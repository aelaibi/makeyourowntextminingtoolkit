               Liverpool       and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

               My specific        role was        to be a me m b e r    of Serial       Number     16 under       the

               direct      s u p e r v i s i o n of Police Sergeant         1288 PAYNE.         A lso    in the serial

               Our      task that da y was         that prior       to the start of play we w o u l d

To achieve        this we w o u l d station our s e l v e s           immediately ouside              the

Our b r i efing was       supp l e m e n t e d by Inspector           PURDY who was          the officer

in charge of our serial,              and later by Inspector                   SYKES.

As    instructed we w ere         in p o s i t i o n    for w h e n   the turnstiles          opened

shortly after        12 noon.        V i r t u a l l y straight away s u pporters wer e at

the ground and star t e d entering.

At    that    time the flow of persons                 into the ground was             light and

steady,       as did the other officers                 of my serial          I was able      to search            |

p r a c t i c a l l y every o n e entering     the ground offered t h emselves                   to be             j

searched and w ere good h u m o u r e d about                 it.     The weat h e r was        fine and           |

Very    little p r o p e r t y was taken from those entering.       I am sure of a                  j

That was not a cause          for concern though as I could see another                           serial      |

ground.     In fact for       the first couple of hours,                  a l t h o u g h we w e r e          j

busy,    every t h i n g w ent s m o othly and there wer e no real problems,                                 J

a l t h o u g h I was aware of several         pe o p l e coining to the one t u rnstile I                    '

was    covering,   w i t h tickets     for the N o t t i n g h a m Forest         end of the ground.)

However    the s i t u a t i o n changed s h o r t l y be f o r e   2.30 pm w h e n       there was a        j
                                                                                                             I
sudden build up of s p ectators             c o m p l e t e l y filling      the area     in front of        [

our seven turnstiles.            Three or four          times    the crowd surged and

pus h e d forward w h i c h resulted        in me being         trapped wit h m y back to the

wall    to the side of the turnstiles              opening.

Dur i n g the lulls       in these pushes m y p r i o r i t y had changed               from

c h e cking the s pectators        into the ground,          to trying to           ’f u n n e l ’ them

into the    ' t u r n s t i l e s ’ as q u i c k l y as possible.

The d e n s i t y of the crowd around me at this                time was such that I had

difficulty     in seeing what other o f f icers were near                      to me,     despite

being only a few feet away to m y right,                   I could only just see PC 115

HUC K S T E P P who was    stood at t u r nstile gates A and B.

I could see no other          officers of m y serial            a l t hough to m y left           I

could see Inspector          PURDY.      He was stood on top of a railing at the

end of the t urnstiles near            to the     large gate        ’C ’ .    He was      s h o uting at

the crowds     trying      to encourage      them to stop pushing,                a l t h o u g h he also

called over     to us to see that we w e r e alright.

A m o u n t e d officer    also came close        in,    in front of me and a t t e m p t e d to

stop the crowd from push i n g but he was                 f r u s t r a t i n g l y ineffe c t i v e as

the crowd were       tightly packed around the horse and seemed                           to have no

fear of the a n i m a l .

At no time did       the crush on the t u rnstiles               relax d e s p i t e     the efforts
                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                  R338

of the o f f icers       I could see,        it be c a m e w o r s e and a coupie or times                  I

was pressed          tightly back against        the wall w ith people so close around

me   that I was v i r t u a l l y unable       to m o v e and put       in a p o s i t i o n w h e r e      I

was c o n cerned for m y own safety.

At   this   time we w e r e serving no p u r p o s e at all,             any efforts should

have been d i r e c t e d at the rear of the crowd w h e r e the p u s h i n g started.

E v e n t u a l l y I was again able       to see Inspector         PURDY who called for us

to   ' e s c a p e ’ from the crowd by going           through the turnstiles                 ourselves.

That m e s s a g e   I p a s s e d onto PC 115 H U C K S T E P P after w h i c h      I went

through t u rnstile A or B and we met again                    inside        the ground.

I m m e d i a t e l y I wen t back out via the         large gate       ’C     to w h e r e    Inspector

PURDY was up on the railing still                   trying    to control        the crowd.            There

was also large numbers of s p ectators                  c l i mbing on top of         the

turnstiles and onto            the wall     above gate       ’B ’

At   that mo m e n t a young boy of about              11 years and p r a c t i c a l l y

un c o n s c i o u s was pa s s e d over   the heads of the tightly p a c k e d crowd                    in

front of     the turnstiles.           He was pas s e d      towards         gate ’C ’w h e r e I took

hol d of h i m and carried h i m into            the ground via              gate 'C' and to          the

'Portacabin'         w h i c h had been set up as a p r o p e r t y store            in that area.

The boy who was h o l d i n g an           'inhaler'    was very pale and short of

breath.     Inside     the P o r t a c a b i n wer e other officers           including I believe

Inspector W H I T E and I left the boy               in their care.

A g a i n I went back out of the gr o u n d via gate                'C’.      The m o o d of      the

crowd had o b v i o u s l y changed and was b e c o m i n g quite host i l e as they

str u g g l e d to get    into   the ground.        One fan who was not              in the crush

but the ohter         side of the railing,          d r o p p e d his   ticket w h i c h went

under    the feet of the crowd.              W h e n he reached under           the railing to

try and retrieve          the ticket,       other    fans thought he was             trying      to

'jump the q u e u e ’ and a c t u a l l y k i c k e d him.

It was      impossible      to stop the crowd p u s h i n g from the               front near the

t urnstiles as the push i n g o b v i o u s l y started from w^'f'f back.                         T h erefore

in an attempt          to relieve         that rush on the turnstiles                I went    further

back    in the crowd          to w here     there are a set of wrou g h t             iron gates

w h i c h separate       the s t a d i u m from Leppings         Lane.

These wer e open but,              as did a couple of other officers we closed                           the

three pairs of gates                to prevent any further           pushing on the turnstiles.

The d i f f i c u l t y w i t h   those gates       though was      that a l t h o u g h the right

hand of the pair had a bolt w h i c h went dow n to the ground,                               the    left

side could only be closed and held closed using physical                                   strength,

w h i c h I did.

By now it was b e t w e e n 2.50 pm and                2.55 pm and elements of the crowd

wer e b e c oming q uite hostile and d e s p e r a t e             to get    into the ground.               I

was s u b jected to quite a lot of verbal                     abuse from people d e m a n d i n g           to

be let      into the gr o u n d          and others     a c c u s i n g me of causing people           to be

crushed up against                the    gates    I was h o l d i n g closed.

It was      impossible        to reason wit h         the m a j o r i t y of the crowd who could

not see what was h a p p e n i n g           in front.       A couple of times            I was      told of

w o m e n and c h i l d r e n b eing crushed up against               the gates and so wherever

possible       I allo w e d       them to filter        through.

About     three     times     the weight of the crowd on the gates was mor e                             than

I could hold and             large       numbers w o u l d surge through be f o r e we              could

fight the gates            closed        again.     The m o o d of the crowd was            one of

desperation         to get        into the ground before           the game started.                I tried

to assure people            that the start w o u l d be delayed,                 something      I

g e n u i n e l y believed,        but a c h ieved     little success.

E v e n t u a l l y the crowd at the turnstiles d w i n d l e d and I saw that                        the

other pairs of w r o u g h t             iron gates had been opened.                Obviously        the

c rowd push i n g against               the gates    I was h o l d i n g could see this and so I

had to let people start flowing                      through my gate,           a l t h o u g h I only

opened one half and tried to slow dow n their                            entry.
It was a m i n u t e     or so after     the crowd had passed through or around

the turnstiles         into the ground and w h e r e                  I was stand i n g was clear,

that I heard the first            ’t a n n o y ’ a n n o u n c e m e n t asking     the Liverpool

fans not     to push against         the gates,          at that time I did not k now what

gates were being r e f erred to.

All    the officers       outside    the gr o u n d      including my s e l f        then went        into

the sterile area          to the rear of the W est Stand.                        I was not     in

p o s s e s s i o n of a radio but shortly after                 that I u n d e r s t a n d   there was a

radio m e s s a g e as    there was     some m e n t i o n of the pitch and officers

b egan running ar o u n d the West Stand                 towards         the police control           box.

I ran wit h them around the polioce control                             end   into the South Stand

from w h i c h I was      able   to gain access            to the pitch.           As    I went around

I could see      large numbers of spec t a t o r s on the pitch                      in wha t appeared

to be a s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d pitch    ’i n v a s i o n ’ .     The m a i n crowds of people

a p p eared to be coming from behind                 the goal           out of the W e s t    Stand

terraces and so          I headed that way.

As    I neared   the p e r imeter     fence       I could see the faces                 and upper bodies

of people crushed against              the fence on the South side of the goalmouth.

I could see police officers              at gate         '3'    f r a n t ically trying       to pull

people    through the gate onto               the p e rimeter           track of the pitch.

I went    to assist       and saw that the people                 just        inside the gates were

trapped up to just above             the waist.            Officers had hold of them and

were    trying to release         them but couldn't because of the wei g h t of

people p r e ssing on them f rom further up the terraces.

I therefore c l i m b e d up the        left side of the open gates                      in an effort

to pull people up as the gates were only wide enough for a couple of

officers     to reach      through side by side.                  However       even though         I was

able to grab the hands of a number                     of people          it was    i m possible      to

release    them.

In order     that    I could use both hands                to grab people           I 'bridged’
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        R338

my s e l f across    the open gate w a y half w a y up.                In t h a x p o s T t T o r T l       was

able    to help a number          of people out of the terraces                   and across            onto

the perimeter        track.

In that p o s i t i o n    I was above        the crowd pressed up against                   the fences

and    it was    then     I saw about five           feet back from the fence and                   just

off to the right of the gate.                    The head and        upper body of a m a n                  of

about    20 years,        clean shaven,        wearing       I believe a       dark c o l oured             top,

my att e n t i o n was d r a w n to him beca u s e he was b adly d i s c l o u r e d and

lifeless,       o b v i o u s l y dead or d ying and only being s u p p o r t e d by the

p eople crushed around him.

That was my first           r e a l i s a t i o n that    this was a major disaster.                    I

shouted at the people around the m a n to pass hi m too me but                                  they

ob v i o u s l y c o u l d n ’t release hi m as they were still                b eing pushed

forward by the mass            of people further bac k up the terraces.

I shouted at the people              to move back and pointed at the tunnel

yelling at them to leave that                   ’centre      south' e n closure        but no-one

seemed to mov e and          I was     just shouted          down.

It event u a l l y b e c a m e apparent        that       there were    large numbers           of people

trapped and crus h e d against              the fencing and this body of people

stretched back several              feet.      The       few we were able       to h elp out of the

terraces onto        the perimeter          track were having           little effect on the

overall    numbers who ne e d e d help and so my s e l f and other officers

deci d e d we had       to enter     the terraces           and pull people back            from the

fences.

To do this       it was n e c e s s a r y   to climb over        the top of the d epth of

fans,   this we did and started pull i n g bodies back from the crush,

m a n y of them lifeless.

Initially we w o u l d       just pull bodies ba c k w a r d s          to relieve         the pressure

on the fence,        but as mor e and mor e officers                 entered      the Centre South

enclosure we were able              to start c o n c e n t r a t i n g on inviduals.

                                                                                                              R338

T ogether wit h one officer                   I a t t e m p t e d m o u t h to mows&fi. r e s u s c i t a t i o n on

one ma n      in his       late 3 0 's,       clean shaven,          brown hair wh i l s t         the other

officer       a t t e m p t e d cardiac massage.               We   then changed over but neither

of us a p p eared          to have any success.

By this       time more and more bodies were being pulled b ack from the

fences onto          the    terraces and there was                  little room for r e s u s c i t a t i o n

and so together w i t h other officers                         I carried the first ma n out of

the terraces,             via    the tunnel under           the stand to the ster i l e area

w here his body wa s               left with a couple of officers.

I returned         to the terraces w h e r e r e s u s c i t a t i o n was a t t e m p t e d on

another ma n who            I have       little m e m o r y of,       he was      then c a r r i e d to gate

’3 ’ end passed onto                the perimeter         track.

Several      others w ere picked up by groups                        of    police and spec t a t o r s         and

we carried         them either           to gate      ’3 ’ or to w here          the fence had been

br o k e n down near            to the centre of the goals.

I have      little r e c o l l e c t i o n of the vast m a j o r i t y of most                  of these

people as the n e c e s s i t y was              to get     them out of that en c l o s u r e as

q u i c k l y as p o s s i b l e    to where      they could p r o perly be seen too.

D uring this        time        I was    aware    that    there was still            large numbers            of

supporters        stood around            in that enclosure,               doing n o t h i n g but      their

very presence h i n d e r i n g the people trying                         to help the injured.

I tried to m o v e some of these away and told them to leave                                       the terraces

but was shoc k e d by the hostile                    r e a ction     I received from some,               and

amazed that some a c t u a l l y still b e l i e v e d                the game w o u l d c o n t i n u e and

wer e adamant         that       they w o u l d n ’t move.

E v e n t u a l l y all    the     injured were m o v e d out of that enc l o s u r e and away,

I remained        in the area.             A couple of times              I heard      the roar       of the

crowd from the Spion Kop and thought                           there       was going      to   be trouble

but   I did not bec o m e             involved     in that.

W he n the m a t c h was           finally a b a n d o n e d    I s u p e r v i s e d the d e p a r t u r e   of
                                                                                                   PAGE

                fans   from the Wes t Stand out of the ground after wfericn we were
    *   -   *


                debriefed.

                Finally   it w o u l d appear    to me   that   the cause of the probl e m s was     the

                vast numbers     of people      trying to enter     the ground   in the   last half

                hour, m a n y of these people had an o v e r p o w e r i n g desire   to get     into the

                g round before the kick off and could not be reasoned with.

                I w ould have    liked to have seen the start of the m a t c h d e l a y e d and

                this ann o u n c e d over   the public address system.        The only

                announcements     I h eard was     the request     for the   "Liverpool   fans   to move

^               back from the fences."

               supervise             turnstile             gates       A to G       i n c l u s i v e at      the L e p p i n g s      Lane       en d

               of    the       ground.              During       the    actual       p la y we        would        supervise          the    c r o wd

               within          the      elevated           section        of the         West    Stand.            And    pri o r     to    the    end

               of    the       game      we     were       to    take     up a      position          outside        the     ga t e s,      in

              Leppings             Lane        to    supervise          the    exit       of    the     c r ow d    from      the     stadium.

               Once       at      the     ground a briefing                   for    all       officers        took       place       shortly

               before          10.00 am             in the N o r t h S t a n d .           After        the    general          briefing,          my

               serial          was      briefed         by PS P A Y N E        on    our       specific        duties,          only       he a n d

one    other         officer          in the       serial          PC    YATES were             in    possession             of a

personal         radio.

Our    instructions               were       to    be    in    position           on    the      turnstiles             by    1 1 . 1 5 am

as    the    gates         would       be    open       from       12 n o o n     onwards.

As    a preventative                  measure        we w e r e         to    peform      searches           of    incoming

spectators            for       weapons       or a l c o h o l i c           drinks.         Prevent         persons          under

the    influence            of    alcohol          from       entering          the     ground and            control             the

behaviour            of    those       entering          the       ground.

To    achieve         this       we w o u l d      station          ourselves           immediately               ouside          the

turnstiles            taking          advantage          of    the       restriction             they       caused       to       the    flow

of    persons         into       the     ground.

Our    briefing            was    supplemented                by    Inspector           PURDY         who    was    the       officer

in    charge         of    our    serial,,         and    later          by    Inspector             SYKES.

As    i n s t r u c t e d we      were       in p o s i t i o n         for    when     the      turnstiles             opened

shortly        after        12 noon.              Virtually             straight        away         supporters          w e r e at

the    ground and               started       entering.

At    that     t im e      the    flow       of    persons          into       the     ground         was    light       and

steady,-as            did       the    other       officers             of my     serial         I was       able       to    search

the m a j o r i t y        of    persons          entering          the       ground.

Any    in p o s s e s s i o n         of m e t a l      cans w e r e          asked     to      leave       them    in the          waste

bins     outside           the    turnstiles.                 Everyone          who     was      asked       did    so a n d

practically               everyone          entering          the       ground       offered          thernse 1 ves          to    be

searched and were                     good    humoured about                   it.      The      weather          was    fi n e     and

quite       warm,         most    people          were    without             coats     making         the    searching             easier

Very     little           p roperty was            taken       from          those     entering.             I am       sure       of a

small       penknife            being       seised and a young                    couple a t t e m p t i n g            to    en t e r

the    ground         with       two     l a rge     cans      of       lager.

The    unfortunate               consequences             however             were     t h at    whenever          an    officer

either       seized         an    item       of    property             or a r r e s t e d      soineone,         then       they

would       h av e    to    leave        their       p osts        on the       turnstiles             and    the       remaining

officers           would          have       to    co ver all            seven        turnstiles             as      best     possible.

That    was        not       a    cause       for     concern            t h o u g h as         I could         see    another             se r i a l

of    officers           inside             the    turnstiles               also      checking             persons          into      the

ground.            In f a c t          for    the     first           couple         of    ho u rs ,       although          we w e r e

busy,        everything                went       smoothly            and     there        were       no    real      problems,

although           I was          aware       of    several            people         coming          to    the      one     turnstile               I

was    covering,                 with       tickets        for        the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t            e nd    of     the     g ro u n d .

However           the    situation                changed         shortly            before        2.30        pm w h e n     there         was          a

sudden           build       up of          spectators            completely               filling          the a r e a       in f r o n t           of

our    seven           turnstiles.                 Three         or    f o ur     times         the      crowd       surged and

pushed           forward          which        resulted           in me         being         trapped w i t h my              back         to    the

wall        to    the    side          of    the     turnstiles               opening.

During           the    lulls          in t h e s e        pushes        my     priority            had     changed          from

checking           the       spectators              into        the     ground,           to      trying       to    ’f u n n e l ’ t h e m

into        the    ’t u r n s t i l e s ’ as          q u i c k l y as          possible.

The    density           of       the       c r o w d a r o u n d m e at             t h is     time was          such       t h at    I had

difficulty              in s e e i n g        what         other       officers            were       near      to me,        despite

being        only a few                feet       away      to my        right,           I could          only      just     see PC            115

HUCKSTEPP              who       was    s t o o d at        turnstile             gates         A a n d 6.

I could           see    no       other        officers           of m y        serial          although          to m y       left        I

could        see       Inspector             PURDY.          He w a s         stood        on      top     of a      railing          at       the

end     of       the    turnstiles                n ea r    to    the       large         g at e    'C ’ »      He    wa s     shouting              at

the     c r ow d s      trying          to     encourage              them      to    stop         pushing,          although          he a l s o

called           over    to       us    to     see     that       we     were        alright.

A mounted              officer          also       came      c l os e       in,      in f r o n t        of me a n d a t t e m p t e d               to

stop        the    crowd          from       pushing         but        he wa s        frust ratingly                ineffective                as

t he    crowd were                tightly          packed around                  the      horse         and    seemed         to     have       no

fear        of    the    animal.

At     no    time       did       the       crush      on the           turnstiles              rel a x      despite         the      efforts

of     the       officers          I could           see,        it b e c a m e       worse         and a        couple        of     times          I

was     pressed           tightly           b a ck    against              the w a l l        with      people         so    close         around

me    that       I was       virtually               unable           to m o v e        and     put     in a       position where                 I

was     concerned            for       my    ow n     s a fety.

At    this       t i me    we     were       serving             no    purpose           at    a l l , any         efforts       should

Eventually            I was           again able             to       see     Inspector           PURDY         wh o     called        for       us

to    ’e s c a p e ’ f r o m          the    crowd          by g o i n g         through         the        turnstiles          ourselves.

That       message         I passed            onto         PC    113 H U C K S T E P P          after         which        I went

through          turnstile             A or B a n d we                 met       again        inside         the     ground.

Immediately               I went        back         out     via       the       large        g a te    "C*     to w h e r e     Inspector

was     also      large          numbers         of       spectators               climbing            on    to p of     the

hold       of    him and          carried            hi m    into          the     ground        via         g a t e * C ? a n d to    the

’P o r t a c a b i n ’ w h i c h        had      been        set       up as        a    property            store       in t h a t a r ea.

The     bo y w h o        was     holding            an     ’i n h a l e r ’ was          very         pale a n d        short        of

breath.          Inside          the    Portacabin                were       other        officers             including         I believe

Inspector           WHITE         and       I left          the       boy     in t h e i r       care.

Again       I went         back        out     of     the        ground          vi a    gate      *C*.         Th e     mood    of        the

crowd       had     obviously               changed and was                      becoming          quite        hostile         as     they

struggled           to     get        into     the        ground.            One        fan who         wa s    not      in the        crush

but     the      ohter       side       of     the        r ai l i n g ,      dropped           his     tic k e t      which     went

under       the     feet         of    the     crowd.             When        he    reached            under       the      railing         to

try and          retrieve             the    t ic k e t ,        other        fans       thought            he w a s     trying        to

’j u m p    the     q u e u e ’ and actually                      kicked           him.

It wa s         impossible             to    stop         the     crowd          pushing         from        the     front      near        the

turnstiles            as     the       pushing            obviously              started         f r o m well          back.          Therefore
in a n a t t e m p t          to    relieve             that          rush     on    the     turnstiles             I went          further

back     in the          crowd          to w h e r e         there       ar e       a set       of w r o u g h t        i ro n    gates

which        separate          the       stadium             from Leppings                 Lane .

These        were       open       but,       as       di d a         couple        of    other        officers          we      closed         the

three        p a i rs    of    gates          to       prevent          any     further           pushing          on    the      turnstiles.

The    difficulty              with          those          gates       t hough was             that a l t h o u g h          the       right

hand    of      the      pair       had a          bolt          which went              down     to    the       ground,         the      left

side     could          only       be    closed and                   held     closed        using          physical          strength,

which        1 did.

By    no w    it wa s         between 2.50                   pm a n d        2.55        pm a n d      elements          of      the      crowd

were    becoming              quite          hostile             and    desperate            to     get      into       the      ground.             I

was    subjected              to    quite          a    lot       of    verbal           abuse      from       people         demanding              to

be    let     into       the       ground and                others          accusing             me    of     causingpeople                  to     be

crushed         up a g a i n s t         the       gates          I     wa s    h o l d i n g closed.

It wa s       impossible                to    reason with                the        majority           of    the    crowd who              could

not    see w h a t        was       happening                in fr o n t.            A    couple        of     times       I w as         told       of

women and           children             being          crushed          up a g a i n s t         the       gates       and      so w h e r e v e r

possible           I allowed             them          to    filter          through.

About        three       times          the    weight             of    the     crowd        on     the      gates       wa s     more        than

I could         hold and            large          numbers              would        surge through                 before         we c o u l d

fight        the    gates          closed again.                        The     mood        of the          c r o w d w a s one of

desperation              to get          into          the       ground        before        the       game       started.              I tried

to a s s u r e      people          t ha t     the          start       would        be    delayed,            something            I

genuinely           believed,                but       achieved          little           success.

Eventually              the    c r o w d at            the       turnstiles              dwindled           and    I saw         t h at    the

other        p airs      of w r o u g h t          iron g a t e s            had     been       opened.            Obviously              the

crowd        pushing          against          the          gates       I w as       holding           could       see     this         and     so       I

had    to     let       people          start          flowing          through my              gate,        although            I only

opened        one       half       and       tried          to    slow       down        their      entry.

It wa s a m i n u t e              or    so a f t e r            the    crowd        had     passed           through         or a r o u n d

the    turnstiles              into       the       ground and where                  I was         standing            wa s    clear,

that     1' h e a r d      the      first       'tannoy'          announcement                 asking         the L i v e r p o o l

fans     not       to    push a g a i n s t          the    g at e s ,     at       that      time       I di d     not        know what

gates      were         being       referred          to.

All    the     officers             outside          the    ground         including              myself        then went             into

the    sterile           area       to    the       rear    of    the      West       Stand.             I was      not        in

possession              of a       radio       but    shortly          after         t h at    I understand                  there     wa s      a

radio m e s s a g e           as    there       was     some m e n t i o n           of    the      pitch and            officers

began      running            around       the       West       Stand      towards            the    police         control           box.

I    ran w i t h        them       around       the     polioce           control          en d     into      the       South        Stand

from which              I was       able       to    gain access               to    the      pitch.          As    I went           around

I could        see       large          numbers       of    spectators               on the         pitch.in what                   appeared

to    be a s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d            pitch       'invasion5.                Th e     main      crowds           of    people

appeared           to    be    coming          from     behind         the      goal       out      of    the      West        Stand

terraces           and    so       I headed          that       way.

As    I neared           the       perimeter          fence       I could            see      the    faces         and       upper     bodies

of    pe o p l e    crushed against                   the       fence      on       the    South         side      of    the        goalmouth

I could        see       police          officers          at    g a te    '3'       frantically              trying           to    pull

people        through          the       gate       onto    the       perimeter            track         of   the       pitch.

I went        to a s s i s t        and    saw       that       the    people         j u st      inside        the      gates        were

trapped        up       to j u s t       above       the w a i s t .           Officers           ha d    hold      of       them and

were     trying          to    release          them       but    couldn't            because            of   the w e i g h t         of

people        pressing             on    them       from    further            up the         terraces.

I therefore              climbed          up the        left      side         of    the      open       gates      in a n          effort

to    pull     people          up as       the       gates       were      only wide              enough        for      a     couple       of

officers           to    reach          through       side       by    side.          However            even      though           I was

able     to    grab        the      hands       of a n u m b e r          of    people         it w a s       impossible              to

release        them.

In o r d e r       that       I could          use    both       hands         to g r a b      people         I 'bridged'

myself        across          the       open    gateway          h al f    way       up.       In that          position             I was
                                                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                                                          R338

able        to       help a         number           of    people         out    of     the      terraces           and across            onto

the       perimeter                tr a c k .

In t h a t           position            I wa s       above         the     crowd       pressed         up a g a i n s t        the      fences

and       it w a s          then       I sa w a b o u t          five       feet      back       from       the     fence       and      just

off      to        the      r ig h t     of t h e         gate. Th e        head and          upper           b o d y of a m a n              of

about         20 years,                clean         shaven,           wearing I believe                    a dark coloured                   top,

my attention                     was     drawn        to     hi m     because         he    was       badly       discloured and

lifeless,                  obviously            dead       or    dying       and      only       being       supported             by the

people             crushed          around           him.

That        was       my        first       realisation               that      this       was    a major           disaster.             I

s h o u t e d at            the     people           around         the m a n      to      pass h i m        too me          but    they

obviously                  couldn't          release            hi m as      they were            s t ill     being          pushed

forward              by the         mass        of    pe o p l e      further         back       up    the    terraces.

I shouted                  at    the     people           to m o v e      back     and      pointed          at     the      tunnel

seemed             to m o v e       and      I was         just        s h o u t e d down.

It e v e n t u a l l y             became        apparent             that      there       were       large        numbers         of    pe o pl e

trapped and                     crushed         against          the      fencing          and    this       body       of    people

stretched                  back     several           feet.           The    fe w we        were      able        to    help       out    of       the

terraces              on t o       the      perimeter            track       were       having         little          effect       on    the

overall              numbers           who      needed          help and         so m y s e l f        and    other          officers

decided              we     ha d    to      enter         the    terraces          and      pull       pe o p l e      back     from      the

• f e n c e s .




To     do         t hi s    it was          necessary            to    climb       over       the      top    of       the    depth       of

fans,         this          we     did and           started          pulling         bodies          back    from        the      crush,

many        of       them        lifeless.

Initially                  we    would       just         pull      bodies       backwards             to    relieve          the     pressure

on     the         fence,          but      as m o r e      and more            officers          entered           the      Centre       South

enclosure                  we    were       able      to     start        concentrating                on    inviduals.

Together              with         one      officer          I attempted              mouth       to m o u t h         resuscitation                on

one    man     in his         late       3 Q's,         clean       shaven,             brown          hair       whilst       the        other

officer        attempted            cardiac             massage.              We    then          changed          over       but     neither

of    us a p p e a r e d      to    have       any       success.

By    this     time         more    and more             bodies          were       being          pulled          back       from        the

fences        onto      the    terraces             and       there       was       little             room       for    resuscitation

and    so t o g e t h e r      with       other          officers             I carried                the    first       man        out       of

the    terraces,             via    the     tunnel            under       the       stand          to    the       sterile           area

where       his    body       was       left w i t h a             couple          of    officers.

I returned             to    the    terraces             where          resuscitation                   was       attempted           on

another        man      who    I have          little m e m o r y              of,       he was          then       carried           to       gate
       a
’3 ’ s th d    passed         onto       the    perimeter                track.

Several        others         were       picked          up by g r o u p s              of    police          and       spectators               and

we    carried          them    either          to       gate       '3'    or       to w h e r e         the       fence       ha d    been

broken        down      near       to    the    centre             of    the       goals.

I have        little         recollection                of    the       vast       majority             of m o s t       of     these

people        as   the       necessity          was       to       get    them          out       of    that       enclosure              as

q u i c k l y as       possible          to w h e r e         they       could          properly             be    seen       too.

During        this      time       I wa s      aware          that       there          was       still       larg e      numbers              of

supporters             stood       around       in that             enclosure,                doing          nothing          but     their

very       presence          hindering          the       people          trying             to    help       the       injured.

I tried        to m o v e      some       of    these          away       and       told          them       to    leave       the        terrace

but    wa s    shocked         by the          hostile             reaction             I received                from    some,           an d

amazed        t ha t    some       actually             s till      believed             the       game       would       continue               and

were       adamant          that    they wouldn't                   m o ve.

Eventually             all    the       injured          were       moved          out       of    that       enclosure              a n d a w ay,

I remained             in the       are a .         A    couple          of    times          I heard             the    roar        of    the

crowd       from       the S p i o n H o p a n d              thought          there          was       going       to    be     trouble

but     I d id     not       become       involved             in that.

When       the m a t c h      was       finally abandoned                      I supervised                   the       departure              of

fans       from    the W e s t          Stand       out       of    the       ground          after          which       we    w er e

           Finally      it w o u l d      appear    to me      t ha t    the    cause       of    the   problems        was    the

           vast    numbers       of    people      trying      to   enter       the       ground    in the       last     half

           hour,    many    of      these    people     had an          overpowering             desire    to    get    into        the

           ground     before        the    kick    off a n d    could      not       be    reasoned       wit h .

           back    from    the      fences."

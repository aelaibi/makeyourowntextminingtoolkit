            D ear E ric,


            Roy Whitehead made an approach to me asking what drawings we had
            relating to Sheffield Wednesday.

            We have now made a check through all our m icrofilm s of drawings
            and the enclosed is a complete list.

            I believe Mr. Whitehead sought a general ground plan, but if one
            e x ists, we were never commissioned to draw it. We have of course
            plans relating to sections of the ground e .g . north stand, but whenever
                          referred to an overall layout I believe it was a special
            plan related to rating purposes.

        I enclose a list of drawings which are likely to
give the inforsat ion we need concerning the North Stand,
the West Stand and the North West Terrace and Stand.        I as
sending a copy direct to Mr Whitehead so that he can aake
his enquiries of Mr English.
        Since Friday I have given soae thought to the overall
situation and I think that you should proceed a step at a
time so as to reduce any unnecessary expenditure to a alniaua.
        I aa confident that In considering the granting of a
Certificate the Local Authority 1s unlikely to raise any
difficulties with regard to the North Stand and the West Stand.
You aay be vulnerable so far as spion cop is concerned since
there may be a significant reduction in the nuaber of
spectators permitted, unless there is an Increase in the
nuaber of    barriers or possibly soae strengthening. The
South 8tand aay also be questioned with regard to its fire
resistance and the consequent need for speedier evacuation of
spectators.
        As a first step, I suggest you coaalsslon an outline
survey of the standing accooaodation plus the South Stand,
which should only be taken sufficiently far as to give you an
idea of the possible loss of spectator capacity if no remedial
work is carried out, and also to give you an idea of the
possible cost of reaedlal work if the present capacity is to
be aaintained.
      Should you decide that It la appropriate to commission a
first stage survey and report on these lines, I would suggest
that an expenditure H a l t of say £500 should be iaposed on :
whoever you eaploy to carry out the work.
      I       am sure that if there is any Aspect of the matter
which you would like to discuss you will not hesitate to give
me a ring.
      Yours sinctorely,

Dear Hr. Whlthead,
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
     X have pleasure in returning the prints of drawings
obtained froa Husbands.   Even though one or two are still
aissing, the great aajorlty of the inforaation ve would
need in an application for a Certificate is contained in
the ones we already have.   We should need to have enlarge-
aents aade but this presents no difficulty.
     It would of course still be necessary to survey the
South stand and Spion Cop before an application could be
subaitted. However, as we agreed last week, in the first
instance you need only coaait yourselves to a liaited
aaount of expenditure aay not exceeding £500 in order to
get sufficiently far to see whether you have any aajor
probleas, and what the effect would be on your capacity if
any reaedial work were carried out.


                                      Tours sincerely,

     Dear Sirs,
                                           Certificate of Safety - Interim Report
                      We have now progressed sufficiently far with our
     survey and assessment to be able to submit an interim report
     covering the probable ground capacity and the likely costs of
     improvements which will be required by the certifying authority.
            The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
     culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
     will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
^    guide.                 Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of
     the fire officer and the police.


     Standing Accommodation
     (a)             Spion Kop
                            The general layout of Spion Kop is good.                                       It
                     has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
                     well below the maximum laid down in the guide.   The
                     slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements for
                     good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                            The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                     of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
                     permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of

          the exits.
                 Where the barriers are adequate in strength
         and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                   2
         of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m of plan
         area.   Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                   2
         Kop is approximately 3120m which would provide
         accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
          standards.   Category A must be able to withstand a
          test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
         and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
         In 1973 you had tests made on all the barriers by
         Toft and Brocklebank Ltd.    Of the 101 barriers on
          Spion Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb
         and a further 15 carried the load but had some actual
         or incipient defect which needed attention.   Most of
         those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
         would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
         On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of
         a long barrier which was weak.   The general situation was
         satisfactory compared with most grounds.
                Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
         barriers up to a uniform category A standard.   It
         should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
         the tests and there will have been some deterioration
         due to rusting.   Host of the barriers are made from
         2§" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
         inches when new.   Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield's
         atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
         to more rusting than others and we must expect some
         increase in the number needing attention.
                Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m,the
         maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
         guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m
                                                                     SH££T   3.

          for slopes of 30°.      These figures apply to 'peak
          viewing* areas.   Spion Kop has an average slope
          of about 17° for which the recommended spacing is
          3.6m.
                    In calculating spectator capacity each barrier
          is assumed to cater for an area of ground immediately
          behind it which is either 3.6m wide or up to the
          next barrier, whichever is the smaller.   We have
          surveyed the Kop, and our drawing 1610/1 attached
          shows the proportion of the Kop which will be
          admissible in the spectator calculation if all the
          barriers are brought up to category A standard.    It
          will be immediately apparent that the great majority
          of the available area will qualify.   Our calculation
          shows that the permitted number of spectators should
          be about 13,900 i.e. the number of places 'lost' will
          be almost 3,000.
                 If you wish to retain mb«t:*of. these extra places
          (aiming for a ground capacity of at least 50,000
          say) then new barriers could be constructed at positions
          shown by the red lines on the second copy of drawing
          1610/1.      The capacity would then be 16,000.
                    In proposing the extra barriers we are mindful
          that in some cases they will possibly hinder the
          close packing of spectators.    Clearly, there is no
          point in spending money in order to achieve a large
          permitted.ground capacity, if 'that-numberrcannot
          then be packed in.   However, we think that even with
          an uneven distribution of spectators it will still be
          possible to accommodate 16,000 spectators.
                 You may wish to consider whether the cost of
          these extra barriers will be justified by the additional
          income they might generate over the years.   It Is

                                                                  SHEET

          likely that new barriers, which will require fairly
          massive foundation and anchor blocks will cost between
          £50 and £60 per metre run.   Thus the extra 235 metres
          of barrier will cost about £5.00 per extra standing
          place.
                 Spion Kop is not ideally catered for by exits.
         A very adequate gangway system feeds to only three
          exit points.   The total width of these three exits
          at their narrowest points is 12.5m. The guide assumes
          a maximum flow rate through these exits of 60 persons
          per minute for each 550mm of width.   Thus the
          theoretical time to discharge 16,000 spectators from
          Spion Kop would be 11$ minutes, compared with a maximum
          of 8 minutes indicated by the guide.
                 The exits at each end of the terrace are reasonably
          free from hazards, except the one at-the North end passes
          under a bridge with a headroom well below the recommended
          value of 8ft.   This defect could be removed by lowering
          the floor level, but I would argue strongly that it is
          far from essential to have such a large headroom, and
          the cost of modification is not justified in an existing
          structure.
                 The exit at the back of Spion Kop is likely to
         raise most difficulty.   The ramp is steep and it has
         an appreciable cross-fall at the top where there is also
         a change of direction.   At one*side is a vertical drop,
         which has guard rails which appear to be reasonably
         strong, but this can only be established by testing.
         We shall need some indulgence by the licensing authority
         if no works are to be requested.   Hy feeling is that
         continuous handrails will be required, splitting the
         ramp into say three separate lanes.
                There may be considerable pressure to increase
                                                                   SHEET   5.


EASTWOOD fir PARTNERS




          the total exit capacity.   We can argue that the
          eight minutes allowed for complete evacuation is only
          really valid for stands where there might be a risk
          due to fire, or explosion, or structural failure.   in
          the case of terracing it is only the impatience of
          spectators which might create danger.   For an interim
          period, at least, this should be acceptable.
                 Any changes or additions to the exit arrangements
          should take account of a possible future decision to roof
          over Spion Kop.   It would be possible to incorporate in
          such a scheme a 'squaring off* at the top which could
          increase the area available for spectators.   However,
          this would probably mean that additional entrances would
          be needed, possibly by tunnelling through the bank at
          lower level.    This would certainly make it easier to
          pack the crowd more uniformly.    However, this is a
          matter for the future and is unlikely to be part of the
          present exercise.

  (b)     The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
                 The west terrace is not quite so well endowed with
          barriers as Spion Kop.   The present layout is shown on the
          attached drawing 1610/2.   Our measurements show a total
          area of 1480m   but there are no gangways.   We feel that
          some allowance should be made for circulation space as
          spectators have to move quite considerable horizontal
          distances to achieve good packing.   The full area would
          justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
          probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
          of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.   The
          barriers should be designed to match this figure approximately.
                 The shaded area on drawing 1610/2 is that which
          may be counted if the existing barriers are of class A.
          About 15 of the existing barriers are likely to need
                                                                 SHEET   6.


EASTWOOD €r PARTNERS




          strengthening to achieve this .standard.   Even with
          this strengthening only 4,300 spectators could be
          accommodated, representing -a loss of nearly half-
          We presume this would be unacceptable.
                 The extra barriers required to achieve
          approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
          second copy of drawing 1610/2.   You may feel that
          some of the proposed new barriers which are close
          to the entrances might restrict the passage of
          spectators undesirably.    In that case they could
          be omitted.
                 The three exits have a total width of about
          11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
          to leave the ground.   Thus the stand could empty
          in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                 The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
          should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.      There are
          no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
          exit.   But we feel this is of no consequence as
          movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
          and quick.
   (c)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                  This area is also illustrated in the drawing
          1610/2.    The gross area available (there are no gangways)
          is about 565 m2 .  Thus if the crush barriers were
          adequate and the whole area is included the number of
          spectators could be about 3,050.
                 Unfortunately, the crush barriers in this area
          were shown to be very inadequate when tested in 1973.
          Only one was tested and the rail and posts were bending
          at a load of only 270 lb/ft.   Because of this result
          none of the others was subjected to a test lea d.  We



                                    (S
                                                                SHEET


EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




             have examined the drawings of these barriers and
             in addition to the weakness of the rails and posts,
             the holding down arrangements appear to be very
             inadequate and might be treacherous.   A sudden
             failure of a bolt, and they are very highly stressed,
             could lead to a collapse without warning.   These
             barriers need major strengthening as a matter of
             urgency.
                    Assuming that the barriers are strengthened
             it will be seen from the drawing 1610/2 that they
             also need considerable supplementation.   The scheme
             shown on the second copy of this drawing does not
             quite justify the whole area being taken in the
             calculations.   But it would be reasonable to count
             say 2900.   This would bring the total standing at
             the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                    The exits serving this part of the terrace are
             very adequate, but there may be requests for central
             handrailings to be provided.


      Seating Accommodation
      U)     The North Stand
                    The fora of construction of this stand is such
             that it presents a minimum fire hazard.   The exits
             are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy the
             recommendations of the guide.
                    Two matters might cause concern.   The first,
             the fact that the exits are marginally below the
             recommended minimum of 1.1m, is we think of very little
             consequence.   However, the second, the narrow gangways
             which are only about half the recommended minimum may
             cause some difficulty. It would be possible to widen
             the gangways by taking one seat off the end of one of
             the rows meeting at each gangway.   As the gangways
                                                                   SHUT   8.

EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




          are the same in the other stands the total number of
          seats lost would be 1,041.   This is almost unthinkable
          and must be resisted strongly.
                 Fortunately, the timing of spectators leaving
          the ground on 6 January showed that a peak of 80 per
          minute passed through one exit.     This is the figure
          quoted by the guide for a 1.1m gangway.     With 18 exits
          for 10,000 people the average would be 556 per unit.
          Thus the stand would empty in about seven minutes,
          which is within the recommended limit of eight minutes.
                 Our observations on 6 January showed that everyone
          had left this stand, apart from a few people who were
          in no hurry,in about six minutes, although we also counted
          about 40 per exit who left before the final whistle.
          The overall picture appears very satisfactory and
          encourages the hope that this stand will be accepted
          as not needing any significant modification.

   (b)    The West Stand
                 This stand is very similar to the north stand
          in its construction.   We were not able to accurately
          assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
          January because there were many seats which were unsold.
          However, there is every reason to believe that there
          will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
          eight minutes also.   There should be no need for
          significant modifications.

   (c)    The South Stand
                 The structure has been surveyed and appended
          are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
          show the plans and cross-section.    Also attached is
          a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
                 The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
          has 5710 seats.   These are served by 10 exits (excluding



                                   17
                                                                  SHEET   9

          those serving the directors box) so that an average
          of 570 people need to pass through each exit.   The
          count on 6 January shoved an average of just over 70
          per minute passing through one exit which corresponds
          to an emptying time of about eight minutes.    Indeed
          there were very few people still trying to get out six
          minutes after the final whistle.   A few had no doubt
          left early and a few were still standing around, but
          the stand had substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                 Having left the top of the stand the spectators
          have to make their way from the first floor landing via
          one of three staircases.   Two of these are 3.6m wide
          and the other 2.4.   This is equivalent to 17$ 'lanes'
          of 550mm.   At 40 people per lane, 700 people pass per
          minute.   To discharge 5710 people (less those in the
          directors box) will therefore take almost exactly 8
          minutes as permitted by the guide.
                 The fire officers were clearly very interested
          in the first floor.   There is very little 'fire load'
          on this floor - the snack bars and the office/lounge.
          But quite a small fire might fill this area with smoke.
          Ve suspect that there might be a request for it to be compart­
          mentalised by fire doors.
                 At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
          almost straight to the open air,. through a compartment
          which is separated from the main part of the building.
          The third staircase is not so well separated and some
          structural work may be needed.   Apparently the paint
          store is beside this staircase.   This may not be wise.
                 There may well be requests from the fire officer
          for considerable extra precautions and structural
          alterations in this building.
                 The front, open-air part of the south stand is
EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




          well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
          one passage.   This passage has a theoretical capacity
          of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
          This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.   Because
          the stand is open to the air and there is very
          ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
          long emptying time is of any great consequence.


   General Requirements
          It remains to be seen what other general requirements
   will be requested.     The fire officer may request structural
   alterations which we have not mentioned.   Ve must expect
   requests for handrailing dividing staircases into lanes and
   on the ramp from Spion Kop.   There will probably be need for
   a new fire warning system, and the emergency lighting
   standards may not be adequate.   In the first instance we
   think it better to wait for the police and fire service to
   suggest what is required.
          The police wish to have a new police office of a
   significantly better standard than the present one, with a
   separate room for the detention of 'wrong doers*.     It would
   probably be better to ask what they need at an early stage
   and with your permission we will do this.


   Effect on Ground Capacity
          If no new crush barriers were provided but the existing
   ones are all brought up to class A standard the ground capacity
   would become
          Seating approximately                 24,000
          Standing on Spion Kop                 13,900

EASTWOOD €r PARTNERS




          If all the new barriers which we have suggested
   are installed the capacity will become
          Seating approximately             24.000
          Standing Spion Kop                 16.000

                                             50,100

          If it is required to increase this capacity at some
   time in the future Spion Kop could be 'squared o f f at the
   back using a steel framed structure and perhaps a further
   4000 places could be provided.   The Kop could also be
   roofed over, of course.

           This total should not at this stage be taken as
    more than a broad guess. We may have pleasant surprises
    but there could be shocks.  The total does not contain
    any allowance for the local authority's charges in
    connection with the issuing of the licence or for our
    professional fees.


    Future Action
           Subject to your approval we suggest that the next
    steps might be as follows
    1.     We should pass copies of all drawings to the police,
           the fire brigade, the d t y Building Surveyor and the
           County Council.   In addition to drawings showing
           the results of our surveys of the Kop, the Leppings
           Lane terrace and the south stand, we are preparing
           suitable drawings of the north and west stands,
           measuring from the photo-copies of Husbands drawings.

    2.     We should make firm proposals to   the police and the
           fire brigade for the new crush barriers, together
           with our computation of the number of spectators, and
           invite comments including any suggestions of further
           measures which may be needed.
    3.     At the same time we should make detailed drawings and
           specifications for the strengthening work on the
           barriers which are known to be weak, and for the con­
           struction of the new barriers, and obtain tenders.

    4.      We should request a meeting with the police and the
           fire brigade to discuss the stands and to try to agree
           what may need to be done to bring them up to standard.

    5.     We should discuss in detail with the police their
           requirements for a police office, and prepare a detailed
           design.

                                                                           v/

         6.      We should discuss with the police and fire officer
                 what other services such as alarms, communications
                 etc. are needed, prepare an agreed scheme and
                 obtain tenders.


         A Meeting with The Club
                You may feel that another meeting to discuss this
         report and the suggestions for further action, should be
^        held shortly.   Dr. Eastwood will be out of the country
         for three weeks from 22 January so that the week beginning
         15 January would be appropriate.

                                           REPORT ON GROUND CAPACITY

              This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
    which is attainable.
           It dealsin broad terms with the necessary strengthening
    and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
    calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
           Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
    the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
    made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
              The green guide has been used as a basis tot our cal­
    culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
    will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
    guide.   Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
    fire officer and the police.

      Standing Accommodation
      (a)     Spion Kop
                     The general layout of Spion Kop Is good.   It
              has a very adequate number of gangways, with spaclngs
              well below the maximum laid down In the guide.   The
              slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
              for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                     The only questions therefore are the adequacy
              of the crush barriers to justify • high number of
              permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
              the exits.
                       Where the barriers are adequate in strength
              and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                          2
              of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m of plan
              area.   Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                           2
              Kop Is approximately 3120m which would provide
              accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                       Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
              standards.    Category A must be able to withstand a
              test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
              and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
              In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
              and Brocklebank Ltd.   Of the 101 barriers on Spion
              Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
              a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
              incipient defect which needed attention.   Most of
              those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
             would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
             On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
             long barrier which was weak. It should be emphasised
             that the general situation was satisfactory compared
              with most grounds.
                     Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                          /

           barriers up to a uniform category A standard.   It
           should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
           the tests and there may have been some deterioration
           due to rusting.   Most of the barriers are made from
           2f" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
           inches when new.   Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
           atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
           to more rusting than others and it is possible that
           there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                     Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m, the
           maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
           guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m
           for slopes of 30°.   These figures apply to 'peak viewing'
           areas.   Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17°
           for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m.   The slope of the
           upper part     changes to 25° for which the spacing is
           3.1m.
                     Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
           Spion Kop could be considered as not being 'peak
           viewing areas' we are prepared to accede to the police
           view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
           This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
           ground.
                     We propose that the existing barriers should be
           supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
           drawing 1610/1X.   The green shaded area behind each
           barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
                                                            2
           available for spectators.   This area is 29 58m      which
           at 54 persons/10m2 gives a capacity of 15,973.        It
           should be kept in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
           have been admitted to the Kop in the past.

                 Spion Kop has three exits, one near each
            end and one at the top.         The total width of
           these three exits at their narrowest points is 12. 5a.
           The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
           exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
           width.      Thus the theoretical time to discharge
           16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be 11$ minutes,
           compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
           guide.   We do not consider this to be a serious
           matter.   Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very
           desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
           fire, or explosion, or structural failure.   In the
           case of terracing it is only the impatience of spectators
           which might create danger. We believe that for an
            interim period at least the evacuation time of Ilf
           minutes should be acceptable.
                    The exits at each end of the terrace are
           reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
           end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
           recommended value of 8ft.   This defect could be
           removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
           it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
           and the cost of modification is not justified in an
           existing structure.
                  The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
           from handrails dividing it into lanes.   Some remodelling
           of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
           desirable.
    (b)    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North Vest Corner)
                  The west terrace has a total area of 1480m but
           there are no gangways.   We feel that some allowance should

            be made for circulation space as spectators have
            to move     quite considerable horizontal distances
            to achieve good packing.   The full area would
            justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
            probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
            of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
            The barriers should be designed to match this figure
            approximately.      Those barriers which cannot withstand
            6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
            ones provided where necessary.
                   The extra barriers required to achieve
            approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
            attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
                   The three exits have a total width of about
            11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
            to leave the~ground. Thus the terrace could be
            emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                      The guide suggests that eyeryone on a terrace
            should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.     There are
            no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
            exit.   But we feel this is of no consequence as
            movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
            and quick.

     <c)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                      This area is also illustrated in the drawing
           1610/2X.   The gross area available (there are no
           gangways) is about 565 m2 .  Thus if the crush barriers
           were adequate and the whole area is included the number
            of spectators could be about 3,050.
                   Provided the existing crush barriers are
            brought up to standard and supplemented in red as

           shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
           be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
           shown in green.    This area is about 535a2 corresponding
           to about 2900 spectators.   This would bring the total
           standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                  The exits serving this part of the terraces
           are very adequate in width and there will be no
           difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.


    Seating Accommodation
    (a)    The North Stand
                   The form of construction of this stand is
           such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.    The
           exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
           the recommendations of the guide..
                  The exits are very marginally below the
           recommended l*lm width, but we do not consider this
           to be of great consequence.
                  Gangways are only. 640mm wide for much of their
           length (they widen round the exit)*   This is well
           below the green guide recommendation.   However, it
           is clearly appropriate to take into account the
           general nature of the stand, the number as well as
           the width of the gangways, and above all the ease and
           speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                   On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
           leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
           The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.   Thereafter
           the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
           This established that in an emergency the green guide
           figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l*lm gangway)
           can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators



                                                                         x /
                                                                     SH6CT   7.


    EASTWOOD Cr PARTNERS




               the average is 556 per exit.   Thus the stand would
               empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
               recommended limit of eight minutes.
                      Our observations in company with the fire
               officer^ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
               had left this stand, apart from some people who were
               in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we also
               counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
               whistle.   The overall picture appears very satisfactory
               and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
               as not needing any significant modification.

        (b)    The West Stand
                      This stand is very similar to the north stand
               in its construction.    We were not able to accurately
               assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
               January because there were many seats which were unsold.
               However, there is every reason to believe that there
               will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
               eight minutes also.    There should be no need for
               significant modifications.

%       (c)    The South Stand
                      The structure has been surveyed and appended
               are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
               show the plans and cross-section.   Also attached is
               a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
                      The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
               has 5710 seats.   These are served by 12 exits (excluding
               those serving the directors box) so that an average
               of 476 people need to pass through each exit.   The
               count by the fire officer's staff on 6 January showed
               an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
               exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
               seven minutes.  Indeed there were very few people

                                                                   SHEET   8.


EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




           still trying to get out six minutes after the final
           whistle.   A few had no doubt left early and a few
           were still standing around, but the stand had
           substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                  Having left the top of the stand the spectators
           have to make their way from the first floor landing
           via one of three staircases.   Two of these are 3.6m
           wide and the other 2.4.   This is equivalent to 17$
           'lanes' of 550mm.    At 40 people per lane, 700 people
           pass per minute.    To discharge 5710 people (less
           those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
           exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                  At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
           almost straight to the open airy through a compartment
           which is separated from the main part of the building.
           The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
           will probably need three sets of self closing fire
           doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
           The club intends to move the paint store from the
           space behind this staircase.
                  The front, open-air part of the south stand is
           well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
           one passage.   This passage has a theoretical capacity
           of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
           This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.    Because
           the stand is open to the air and there is very
           ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
           long emptying time is of any great consequence.


   General Requirements
          The police and the fire officer, and possibly the
   Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
   matters.   Prior to holding a further formal meeting they
    #

^SASTW OOD ft PARTNERS




        will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
        further visit.   We would like to be present when any
        further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
        being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood's absence
        which will extend to 15 February.
               If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
        post they would like, this can be considered by the club
        and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
               A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
        might be held around say 16 February.
               In the meantime Eastwood& Partners       will be checking
        the   various electrical services so that we shall be in a
        position to discuss these at the meeting.


        Future Ground Capacity
               Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
        out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
        ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows
                Seating approximately                  24,000
                Standing on Spion Kop                  16,000
                Standing at Leppings Lane end
                (total including N.W. corner)          10,100
                                                       50,100

                It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
        has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
        be admitted to the ground.      This involved of the order of
        19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.   Indeed, it
        is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
        70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
        Kop probably approached 30,000.
               It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
        excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

               H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best In Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 thts season and,: viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and It was hoped to expand tills side of the Club's activities. The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED *

1.    That, whilst Designating Orders dtd not specify time limits for the Issue of
General Safety Certificates, It was essential to aim for the Certificate to be Issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
        2.    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the aim should
        be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds,

        3.    That as much work as possible should be carrted out in the close season,
        bearing In mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
        will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's Witness Bally had
        also to be borne In mind.

        2.   Discussion on Standing Areas

        A.   Spion Kop

        IT WAS AGREED -

        1.    That the siting and angle of the new barriers to be installed be the subject
J       of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

        2.   That the Club consider the Installation of simple lateral barriers (not of the
        climb proof type) for crowd control purposes In the blocks on either side of the
        central block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).

        3.     That, In view of the clearance time of 11} minutes compared with the
        8 minutes specified In the Guide, the means of escape be discussed tn detail
        between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (Including the re-si ting of the gates
        In the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the ext sting gates and/or
        an tncrease tn their number).

        4.   That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
        maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

    /   5*    That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary poets and fences
        be tested to the appropriate standards.                  ------

        6.   That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
        crush barriers and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussions
        between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

        7.   That the Club's longer term proposals for the Improvement of the means of
        egress be unanimously welcomed.

        8.    That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
        points have been resolved.
B.    W est T errace

ITWASAGBEED-

1.    That the Club's proposals for the Installation of additional barriers and the
reduction In capacity to 7,200 spectators without the need for additional gangways
should be implemented.

2.    That the question of the cross-foil on the steps on the north-west corner
exit, the height of some of the existing crush barriers, as well as their corrosion
and sharp edges In places, be the subject of detailed discussion between
Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

C.    North West Corner Terrace

IT WAS AGBEED -

1.    That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush barriers up to standard and
supplemented by new barriers with a consequent capacity of 2,900 spectators should
be Implemented.

2.    That the Improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting be
the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

3.    North Stand

IT WAS AGREED-

1.     That, In view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
Working Party as to the appropriate steps (if any) to be taken over the width of the
existing gangways, both sides be requested to consider all the points made, and
to re-consider the matter at the next meeting.

2.   That the q u estio n of fire protection works to the Store Boom and to the Team
Boom be the subject of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the
Fire Service.

3.     That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
and First-Aid Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted In principle, and
that the facilities required In the new permanent structures be considered later in
the Agenda.

4.    That the existing Wire Mesh barriers under the Stand be the subject of
discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

5.   That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Sirveyor.
                                         3.
4.    West Stand

IT WAS AGBEED -

That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied In die required time,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur In the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency use, rather
than for normal use).

5.    South Stand

IT WAS AGBEED -

1.     That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss In detail the apparent
spalllng of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for Inspection (2
only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin walls.

2.    That, to overcome the means of escape problems In the upper part of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
seats or some such alternative.

3.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
fire resistance In the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.

4.    That the means of escape problems In the front open air part of the stand
be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
side consideration be given to providing an additional gangway to exit on to the
derelict land adjoining the Splon Kop.

5.    That no Immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons Immediately
before a match, even though police had control of Its use after a match.

6.    Ground Exit#                                                                    '

Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
already supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
circulated without delay.
*   ••   r



             7.    Communications

             IT WAS AGBEED That consideration would be given to the installation of an
             improved public address system,, with the Police having access to Its control
             from their Control Boom, together with Its use as a fire alarm system, subject
             to an emergency back-up system In the event of failure.

             8.    Police and First Aid Facilities

             IT WAS AGBEED-

             1.    That the Chib accept the principle of permanently contracted Police and
             First Aid Facilities.

             2.     That the Police would supply the Club Secretary with a copy of their initial
             sketch plan showing the facilities they wished to see, and that Dr. Bailey would
             Inspect the existing first-aid and medical facilities and then discuss fixture
             facilities with Dr. Eastwood.

             9.    Any other Topics

             IT WAS AGBEED That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the existing
             and any proposed emergency generating and fire-fighting equipment.

             10.   Future Action

             The Club stressed that they wished to carry out as much work as possible before
             tiie Issue of the Certificate by the start of the 1979/80 Season. If this was to be done,
             It was essential that any points for discussion between the various representatives
             of the Working Party and Dr. Eastwood had to be cleared without delay.

             11.   Date of Next Meeting c                           .

             IT WAS AGBEED That the nett meeting should be held at 2.30 p.m. on
             Wednesday, 18th April, 1979, at the Stadium.

The Note (previously circulated) of the meeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, was considered
In conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
and Partners, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the City of Sheffield
Metropolitan District Council Building Surveyor's Department held on 13th April, 1975.

The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
amendments and additions In the Ught of the farther Investigations and discussions:-

2A     Splon Kop

Paras. 1 6 2 - Revised copies of drawing no. 1610/EX were circulated at the meeting
showing tiie proposed new crush barrier layout, Including the Uvo lines of radial
barriers. Thts was AGREED In principle.

Para. 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop as existing would mean an unacceptable
evacuation time of some 1 2 \ minutes. Larger and re-aligned gates In the barrier
and Improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this time Lo some 10 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by Installing a new exit of 3 metre overall width.
This could bo Integrated Into the proposed ftiture scheme for enlarging and roofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.
Para. 4 - The exploratory work regarding the Improvement of the headroom bad
still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

Para. 5 - Because of the difficulty In devising a suitable method of testing In places
(such as the top of the Kop), It was AGBEED that proposals should be formulated
after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

Para. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was AGBEED that the question of the height of some
of the crush barriers be considered again after It was seen which of them failed on
testing.

Para. 7 - The Club stressed that their proposals for the Improvement of the means of
egress would hopefully be carried out In the shorter rather than the longer term future.

Para. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with
the Installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates In the e x is tin g
barrier, could all be carried out In the close season. Their aim was to achieve a
16,850 crowd capacity.

2B     West Terrace

Para. 2 - The Club accepted that In view of the cross-fall on the north-west corner
exit, the steps should be re-built. It was AGBEED that the other matters would be
considered again after It was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

2C     North West Corner Terrace

Para. 2 - 'Whilst accepting the need for the Improvement or replacement of the
existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
out more extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area Into use for an
additional 250/300 spectators.

3.     North Stand

Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood,, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
agreement on a scheme which could be recommended to the Club* This would
Involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from In
front of each of the 9 upper exits. The result would mean a loss of 126 seats
compared to the 225 In the original proposals. The dub AGBEED to give
consideration to the proposal.

Para. 2 - The word at the end of the first line should have been 'Tea' and not 'Team'.
It was AGBEED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss In detail any
fire protection works considered to be necessary.
       4.      W est Stand

       The Club AGBEED that additional exits of simple steel construction should be
 W -   provided from each end of the upper stand.

       5.      South Stand

       Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
       Whilst rusting was not excessive, It was AGBEED that all bases would be exposed for
       Inspection and, If necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
       encasing In concrete for permanent protection. Because of tbe apparent accumulation
       of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
       Club also AGBEED that the space beneath tbe timber floor should be cleaned out.

       Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, It was AGBEED that
       It would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes In tbe upper part
       of the stand (the covered area).

       ' para. 3 - It was AGBEED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the



       I
         outer edges of the main staircase; that the existing Iron centre railing should remain,



       «nH that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be Installed.
       It was also AGBEED that the brick staircase walls should be buttressed where crowd
       surge pressure could be generated.

       Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, It was AGBEED
       that on the west side a new exit through a new 1.2 metre wide door adjacent to the existing
       snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance measures In the
       surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
       footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
       Isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGBEED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
       should consider precisely what measures could be considered satisfactory so as to
       avoid any loss of seats.

        6.     Ground Exits

        Hie 1:500 site plan was in the process of being circulated.

        7.     Communications

]£^K    The Club stressed they were thinking In terms of an upgrading of the existing public
        address system . It was AGBEED that the Police should have an over-ride facility
        from their Police Boom, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
        achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

        8.     Police and First Aid Facilities

        Paras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that It was essential that there was no gap In
        the provision of Police Facilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
        the permanent structure. With this In mind, they were happy for the safety aspects

                                               3.

Mr. McGee stressed that it was essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to make application for financial assistance under the Football
Association's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50,000 crowd
capacity if the aim of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest,
proposals, If Implemented, appeared to give a capacity of some 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans fcs revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Building Surveyor.

Mr. McGee requested that he be advised If It appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded wi thout
delay.

 I have now received the detailed comments of all of the disciplines
 represented on the Working Party.

 These have been collated Into the attached schedule which, together with
 plans, confirm formally In writing the matters discussed by the Working
 Party with the Club over the series of meetings held so far and which
 tiie County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
 safety at the Ground.

 They are, of course, Individual requirements on specific matters and are
 additional to the general requirements set out In the specimen form of
 General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my letter of                          [*>•. ■-

 After the Club has had the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
 you would let me know which of the requirements you feel will be able to
 be carried out In the dose season.

 Should yon have any queries, Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (ext. 422) would
 be happy to discuss them with you.

Public Address System

The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having an
over-ride facility from their Police Room.

Police Facilities

A suitable permanent Police Room (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan
marked AA ) to be provided In the 1980 close season.

First Aid Faculties

(1)     Structure

        The existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
        and it is suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
        structure which 1? not likely to require up-grading for a very long time.
        The internal finisn, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
        impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fairly
        sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved fay the use of
        tiles or formica type finish e tc .. . .

(II)    Waiting Area

        The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise .
        the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

(Ill)   Treatment Area

        The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
        patients at any one time, and consideration should be given to the needs
        for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
        patients may well be lying on couches.
(iv)     Lighting

         Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
         provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

(v)      Water

         A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
         for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
         be provided. The Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
         the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
         chipping.

(vi)     Toilet Requirements

         The dub should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
         the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
         an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vii)    Storage

         Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
         wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
         be lockable.

(vili)   Equipment

         The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service:-

         Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
         on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is
         cublded.

         Six Stretchers.
         Two sets of stretcher wheels.
         20 Blankets.
         Six Pillows.
         One Minute-Man Kesuscltator.

(ix)     Telephone Facilities

         A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
         achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
         police.




                                    6.




                                         4-S
     (x)      C ar Parking

            The dub might also consider what facilities could be extended to the      y /
            St. John's personnel for the parking of staff cars.

S.   Crowd Capacity

     The following numbers will be considered to be satisfactory, provided that the
     recommended work as detailed above is carried out:-

            Spion Kop                   16,850
            South Stand Upper            5,567

 Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounda Act. 1975

Further to my letter of 19th July, the provisional drawings in respect
of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's Hillsborough Stadium have
been considered in detail by the Officer Working Party. As you are
aware, a marked set of the drawings have subsequently been
collected by a member of your stall from the office of the Building
Surveyor at the Town Hall, Sheffield, on 2nd August.

 I would stress that the notes on the drawings cover essential points
 and are without prejudice to any fiiture detailed requirements.

 As agreed, I should be obliged if you deposit a complete set of
 drawings showing the "as built' construction.

                                    Tours faithfully,

Dear Sir,
                                                                2 3 AUG 1979
 Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975              Rec’d

As I think you are aware from the conversations which Mr. D. Vaughan of my
staff has had with you from time to time, the County Council has always had In
mind that If possible the Certificate In respect of the Hillsborough Stadium would
be Issued In September. This possibility was based on the assumption that the
required works would be coop leted by that time, and also the Club's request
that the Stadium be certificated to maximum capacity by the start of the 1979/80
Season.

However, It Is obvious that despite all the progress to date, It will not be possible
for the Club to coup lete In the next few weeks all of the work set out In the
Schedule of Matters Requiring Attention forwarded with my letter of 8th JUne. The
County Council has particularly in mind the structural and fire resistance works
required to the South Stand, and the Officer Working Party is endeavouring to let
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners have comments by 3rd September as requested
by their letter dated lOtb August.

The County Council would be loathe to issue a Certificate In September with a
restricted capacity, and I believe such a step would also not be In accordance with
tiie Club's wishes*

With these facts la mind, I think it would be more realistic to aim to issue the
Certificate at the beginning of December, and so allow the Club more time In
which to complete the required works. It would assist if you could let me know
the Club's programme for tbe completion of the required works.

An extra copy of this letter is attached for your use should you wish to pass It for
comment to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners.

                                               Yours folthftilly.

Mr. Whitehead welcomed the representatives and explained that delays cnu'od prlmnriiy
by the wet weather, had meant that all of the rewired work had not been completed by
today's meeting as the Club had originally envisaged.

Tbe Schedule of Matters requiring attention (rioted 8th June, 1079) was considered, wiih
the following results (after site Inspection where necessary):-

5.      The future of the sco re -board building was still undecided but, if a decision
        to be made shortly was to retain It, supporting calculations would be forwarded
        to the Building Authority.

6.      Work carried out. Test, report to be forwarded to the Bulldtng Authority.

C.      North West Terrace

1.      To prevent local damage to the sheeting, particularly at the joints and to
         spread the anticipated load over a larger area than at present. It was agreed
         that a continuous horizontal timber member should be fixed to the front of the
         sheets at a height about one metre from terrace level.

2.      Work carried out.

D.      Wsst Stand

        It was agreed that, whilst the only positive \\&y of proving the adequacy of the
        joint between the new and existing construction was by means of a test load,
        the calculations provided would be regarded as acceptable.

E.      West Terrace

1.      Work carried out.

2.      Work carried out.

F.      South Stand (Bear)

(I)     It was agreed that, provided seat no. 26 was replaced by a flush fitting type

(viii) The steel columns had been opened up for inspection and agreement on
       necessary remedial work.

(ix)    It was agreed that a test load of 200 lb/ft would beapplied along the
         whole length.

(x)     Work in hand.

(xi)    It was agreed that a metal rail extending 10" above'the wallshould be Installed r.t

G.      General Structural Matters

1.      Work mainly carried out.

2.      Re-assessment to be carried out shortly.

H.      Emergency Lighting

1&      It was obvious that there was adifference of opinion as to what could be
2       regarded as acceptable as regards the emergency lighting in the South
         Stand. It was agreed that a trial should be conducted during the hours of
         darkness attended by representative: of th<? Club and ih^ Fire Service so
         as to identify toe danger areas. Consideration would then be given to
         possibly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to those particular
         areas not covered by the emergency lighting covering other parts of the
         ground.

I.      Fire Warning System

        The problems with the public address system seemed to be mainly ones of
        diction and correct volume level. It was agreed that the police would monitor the
        position at the next home match and, pending the new police control post being
        erected, would arrange for an officer to sit alongside the Disc Jockey in the
        meantime.

        It was also agreed that the monitoring point for the flre detection equipment
        should be in the tower between the South and West Stands, and would proceed
        once the electrical work was completed.

J.      FI re Extinguishers

        The fire extinguishers had been delivered and were to be fitted shortly as
        shown on the plan. The Fire Service undertook to clear any doubtful points.

M.   Notices - Extt Signs

1.   To be erected after decorations complete.

2.   Will be put in hand once agreement reached on emergency lighting.

N.   Emergency Procedure

     It was agreed that the Fire Service would supply the Club with details of the
     necessary wording.

0.   Access for Emergency Vehicles

1.   It was agreed that whilst no real problems had occurred in the past, the Club
     would (in consultation with the Fire Service and the Polled) mark out o lane
     from the main gate to the South Stand in which parking would not be allowed.
     It was also agreed that the hydrant outside the South Stand would have to be
     kept clear.

P.   Public Address System

     Already discussed under "Fire Warning System"

Q.   Police Facilites and R. First Aid Facilities
                       •«
     As agreed, a suitable permanent Police Room would be provided in the 1980
     closed season.

     The Club explained that il would be pvsier&ble from'a building point of view
     for boththe police and first aid facilities to be in the same overall building
     although physically separated. The police rqjresentatlves reserved their
     position on this point, pending the outcome of detailed discussions with the
     Club.

     The question of parking for both police and St. John's personnel purposes
     would also need to be looked at in detail.

S.   Ground Capacity

     Provided the outstanding points v.f*tc satisfactorily resolved, it was agreed
     that the crowd capacity -.vouic' be  shown, i.e . a total of 50,174.

    T.     Issue of Certificate

    The Club were anxious that the Certificate should be in force by tbe derby game
    with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning, and they were assured that providing
    the outstanding points wore satisfactorily resolved, it was still the intention to
    issue the Certificate at the beginning of December.

  Dear Sir,
  Safety of Sports Grounds Act# 1975
  As was discussed at the meeting cn 12th Noventoer between representatives of
  the Club and the Officer Working Party, the question of the issue of the
  General Safety Certificate and the fee to be charged was put to the County
  Caimittee concerned this morning.
  Subject to the outstanding points being satisfactorily resolved, the
  Ccdnittee has approved of the issue of the Certificate and has reccnmended
  that the question of the fee to be charged should be discussed with another
  Carmittee before a decision is reached. This approval will, of course, be
  subject to formal confirmation by the County Cornell on 19th Deoenber.
  The principal outstanding matters are still those relating to the South Stand
  discussed cn 12th November, namely, remedial works to the steel columns and
  the emergency lighting system. I understand that little or no progress has
  been made cn these two matters.
  Vtiilst the County Cornell recognises the Club’s co-operation in carrying out
  by far the majority of the measures reocranended by the Officer Working Party,
  I am sure you will appreciate the position vtoich will be created should
  progress not be made quickly on these taro outstanding major items.
                                                             Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr* Stenton,
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
     As promised in my discussion with Mr* Sherrif yesterday,
I write to record the load tests which have recently been
carried out*   We have not yet finished writing up the
report on the testing of all crush barriers but I can give
an assurance that all barriers except one were brought up
to standard during August and that the remaining barrier
has recently been tested and satisfactorily passed the green
book requirement*
     We have also managed to apply test loads at two or three
places along the boundary fence adjacent to the tunnel exit
from Spion Kop and in each case, the fence withstood the
required sideways load for handrailing set out in the green
book*
     We have also test loaded the wall in the small
triangular area below the tunnel exit from Spion Kop to the
full 6 kN/m requirement*
     Zn the South stand we test loaded on a 2m length at the
foot of each of the access gangways with the full crush barrier
load of 6 kN/m length*   We have also test loaded every
complete span of the balustrade under a load of 3 kN/m length*
Zn all cases the load was withstood without distress*
                                            Yours sincerely,

  Dear Mr. England,
                                    Certificate of Ground Safety, 1979
                      Test on Crush Barriers,                                  Balustrades and Fences
             We have pleasure in presenting a formal report drawing
  together the results of all the load tests on crush barriers,
  fences etc. which were carried out between June and December
  1979.


  Crush Barriers
Q       The first series                                          of      testswere made on all the barriers
  existing at the time of the application for a safety certificate.
  These         are shown on the attachedprints of drawings Nos. 1610/61 and
  62.           The barrier numbers   used in the following descriptions of
  the tests          are as shown on                                    thesetwo drawings.


  (a)       A total of 19 barriers failed to carry the specified test
            load of 6 kN/m length when first tested.                                               Seven of these
            failures (Nos. 40, 41, 42, 57, 58, 62 and 68) were caused
            by defective retaining clips on the horizontal rails.
            Seven failed because the horizontal rail suffered permanent
            deformation (Nos. 34, 87, 91, 92, 93, 97 and 98) and five
            failed because of bending of vertical posts (Nos. 4, 18,

                                                      Regisfarad In England - No. 1134831
                                                                              Go
                                                               SHEET

         19, 37 and 38).
              During the course of the testing careful inspection
         was made of each barrier and it was found that, although
         they passed the test/ a number of barriers had minor
         defects mainly due to corrosion.   A total of 32 new clips,
         eight new rails and five new posts were fitted in addition
         to strengthening of those barriers which failed the test.
         All protruding or sharp edges were removed.
              One further barrier was modified because it was initially
         significantly lower them the minimum height recommended in the
         green Code of Practice.
              Following construction of the new additional barriers on
         Spion Kop and the completion of repairs to the old barriers
         a second series of tests was made.   All the new barriers
         and all the repaired barriers now passed the test.


   (b)   Leppinqs Lane
              In the first series of tests six barriers (Nos. 104,
         105, 106, 107, 110 and 123) had failures of the tube
         retaining clips.   Five barriers (Nos. 107, 114, 115, 121 and 130)
         suffered permanent deformation of the horizontal rail.
              All these barriers were repaired.   In addition 13 new
         clips and five rails which were badly corroded were replaced,
         and any protruding or sharp edges removed.
              After construction of the new barriers, they and all
         the repaired barriers were tested and all withstood the
         test load satisfactorily.


   (c)   North West Corner
              The initial testing of the first few barriers in this
         corner showed that all of them were only capable of taking
         about half the test load.   The rails deflected excessively
         and the holding down bolts were also inadequate.



                                      61
                                                                       /
                                                                     SHEET

EASTWOOD Cr PARTNERS




              Major strengthening in the form of extra posts to
       shorten the span of the rails and to share the load with
       the existing posts were installed.         A new type of holding
       down arrangement was devised.
             When re-tested all existing barriers plus all the
        new barriers successfully withstood the specified load.

  rhe Safety Cage
^       When the first series     of tests were made on the crush
 barriers it was found that the safety cage along both ends of
 the ground had defective supports.          It was found that certain
 holding down bolts     had not been fixed when the fence was
 installed.     There   was   also a need for support from the
 concrete perimeter wall in some places.   After appropriate
 remedial work the fence was successfully test loaded in 4m sections
 along both ends of the ground using the normal crush barrier
 loading of 6 kN/m length.


 Boundary Fences
       Concern had been felt for the boundary fence along the
  ;dge of the ramp from Spion Kop.       Any failure of this fence
    the crowd leaves the ground could result in people being
 spilled down a steep bank.   The whole length of this fence
 from the score board down to the bottom was therefore tested
 using the lateral force specified in the green Code of 2.74 kN/m.
 The whole length carried the load satisfactorily.
       The continuation of this fence round to the north-east
 corner of the pitch, plus the two lines of fence which protect
 the island of spectators to the west of the tunnel were also
 appropriately tested (the lengths marked in red on the attached
 print of drawing 1610/11).       All the sections successfully
 carried the test load without signs of distress.
       It was also found to be possible to test load five sections
 of the boundary fence round the top of Spion Kop as shown by the
 short red lines.       The load applied was again that appropriate to

                                        (= 2 -
                                                                    SHEET   4*

EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




  the lateral force on exit routes.        Again the load was
  satisfactorily resisted.


  South Stand    Balustrade
        The final testing was on the south stand balustrade.
  At the foot of every gangway a length of 2m was subjected
  to the same test load as crush barriers i.e. 6 kN/m length.
  In every case this load was resisted without distress.
^       In between the gangways, the balustrade was subjected
  to a test load of 3 kN/m length applied to the whole span
  between successive pairs of supports.        Again the load was
  everywhere satisfactorily resisted.


  Future Numbering of Crush Barriers
         Many of the barriers have been lengthened and also
  additional barriers have been installed.        It is obviously
  inappropriate to continue with the old numbering system.
  We therefore include prints of two new drawings 1610/63 and 64 which
  show a new numbering system for Spion Kop and the whole of the
  west end of the ground.     It is proposed that these numbers
^ w i l l be used in all future reports.


                                      Yours sincerely

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

    I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.

    After consultations with the Building Authority and in view of the fact
    that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
    Council is able to agree this year with the course of action which you
    propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
    upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
    to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
    25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

    Hay I also mention the Certificates by:-

    (a)      a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
             paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
             parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

    (b)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
             26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
             within the Stadium; and

    (c)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
             12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
             Emergency Power Supply.

    I take it that if the Club has not already done so, they will shortly be
    requesting you to supply these.

                                                                 Yours faithfully,

      Note of a Visit to the Hillsborough Stadium. Sheffield
                        on 8th June, 1981

PRESENT:   Representing the' Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

           E. England (Secretary)

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

           C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
           F. Davis (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
           R. Grimshaw (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

           D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           D.l. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.     Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2 .____ Inspection of Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)    South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel       .
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be gi,ven.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)     West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars' supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.


                                    -   1-


                                 <ol
(c)    North-West Terrace

The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also noted*that the tie bar* through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been "protectively wrapped.

(d)   North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)   Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.                                                     !

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

(f)   General

It was noted:-

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

For the attention of Mr. P. Vaughan.

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
            Sheffield Vednesday Football Club Ltd.
              Radial Fences at Lappings Lans ted
     Vs havs bssn instructed by ths Club to organlss ths
Installation of two radial fsncss on ths tsrracs at ths
Lsppings Ians end of ths ground.
     It is intsndsd that thsss fsncss are so posltlonsd
that thsy divide this ssction of ths tsrraes into
approximately three equal arsas, sach ssrvsd by its own
sntrancs.
     By dividing ths tsrraes aors control ovsr supporters
should rssult. A visiting tsaa with only a fsw followers
will ba allocatsd ons ssction, with ths othsr two ssctions
rstainsd by ths hoas supporters.
     Largsr contingents of visiting spsctators eould bs
accommodated in two or all thrss areas as their numbers
dictate.
     A 1.13 metre wide gate is propossd at the rear of
each fence to give access for Maintenance and also policing
during a gams. Ths gats could bs lsft opsn, but fastsnsd
back, to connset ths arsas during a gaas if adjacent onss
are accuplsd by supporters of ths saas tsaa. When establishing
ths hslght vs havs considsrsd that ths vlsws to ths cornsr
flags should not bs rsstrletsd any further than thsy are at
present by ths psrlastsr fence. We therefore proposs that ths
top of ths fsaes should bs approxlaatsly 1680aa above the
terrace.
     This aay not prevent ths odd spsctator climbing ths fsacs
but should sllalnats a mass invasion froa one arsa to ths othsr.
Fences this hsight appear to work succsssfully at St. Jaass's
Park, ths hoas of Nswcastls United.
     Ve would bs plsassd if this spsdflc point can be discussed
within ths Working Party and your coaasnts forwarded to us.
     Also to bs includsd in ths saas contract arc soas gatss at
various locations around tbs north stand. Nov ths gyanaslua is
opsn to ths gsaeral public sscurity to othsr parts of ths ground
must bs aaintainsd. It is propossd that gatss are provided at
ths top of ths raapa at both snds of ths stand with additional
gatss at ground floor lsvsl at ths Penlstons Road snd of ths
stand. A separate gate will be placed behind the west raap to
prsvsnt psopls going round ths rsar of ths gyanaslua towards
Lepplngs Lans.
     Six copies of our drawing 3S63/1 together with two copies
of our drawings 3963/2 and 3 (for reference only) are snclossd.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                      Safety of Sports Grounds Act# 1975
                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
    As previously intimated to you we carried out tests
on approximately one fifth of the crush barriers in July and
also made a preliminary Inspection in company with Mr. Shertff.
    One or two of the crush barriers showed signs of distress
under the test load and along a length of the boundary fence of
the Kop at the North East corner it was discovered that oertain
of the stays were rusted through.      Remedial work has new been
carried out and the defeotiye crush barriers have been successfully
subjected to the test load.   We shall be inviting Mr. Sheriff
to Inspect the remedial work in the next few days following
which Z will issue a certificate on the lines of that which X
sent to you last year.

                                        Yours sincerely.

         Dear Sir,                                    ijQsiVvGoci 6c Partners
         Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1973. - ^                 15SEPI98I
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

         Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party
         (Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
         letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

         1.      Radial Barriers on West Terrace

         Whilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
         result* concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur with
         opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
         exit gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
         whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
         problem was of such a small scale that it could be easily coped with by
         the police.

         Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
         to the proposals to instal two 1680 saa high radial barriers, with 1.15
         metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:-

        I (a)    the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
                 satisfactory (Mr. Sheriff to contact you direct);

    o (b)       confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the rear
                 of the Terrace after installation of the barriers and gates, and

         (c)     the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
                 control.

         2.      Security Gates around North Stand

        The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club's need to provide
        -security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is in

         Provided that the gates and/or their Supports, hinges, etc. do not
         impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
    /   in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
J       sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stand.

3.     Other Matters

Two other matters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating
to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of the
Lottery Ticket Boxes.

 (a)   Police and First Aid Facilities

       It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
       aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim
       basis on the understanding that the Club would provide purpose built
       replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

       It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
       still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
       a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are to
       be provided.
 (b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes

       Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
       the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps
       were to be tipped over or ignited* either accidentally or deliberately.

       The Officer forking Party felt that the Club should be requested to
       re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                            Tours faithfully,




                                            Chief Executive.

Dear Eric,
                   Safety of Sports Grounds Act
    I enclose a copy of a letter fran David Vaughan dated
14 September from which you will set that th$ proposal to
instal the radial barriers on the West terrace and to
provide security gates round the North stand are accepted,
although with sane reservations in the case of the radial
barriers.    Twoothers natters are also raised, that of the
Police and first aid facilities and also the lottery ticket
                                                   5

boxes.
    I intend to walk round the ground at the end of the week
to inspect the various minor works associated with strengthening
crush barriers and boundary fences before issuing a certificate
for this year's testing programme*    I will telephone before
X cane so that we can have a chat for a few minutes.

                                Yours sincerely.

                                           \ In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that
                                           ^ the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
                                             on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
                                             of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the West
                                             Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
                                             course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
                                             time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
                                             being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals.

                                             As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the
                                             security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party wishes
                                             to make the following comments:*

                                              (a)       Radial Barriers on West Terrace

                                             The matches played at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
                                             confirm that they appear to be working well and satisfactorily effect the
                                             segregation of opposing groups of fans. However, the entire section of
                                             the Terrace has yet to be given to one group of fans.

                                             The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,

                                              from the ground. The effect is to maka it very easy for fans to climb

                                              rails have been cut off short of the radial barriers in a manner which
                                              leaves dangerous pieces protruding into s q m of the gangways.

                                             impinge on the existing            critical ramp widths, the Officer Working Party

                                             I am informed that the manner in which the gates have been installed
                                             has resulted in each gate's hinge impinging at least 7i" into the width'V
                                             of the ramp. This means that there is a 15" reduction in width of the \

For the atfntion of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Safety of Sports Ground Act
        Thank you for your lattar of 20 January.
        X believe the snail number of points needing
clarification hava already bean discussed between
John Strange and Mr. Sheriff.     One of these refer to the
need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
in fact already provided by the sheeting frrfme.  There is
also a small amount of rust staining arising fro* misplacement
of reinforcement in the 1 0 0 m thick retaining wall.    There
is no immediate danger arising fro* this and an appropriate
maintenance repair will be carried out.
        Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
it will make it easiftr for anyone who so wishes to climb
over.   Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
leave the crush barriers as they are.   Zf all barriers
were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.
There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
capacity which is undesirable fro* the Club's pAint of
view.   However froa the point of view of safety a strip
of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
major hazard.
          Zt should be kept in Bind that the introduction
of these radial barriers has effected a very great
improvement froa the point of view of segregation of
spectators but to achieve perfection froa the point of
view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
Z believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
between the various interests.
          Zn the second paragraph on this subject you
refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding froa the
crush barriers.   I have not had an opportunity to check
this since receiving your letter but Z aa informed that
the word 'dangerous* is a little exaggerated and they
do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
gangway at this position.
          With regard to the security gates around the North
stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
the gate width is at all critical.   The remaining clear
width is 3.300bsi which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
routes.    The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
practice more than half the number tend to use the lower
exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
to the upper set of exit stairways.     The picture is that
fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.
        Chare were very good structural reasons for placing
the gates in this way*   The theoretical ax 1ft capacity has
not baan changed since it was always a six unit gateway*
There is no funnelling effect# and thera is a good
'reservoir* area upstreaa of the gates*

1.       Purpose of Meeting
                                           \

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss«£he apparent difference of opinion
on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
and the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as to
carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

2.       Ground Inspection

A.       West Terrace

Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely through the new
radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
left unsupported.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
current season.

(ii) That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
be cut off.
B.    West Stand *

One of the security gates vhich the Club wished to instal at the bottom of
th« two staircases had now been erected.

IT WAS AGREED    that this could, be regarded as satisfactory.

C.    North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

IT WAS AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
initial consideration of the Club’s application for a General Safety
Certificate, the point would notbe pursued at the moment.

      NOTE -    A search of the file subsequently revealed that,   as
               suspected, the point had been considered at a
               meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
               the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

                   "the construction and width of the ramps being
                    such that they could quite.properly be
                    regarded as elevated roadways".

D.     Spion Kop

It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
theleft of the original exit at    the top of the Kop had taken place; that
the   boundary fence at the top of the Kop had been reinforced, and that the
existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
levelled off as agreed.

E.     South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

P*    Items of General Maintenance

IT WAS AGREED    that the following items of general maintenance required
attention:-

(i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
the exit at the southerlyend of theWest Stand (tobe done that day), as
well as the rounding offof thebrackets to   the North Stand securitygates.

(ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
Gate "0".
(iii) The cracks‘in the concrete terracing of the Spion Kop to be   filled.

(iv) The wooden support to the electrical line between the brick built
refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

(v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
to the South Stand) to be pointed.

(vi) The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and
exposed bar).

G.    Temporary Structures

Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
television transmissions.

Paragraph 20 of the Club's General SafetyCertificate requiredT.V. cameras
and portable equipment to be placed onlyin suchpositions asmaybe agreed
between the Police and the Club. The Club also were generally required to
ensure that the Stadium complied with good engineering and building practices
and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to the
Club.

3.    Future Developments

A.    Police and First AidFacilities

It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
forthcoming close season.

B.    Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their
intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
Stadium.

C.    Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

Dear Eric,
               Annual Certificate of Ground Safety
     We have completed the testing of the remainder of the
barriers at the Spion Kop end of the ground excepting
those barti4«s which beaause of their position cannot be
subjected to the test load*   Z am pleased to say that all
the barriers withstood the load but unfortunately in a number
of cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed
considerably*   Xt is inevitable thatwwater gets under
these clips and they rust thus becoming weaker with the
passage of time*   Xn one or two esses the clip actually
snapped as the final load was taken off*   A total of 25 new
clips are needed on Spion Kop including a few on the barriers
at the top which have not actually been tested*   John also
inspected the Leppings Lane end and 10 clips are sufficiently
corroded to make it wise to change them rather than wait until
they are tested during the next twg y e a r s ^ jfe are using
a heavier gauge metal for the jsstnfipoeiw^t clips so that the
future life expectancy will be increased*
     The metal in the tube beneath the clips is also subject
to corrosion and 11 lengths each about 8ft* long on Spion Kop
are clearly nearing the end of their life*   We have to bear
in mind that the corrosion which can be seen on the outside may


                                                                   /
be matched by corrosion inside the tube which cannot
of course be painted*   Whilst all 11 lengths successfully
carried the test load you may think it prudent that they
should be replaced now because they could become dangerous
within five years*
     If all this work is carried out (new clips on both
Spion Kop and Lappings Lane plus 11 new lengths of barrier
top rail on Spion Kop) the likely cost is between 61250
and £1500 exclusive of professional fees*    Z should be
pleased to have your view as ttowhether we should carry out
the whole of this work or merely replace the clips on
Spion Xop which deformed under test in which case the cost
of the work would be approximately halved*
     John has already walked round the ground and he tells
me that some splitting and spelling of the concrete columns
is developing at ground floor level at the back of the
South stand*   x*shall be making ay inspection in company
with the Building Surveyors department representative during
this month and it is likely he will raise the matter*   In
any case it is important that splitting of this kind be dealt
with reasonably quickly so as to retard the rate at which the
reinforcement corrodes*    Z will discuss this matter with you
when Z have seen the damage myself *

                                       Yours sincerely.

             Many thanks for your letter of the 12th July re barriers on Spion Kop
             and Leppings Lane, and I agree that you put the work in hand as
             detailed in order that we have no dangerous barriers for the start

           G.    Stanley (South Yorkshire Police)
           D.    I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.    Ground Inspection

A.    South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

(iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

B.    West Stand and Terrace

The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers. This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.
IT WAS AGREED

(i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way.

(ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

C*    North West Terrace

No comments.

D.    North Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regarded as acceptable.

E.    Spion Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club1s development proposals proceeding; that the loose coping stores
had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

F.   Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.   Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.
4.    Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club's
Architect and had been formally approved.

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for unproved toilet
and catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

        Dear Bill,

        SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND

        I would like to discuss the suggested improvements with you at an
        early opportunity and shall be pleased if you will let me have
        some dates when you could meet me at Hillsborough to give these
        matters further consideration.

Saar Dfeck,

                       turnstiles at Leopings Lane

     Thank you for re turn inn the narked copies of our drawings
6705/2 and 3. After our telephone conversation yesterday we
have altered the layout accordingly. Two prints of our drawing
6705/4 are enclosed for your cccments.
     We have equalised each combination of turnstiles and gate
as requested but each gate needs to be at least 2.75 m for exit
purposes.
     If this arrangement is satisfactory, or*even if you wish us
to make more alterations, ve would be available to have a meeting
with you and South Yorkshire Police saaetime nest %eek to discuss
the proposals in detail...    ____ ........

Dear Dick,
                     Re-organisation of Turnstiles
             and New Toilet Facilities at Lappings Lane
        As requested we have now prepared an estimate for the
cost of works envisaged at the back of the Nest stand for t h e .-
segregation of visiting spectators.
        The scope of the work falls into two categories, firstly
the turnstiles, fences, walls and gates, and secondly, the
toilets and refreshnent facilities*
        The proposed layout of the turnstiles etc. at the bade
of the stand is shown on our drawing 6705/4, a copy of which is.
enclosed.   Including the radial fence on the Vest terrace, we
estimate that the cost of this work, including professional            '
fees, is likely to be in the order of E66,600.   This
assumes that five of the existing turnstiles can be re-used^
and seven new turnstiles are purchased.                ..
        Also enclosed is a print of our drawing 6705/7 showing i
the proposed layout of the new and refurbished toilets beneath         -
the West stand. We estimate that the cost of the toilets/ ;      * *


agsAAnincluding professional fees, will probably be around •
£60,700.   This includes stainless steel fittings which are fairly
resistant to abuse but are expensive.     The saving if vitreous
china is substituted for stainless steel urinal troughs and
sinks wrnld be about £2,200.   Xf the items of mainteaaoos
work, listed by S.Y.C.C. Working Party on their last vi**t;
and agreed to be done i.e. investigate the condition of the
concrete frame" at the back of the South stand and the corrosion
of stanchions at the back of the West stand, repointing the
boundary wall on Penistone Road and providing the mesh infill
on the bridge to the kitchens are added to the same contract
we suggest that an allowance of £3,000 be made for this.
        The total expenditure for the whole scheme plus
the mainteannce work i> therefore likely to be about £130^^00 .
including professional fees and Building Regulations fees. ^


                         Tours sincerely.

              Dear Sirs,

              Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1985
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

              In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meeting of the
              Officer Woxking Party (Sheffield District) vas held on 18th April
              to consider the proposals which you outlined, the County Fire
              Service requested additional tine to consider the means of escape
              aspects.

              I am now able to say that, subject to the incorporation of the
              following points and to the submission of detailed plans and
              calculations under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and
              Building Regulations, the proposals outlined are regarded as
              generally acceptable

              (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile
    J               numbered 16 and the wall of the inner access road;

              (b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral
                    area or visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in
                    half by a new central radial fence running from the tunnel
                    entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates erected
                    so as to permit entry to be diverted to either half as
                    appropriate (the proposed new secondary radial fence
                    adjacent to the existing fence indicated on the plan to be
    J               abandoned);

              (c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
                    terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial
              ?     fence running from bade to front with two gates (the existing
        uA^         radial fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral
                    area and home supporters - to have a second gate installed f

Dear Dick,
             Re-arrancreaent of Bntry and Exit Arrangements at
                          Lepplngs Lanei
        I            understand, following John Strange's telephone conversation
with you yesterday, that South Yorkshire County Council did not send
you a copy of their letter to us dated 2 May.       A copy is now
enclosed.
        A number of things that they request*have already been
incorporated since we wrote to them on 9 April.        However Z do
not think that it is realistic to ask for the gates in the radial
fences and have written to David Vaughan accordingly.


                                 Yours sincerely.

           Thank y m for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
   of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
   to you on 9 April.
            In the interim period several of the points which you
p r a i s e d had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
  which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.             However X
  would* "ask that further consideration should be given to the
  request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a seoond gate to
  be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
  barrier which you have asked for to have two gates, txf these
  gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having             a
  steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
  would hardly be justified.     Zt is our view that in the event of
  emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
  gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
  We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
  Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                  Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act. 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

    In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
    (c) of my earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
       the South Yorkshire Police.

    Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
    are incorporated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
    the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radial fence
    in the right hand area of the Leppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as home
    supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                                     Yours faithfully




                                                     Chief Executive.

Dear Dick
                   Alterations at Lappings Lana End
      We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
6705/5 and 6705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the West stand.
     Both drawings show the following turnstile arranganants •
            Turnstile Hos    1*8    -   Worth stand
                             9 - 13 -   North west terrace, hone supporters
                            14 - 16 -   West stand, hone supporters
                            17 - 19 -   West stand, away supporters
                            20 - 23 -    South west terrace, away supporters
     The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
the same on each drawing.      You will see that we propose to build a new
ladles toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
refreshment bar. The existing ladles toilets will be refurbished for
the use of home supporters. The existing gents toilets will be
divided and refurbished.
     Drawing 6705/5 indicates present turnstiles housings <17 * 18)
remaining with the a joining fence covered with sheeting to completely
separate the home and away supporters.           However, doing the calculations
for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch p              at



                                      1 3 3
                                                                     2




the two external gates on the left hand side of the row of six.
Zt could take over 20 minutes to evacuate that end of the ground
depending on how many people leave the South stand from that side.
We, therefore, show on drawing 6705/8, an improvement to that
arrangement by demolishing the two end turnstiles (17 A 18) and
constructing a new dividing wall angled across to enclose three
gates on the left hand side Instead of two.
     We believe that the cost of the scheme on drawing 670S/5 will
be about £57,500 and for the one shown on drawing 6705/8 around
€59,500, both including professional fees.- To these figures add
say another £3000 for the maintenance work mentioned in our letter
of 2 Nay.
     Zf a decision to proceed with one of the proposed schemes is
given within the next few days it may be possible to have the work
substantially complete by the start of next season.   This is not
certain but we would have a go*


                             Yours sincerely.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd*

I thank you for your letter dated 12th June.

Taking into account all the factors which you mention (particularly the
steel sheeting of the wooden decking of the upper seated area by the
start of the forthcoming season), the existing roof of the South Stand
will be regarded as acceptable on a temporary basis until the end of
the 1985/86 season. At that time, either a new roof must be constructed
or the under-roof timber cladding of the existing roof replaced by the
start of the 1986/87 season.

Details and plans of the work will, of course, be required in the usual
way.

Tours faithfully,




Chief Executive

For the attention of Inspector C. C i l v r t .


Dear Mr. Calvert,

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

        Further to our telephone conversation on 24 June we have
pleasure in enclosing two copies of our drawing 6705/8 showing
the furoposed arrangement of the turnstiles and fences and gates
at the rear of the West stand.
      It is also proposed, but not shown on the drawing to
install a single barrier rail, just above head height down
the centre of the seated area and also a fence approximately
2m   away from the existing radial fence.on the right hand side
of the terrace (looking from the pitch),to separate standing
spectators* The fence will be just like the ones already installed*
       Although Dr, Eastwood has discussed the proposals in
outline with Chief Inspector Moseley we would also appreciate
receiving your comments.
      Perhaps the work can be completed ready for the start
of the season if the scheme meets with your approval.

                                  Tours sincerely.

  Dear Sirs,

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
      Thank you for your latter of 25 Juns regarding ths roof
0 o f ths South stand.   X am sure the Club will be very appreciative
  of the co-operative attitude of the County Council*    The
  breathing space which has been provided will be adequate for
  the Club to take action by the start of the 1986/87 season.


                                 Tours faithfully.

Dear Dick,
                    Alterations at Lepping* Lans End

     He have pleasure in enclosing a set of prints of our drawings
showing details of the work at the Leppings Lane End.
     Drawing 670 5/8A is worth a look at because it shows the proposed
layout of the turnstiles and fences. South Yorkshire Polios have
given their approval to the scheme though we have not received
anything frcm then in writing.
     Tenders are due back on 11th July, 1985.
                             Yours sincerely.

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

As requested by your letter dated 16th July, I have written a confirmatory
letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
the timber deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for .
your information).

I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
have been made by the Club in respect of (i) re-organisation of fences
and turnstiles and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
West Stand, Leppings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
Spion Kop Terrace.

The Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine meetings of the
possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
of such proposals have been considered to date.

As on previous occasions, I am assuming that you will subnit the necessary
detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
Act approval (bearing in mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
to give the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
alterations or extensions at the Ground) should ths Club decide to implement
the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                                   Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) net yesterday afternoon
to consider the detailed drawings enclosed with your letter dated
25th July relating principally to arrangements for the segregation
of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough
Stadium.

Subject to the following points and to the submission of the necessary
detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals are
regarded as generally acceptable

(a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both                security    access and emergencyegress
purposes, a pitch perimeter fence                gate to be provided;

(b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail     by Turnstile23tobe either
shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the
outer (river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile
16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller
shutter gate between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

(c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the internal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

(d)    Plan No. 6705/10A - sane comments as for plan 9A;

(e)    Plan No. 6705/11A - no objection in principle, but details of exact
location required;

(f)    Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
indicated;

                                                   /Contd . . .

(g)    Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved
by steep slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements
to give foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to
take measures on top of the vail to discourage persons from attempting to
climb over vill have to be borne in mind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in viev of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers mu&ered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stevarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
Stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained.


                                     Yours faithfully,

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
       Thank you very such for your letter of 30 July giving the
outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.   We note
the general coament that the calculations have to be approved
by the Building Surveyors Department,     lie believe that all the
calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
checking and consent.
       With regard to your detailed observations our response
is as follows *-
(a)    We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
the proposed extra security gate. There is already a gate in
the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
police. This sane gate will still be available for the spectators
in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
which will be under the control of the police.   This point may
perhaps be clarified during the Working Party's visit on 7 August.

(b)    The foundatinasffor this fence are in fact already aligned in


                                   [S I
the way pou suggest

(e) and (d)
       We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
single block thickness Is not sufficient for the cubicle
walls. The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
durability, and would probably invite vandalism*

(e)    The refreshment area is under the most westerly
staircase up to the north west corner terrace.     There will
be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

(f)    The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm <4 •X")
above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
step.

(g)    The stepping of the lace of the wall is achieved by 45*
chamfers which will not form good footholds.

(h)    Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

(1)    As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

(j)    Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
taken care of by Nr. Chester.


       It will be much easier for your Working Party to
appreciate irhat is intended when they see the works under
construction. There will also be an opportunity to see
the metal decking of the South stand.


                          Yours sincerely,

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

           D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
           F.   Waterhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer" inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.    Ground Inspection

A.    Leppings Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood ft Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood ft Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment.

On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wail by
45 chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wail
and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted).

As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete slabs. It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Mala Toilets* it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by thePolice.
This gate would still be available for the use ofspectators in an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. vide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the nev South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the nev fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that the condition of the internal vails in the nev male and female
toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the nev 2 m. vide gap
formed by the nev radial fence;

(c)   that a nev gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
the nev South Central Terrace Pen;

(d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
area should b« securely fixed to the concrete vail;

(e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
uppar seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

(f)   that the corrosion of the steel columns at the rear of the Stand
should receive attention on a maintenance basis.

*•    South Stand

Messrs. Eastwood A Partners reported that the condition of the upper
concrete outer portion of the exterior vail of the Stand had been
investigated and vas considered to be satisfactory.

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non~slip
surface vas to commence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
start of the season).
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the f lammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of th« metal sheeting.

C.    Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club's
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its present condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.    North Stand

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.    Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that a 2} kg. CO2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
secure.

Oear Dick,
      Many thanks for your note of 12 August enclosing the
copy of David Vaughan's note of the meeting held at the ground
on 7 August.    A copy of ay letter to David Vaughan vas sent
to you the same day so that our letters have crossed in the
post.
      You will see that Z have taken up very strongly the
suggestion by Don Sheriff that the workmanship in the brickwork
was poor and would lead to weakness. Zt is unfortunate that
David Vaughan did not record that I had completely refuted
what Don Sheriff said.    David now recognises that this was a
mistake but iV putting the matter right by circulating a copy
of my letter.
      Turning to the matters on the second pagei-
•It was agreed"
My comments on the points you have in mind are as follows «-
(b)   This refers to the existing gate between the new 2m wide
      gap formed by the radial fence which will be used for
      police access only.   You will notice from the wording
      of David's minute that Z persuaded that that steps could
                                                                     2.




          be used.   I have Interpreted   this as being from
          the Inside only which means that we will not lose
          any of your advertising space.   We have added the
          provision of some timber steps on the inside to
          the work being carried by Gleeson.


C   (c)   The other radial fence forming the small visitors
          pen has left a length of terrace without a direct
          access on to the pitch. There is of course a gate
          at the top of the terrace connecting into the next
          pen and we had hoped that the police would accept
          that as an adequate means of exit in emergency.
          However at the meeting they made the point very
          strongly that if someone had to be got out of the pen
          which has no gate or if there was misbehaviour the
          police would only be able to get in via the neighbouring
          pen, passing up the terrace through the gate at the
          back and then down again in the Isolated pen. They
          considered this unacceptable.   Z think that this
          particular item can be paid for out of the contingency
          sum and suggest that it be added to Gleason's work.

    (d)   You will recall that when you and Z went round with
          Superintendent John Freeman he pointed out that the
          advertising hoardings on the parapet of the seating
          area of the West stand were simply hookid over the
          parapet wall and some of the hooks had been bent*
          We agreed that a fixing would be provided* Be had
          apparently reported this to David Vaughan so the
          matter n s raised again* Zt is clearly a good point
          because any hooligans in the seated area could easily
          drop an advertising board on to people below*    Z have
          in mind that the hoardings can be fixed by a runner
          of timber and again subject to your approval, this
          can be carried out as part of the present works*

                                  1€»M-
(e)   This is a very minor matter which can be dealt with
      next year.

(£)   You will probably know that the bases of the steel columns
      behind the Nest stand have bemn queried year by year
      by Don Sheriff who has requested that exaavations be
      carried outto ensure fchat the steel is not rusting
      below ground level.    By chance Gleesons had exposed
      one of the columns and I was interested to see that it has
      not suffered badly.    However X have pointed out that the
      columns do not carry any load.    They form part of the
      previous structure and were chopped down to that level
      when the new concrete stand was built for the World
      Cup.   They merely form a frame within which the brick
      wall is built. There is therefore no cause for concern.
      At the next meeting in February I will try to get this
      item deleted from the list.



      Quite a number of items have now been added at Police
request. In addition there is the cost of the new gas main
and also unexpected costs in connection with the electricity
supply to the new refreshment area in the North West corner.
Z am asking John Strange to check on all these items to see
whether they can be accommodated within the contingency sum
which we included in Gleesons contract. Z^am Ion holiday but
John wirlL^e^^gggilS^^S^^ next week.

                      Yours sincerely,

Corderoy k Co.,                                  26 September, 1985
2A, New Walk,
LEICESTER LEI 6TF.

For the attention of Mr. M.P. Robina.

Dear Mr. Robins,
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Clob pic
                  Seorecration work at Lepplnos Lane
     The segregation of supporters at the Leppings Lane
end of the ground was first proposed some tine before
September 1981. We do not know the exact date but the
original request that schemes be looked at was made by
South Yorkshire Police in the days when Mr* England was
the Club Secretary* Some rough outline shbestes were
prepared at that time but the work did not proceed.
     Zn February this year the natter was raised again
and more schemes devised. Approval of a schwas was
given by SYCC in May. Shortly after that another, such
less expensive scheme was put forward. After agreeing
several natters of detail with SYCC and the Club#
construction work eventually started on 22 Jttly# 1985.
The work is now almost complete.
     Enclosed are copies of the following documents
relating to the segregation work»-
     a)   Our letter dated 9 April,to SYCC.
                                                                    2




          b) Their reply dated 2 Hay,
          c) Our letter dated 8 May to SYCC.
          d) Their reply dated 10 May.
          e) Our report on the tenders received forthe work
             dated 12 July.
          f) A filled in copy of the relevantpages of the
             Bill of Quantities received from Gleeson
             SBfceffield) Ltd.
C         The scheme involved the alteration of existing toilets,
 ^   the provision of new ladies toilets and refreshment
     facilities because segregating walls prevented access to t
     the existing toilets and refreshment bars by either the
     home or visiting spectators.
          Also Included in the Contract were various items of
     ground safety work. These are items 6 and 8, page 7/1 of
     the Bill of Quantities* items 1 to 4, page 8/1 for the
     repair of barriers on Spion Kop which failed the load test
     earlier this year and items 1 to 3, page 9/1.
          Enclosed are copies of the following documents
     relating to that safety work:-

       Note of a Meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield
                        on 22nd January, 1986

PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

           Dr. W. Eastvood (Messrs. Eastwood A Partners)
           R. Ward (Groundsman)            !               ~'   "'',L

           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
           R. Woodhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)*

1.    Welcome and Introduction

Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish
the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)
on 31st March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986, the Certificating Authority und»r
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
Council. In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it had been suggested to the
City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
Surveyors’ Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed and introduced to the
remainder of the representatives present.

Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties since 1978. piere
had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation
had occurred but, in the main, these had been resolved both amicably and
constructively.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his services and wished
him well for the future. Other representatives endorsed Dr. Eastwood's
remarks.

2.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded with the letter
dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
to carry out the "winter” inspection of the Stadium.

A.    Development Proposals for the Spion Kop

The further details were in addition to the comments set out in the letter
dated 29th November, 1985, on the observations made following the Officer
Working Party meeting held on 13th November.
      (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face

      Dr. Eastvood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at
      the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
      sealed. In reply to queries from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
      that no storage would*be allowed under the structure and that checks
      for any accumulations of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis.

      Cii)   Climbing of the .Inner Steel Frame

      As regards the possiblity of unruly spectators climbing the inner steel
      frame of the new structure, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boom jp
      member was now to be omitted. The resultant height of ove£ 10 feet
      would make it very difficult for spectators to climb the structure.

      (iii) New Step and Barrier Layout

      Drawing No. 6648/56 was circulated and considered. This related to the
      new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
      in particular on the discussions which he' had had with the Planning
      Authority as to the height of      an intermediate or a low second rail to
      the barriers where the drop to the gangway below could be over one metre
      in places. He sought the Officer Vorking Party's view*K and the merits
      of the options were considered.                        •

I     IT HAS AGREED that, in the view of the Officer Working Party, the best
      option for a second rail in the areas described was a low toe rail at
V.    a height of some 200 on.

B.    Facilities for the Disabled

To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) were not
unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
 (opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He still considered
that any such proposals would involve the loss of up to'1,000 of the extra
5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
Other areas of the Stadium had also       been considered and investigated, but
none could provide as large a flat,       easily accessible area as that in frontof
the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major
problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area. The only
major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North
Stand extending virtually to the pitch. For this reason, the Club were willing
to roof an area from approximately the letter "0" on the results board to the
end of the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) with a substantial roof, including
armoured glass where there might be a visibility problem, provided that this
was supported by the Officer Working Party.

Whilst accepting much of what Dr. Eastwood said, the Officer Working Party
(and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed some concern as
to whether making semi-permanent facilities for the disabled in front of the
North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly apply to the roofing of the
enlarged Spion Kop.




                                       (1 2 -
IT VAS AGREED that, in Che first instance* Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
plans of the. suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

C.    Ground Inspection
      (i)   West Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area *
of the stand could be moved within certain limits if the Police considered
that this would achieve a useful purpose.

IT WAS AGREED

  (a)  that the additional advertisement hoardings at the front of the upper
 seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
•
 fixed to concrete wall;

(b)   that further areas- of spalled concrete at the front of the upper
seated stand area should received'attention as matters of maintenance.

      (ii)   North-West Terrace

IT WAS AGREED that the advertisement hoardings erected on the upper North-
West Terrace should be securely fixed.

      (iii) North Stand

The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

As previously mentioned by Dr. Eastwood', the possibility of providing an
increased width access to the pitch area (between the North Stand and the
Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
by the Club was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into the
enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.

It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
was not essential for their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

      (iv)   Spion Kop

Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
roofed, Spion Kop, and confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
unauthorised access to areas where work night be in progress during the
course of t
          the
            h V season.

l£ was' no ted th at the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the
front corner nearest to tne South Stand, with a stepped arrangement «.o
assist access and egress, had been provided.

      (v)    South Stand

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
solution to the flamnability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

    ^ . H . Chester Esq.,                               14 July 1986
      Secretary,
      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC,
      Hillsborough,
      Sheffield,
      S6 1SW.

     Dear Dick,
                  Home Office Document on Fire Safety and
                        Safety at Sports Venuee
            Z have read through the part of the document which deals
   with Sports Grounds. Z do not see any grounds for objecting to
   any of the recommendations. There will be little if any change in
Q the procedure already established at Hillsborough. The document
 ^envisages that far more grounds for various sports will be designated
   but in appropriate circumstances the procedures will not be so
   onerous as those relating to Hillsborough. However, as it is a
   •top' ground we cannot expect that there will be much relaxation
   compared with the present Arrangements.
            There is a welcome statement on page 11 that due account
   vhould be taken of the need to keep the costs to clubs and local
   authorities to reasonable proportions* There are also various
   references to Safety Certificates reflecting the circumstances of
   each particular ground and the number of spectators who are likely
   to attend (see page 14).   These words may be useful to us in the
   future, although we can expect to have more stringent requirements
   compared with some of the smaller clubs.
            Zt is comforting to know that the new Green Guide will not
   become a statutory code, and will continue to be subject to

                                        HH-
interpretation.
         The reference to prohibition notices by either the fire
authority or the local authority on page 19 may cause concern to
some clubs. But in paragraph 2.38 on page 20 there is a clear
implication that it is only necessary to reduce the risk to
an acceptable level, rather than trying to remove all risk. This
wording will help curb excessive demands, and may be useful to
us sometimes in negotiations.
         I am returning the document herewith.

                         Yours sincerely,

  Dear Sir,

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

 In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to consent on the
 condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
 have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
 received them as yet.

 The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
 with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
 receive is very satisfactory.

 The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
 information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
 letter have now been further clarified as follows:-

 (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
 from the walkways.

 (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
 dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

 (c) Gates oust be unlocked and stewarded at all tlaes, during matches: if this
 cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

 I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
 particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
 exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
 the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
 their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
 Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) toshow a
 better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
 outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
 type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
 current locks, about which they are very concerned.

 Encs.

)(     For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bovmes


       Dear Sir,

       SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

       Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
       Club.

       Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

       An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986.        The
       comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
       individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
       it is assumed tnat from previous correspondence and documentation that the
^      various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

/^     MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

       North Stand

       Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

       The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7.S.35
       in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

      There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
      with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
      ment of these buildings.

       Soion Kop

      A.     Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit route has not
             received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
             installation, this should be removed immediately.
                                                        «

       B.    It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
             part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten

                                                            IS2-
                                AII                K© a^faeea^ ♦,*                      rstl.^op
     with barrel bolts secured to the gate both top and bot'tco and open in
     a sideways direction.    It is doubtful that if it wers necessary to
     evacuate* the stand onto the pitch in an emergency that the gates would
     open if pressure were generated by a crowd.      No record can be found
     in respect of ^discussion on gate fastenings.     It is recommended that
     a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch side should
     be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

C.   During the inspection it was observed that several concrete steps on
      the lower terracing were in need of repair and in one case the complete
      step had erroded away.   Every endeavour should be undertaken to ensure
      that all steps are kept in a good state of repair.

D.   The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
      climbed is ineffective.  It has been   observed that patrons visiting
      the Kop can, in large numbers from the back of the Kop, climb into the
      lower half of the roof. The mesh should be extended to alleviate this,
      situation.

     It was observed     that where the terracing is above 1 m higher than the
     lateral gangways     wire mesh infill had not been located along t^ full
     lengths.   Where    the mesh had been provided this had been spot waided
     but the mesh had    not been given an additional vertical support.

F.   Exit gates should be unlocked and keys held by stewards manning the
      gate before patrons enter the stands.

West Stand

A.   Timber framed and clad units located under this stand have been there
     for some considerable time. No record exists of:-

     (1 ) acceptance of these units or,

     (2 )    that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions.

     Exit gates to the pitch perimeter as item E under Spian Kop a&ove.

South Stand

The accommodation is divided into four areas:-

A.   Ground floor offices,     directors suite, players area,     function suite,
      kitchen etc.

B.   First floor, upper stand walkway, press lounge, players lounge, paint
      stores, disused bar area.

C.   Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

D.   Rear stand, covered seating.

With respect to the four areas, the following observations are made:-

A.   Ground Floor:-

         (i)    During normal working hours most doors from the office area
                are kept locked shut.   All doors marked 'Fire Exit' should
                be made readily available for use b y j m y person within the area.
  (11)   A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
         and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
         fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
         also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
         by corrugated, lightweight plastic sheeting.

         The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
         should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
         requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

 (iii)   All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
         areas always maintained free from such storage.

First Floor

   (i)   Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
         the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint.
         store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
         should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

  (ii)   Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
         five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
         off should an emergency arise.

 (iii)   All timber construction within this area     should   be suitably
         treated so as to be flame retardant.

  (iv)   The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
         mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
         be removed from this area.     Proposals to relocate the stores
         should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
         is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
         licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

   (v)   The timber constructed cupboard and the portable sales kiosks
         should be removed from this area.

  (vi)   In the cleaners' cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
         separation between the ground and first floor levels is breached
         by the passage of cables through a wall.    The area around the
         cables should be infilled with material to ensure a minimum
         fire resistance of thirty minutes.

 (vii)   All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
         it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
         being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
         rebates.

(viii)   Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
         purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

Uncovered Seating Area:-

The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having the
ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter track.
This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
to 1 m high at the West end.
       To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch 'it is recommended
       that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

D.     Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand):-

       The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
       in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
       areas described in A and B above.

       Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
       later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the
       means of escape from the covered seating area would be acceptable.

AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection
in the South Stand.

 j.t is recommended that such provision should be made in all areas beneath
      seated area of the stand as soon as possible.   The system should also
   ver the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corridor
 of the South Stand.

The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
system.

 In order that persons using the Spion Kop can receive early warning of any
 fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
 fire detection be provided in that Club.

 EMERGENCY LIGHTING

Spion Kop

The emergency lighting has yet to be tested - no test certificate received.

 iouth, North and West Stands

( h letter dated 12th November, 1980, from Eastwood and Partners, it was
 suggested that following test certificates dated 11th August, 1980, a period
 of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand and 2 years for
 North and West Stands. As of today no record appears to exist as to whether
 these areas have been re-tested or that the test certificates together with
 maintenance records have ever been re-presented.     The emergency lighting
 system should therefore be re-tested for the whole of the ground and test
 certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should conform
 to B.S. 5266.

FIRE ALARM

West Stand

Existing call points to be relocated to accessible positions outside of
franchise areas and be increased to cover the upper areas of the stand.

North Stand

As West Stand above.
/                                       - 5 -


    South Stand
    This stand appears to be veil covered with regard to the provision and siting
    of call points.   %

    Indicator Control Panel

    The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
    between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match days it
    is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

    This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
    be: -

    1.   Police control box

    2.   Main office reception area

    FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT

^fche current standard and displacement of First Aid fire-fighting equipment
     considered satisfactory.

    GATES

   The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
   Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
   and the fact that they are of existing construction.     I would wish, however,
   to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
   means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
   given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
   replaced then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
   structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths.
   While the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail­
   able for use from the inside by any person should an emergency situation
   arise. Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the outside
  must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
   additional security being afforded by the presence of a steward who should
^^be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

    If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact
    the Officer concerned.

    Yours faithfully,




    Divisional Command^

   Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Gate Release Devices

   I refer to your letter of 19th August and the enclosed plans of a proposed gate
   release device.

   The proposed device has been discussed by the various Authorities at some length
   and it has now been suggested thatjfoerhapsa prototype device could be fabricated
   and fitted to one of the gates for testing purposes. It has also been mentioned
   that with some modifications the proposed device could also be used for the
   sliding gates at Sheffield United Football Club.

   I look forward to hearing from you with your coanents on this matter.

   Yours faithfully,
   .              _________

          MADE BY:                              Enerpac


          DESCRIPTION:                          One hydraulic pump complete with two hydraulic cylinders.
                                                The force on the cylinders, under an applied force is
                                                measured by a pressure gauge mounted on the pump.


          IDENTIFICATION:                       Pump: D948005
                                                Gauge: BGF 168 SR
                                                Cylinder 1: 04773                   Model RC 53AF9N

          METHOD

          The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0*5 lever arm testing machine                                                  in
          terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                                of
          the forces applied during the calibration is +0»5%»

          Three tests were made on each cylinder.

          Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

    For the attention of Mr. 0. Mackrell


    Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                         Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                              Barrier Testing 1988

         Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
    part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
    The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
    128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
    the lower area of terracfat t^ie Leppings Lane end of the ground.
    The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
^ 1 6 1 0 / 6 4 E , a print of which is enclosed.
             The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
     procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
    Grounds* •
         Zn all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
    withstood the applied load. A clip over the rail of barrier 124
    broke before reaching the full test load.
         Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
    that sane of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
    tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those t sted on the
    Lappings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
    load.




                                        0   _O(o
                                                                          2


         The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
    replaced now. There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
    barrier 144, when tested, and we also recommend that that rail
    is also replaced.
         As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
    be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
    the start of the coming season.
         Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
    results of the barrier tests.



                                    Yours sincerely,

♦                                      I- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1

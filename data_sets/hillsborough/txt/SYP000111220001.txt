               1.30 pm       Moderate          fljpw of fans going thro u g h to West S t a n d and

                                               turnstiles         for N o r t h Stand,          fans        forming

                             queues,         no    problems,        Several        cans taken from Liverpool
fans,      mainly       soft drLrfks,         before      entry      into ground.

I noted that            plastic bin half               full at this        stage.

L arge     influx       of L i v erpool       fans,      b o isterous an d m any

smelled of intoxicants,                    some with o u t       tickets want i n g

to    pay at turnstiles.                These         fans were turned away

by me at the turnstile.                     Fans g r a d u a l l y    pushing and

s w a rming ar o u n d turnstiles,                no orde r l y queues.          I saw

several         fans    begin to       climbvonto         the blue metal

scr e e n i n g      that separates West S tand t urnstiles                      15 and

16 from L e p pings Lane t e r r a c e turnstiles.                        One youth

in particular            in m a r o o n / m a u v e    jumper    stood on screening

an d began           playing to the         crowd below.             He   ignored Police

request         to    climb down and he was               then joined by other

Li v e r p o o l     fans who     climbed onto the sc r e e n i n g from

the L e p p i n g s Lane terrace              side.       These      fans then      climbed

from the top of the screening and over the t u rnstiles

wal/l .      I noted that          1 empty milk           bottle was t h r o w n and this
 /
smas h e d on the ground.                  I could hear          banging     on the

blue s c reening          from the terrace               side.       T o g ether w ith

push our way thro u g h the                 crowd and m a n a g e d to shut           one

half      of a metal        railed gate that              leads onto turn s t i l e s

9 to *16, in order to ease                    congestion ar o u n d the          turnstile

area,      we were also a s s i s t e d b y a m o u n t e d officer,                 but

the gates were            pushed open by the sheer weight                      of the

mass and this further                  congested the turnstile area

9 to      16.

D i r e c t e d to go      inside the ground and then onto                     the    pitch

and    I began ass i s t i n g         fans from the L e p pings Lane                terrace

who    had      climbed onto         the    pitch.        A few minu t e s      later      I

was    re-dep l o y e d to stand       in line on the          centre     line of

the    pitch facing      the L e p pings Lane goal.                S h o r t l y after

I was    r e-deployed a gain and            I went     through the        players

tunnel    w i t h several     other       officers,      thro u g h the building

and then ar o u n d the       back of the entrance              tunnel     w hich

gives access       to the     pen are a of the L e p pings Lane

centre    terrace.       T o g ether wit h PC         1171 H o r s e f i e l d we

began to move fans          back     thro u g h tunnel,        I saw that many

were    injured    in the tunnel          area.       I then m o v e d    into the

pen a r e a and saw a crush barrier                  twisted a n d d i s torted

and about 7 or S steps down                 I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 or

so bodies,      laid on top of each other,                  I noted that

there was      not muc h blood about            these bodies a n d their

faces a n d    lips were      blue.       Whilst      I was a s s i s t i n g   one

fan who     had diffi c u l t y breathing,            and whilst       I was

placing     him in the       recovery       position,       near    to the

collapsed      crush barrier,          I noted that         1 empty      brown beer

bottle was      thrown down from above                the West Stand.            This

bottle    n a r rowly m i s s e d   the    injured male L i v erpool            f a n ’s

head.     M a n y of the spect a t o r s      from above        the West S tand

were    con t i n u o u s l y shouting     out abuse,       direc t e d at the

Police    officers,      whilst      I carried one y o u t h w i t h a leg

injury and a s s i s t e d by 3 fans           through the         tunnel,      I was

ki c k e d on the shins an d ankles             by bystanders          in the tunnel

who also ye l l e d abuse at me.               I did not sust a i n any

i njury other      than minor        bruising        to the shins.          Later      I

worked     in the amb u l a n c e    rec e p t i o n area behind Leppings

Further to my statement of 15th April 1989.


I can say that when entering Pen 3 on the Leppings Lane terraces
approaching from the tunnel I saw a broken barrier and on looking at
a detailed plan of that terrace I saw my first body in an area marked
06 on the grid.   This was to the right of the barrier as I approached.
Between that body and the perimeter fence     I saw about 20 more bodies,
these bodies were slightly to the right of the damaged barrier.      The
bodies were laid parallel to the perimeter fence.
On my arrival in the pen I saw that the perimeter gate was open and
bodies were being removed from the pen onto the playing area.

                       Manchester across the Pennines and down to Sheffield.                                 We only had

                       about    15 minutes or so delay caused by roadworks on one of the roads

                       traffic.    » \Ay had jto need of directions as we made our way.                              We got

             Cj\       outside tl                         about 2 . 15pm (1415 hr s).           There was only

                       around the entrance as ifytfmiting for mates.                  There was certainly no

                       sign of any crush.         Wj/en I arrived at the turnstiles the r# was a

                       getting intoNTne ground.             I gave up my ticket at the turnstile in

                       the normal way.        We went to the cafe serving hatch on the «ide of

                       West Stand and had some chips.              We stood in tj>e vicinity of the

                       tunnel w h i 1st we ate them.           There was no ^»fgn of any stewards to

ground.       I d i d n ’t see any gate other than the turnstiles open at

that time.        When I first got to the turnstile 1 did see the

concertina gate to my left, open siightly from the inside and a man

walked o u t .     The gate closed behind him.           I d i d n ’t think anything

of it at the time I didn't take any notice of the man.                  Whilst

waiting to take up our match           viewing position.       Ididn't see    any

sign of disorder.          I didn't    see any alcohol being     drunk in the

ground.       We took up our viewing at about 2.20pm (142©hrs)» me and

           walked through t.ha             into pen 3.      We^Ttopped at about

point 1 which is &H on the grid map.              The corner two lads we were

with had tickets for another section of j ^ o u n d and we split up.                  At

the time we walked in it was           quite cjffwded, but we    could move about

quite freely.         As time wen V    by y0'' pen was getting more full we were

gradually moving to our right and moved to 6F on the grid plan.

There was a crowd barrier in front of me at this point.                   We were

about in the middle of this barrier.                       was standing on my

right.       It gradually got very bad in t h e r e at about 2.45pm (1445).

There was quite a crush all round us.              It was getting difficult to

breath.       We managed to jostle a little space and ducked under the

barrier.        So we wouldn't get crushed against it.            As we got to the

front of this barrier it was getting so tight you couldn't move at

all.       It was just a solid mass of people.           At about 2.55pm <

1455 hr s) people were beginning to panic.            The crtmh was getting very

  d.       A m a n jajjj^MMrFedT between me and       ~he~~>»ad fallen against the

maiv had his throat pressed against the barrier I coula only see his

head.       He had long blonde hai r , to his sho u ld er s. y/' It looked

permt                grabbed                                 y attention.        He

gri pped                  ightly                            Both me and

    the barrier we just couldn't turn aroumt-^eTfough to help hi®.                  W#

    felt so helpless,     there were so^iwgfny people in d i st re ss .     Round

    about 3 o ’clock <1500 hrjt^the crush got even wo r s e .          It felt Hire a

    sudden surge m±3Ll00j<f€t a slow build up of pressure.          We were forced

    towards the left then I didn't see anymore of the man w e were trying

    to help.     All I can remember was he was wearing a           blue s h i r t .

    People were screaming at the police to           open the gates at the front of

    the pens     but they d i d n ’t seem to take    any notice.      I don't know

    whether they were too shocked or what but just d i d n ’t seem to be

    reacting       After a while I was aware of people getting onto the

    pitcy by trying to climb over the front fence.             By this time I was

    getting really distressed the man behind me offered to give me a le<g

     p although I couldn’t get my leg up enough for me to be lifted.                       He

    then seamed to grab me by my jeans and           the scruff of my neck and

    bodiljp lift me up.       The crowd packed tight at that time and I was

    hel^f by my ankles by the pressure although 1 was standing high above

          other spectators.        As the crowd seempd to relax I fell forward 1

     as   lying face    down over their headsf      I know a man punched       me in my

    right side near my b a c k .    I kickjro out   at him which made me       go

    forward and I fell almost h e a c ^ i r s t   into the entrance of the

    perimeter gate,     the gate w a y open at this time and a policeman

    ^dragged me onto the pitch^f       The game had definitely been stopped by

    the time I     was or^the aftch.       I was in a complete daze when X was             on
*
    the pitch.         I knouMfrtjured people were being assisted but I was in

    no shape to help anyone.          After a while a policewoman guided me off

    the pitch onto Section A of the terraces.            There was total      chaos

    surrounding this incident.         I heard an announcement over the

    loudspeaker saying the match was void.           I d i d n ’t have a clue what

    time it was when I le ft .       I was worried about            I couldn’t find

             him an y w h e r e .   Luckily all of us met up at the car later on*   I think

             the barrier we stood by must have been the one that broke that they

             have mentioned on television.           If it was the same one I certainly

             d i d n ’t hear it break or even knew one had broken until     later in the

             evening.

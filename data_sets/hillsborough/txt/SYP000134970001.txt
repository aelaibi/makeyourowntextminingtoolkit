                                                          WARRINGTON

                                                          19 April     1989

Dear S i r ,
                  Havin g been a s p e c t a t or at the H i l l s b o r o u g h grou nd (Leppings
Lan e terraces) on the day of the FA cup match betwe en Liverpool and
N o t t i n g h a m Forest on 15 April 1989 I feel I should wr it e to you
ou tl in in g the the a rea s w h e r e I b e l i e v e s e r i o u s e r r o r s of ju dgement
wer e made.

1. After pa ssi ng t hr ou gh the t u r n s t i l e s at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 14.10. It was
my belief that the only e n t r a n c e to the te r r a ci ng was th rou gh the
tunnel leading to the en c l o s u r e d i r e c t l y be hi n d the goal. T he re were
no s te wa rd s or polic eme n givi ng d i r e c t i o n s to any of the other
en tr an ce s and th ere we re no signs on wa lls to give instruction.

2. The e nt ra nc e of the tunnel onto the t e r r a c e s was c o n g es te d when we
arrive d so I moved to the right and ended up ag a i n s t the r a i 1 ing which
ran fro m the stand at the back to the wire n e tti ng at the front of the
go al mou th terrace. The w ho le te rr ac e filled to c a p a c i t y ve ry qu ick ly
with many s u p p o r t e r s at te m pt i ng to a spread out along the terrace, not
real isi ng that th er e was a fen ce in the w a y untill they we r e very
c lo se to it. At this point most su pp or t e r s gave up, as I had done and
re mai ned by the fence.                    .
By 14.30 the are a behin d the goal was e x t r e m e l y co ng es te d any mov em en t
in the crowd re su lt in g in i n di vi du al s being squeezed. At no time did I
see any at te mp t by p o l i c e of f i c e r s or s t ew ar ds to check on the nu mbe rs
of fans beh in d the goal. Ne th e r did I see any at tem pt being made to
divert fans to the te rr a c e to the right of the fen ce which was still
r e l a t i v e l y uncongested.

4. By 14.35 I was most u n c o m f o r t a b l e as a resu lt of t h e ' c on st an t
pr e s s u r e fr o m the crowd. Lo oki ng behind me I saw a small gate open at
the top of the railing u n d e r n e a t h the stand. I pus he d my way to the
gate and entere d the e n c l o s u r e to the right of the goal.           This gate
did not appe ar to be sig np os te d and could not be seen by a n y b o d y apart
fr om the fa ns sta nding right next to the fence.

5. As the dis as te r unf ol de d it b e ca me ob vi o u s that the p o l i c e fo rce
we re acting in a t o t a l l y d i s o r g a n i s e d fashion. Of f i c e r s and fans
worke d well as i n d iv id ua ls but g ro up s of of f i c e r s a p pe ar ed to stand
aro und doing ver y little, waitin g for ord er s which wer e o b v i o u s l y not
forthcoming. This was in co m p l e t e con tr as t to the d i s c i p l i n e and
o rg a n i s a t i o n of the fire se r v i c e who moved around the pitch in a
purposeful ma nn ne r and who we r e o b v i o u s l y under the control of a
senior officer. The only tim e the p o li ce f o r c e app ea re d to act in a
co or d i n a t e d fashio n was in ar re sti ng the c h ar ge of so me Liverpoool
fans after taun ts fro m N o t t i n h a m Forest su pp or t e r s o b v i o u s l y un aw ar e
of the g r a v i t y of the situation.

6. No at te m p t w a s ' m a d e to c o m m u n i c a t e with the crowd.    Exc ep t for a


                                             PAGE   1
request for fans to leave the pitch.

7. Very few         st r et c h e r s seemed    to be a v a i l a b l e for t r a n s p o r t i n g   the
injured.



Can I sugges t the f o l l o w i ng c ha ng es to the way football                      g am es are
organi s e d :-

                   - For games to be played on neutral gr oun ds all fa cto rs
should be c a r e f u l l y w e i g h e d when de ci din g which end a set of
s u p p o r t e r s should be allocated. For e x a m p l e the r e l a t i v e size of cro wd
att e n d i ng home m at ch e s should be given a hig he r we i g h t i n g than
i n co nv en ie nc e in o r g an i s i n g the arrival of fa n s at grounds.

                  - On en ter in g g r o u n d s fans must be given clear in st ru c t i o n s
about whe re they should go. Th es e i n s t r u c ti on s should be verbal (given
by police and stewards) and back ed up by wr itt en n o t i c e s . T h i s is
es pe s c i a l l y im po rta nt for fans tra ve ll in g away fro m home.

                    - Pol ic e and st e w a r d s shou ld c o n s t a n t l y monito r crowd
s i s e s / m o v e m e n t s for any sign of d ev el op in g problems. Pol ic e and
st e w a r d s shou ld by traine d to watch for any tell tale signs; such as
ge nu in e and ob vi ou s di s t r e s s shown by fans etc. Use of t e l e v i s io n
c a m e r a s / c o m p u t e r s alo ne are not sufficient.

          - Both the fe nci ng at the front and at the side of t e r r a c es
should be re mov ed fro m all grounds.

               - All    e xi ts should be c l e a r l y mark ed and            illuminated.

                    - Senior pol ic e o f f i c e r s should re ce iv e more tra ini ng in
coping with and di re ct in g their men during major d i s a s t e r s with la rge
nu mb er s of dying and injured as op pos ed to dealin g with major
d i s t u r b a n c e s (eg' r i o t s ) .

                   - C o m m u n i c a t i o n s need to be improved, both betwee n p o l i c e
o f fi ce rs insi de and ou t s i d e the gro un d and betwe en the a u t h o r i t i e s and
s u p p o r t e r s via a good qualit y public ad dr e s s system.

                    - More medical fa ci l i t i e s shoul d be made e a si ly av a i l a b l e at
grounds. C h a r i t a b l e in s t i t u t i o n s such as the S t . J o h n ' s A m b u l a n c e
Br ig ad e s h ou ld not be exp ec te d to pr ov i d e all the medical
f a c i l i t i e s / e x p e r t i s e n e c c e s s a r y dur in g football m a t c h e s a t t e nd ed by
large nu mb e r s of fans.


                                 Yours Faithfully,

                                      At 2.58pm (1438)      this date walked down Herries Road towards the

                                      ground in company with the rest of my s e r i a l , with a view ter taking a

                                      meal after the start of the game.         Noticed that several fans were

                                      still walking towards the ground,         no trouble from any of the fans,

                                      some of whom we r e using tax is to travel down to the ground.

                                      At 3.05 p m1*(1505) this date ordered into the ground by a S e n i o r

                                      Officer who was on duty outside Penistone Road, Hop end,         identity of
of f i cSr not known-       I entered the ground with the rest of my ser ial

and other officers,,        informed that there was trouble from the crowd at

the Lappings Lane end and that they were invading the field.                                   Once in

the ground and onto the playing field I made my way over to the

Leppings Lane end.          At this time the players were just leaving the

fiejd.     I could tee® several supporters were climbing over the crowd

barrier of Lappings Lane.

Gn arrival at Leppings Lane end saw that the supporters were squashed

up against the fence and          that they were obviously being crushed by

the sheer number of fans          behind them.     Iassisted other officers                             in

removing fans from a small gate situated to the righthand side of the

goal    posts.    The fans coming out of this gate appeared all alive at

first although they were gasping for breath and some required first

aid.     I took serial fans from the gate and into the open space of the

playing field, all seemed to recover quickly once out of the cr^sh.

It was obvious that the small gate was not releasing tha prSssurS sti,

the people       in front of the fence.        I could see that there appeared t*

be people collapsing due          to the pressure of the r e s t ^ f the Crowd,                                  1

shouted to the people at          the back of the crowd to move                           but thisr
                                                                                     .

was met by       abuse,    the pushing did not stop although there seimed to

be room at       the rear and sides of the crowd.

I could see that there was one man behind the fence who appeared to

me to- be obviously dead, he was yellow and he had failed down,f his

eyes were still open,         people were trying to help him but there was no

room.     The    only way to get to this man was to rip down the                         periineter

fence.     In    company with P C .2523 Burrows other officers an d                      supporters

I ripped open a section of fenci ng di rectly in front of the rtian, he

was passed out through the fVnce and w i t h other^ I carried him onto

the playing field.          Mouth to mouth resuscitation an d^ h eart^ma^s.^ff^

was given by a first aid^fc|ilf£;but the man d i d o ’t come                       round.               An

ambulance arrived behind the goal posts and this man's body was placed in

the rear of the vehicle and left with one of the vehicle's crew.                        I could

see   that   several       other    fans still needed pulling out of the crowd,               in

company with Police Constable Burrows and other officers, I assisted with

the rescue of fans.

In    company     with    DC Burrows      and PC    1513   Reeves   and some   supporters,     I

carried one of the dead bodies from the playing area into the gym.                           The

body was carried on an advertising board which had been ripped from the

ground.      PC Reeves stayed with the body once it was placed in the gym.

I returned        to the playing         field,    there were many distressed and angry

supporters.        In company with PC Burrows and other officers I was ordered

to form a cordon across the centre line of the field.                          Remained there

until     later    told    to supervise      Notts.    Forest   fans   leaving    the   ground.

After the fans had left the ground I returned to the North stand and re­

grouped with my serial and Inspector Bateman.

I then went        to Claywheels         Lane and with other members       of my serial we

travelled to Barnsley Hospital for reception of 28 bodies.                       On arrival at

the hospital informed that these bodies had been re-directed to another

location     so    I     returned   to    Claywheels    Lane,   from   there   transport     was

arranged to convey me and other officers back to Rawmarsh.

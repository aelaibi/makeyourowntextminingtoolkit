PHOTO CALL AND BRIEFING BY LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH

I have today ( W ednesday 9 J u ly ) met Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and agreed with him a              J\,
media handling plan, the essential elements o f which are:

Monday 14 July - Lord J S-S to be photographed and filmed at his Home Office desk, f                       *J   f
followed by a few short remarks to Home Affairs correspondents and selected regional                            |
media. He will use this occasion to say he is starting the Hillsborough scrutiny that day, how                  ^ |/j
he will receive submissions and underlining that he will not be holding public sessions. W ith                  <J !
one exception, this is the only occasion on which he will be available to the media.                                    4#|

October - date to be agreed, the judge will meet relatives and their representatives in
Liverpool. We are considering how to manage this with the media, to prevent the judge being
doorstepped. The likelihood is an arranged photo call with the relatives, at which the judge at
least will say nothing.

Generally the judge is content for CD to have a standard line to take if the media ask us or
him to respond to comments made by those who make submissions to him. This line, which
will be cleared shortly with you ( Home Secretary ) and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will
basically refuse to comment on what is being said but reiterate that material has been
submitted and neither we nor the judge will be commenting on it.

There is one other issue, o f which you need to be aware. The judge’s view is that the
submissions will not be made public and all he will submit to you will be his report. This
could be seen to be at variance with your own comments ia-the Hous.e_lfaatJhcjadden.ee will
be published. You may want to speak to the judge about this.

CD’s view is that by arranging filming and off-camera opening remarks from the judge we
can manage the media and avoid damaging stories about secrecy. It also seems vital that we
do not lose control o f the media in Liverpool at the time o f the judge’s visit. I have assured
him that however private he may think the visit, the media will find out.

We will issue an operational note to national, Yorkshire and Merseyside media on Friday 11
July inviting them to film/meet the judge at QAG at 10am on Monday 14 July.

Are you content with these arrangements?

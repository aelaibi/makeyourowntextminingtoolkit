 RE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER -                               15 APRIL 1989

 I have previously written to you concerning the investigation into the
 Hillsborough disaster and perhaps now is an appropriate time to update you.

 We are currently investigating all possible criminal action that may have
 been committed under the guidance of the Director of Public Prosecutions
 and the supervision of the Police Complaints Authority.

  The extent of this investigation will undoubtably result in a delay in the
  inquests starting.  I am not in a position to give you any firm date when
  the inquests will commence.

  You will of course be informed of future developments but if you have any
  queries please contact my officers at Nechells Green Police Station,
  021-359-5555 extension 246.

  Yours sincerely

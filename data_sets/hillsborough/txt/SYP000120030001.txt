All    quiet         on a r r i v a l ,           but     a     large        amount          of L i v e r p o o l        supporters               in

the    excess         of    '150 sat              on the          grass          banking          outside        shops        drinking

from     the        cans,      they          were        noisy,         but       caused, no            real     problems..                We     then

returned         to      our    position                 at     the Station,,                 Whilst        walking           down         the

shirt.         With      them       was        one       sma l l       boy.            They    were       carrying           a   fold           up

s to o l .     We      advised               them        that        they w o u l d          probably           not      be a l l o w e d in

with     this        stool.             They       said         they        had    only        taken       t hi s     to    the       game        so

the    little         lad      could          see        o n to      th e    pit ch ,        and       they a gr e e d        to      take        it

By    t hi s    t i me     I saw         large           numbers            of    Liverpool             supporters            m a k i ng        their

way    down      the       main         road,          carrying             packs       of     b e er    and     lager.            They were

very     boisterous             s h o u t i ng a n d              singing.

I noticed           one     youth            in    particular                about          18-19       years       about        5*9"          tally

heavily         built       wearing               Union Jack                shorts,          was       singing        louder          than

anyone         around       him.             He    definitely                appeared             worse     for       drink.           His

mates        appeared          to       be    telling             him       to    keep       quiet.         They         then      moved          on

down      the     main       road.

I then heard a message                          over       the     radio           "Assistance            required         outside

th e    public         house       ( n ame      not       known).           The      supporters            all      age    g ro u p s ,

both      sexe s,       were       very        well       behaved.             No    singing         or    chanting,            no

evidence          of    dr in k,         made       their       way     from        off    the     Platform          down       the

st ep s .        We    were     then        joined         by     two     mounted          officers,           I believe                from

S o u t h Y o r k s h i re.

The     supporters             were       held       for    approximately                  5 minutes           in    the       s m all

triangular             area     outside             the    public         ho u s e .

1 noticed             that     two       men    at    the       rear      of     the      supporters           were       carrying                tea

urn s .      We       were     then        instructed             to    escort         the     supporters            to    the

football          ground.            This       was       contrary          to      the    order        and also          it w as

rather       unusual           considering                the     supporters              were     so     quiet      and well

behaved.

We     escorted         the     supporters                down     the      main       road,       arriving          outside              the

Leppings          Lane       entrance           at    approximately                  2.15      pm.        No   problems

experienced               with       the       supporters              from        leaving       the      station         to    arriving

outside          the    ground.

They      then made            their        way      to    the     queues           that     were       forming         outside            the

Already          there       was     a     large      amount            of s u p p o r t e r s   outside          the     ground            but

this      wa s    not     unusual            considering                it w a s    a Semi       Final.           I was

approached             by s e v e r a l        supporters               at d i f f e r e n t     times      and     asked           a

supporters              standing           on    pavements              across       the    road        from L eppings            Lane ,

instructing              them       that        if     they     had a ticket               to m a k e     their       way       into       the

We    were     receiving              feedback            that         tickets       were       being     sold       outside          a    pub

By    this     time       approximately                  E.35          pm the       numbers        of    people       outside             the

turnstiles              were     growing.               What       seems       strange          there     d i d n ’t a p p e a r          to    be

any Policemen               in the           immediate             vicinity          of    the     turnstiles,             to    create

a small        sterile           area        between          the       queueing          supporters           and    the       actual

turnstile.               There        was       no     definite          queues.           With       £910     we w e n t       amongst

this     crowd          outside        the       turnstiles              to    assist       in     forming          some    kind          of

order.         Th e      numerous            times       we     were      asked       by L i v e r p o o l      supporters

"Which       is th e        West       Stand"           and     "Which         is    the    South Stand".                  There          didn't

appear       to     be a n y        clear        signs        to       instruct       the       fans     where       to    go.        At

At    this     point        PC      Cammock            and myself             moved       out    of     the    crowd       to a s s i s t

We     escorted          him       over        to PC R o s e a n d         PC       Morton and they                took        over.             I

believe           they       managed       to     get     him      into     the         ground.

There       seemed a            general          complaint          -from L i v e r p o o l          supporters               of    the

size      of      the    crowds          gathering           and    the     slowness             in b e i n g      dealt           with

entering           at    the       turnstiles.

One      middle         aged       Liverpool            supporter           came        up     to me a n d m e n t i o n e d           in

relation           to    the       crowd        gathering           that       they       had      the s a m e     attendance

every week              at    Liverpool           and     manage         much       b et t e r .       In    reply        to       t hi s    3,

pointed           out    that       they       d o n ’t a r r i v e      all       at    the    same        time.

T he     t im e    now       about       S. 30    pm.        1 was       surprised             to    see     a    large        amount            of

supporters              climbing          onto      the      wall     above         the      turnstiles.                 I mentioned

t hi s    to PC         Cammock,          and     also       that     they         seemed       to w a i t        several           seconds

before         jumping         off       the     wall     into      the     ground.

A Police           Officer          I believe           an    Inspector             then a p pe a r e d           on     the       wall      the

climbing           ceased          but    he wa s       lifting          s m al l       children        from       the        developing

c r u s h t o sa f e t y .

Again       myself           a n d PC     Cammock         went      to     give         what    assistance               we    could,

and      I myself            could       feel     the     force       of    the         crowd and           I withdrew              further

back      towards            the    road.

I seemed           to    recollect             earlier        hearing          a    radio m e s s a g e           requesting

Public         transport            to    be     stopped        from       travelling               along        Leppings           Lane

but      I saw      the       buses       were      st ill      mo v i ng      through           the    cr ow d,         forcing            them

etc.         Also        there    seemed         to     be a g e n e r a l          lack         of    information                   coming

information and                  requests          e t c , , to         the      crowd.

The    mood         of    the    crowd      by     this       time        wa s    growing             more       volatile                but       no

evidence            of    violence       towards             us,    but       they were               continuing                to       push.           A

Land       Rover         containing         a P.C.           w h i c h was        parked          to       the       extreme             left       of

the    turnstile            area     began         to      edge     in s l o w l y          in a n a t t e m p t            to       slow          down

on    the      step was          shouting          loudly          fo r    the     supporters                   to    stop       pushing,

but    the      crowd a p p ea r e d         not        to    hear        this,        or    take          no    notice.

At    t h is    stage       I didn't         see a n y t h i n g           to     indicate             the       impending

disaster            even    though       there          was    a    l a r ge      crowd          but       this       is u s u a l            for

big    ga me s.

It w o u l d        be    about     this     t im e        1 heard         over        my    personal                radio       somebody

making         reference          to a      ’c a t a s t r o p h e ’ . I had                no    idea w h ose              voice             or

whose        call        sign    it was.           We w e r e       still         receiving                nothing          from Match

C o n t r o l , it        seemed     strange.

X w as       then a pp ro ac he d           by a n o t h e r        Liverpool               supporter                who    produced                a

open ,       about       3--4 feet.          People           were        not     rushing             in,       it    seemed             as    if

someone         was       checking       tickets             and    using         t h is     as       an    extra          turnstile,

but    I w as        s t il l    surprised            to     see    it     open.

I pointed           out      this       to     the       enquiring           Liverpool              supporter and               he

started        t o w aIk          ove r .

At    t his    t iine I h e a r d             f r om     other       of f i cer s t hat             the       g ame    had      .been

delayed        until         3.13       pm.         I told a pp ro a ch i ng                  supporters              'Don't           rush,

the    start        now      delayed’.                  The    time     about        now 3 . 0 0          pm.         Ithen        heard a

loud     c h eer       or    roar       likened              to a goal         scoring          cha n c e .           A group          of

supporters             cl os e~ by          said        'What's        t hat      t h e n ’ , I r e p 1 i e cle          ‘C o u l d      be    the

made     a    comment            that       the     start       ha d    not       been        delayed and              that        I w as

lying.         There were               s t i ll        odd    supporters            asking          for spare             tickets.

I s a w PC R o s e           having           problems          with       on e     youth,          apparently             he      didn't

have     a ticket            and       was     j u st        making     a general              nuisance           of     himself.

I then        saw      t ha t     the       large        blue       gate     that        had    been          opened      earlier             wa s

now    cl os e d.           Then       about        eight       minutes           p a st      three       1 received               a    radio

message        something               to     the       effect       ’All      serials          or       personnel            onto       the

emergency           code         ’Hr.       Meadows           urgently         required             at    the    Police            Room."

I then        ra n t h r o u g h        a     l a rg e       blue    gate      to    the       extreme          right         of       the

turnstile           a r ea .        I ra n         through          into     the     area       behind          the      Leppings             Lane

stand        then      to    the       r i g ht     towards          the     rear        of    the C o n t r o l         B o x.         To my

left     I could            see     terracing                (extreme        right         hand      corner           of L e p p i n g s

L a n e ) seemed            to    be    plenty           of    room.         1 could           see       no    players          on      the

pitc h,       but      I couldn't              see       any    fightin g .

I then        eventually               made        my    way    onto       the      pitch       vi a a g a n g w a y            in      the

outside        seating            area        of    the       South     Stand.             From      t h is     position               I could

see    l a r ge     numbers            of     officers          on     the     pitch          and    standing            on     the

fencing        behind            the    Leppings              Lane     goal.         X saw          several           supporters

running        on      the       p it c h .        I asked a           steward           what       had       happened,            he       replied

    Following              other          officers           I went        immediately                to    the       fencing          behind a

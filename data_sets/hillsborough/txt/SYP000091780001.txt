when      the       pub h a d           been    open.               I recalled              t hat      I had    been        on    the    same

p at r o l     area       the       previous             year        when        considerable               numbers         had    been

drinking            at    the       pub a n d           I noted with               dismay           t hat     the    numbers           were      far

greater         than          the       previous          year.             On    continuing             my    patrol          I noticed

that      the       fans       outside          the R o y a l             Hotel        were       beginning          to     increase.              In

duty      sergeant.                 He    i n f o r m e d me             t h a t all        the     pubs      in the a r e a           had    been

visited and asked                        to    close.               Seeing        the       pubs       that    were       open and           the

number         of    people             drinking          1 realised               we       were       in a no w i n           situation.




On    continuiri                        patrol          I saw        t hat       the       number'-sf         fans     outside          the

saw      that       there          were       Police        Officers              present           on the      road        opposite

the      pub.        As       time       went       on    I saw           there        wa s     a steady        flow        of    fans       along

Penistone            Road and             from Neep s en d Lane                        many       of    them    had       obviously           been

drinking.                I noted a             build        up of           fans       outside          The V i ct or ia          Hotel

LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY



I have amended the DOE paper for Lord Justice Taylor in the light
of the Secretary of State's response to Mr Moynihan's comments on
the draft which I submitted on 6 June.


Paragraphs        9 to   11   of   the paper now        set out more       firmly the
Government's       continuing       commitment    to    the     national   membership
scheme     and make      clear     that   this   has   not    been   changed   by   the
Hillsborough disaster.


    I attach the revised version, which I have sent to our contacts
    in the police department at the Home Office.                  Unless they raise
    any difficulties,     I will send the paper to the Secretary of the
    Inquiry on Monday.

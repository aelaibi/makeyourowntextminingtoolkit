1989



Mr Max Madden (Bradford West): To ask the Secretary of State for
the Home Department, what information he has received showing the
number of people who were: (a) arrested and (b) charged inside or
outside the Sheffield Wednesday Football ground on Saturday 15th
April for: (a) drink related offences, (b) obstruction or assault
on police officers, (c) robbery, (d) looting, (e) pilfering and
(f) urinating in public place.




DRAFT REPLY

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has informed me
that 43 persons were arrested of whom 10 were charaed, 10 ejected
from the ground and 23 were giveir~a verbal cautio ind released.
Of the 43 -parsone arrested 19 were for drink related offences, 1
for obstructing or assaulting the police, none for robbery,
looting or pilfering, and 1 for urinating in a public place.
BACKGROUND NOTE

The majority of arrests were early in the match at Hillsborough.
Once the scale of the emerging tragedy became apparent most of
the 43 arrested who remained to be dealt with were rapidly
cautioned and released, and to free every available police
officer to rescue casualties and to save life: this accounts for
the seemingly high figure of 23.

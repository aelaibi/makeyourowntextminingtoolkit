                     HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER
                          Saturday, 15th. April 1989


4.40 p.m.      Received telephone call from Police Inspector McDowel
               requesting me to go to Hammerton,Road Police Station
               immediately.
4-50   3 .m.   Received telephone call from                  Area Office,
               Leeds.      The police had also contacted her.       Told her
               I was just about to leave.
5.00   3.m.    Arrived Hammerton Road Police Station - only one other
               person had arrived before me - the local Vicar.
5-45   ).m.    Telephoned                   from Hammerton Road Police
               Station.       Police Station was by now thronged with
               people and so everyone was directed a few yards further
               down the road to Hillsborough Boys Club.
               Food and drinks were already being dispensed at the
               Boys Club.       I volunteered assistance with this and
               continued to do so at intervals, but no help required.
               _______________joined me at the Boys Club and I kept
               the Family & Community Services personnel alerted that
               we were there - and ready to call a team outJ         The
               place was by now full of relatives, friends, social
               workers, police, clergy, etc.      ChaosJ
7.15   '.m.    We were sent to Burngreave Vestry Hall where, we were
               told, they were having a problem with the boiler.
               When we arrived two people from Social Services had
               preceded us and opened the building, but they knew
               nothing about the boilerJ      Shortly afterwards,
                     I] Assistant Director, Family & Community Services,
               joined us with 4 or 5 Social Workers.       He then decided
               that Kelvin Community Centre would be the most suitable
               place to set up a Rest Centre, being nearer to Police,
               Football Ground, etc., and requested us to go there
               immediately.
  8.15 p . m .     Arrived at Kelvin, several Social Workers there.
                   Took stock, decided we needed some of our own equipment.
  9.00 p . m .
                   Arrived Sheffield WRVS Headquarters, Glossop Road.
                   Collected insuls from Emergency Services cupboard,and
                   part box from Canteen Room.        Also took tea towels,
                   dish cloth, washing-up liquid, paper roll and towels.
  9-30   ).m.
                  Returned to Kelvin.         Social Workers brought in beds
                   and divided room into sleeping area at one end and
                  dining area       at other end.

                  After being told that several bus loads of people were
                  expected to arrive from Liverpool, I telephoned                 |

                                                                and asked them
                  to report for duty.

                  In the meantime [                  |set up tea bar and started
                  dispensing drinks to Social Workers.

                  Insuls were required as crockery in cupboards was stained
                  and dirty.                 Tea, bread, soup, tins of baked
                  beans, and margerine were all brought in by Family and
                  Community Services.
                  Also 'phoned                                          .
                                                                        to put
                  on alert (no reply from

                                                                       arrived.
 11.00 p . m .
                  I was given to understand that the majority of the injured
                  had been taken to Northern General Hospital, so telephoned
                  to offer our services, particularly at canteen.         They
                 appreciated the offer but declined - own staff were coping.
1.00 a. m .
                  (Sunday)     All very quiet so I decided that three of us
                 could leave.       I took                                     home,
                 and went home myself, leaving

                 _______ on duty*      In the event, they had only four people
                 in the Rest Centre during the night.
                 Requested                    act as co-ordinator.
Sunday, 16th. April
7.35 a. m.                       rang as I was leaving.
7.40 a. m.
                 Arrived at Kelvin Community Centre.         Had already 'phoned
                                      and asked her to report for duty,
                                      and I took over, and                 and
                                 left.
                 Alerted
                                                      and asked them to
                 report for duty at Kelvin, which left me free to 'phone

           Canteen.                         also opened Buffet Bar.
           Both canteens were very quiet, little demand.
                      visited Northern General Hospital Canteen.
4-00 p.    Telephoned                    and alerted her for duty at 6 p.m.
           Received a request for sandwiches from Medico-Legal Centre,
           (Coroner's Office)     Watery Street, which were delivered.              V' '' 'fi

           Shortly afterwards I received a further request from

           coffee, milk and sugar also on floor.           Evidence of spilt
           drinks all round as each person was hastily snatching a drink
           when they could.
                                                                                        "■ j
                               Manager, Medico-Legal Centre procured a table
           and a trolley and set up the urn, and I then dispensed drinks
           non-stop for the next hour.
           Telephoned Kelvin and asked                          to bring further
           supplies of insuls.        She and I continued the service.
           The Medico-Legal Centre is only a few minutes away from Kelvin
           Community Centre and I intermittently went round there to
           check progress.      However, just a few people had been in that
           day and the Social Services decided to close it down at 7*00 p.m.
                                             were taken home and I resumed
           duties at Medico-Legal Centre.

9*00 P-m   Medico-Legal Centre closed down for that day and
                      and myself went home.
           I was informed that the Medico-Legal Centre would be
           re-opened 8 a.m. Monday morning.        Decided that there
           would be no requirement for drinks and food before 9 a.m.
9.30 p.m   After arriving home I 'phoned                    at Leeds and then
           'phoned                     giving them both a run-down of events
           and requested                    to telephone                 (Joint
           Sec.) at 9.30 a.m. on Monday morning, in order to keep
           office informed.

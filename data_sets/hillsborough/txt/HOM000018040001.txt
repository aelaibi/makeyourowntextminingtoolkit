    Thank you for your letter of 18 April to the Prime Minister
about the disaster at Hillsborough. I have been asked to reply.


    As you probably know, an Inquiry under the Chairmanship of
Lord Justice Taylor has been formed to investigate the events of
Hillsborough and to make recommendations. I have therefore
forwarded your helpful suggestions to Mr R Whalley, Secretary to
the Inquiry, who can be contacted at this address.

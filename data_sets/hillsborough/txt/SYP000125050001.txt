 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD    WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IT APPEARED TO ME THAT EVEN AFTER THE GAME HAD STOPPED THE TERRACING WAS STILL

 FILLING FROM REAR. AS THEY GOT PEOPLE OUT ONTO THE PITCH,     THE CRUSH DIDN'T GET

 ANY EASIER FOR A LONG TIME. THE TERRACING SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEARED FROM THE

 REAR.

 AT ABOUT 2.00PM (1400)    \ w A s \ w A L K ING AT THE REAR OF THE NORTH STAND

 AND I SAW A LARGE NUMBER o K j o L I C E OFFICERS QUEUING UP FOR MEALS.

        OUGHT IT STRANGE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THEIR MEALS AT SUCH A

 LATE TIME.

 I DIDN ’T AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT THE NORTH STAND/SPION KOP AREA WAS

 COMPLETELY CUT OFF FROM THE WEST STAND END - IT CERTAINLY DIDN’T

 HELP THE SITUATION THAT OCCURRED LATER.

 o f ^ O U HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE APPEARED TO BE A GREAT LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLICE IN & OUTSIDE

 OF THE GROUND. THERE WAS A LACK OF STEWARDS GIVING DIRECTIONS.      I ALSO FEEL

 T^tE   WERE NOT ENOUGH GATES TO EXIT FROM THE PENS & THEY WERE NOT WIDE E N O U G H .

 LACK OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WITHIN THE GROUND TO COPE WITH DISASTER OF THIS

 MAGNITUDE.   THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN THE TUNNEL WHICH WAS VERY DARK.

 NO


Q 1S

 Q43

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 IT WAS OBVIOUS FROM MY POSITION THAT      THE TWO CENTRAL PENS, BEHIND   THE G O A L ,

 WERE FAR TOO FULL,    1 & 7 HAD GOT   LOTS OF SPACE LEFT.

 G44

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,      IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME THIS

 H^JpENED?

 NO

 I SAW SOME OF MY FRIENDS ON THE PITCH,      I WENT TO SEE IF THEY WERE ALRIGHT,

 AND THEN WENT TO FIND THE REST OF THEM.


<317

 <349

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

    JERE WERE FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CENTRE PENS./
m
 IT SEEMS THAT THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE W E R E N ’T WATCHING THE CROWD BUILD UP, Y

 NEEDED POLICE OR STEWARDS TO DIRECT THE INCOMING CROWD, AWAY FROM THE AREAS

 THAT WERE FULL.

 THE LACK OF ORGANISED CROWD CONTROL AT7 ~|H^ TURNSTILES CAUSED THE CROWD BUILD

 UP OUTSIDE, AND I BELIEVE THAT SOME TURNSTILES WERE SHUT.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 4.30PM    <1630)

 G51

 D ^ P YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,       A

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 I WAS ON THE PITCH, THERE HAD BEEN A TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THE GAME

 WAS ABANDONED.     I ASKED A POLICEMAN,   WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND HOW MANY HAD DIED,

 AND HE SAID HE D I D N ’T KNOW.   HE TOLD US THAT IF ALL OUR PARTY WERE TOGETHER

 WE WOULD BE BEST TO GET OFF HOME.

ONE *0F THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS RAN UP TOWARDS THE NOTTS FOREST FANS WHEN

THEY STARTED CHANTING.       THEN THE POLICE LINED UP ACROSS THE PITCH.

<353

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE j^Y THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE POLICE FAILED TO REACT TO ASSIST THjT INJURED, THERE WERE ABOUT 50 OUT OF

500 HELPING.      THERE WERE FANS HELPINprTHE INJURED,     THEY ORGANISED THE M S E L V E S ,

AND GOT MAKESHIFT STRETCHERS TO REMOVE THE DEAD AND INJURED.             THE FANS WERE

FERRYING THE INJURED THROUGH THE POLICE LINE, AND THEY STILL DIDN'T HELP.                 AT

ONE TIME EVEN MORE POLICE LINED UP ALONG THE PITCH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE NORTH

STAND,    AND THERE W A S N ’T ANY PROBLEM.   IT WAS AS IF THE POLICE COULD ONLY REACT

Q     A CROWD PROBLEM, WHICH DIDN'T EXIST, AND D I D N ’T KNOW HOW TO HELP THE

INJURED, ALTHOUGH THEY MUST KNOW BASIC FIRST AID.

THERE WAS NO FACILITY TO REMOVE THE PITCH F ENCING g/ 'THAT HAD TO WAIT FOR THE

FIREBRIGADE WITH BOLT CUTTERS.        THERE D I D N ’T APPEAR TO BE MUCH FIRST AID

EQUIPMENT,    IT SEEMED TO BE LEFT TO POLICE 1J6 DO MOUTH TO MOUTH AND HEART

MASSAGE.

THERE WAS A LACK OF MEDICAL ASSISffiNCy AND TRAINED FIRST AIDERS,

ALSO IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR T#E EMERGENCY SERVICES TO ARRIVE.

YES

G53B

CAN YOU COMPARE THE POLICING OPERATION,        LAST YEAR YOU HAD TO PASS THROUGH A

POLICE CORDON AND SHOW YOUR TICKET BEFORE GETTING TO THE TURNSTILES, AND I

D O N ’T RECALL ANY PROBLEM IN GETTING IN.

 ONLY THAT OUTSIDE THE GROUND & NEAR TO THE TURNSTILES THERE WAS PLENTY OF

 POLICE OFFICERS ABOUT - BUT THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO ORGANISE THE CROWDS INTO

 QUEUES. THEY SEEMED TO THINK THAT THEY WERE THERE FOR DISORDER PROBLEMS AS

 OPPOSED TO GETTING THE FANS INSIDE. THERE IS A GENERAL ATTITUDE THAT CERTAIN

 PEOPLE CAN GET IN THE GROUND WITHOUT TICKETS. A POLICE CHECK AWAY FROM/THE

 GROUND COULD PREVENT THESE PEOPLE GETTING IN.

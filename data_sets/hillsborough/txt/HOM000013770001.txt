                 Dear Mr Addison

                 HILLSBOROUGH : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
                 Following our meeting last Thursday I was able to report on the understanding

â™¦
                 between the three parties concerning a basis for reimbursement of the costs
                 incurred by West Midlands Police to the above investigation.

                 Consequently I am now able to confirm that the A u t h ority is prepared to
                 accept the Home Office offer of special assistance towards these costs
                 including the criminal investigation. It is understood that the offer
                 applies only to costs incurred in the current financial year.

                 Mr Geoff Cocking will be in touch with your Mr Schofield to finalise
                 arrangements for reimbursing South Yorkshire and as soon as I am satisfied
                 that these arrangements are in place I shall authorise payment of the West
                 Midlands accounts.

                 Yours sincerely




                 R C Johnston

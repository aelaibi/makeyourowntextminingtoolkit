    At 8.^5 am on Saturday 15 th April 1989t    reported for duty at Woodseats Police Station
    and there after travelled to Hillsborough re FA Cup Semi Final Football match between
    Nottingham Forset and Liverpool.


    1 was a part of Serial 7 which was being supervised by Police Sergeant 752 Batty.            Our
    duties were in the Spion ^op keeping order and aceasway clear.


    After the briefing in the North Stajad we took our positions in the Spion Kop.     ^rom            \

    then until^2.0Qpm that same day there was a steady influx of football supporters.            At
    2.10pm I had left the Spion Kop with Police Constable 1183 West and a prisoner
^                     who was arrested for being drunk in the ground at a designated
    football match.    He was arrested from the Spion Kop near to its corner with North
    Stand, where some of the Liverpool supporters were kept separate from the Nottingham
    Forest supporters. I looked towards Leppings Lane there u je rt, some crowd in the centre penn. •


    After process of the prisoner I returned to the Spion Kop with dther Officers and we               J
    were sent to theSpoin Kop^ corner with the South Stand as there was some trouble in that           (
    corner.   By the time we got there the trouble had subsided.     Whilst there I saw a              j
    youth running across the pitch from the direction of Leppings Lane end.      He was running
    towards Spion Kop and at the same time he was gesturing 'V' towards the crowd in
    the Spion Kop.    At or near the half way line this youth returned back towards the
    Leppings Lane when I heard a loud cheer from the crowd which suggested that the youth
    had been detaibed b y the Police.


    I then returned to the far end of the Spion Kop where the Liverpool supportes were
    kept away from the Nottingham Supporters by a Police cordon.      Upon my arrival at this
    point I looked across towards Leppings Lnae end and       saw people climbing over the
    Leppings Lane fence and coming onto the football pitch and ther^were other climbing
    up into the stands.    here were number of Police Officers in front of the fence.        I
    had assumed that this was crowd trouble.    But people continued to climb over the fences
    and unto the upper level of the stand.     The game was stopped at this stage and there
    were a lot of people on the grass and some of these were lying onthe grass with people
    leaning over them.    I then noticed acordon being formed along the half way line by the
    Police Officer.


         I then saw a person being given a kiss of life it was at this stage that I
    realised that something searious had occurea.      Suddenly people were ripping the side
    boards which were used as make shift stretchers and people were being carried c?/}the
                                                                                       0P r(          |




stretchers and placed near to the entrance between Spion Kop and the North Stand.               By
this time ambulances                          were begining to arrive and the *ed Cross and
St Johns Ambulance men and Police Officers were busy giving First Aid to the injured.


I vaguley remember hearing on the radio that it was a major incident.               We remained in the
Spion Kop untill it was clear off spectator and there after                 I v.as giving duty with
Police Constable xemple to gaard the gate which gave access to the Police Boom and to
ke.p press away from the area.


I remained on duty at this location untill the bodies of the dead were brought back
to the gymnasium from the hospital and later in the earlie hours of the morning
^ssisted the Social services and also the relatives -                who had attended to identify
*heir frienas and relatives.


I came off duty at 6.00am on Sunday 16th April 1989*

             Re:       Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry

             We refer to our letter of 24 April 1989                                                                                                                      K

             The District Health Authority and the two hospitals involved in the
             Disaster have been de-briefing staff over the last couple of weeks.
             In the course of that process we have taken statements from a few
             key personnel, including medical and nursing staff, 18 in total.
             We envisage not all of them will have evidence relevant to the
             Inquiry, but we would like the Inquiry to know those statements are
             available.  We are awaiting approval of the statements at the
             moment but we can let you have copies of them, either in draft form
             or as soon as they are approved, should you so require.

             Yours faithfully

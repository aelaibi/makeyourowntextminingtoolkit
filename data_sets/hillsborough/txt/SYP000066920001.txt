                 went     to H i l l s b o r o u g h       town at ar ou nd 1 0 .1Sam to             dosome shopping.                 I

                 parked my vehicle                  in     B r a d f ie l d Road outside Regent Court                 flats and

                 set     off    towards          the shops.

                 I w a l k ed       into the        precinct     and      purchased         goods    from Boots         but was

                 unable        to    purchase        the   goods    I required             from the N ew sa ge nt s         in there,,

                 I w a l k ed       back     onto B r o a d f i e l d Road and deci de d to turn                   right^eut          of

b el i e v e d due    to the fact           of the semi       final    being held that day.             It

seemed that          the Police          officers were        in pairs and were          not more       than

40 feet       from each other             pa trolling a small are a each.

On the      corner      of 8 r a d f i e 1d Road and M i d d l e w o o d R oad P e d e s t r i a n

barriers       have     been e r r e c t e d to      protect    pedestrians against              the

traffic.       Since      these      have    been e r r e c t e d the football         area on this

j u n c t io n has    been grea t l y        reduced.    These    barriers       run aj>a1ij*d 20 feet

into    each of the two              roads       I mentioned.

As    I began making my way                 from the    precinct       towards M i d d l e w o o d Road,,       I

was    pushed backwards w i t h force                 by a crowj^rof youths.            I fell     onto      the

floor     quite      hard but        1 m an a g e d to sava^'my head from hitting                 the

It took a few seconds                   for me     to try to sit       up,    and as    J. was

strugg I i ng a y outh kne 11 down bes i de me . The                      c rowd of youths         by thi s

stage were a few yards                   further     down the    road.       The youth       1 could, see

was also a L i v erpool              s u pporter     by his    scarf.

The y o u t h held my shoulders wit h both hands as                           if to assist        rne. As     he

k n e 11 beside me the y ou t h              said.

" D o n ’t a n t a g o ni s e   them     'Pop*.     Because    they've       been drinking        since

half    past 8 and t h e y ’re after                trouble."

He went       onto ask me          if    I was     going to the football          match or        if    1 had

any    relatives        or friends,          going    to the match,          I said,    No    I wasn't

and    that     I d i d n ’t know anyone a tt en d i n g         it.    The y o u t h went       onto say       if

I was     thinking        of going        to keep away from L e p p i n g s Lane             erijj/at around

going     to arrive         there       from all     different    direc t i o n s with the

                                                                                                                sms
intentions           of breaking          the gate at L e p o y f f g        Lane      to get      in.

SSuddenly the youths a t t i t ud e                  changes and           I realised within seconds

why as two of the original                      crowdr were walk i n g             back    towards        us.

As    the youths           got    close     to where       I and the y o u t h were              on the floor             I

heard one of them say,                    "Kick him        in the g o olies," and they were

o b v i ou sl y edging           him on to assault me                in. This       I thought was totally

against        the youths          nature and he helped me to my feet                            but as his

friends        were wi t h i n hearing             distance         he said,       ’Go on get         off on your

b ik e . ’

The y o u t h then wa l k e d away w i t h his two friends                             back along B r a d f i e l d

Road.
I was        not a c t u a ll y    physi c a l l y    injured        in a n y w a y from my fall               but    I

21    years.                                               .

In my opinion they had been drinking                                heavily,       I could smell           the       beer
                                                                    /
on    them      as    they    pu.shed     passed      m e . Mn.      of    the   youths        we r e car ry i ng

cans     of     beer,      some    had     packs     of        ns   with    them   .
The y outh that helped me                    I bel/ieve was a r o u n d            19 years        old.    He was a

good     looking          lad w i t h    lightish         coloured hair,           which       I think was

collar        length and          longisti on top.             He was about 5'            9“       S ’ 10" and was

of    propo r t i o n      build.       He was an e x t r e m e l y kind           lad and seemed totally

out    of     place with this             crowd,      it seemed as though he had gone along

with     them        initially but          now was a s h a m e d to be a s s o c i a t e d with them

because        of the behaviour.

A fter       the     incident      had oc:cured I looked for a P o l i c e m a n to inform him

of what        had h a p p e n e d and of what             had      been said about what                 was

p r o p o s e d to happen at L e p pings Lane,                      before       the kick off, but         I could

not    see a nyone           they seemed to have                d i s a p p e a r e d from the main            roads

into     the       side    roads.       I discussed         it when        I got    home with my wife and

             I a s k e d her advice,      as to what    to do but we decided not    to   report   it

             as we d i d n ’t think      the Police w ould take   us   seriously.

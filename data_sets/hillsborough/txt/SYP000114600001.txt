                    I am a Police Con s t a b l e       in the S o u t h Y o rkshire Police                p r e sently

                    st a t i o n e d at C1 S u b Division,        Rotherham.

                    On Saturday,       15 April,      1989     (150489),        I commenced duty at M a i n Street

                    Police Station,        R o t h e r h a m at 8. 3 0 a m    (0830).      Shortly afterwards                 in

                    company wit h other officers we were                     conveyed by coach to H i l l s b o r o u g h

                    Football    G r o u n d at Sheffield,         where we a t t e n d e d a briefing.

                    After the briefing the serial                 I was a t t a c h e d to       (Serial 37)            made our

                    was    in charge of both the serials                 (36 and 37).                      /

                    Bo t h serials were stood by the W a d s l e y Bridge Railtfei*y S t a t i o n

                    aw a iting the arrival         of a special         t rain containing Liverpool

                    supporters,     this     I believe was due to arrive at 2 . 0 2 p m (1402).

                    We had been s t a n d i n g    in the R a i l w a y S t a t i o n a rea for a considerable

                    length of time,        w h e n a message was             passed over the          radio to the

                    effect that a s s i s t a n c e was      required at a store               called the         "Gateway",

                    w h i c h was about 2 0 0 yards away from the R a i l w a y Station,                        further

                    along Hali f a x Road.         Myself,      in company wit h several                 other officers,
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   R387

proceeded to t h ^               location on foot,          but as we a p p r o a c h e d the

*G a t e w a y * ,         c a l 1 over the    radio stated no further a s s i s t a n c e was

requi/rei

M y o b s e r vations wh i l s t       in this are a made me awaptf''that hun dreds of

L i v erpool      s upporters were standing a m                    iting a r o u n d drinking

alcohol        from cans,         almost      everyone    of them was holding a four-pack

( b e e r / l a g e r ).

A fter     only a few minu t e s we              returned back to W a d s l e y Bridg e R a i l w a y

Station.          Whilst       stood there        I saw numerous Liverpool           s upporters

walking        down H a l i f a x Roa d       in the d i r e c t i o n of the football       ground

m any of them              carrying   cans of beer/lager.

The train a r r i v e d at about 2pm(1400>,                   our two serials wer e

positioned along               the exit from the s t a t i o n and onto the H a l i f a x

Road,      where      several M o u n t e d officers were waiting to as s i s t                 in the

escort       of the supporters,               this took several minutes,           then we walked

the supporters               towards the ground,          these    particular     supp o r t e r s were

all well        beha v e d a n d there were           no incidents      to report.

We arri v e d at the ground,                  the Lepp i n g Lane    entrance where        the

supporters we had e s c orted went                    t h r o u g h the outer gate towards         the

turnstiles.

We then were told to take up a p o s ition on L e p pings Lane                            near to the

bridge,       whilst         I was stood there numerous             supporters were        still

a r r i v i n g m a n y of w h i c h were still          drinking    beer or     lager,    also many

were asking           for tickets       from other s upporters           or asking      if anyone

knew where ttawy could be purchased.                         It was very a p p arent       that    lots

of people J^ad t r a v e l l e d to H i l l s b o r o u g h without          tickets.

It wouldr be a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 4 5 p m     (1445)     w h e n I was aware     that more

an d mdre        people were arriving,              hundreds      in fact.

I ha/a part of a m e s s a g e          over the       radio that      indicated that the game

w«     going to be delayed,                and    in fact    I told several       s u p p o r t e r s this.

                                                                                                                       R387

               .    I just don't know where all                   these suppo r t e r s were        coming from,       the

                    are a at this time was            congested.         I also      saw that       people    stood

                   w ait i n g    near the turn s t i l e s were        being   lifted over the fencing to
             Ir
                       oid what a p p e a r e d to be a crushing             situation.         There w ere also

                    several y o u n g s t e r s    climbing       over the wall       into the ground.

                    It w o u l d be shor t l y after 3pm            (1500) w h e n    I heard a loud cheer from

                    inside the ground,            which     I a s s u m e d was the kick-off.              There were

                    still     hundreds      of s u pporters outside          the ground        pushing towards the

                    ent r a n e e s .

                   S everal       minutes    elap s e d w h e n    I heard a message          over the       radio.        I am

                    not   certain but        I believe the m e s s a g e to be similar                to    "All available

                    officers a t t e n d     i m m e d iately     inside the ground".           On hearing          this    I

                    ran towards          the turnstiles.           F o l l o w i n g me was PC 451 Cooper,          w hom for

                    the    rest of this          incident    I was     in company with.             We both jumped over

                   a turnstile           ran to the    rear of the S o u t h stand down t h r o u g h the

                    s eating a rea onto the           playing area,         at w h i c h    point    I could see there

                   was a large           crowd    problem at the        rear of the L e p pings Lane end

                    goalposts.

                    I wept       im m e d i a t e l y to this are a and     I saw that        people were          being

                    crurshed on the         perimeter       fencing,     also   on the side-fencing ,               together

                            PC Cooper       I stood on the small wall                near the       perimeter       fencing

    C   ~           and began lifting             people over the fencing.                 I lost    count    of how many

             iA      we got out but they m a i n l y             consisted of younger          people,       all   of w hich

            £ ^O ^^jjad either          climbed near to the top of the fence,                   or had been lifted

(bis                up by fellow supporters,                we    carried on doing this for what                   seemed

                    hours,       although    I realise       it wasn't,      when     it seemed that the m a j o r i t y

v       y           of s u pporters were           out of any further           crushing      problems.        Myself and

                    PC Cooper,          together w i t h some other         people,        carried a teenage          boy to

                    the gym on a m a k e s h i f t     stretcher,        in my opinion this boy as dead.                        I

                    don't know who we handed the body to,                       but a police officer               told me
                                                                                                                PAGE      4
                                                                                                                R387

            where     to put the       body.

            We   returned to the            playing area an d a s s i s t e d      in giving     first aid

            w h e r e v e r we    could.

            L ater on w h e n al m o s t all          the   injured were      taken a w a y my s e l f and PC

            C ooper went          into the stand w here          the   incident     had occurred.            This    I

            u n d e r s t o o d was m a i n l y to    protect the scene due to several                groups        of

            supporters           standing    nearby.        It was at this time w h e n a y o u t h from one

            of the groups           threw some water          over myself and PC Cooper.                  No ac t i o n

            was taken w i t h        regard to this,          due to the fact that the s u pporters

            still     in the stand were              in my opin i o n a n g r y and a n n o y e d a n d    in doing

            anyth i n g may have           caused further        problems.

            Most     of the suppo r t e r s      had by now        left the ground,        the ones that

             remained were sp o k e n to, and slowly an d carefully a sked to                             leave the

            ground,      this they did without any                 problems.

            We then made our way to W a d s l e y B r i d g e S t a t i o n and met              other members

            of our serial.            We then went          to C l a y w h e e l s Lane and were    later stood

            down.

POLICE CONSTABLE 1679 OXLEY.    C1 SUB-DIVISION, ROTHERHAM.   6th JUNE 1989



I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police, stationed at

Rotherham.

I have been requested to submit a report regarding the 1988 $smi final

at Hillsborough, played on Saturday 9th April 1988 between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest, with specific reference to any overcrowding in pens 3

and *t, tunnel problems, and any knowledge of tunnel gates being closed or

being blocked off by police or stewards.

After attending the briefing at Hillsborough the serial I was attached to

took up a position at the Lepping Lane turnstiles this was to search fans

prior to entering the ground, I cannot remember all the officers in my

serial but the ones I remember was PS Keenan, PC 1027 Yeomans, PC 1l¥t

Reynolds, PC ^+51 Cooper, and PC 65^ Kettleborough.   As the supporters

were arriving and approaching the turnstiles they were searched, I remember

that many cans of beer,lager, and pop were either taken from them or they

handed them over as they approched us.     The supporters were in my opinion

generally speaking well behaved, there was lots of the supporters who had

obviously being drinking but none who I saw were drunk.    There was also

a couple of occasions when more supporters seemed to be entering the ground

from what had been a steady or constant flow.

After the kick off and all the supporters were in the ground I together with

my serial m attended in the ground,stood at the rear of the tunnel which

leads to pens 3 and    at no time did I enter the pens due to most of the

tunnel being full of supporters, although the tunnel area was fairly well

congested the supporters were well behaved and from the view I got there

was no pushing taking place.

Approximately 10 to 15 minutes later our serial attended at the gym within

the ground and took our meal.    We later took up a position on Lepping Lane

awaiting the end of the match, the match ended and we supervised the dispersal

of the Liverpool supporters and ^as I remember there was no incidents to report
COOT: - REPORT BY POLICE CONSTABLE 1679 OXLEY.



¥ithrBference to any gates being blocked or closed within the ground I

do not remember seeing anything regarding this,

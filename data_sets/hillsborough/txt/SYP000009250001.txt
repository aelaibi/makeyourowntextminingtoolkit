               I am a keen Liverpool               F.C.     supporter and season ticket                        holder.        On the

              a f t e r n o on of S at ur d ay     15 April        1989      (150489)         I a t t e n d e d the F .A . Cup

              S emi-Final          m at c h at Hi 1 Is bo rough,        together with two friends,

                                                      Liverpool               and

                             Liverpool.          WE had tickets            for the N or th Stand at the S pi on

              Kop        end and took up our           seats at about 3.03pm,                       just after     kick    off.

              After a couple             of minutes       I could see what                1 thought was a             crowd

              overspill           from   the terraces           at the L ep pings Ln end of the ground.                           A

               lot of       people were         on the    pitch and after a few minutes                         I could see

              one or two           people    being     carried up to the                corner        of the    pitch in front
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                SS2 9

of me,       who a pp ea r ed      to be     injured.       Then a few minutes after                       that    I

saw someone         in uniform,            it may have been a St.              Johns Amb ul an ce               man,

w it h someone        on a mobile           stretcher and the face was                   covered wit h a

blanket.         It was at         this     point    that    I realised things may be more

serious       than I first           thought and so I made myself                    known to a steward

a nd offered my services.                    He    took me straight            down to the

gymnasium.         When      I got        in there,    there was a l re a dy one                  corpse    in

there and a number              of    injured people about.                 There d i d n ’t seem to

be any o r g an is at io n so             I just shouted that            I was a doctor and asked

who    needed my assistance.                     I checked numerous            p e o pl e for serious

i nj ury and by this            time       bodies were coming            in everywhere.               One

p o liceman was trying               to    resuscitate an elderly g e nt le ma n and                       I went

to help him,          but    it was a lost           cause.     I t h e n tried to r e s u s citate

some    7 or 8 b o d i e s , only one of whi ch was                   successful.                 I left    the

g y m n a s i u m for a short         period of time on two occasions when                            I went

onto    the    pitch to help,              but    it seemed there were             plenty of doctors                    on

 the    pitch and so          I returned to the g y mn as iu m to help with                           the

injured       there.

All    this    took     place      over a period of some 45 minutes.

After    this     time things             seemed to be a little more                 o rganised an d the

flow of       injured       into     the g ym nasium seemed to s 1ow a little.                             Two

police       Inspectors asked myself and                    I think      two   other doctors               to

pronounce        life    extinct          on the bodies,       w hi ch    by this        time       had a Police

 Officer a l l o c at e d to each.

Some    had a l r ea dy been          pronounced,       and    in fact         I pronounced           life

extinct       on three b o d i e s .

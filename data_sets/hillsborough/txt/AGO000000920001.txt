HILLSBOROUGH


My letter of 7 January gave you advance warning that we expected to receive
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report on Hillsborough. He has delivered his report
today, and a copy is enclosed. The Home Secretary has confirmed that he will wish
to publish the report by laying it before Parliament and making an oral statement, as
he did at the time of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s appointment. I expect that he will
want to clear the terms of his response to the report with the Attorney and will be
writing about that soon, once we have had the opportunity to read the report and
offer advice to the Home Secretary on it. I expect that he will want publication to be
during February. In the meantime, you may want to consider what advice you will
offer the Attorney.

I am copying this letter, with a copy of the report to John Ringguth at CPS
Headquarters.




                                                PAUL PUGH

At    just       after          3pm    (1500)        ’g a r b l e d *      messages           were    heard          on    the       radio

which       to    be       truthful          had     not       been       excellent           reception             in a       number           of

areas       on    our        patrol         throughout              our    tour.         In    order       to       clarify          the

situation             we    attended           at    F o x h i 11     section           station       in       order       to

ascertain             what       if    anything           we       were    required           for    and       by    this       time

traffic          in    the       area       was     becoming          extremely           congested             and       it    was

difficult             to    move       anywhere            quickly          in t h e    area.        On    our       arrival               at

the      section           we    ascertained               that       there appeared            to    be       a     serious

situation             developing             at     the    ground          and    we     decided          to    attend          at       that

location.              It       was    virtually           impossible             to    make        any    headway             down

Halifax          Road       to       the    ground        using       the       Police        vehicle          and    we       decided             to

abandon          it    off       the       road     somewhere             along       Halifax        Road.

On    our       arrival          at    the     ground          via    the       main     Police       access           on      Penistone

direction           of    the        pitch       and     into      the       gymnasium.

I asked        some       officer          what        was    happening                 but    got             reply        and       began        to

assist        one      officer         with       an     injured          person             into    the       gymnasium.

I went        into       the     gymnasium             and        remember          my       first        reaction          was       one     of

disbelief           as    there        must       have       been       about           30    or    so     bodies          laid       out     in

rows     on      the     floor.          Officers            were       stood           by    the    bodies*         all        obviously

dead     as      they     were        covered           in   sheets,              blankets,          coats          etc.

Detective             Inspector            Scaife        then       called          me       over    and       I joined           him       and

DC     Take    with       Detective              Superintendent                    McKay.           We     were      told        to    go     and

obtain        details           from       all    mortuaries                 in    the       area    with           regard       to     how

many     bodies          they        could       accommodate              at       short       notice.

Detective             Inspector            Scaife        decided             that       this       would       take        some        time       and

 due    to    the      situation            at    the        ground          and    in       the    gymnasium              at    that       time

 it    would      be     more        beneficial              to    go    elsewhere.                 We     therefore             left       the

 ground       and        attended           back       at    Foxhill section                   station              using       the

 previously              abandoned           Police          v e h i c l e as       by       this     time          officers           hau made

 At    Foxhill           section         station         mortuaries                were        contacted             in    the     area          and

 Each    in o r t u a r y      was    asked       to     forward             the        information            when        received              to

 Ecclesfield              Control          Room     and       they       were           informed          to    pass       this

 information              onto       the    ground           for    the       attention              of    Mr.       McKay.

 1    remember           by    this      time     we      had      difficulty                 in    leaving          the    section

 station         as      there       were       increasing              numbers           of       supporters             wanting           to     use

 the    telephone              to    phone       home.            This       was        allowed          for    a    short        while          but

 we    eventually              had    to     direct          some       to    a     public          kiosk       further           up    the        road.

 We    returned           to    the      ground         wi t h     the       i nfo rmat ion           we       had    col 1a t e d          and
were        instructed            to     go      to    Hammerton                Road        Police         Station           to      assist        with

 relatives            and       friends          of    the       deceased                and    missing          persons             reported        as

a     result        of     the    incident.                 It    took          30/40          minutes          to    get       to    the     ground

due      to     the      heavy        traffic          in     the      area.

  Hillsborough

  In case it should come back to you in garbled form, I thought I should let
  you know exactly what I have written to Granada T.V. following last night's
  programme. I enclose a copy of my letter and its enclosure. There is one
  place where one of your officers might help me. I have not looked at the
  original pathologist's report recently and hope that I have correctly identified
  the figures as being milligrammes in 100 millilitres of blood. His evidence
  was, I believe, in pages 64 to 68 of the inquest notes.

17 ‘FeBruary 1998

Dear Mr Boulton,

Hillsborough Disaster

When I telephoned your colleague last night immediately after the World in
Action programme, I asked whether you are really interested in the truth or
merely in perpetuating the view of some Liverpool families that the police
and the police alone were to blame for the initial disaster. I was told that
you were indeed interested in knowing that - as any reasonable person could
have guessed - there is another side to the matter. There always is.

I love the majority of Liverpool people; they are funny and generous in
spirit. I share a common heritage with many of them, from Ireland. The
mass reaction which has overtaken them can be found in Yorkshiremen and
any other sub-section of humanity but particularly in football fans. It is
selective blindness to the facts - and we can all be guilty of it when we are
as deeply affected personally by events such as occurred at Hillsborough.

At the inquest, I represented Chief Superintendent Marshall, the police
officer who asked for the gates to be opened. I was mentioned by name in
Jimmy McGovern's documentary (which incidentally portrayed some of the
worst behaviour of the fans very accurately and was not by any means all
whitewash) as one of'the cavalry' brought in to save the police. I can direct
you to the evidence which showed as clearly as any case I have ever been
involved in that although it may be true to say that the fans did not smash the
gate down (as highlighted in the programme) they positively forced the
police to open the gate, with exactly the same consequences as if they had
smashed it down. If it had not been opened, there is no doubt whatever that
the death toll outside the gates would have been many times higher than the
eventual death toll inside the ground. People were already fainting and
being crushed by the relentless and mindless pressure from behind when the
gates were opened in a desperate attempt to save probably hundreds of lives.

This fact has another aspect. It has been suggested that the police should
have linked arms across the tunnel to stop fans from going down that route.
The police would have been trampled and killed and/or any temporaiy



                                   Page -1
barrier which was available would have been wrecked in a minute. The gate
which was forced open by the circumstances of the pressure of the late fans
was of the stoutest possible kind, supported by brick and steel pillars. It
couldn't contain the fans without injury and death on a massive scale. A
police horse which some thought would control the crowd was later found to
have 13 or 17 (I can't remember exactly, but does it matter) cigarette bums
mostly around the soft flesh of its anus. The coroner refused to allow that
evidence to go in in case it was considered too detrimental to the fans. I
myself wrote to three firms of solicitors representing the fans - a letter which
was composed with the help of a consultant psychiatrist with the aim of
avoiding further distress to the grieving families - asking for help as to what
methods they alleged could have been used effectively to prevent the fans in
Leppings Lane from pressing those in front against the gate. Two firms did
not reply at all. That is not surprising as there was in fact no method short
of live ammunition which could have stopped them. If the same question is
asked again today there is still no answer. A third firm replied that the
police should have had a man with a megaphone asking the crowd to hold
back. That last statement deserves a row of exclamation marks but you
might think it pretentious. There was in fact a loudspeaker van bellowing
out requests for the fans to show some restraint - without any effect.

My involvement ended there. I did not represent Mr Duckenfield, the
officer in overall charge. If I had, I would have asked the same question.
How could the fans have been stopped. Even if camera 5 was working
perfectly and he could see the build-up of fans, how was he or anyone else
going to stop them when they had no tear-gas or rubber bullets. In any
event, as we have often seen in Northern Ireland and elsewhere throughout
the world, strong tactics by the police only make matters worse. The simple
truth is that like the old joke, "Where does a six foot gorilla sleep when it
comes into your house?" Answer, "Anywhere it likes.", a crowd of
thousands, the worse for drink or not, goes where it likes. Any attempt to
stop it by force can only lead to the very injuries and deaths which some
people say the police could have avoided by trying to stop the crowd. How?
It just couldn't be done. Imagine, if the gates had not been opened and
hundreds had died up against them, as was inevitable. Mr Marshall and
others in the police would have had to leave the country to avoid being
lynched. The cry, "Why on earth didn't you open the gates?" would have
been heard. It always so simple in theory - different in practice.




                                    Page - 2
On the question of alcohol, the evidence from local people was
overwhelming. Before the match, fans were urinating everywhere they
could find in people's gardens and in the street. I gently cross-examined a
young lady whose brother was killed. She went down the tunnel before the
final crush. She said she was accustomed to going to matches and went
regularly at Anfield and elsewhere. I asked her what it was like in the
tunnel. She replied that it was perfectly normal, just like every week, with
two lines of men down each side of the tunnel urinating against the walls as
she walked past. The need to urinate stems from only one cause!

It is most unfair to have Trevor Hicks spear-heading the families' case. His
daughters were absolutely and entirely innocent, like the other four women
who were killed. No woman had any trace of alcohol in her blood. The
deceased men tell a different story. The limit for driving a car at the time
was 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. However, the
pathologist's report stated quite clearly that the lower figure of 20
milligrammes of alcohol was significant. Above that figure, a person's
ability to control his movements would be affected. You will see from the
attached computer analysis which I prepared from the pathologist's report on
the deceased that approximately 50% of the deceased males had so much
alcohol in their blood as to be affected in that way which would of course
mean a lack of M l ability to stand up straight and control the pushing and
shoving to which they were subjected. You will also see that 14-year-old
boys, who should not have been drinking at all, including the one featured in
your programme, had varying amounts of alcohol in their blood. Well over
10% of the older men had over four times the significant figure - i.e. over the
limit for driving a car. The coroner invited a statistician to give evidence,
which was that it was impossible for those killed to be unrepresentative of
the entire crowd. Statistically, the probability was that they would be a
sample to be repeated throughout the crowd. There were 10,000.00 people
on the terraces concerned - and therefore 5,000.00 of them unable to control
their movements and avoid passing on the pushing and shoving.

There has been a natural reluctance on the part of the police to defend
themselves by stressing these facts. Facts, not conjecture! It just isn't done
to criticise the dead. That is why the continuing efforts to have another
enquiry by Mr Hicks and others is not only unfair to the police but is also
potentially unfair to the families of those deceased who undoubtedly
contributed more than a little to the disaster. We are not talking of one or
two of the deceased but of approximately 45 out of the 90 males who died -



                                    Page - 3
of all ages from 14 upwards - and then of approximately 5,000 of those who
survived but who contributed to the crush overall. The over-simplistic view
is that Liverpool fans were killed by Liverpool fans.

Despite the unarguable facts, no-one on the day itself contributed as much to
the deaths as the minority of football fans of any and every club in the
country who had made it necessary for the fans to be caged in like animals.
Most of the dead would have escaped if the fences had not been there and
they had been able to step over the boundary onto the pitch without causing
the police to fear, with just cause, that this was one more example of
hooliganism with fans bent on invading the pitch and attacking the players
and opposing fans. For the very same reason, it was not possible to share
out the available turnstiles at Hillsborough equally between the fans. They
could not be trusted not to kill or maim each other. So, Nottingham Forest
were allocated half as many turnstiles again as the Liverpool fans because
the turnstiles had been built in calmer days when it was not necessary to
 distribute them equally between ends of the ground. The authorities have
been blamed for this inequality but fans were better behaved when the
 ground was planned. In 1989 you simply could not allow opposing fans to
mingle on entering or leaving the ground. The ultimate responsibility for the
 deaths therefore lies with fans of all clubs who were - and still are - unruly
 and prone to fighting rather than watching the football.

You must look at the history of English football for the reasons for Lord
Taylor's interim report. Heysell, in which many people were killed, was not
long back in the history of the Liverpool fans. England was banned from
European football because of hooliganism but was hoping to get back in. If
the fans had been found guilty, any such hope would have been dashed. The
temptation to exonerate the fans proved too much for Lord Taylor. I do not
suggest any connection between that interim report and the fact that it was
worth untold millions of pounds to the football industry. I am content to
point to the fact that the full report which came after England had been
allowed back into Europe was much more even-handed and did not
exonerate the fans completely; it was a fairer final report in pointing to a
combination of circumstances in which many factors played a part, including
the hot weather and, paradoxically, the decision to ban alcohol in the
ground, which meant that alcohol had to be consumed in advance or not at
all. Judges are fallible like the rest of us. The interim report can be shown
to be more fallible than most - and will be exposed in another enquiry.




                                    Page - 4
The families may have a point about the 3.15 cut-off time. The coroner tried
to be fair to all parties - and stopped me and others from pursuing some lines
of enquiry which would have tended to put the blame squarely on specific
sections of the fans such as those Liverpool fans who bought tickets in the
Nottingham Forest end of the ground but who made their way, naturally, into
the Liverpool area, causing over-crowding, but I think it was a mistake to
give even a toehold of an error in procedure. In hindsight, all sorts of
allegations can be made but at the time no-one was prepared for a disaster
on such a scale and the fans themselves did not behave as well during the
rescue period as they now say everyone else ought to have behaved.

The alcohol evidence came out on the day that Mrs Thatcher was ousted as
Conservative leader. The newspapers were M l of that story and the alcohol
figures received no publicity whatever as a result. If the families succeed in
obtaining a new enquiry, they may regret it as there are very specific rules
governing inquests which prevented advocates from asking questions which
tended to place blame on named individuals. A public enquiry will not have
the same rules and some very searching questions will be asked which could
well lead to more distress to the families of 50% of those who died, many of
whom have probably accepted the facts and are not pushing for more
investigation which Mr Hicks, as the father of two of the completely
innocent victims, can do without fear of any adverse evidence against his
daughters. Some of the others may not thank him when it is all over.

You stated in the programme that the police had been asked to comment and
had refused. I have no official standing on behalf of the police. Mr
Marshall retired on attaining the appropriate age and has nothing more to do
with the matter. I have commented because this matter needs to be laid to
rest. If it is not, the principal losers will be the families of those deceased
males who contributed so much to the disaster, who can be named in a
public enquiry, and the previous fans who made the fences necessary.

Yours sincerely,

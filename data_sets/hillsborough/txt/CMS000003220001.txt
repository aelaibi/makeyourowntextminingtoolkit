1.    I have discussed w ith M r Ram say the responses to m y 24 Ju n e m inute to
you and offer the following comm ents on the points raised.

Scope o f responsibility

2.    M r Phillips asked w hether we should be in the lead in the event o f a
disaster while a sports ground was being used for some other activity, such as a
concert; and w hether disasters at cultural venues w ould also fall to us.

3.    T he answer on b oth fronts is no. T he H om e Office retain responsibility for
non-sports use o f sporting venues. O u r responsibility for football stadia etc is
unique because, unlike theatres, cinemas and the rest, our Secretary o f State has
the statutory responsibilty, through successive sports ground safety legislation, to
ensure safe accom m odation for spectators. This responsibility was m ost recently
exercised in the decisions announced last m onth on extensions to the 1 August
deadline for all-seating for clubs in the Prem ier League and Division O n e o f the
Football League.

Scale o f disaster

4.     D r Gray expressed unease about our ability to cope in the face o f a large-
scale disaster, perhaps involving terrorist activity and risk to foreign sportsm en or
spectators.

5.    It is im portant to keep in perspective w hat is implied by lead departm ent
responsibility. It does n o t imply that we take over the role o f other agencies,
either local or national. T he lead departm ent may have an active role - where for
example local services seek specialist advice - b u t m ore likely the role w ould be
lim ited to dealing w ith Parliamentary, media and public enquiries. A terrorist
attack in a sports ground w ould be handled by the relevant authorities, as they
w ould respond to a terrorist attack anywhere. But, it w ould be for us if we were
to accept lead departm ent responsibility, to keep in close touch w ith services on
the ground and to provide up-to-date information for our Ministers.

Experience from Hillsborough

6.      Finally, you ask w hat lessons could be learnt from the H om e Office
experience immediately following the Hillsborough disaster and subsequently. In
terms o f immediate reaction, the H om e Office will have provided a point o f
reference for enquiries, keeping in close touch w ith local services. Subsequendy,
the H o m e Secretary set up the Taylor Inquiry and provided secretariat support for
it. T h e final report by Lord Justice Taylor was presented to Parliam ent by the
H om e Secretary and from it o f course flowed the decision to take legislative steps
to im prove safety at sports grounds.

Conclusions

7.     It w ould clearly be logical in terms o f our policy responsibilities to take on
lead departm ent responsibility in this very lim ited sphere. W e have responsibility
for legislation governing sports ground safety and it is our Secretary o f State w ho
has taken the decisions eg on enforcing the all-seater requirem ent for football
clubs.

8.     From the point o f view o f resources, we should clearly need to be capable
o f going into top gear in producing briefing for Ministers, not ju st in this
departm ent, and in handling press enquiries. B u t this w ould essentially be an
increase in the level o f the sort o f activity to which we are already well used in
our day-to-day work. It is true that the H om e Office does have a dedicated
emergency operations suite - essentially a room equipped w ith telephones kept
ready for the purpose - but the H om e Office's responsibility for disasters is w ide-
ranging. It is the lead departm ent for nuclear pow ered satellite accidents, for
severe storms, and for serious industrial accidents and was m ost recently called into
action at the tim e o f the severe flooding in W est Sussex earlier this year. Brigadier
Budd, to w hom I have spoken about this, does not see it as any way essential for
a lead departm ent to have a dedicated resource o f this sort.

9.     Are you happy, on the basis o f this, that I should inform Brigadier B udd
that, subject to the views o f our Ministers, we should be prepared for the next
edition o f "Dealing w ith Disaster" to reflect our lead departm ent responsibility for
disasters in sports grounds?                                               1

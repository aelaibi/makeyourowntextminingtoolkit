               Further     to my      s t a tement         of 7th Ma y           1989        (070589)    regarding                       the

               Hillsborough Disaster                     I describe            in this       statement      sever a 1 pe opIe                              I

               assisted       or a t t e m p t e d       to assist at the                rear of the L e p p i n gs Lane

               terrace.         I cannot       remember          details           of any of them except                             for       the

               d e c e a s e d Peter R e u b e n T H O M P S O N w no            I tried to         revive          by app 1yi ng a ba.g

              a n d mask      but was not s u c c e s s f u 1,                  I cannot        remember        the             clothing              of

               this man but         I remember            his    face          because       I saw him a g a i n                    later when he

              was     being     taken from an a m b u l a n c e                 into     the    gym at   the football                           ground

              w h i c h was a t e m p o r a r y mortuary.                      I cannot        remember what                    time       this was

               or who was        carrying       him.         There were a lot of amb u l a n c e                                men and Police

              around.

               In my s t a t e m e n t    of 7 . 3 . 8 9     (070589)            I d e s cribe      leaving my a m b u l a n c e and

              a casualty was             brought         to me at        the       side      of the amb u l a n c e                  I wo r k e d on
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            3988B

this    casualty,        avid then a n o t h e r     person was was              laid at       the side       of the

ambulance        both     these    persons were            dead.

I then star t e d to walk               to wards    the tunnel           which    leads    to the L e p p i n g s

Lane    terrace and          came across         another         casualty.        I tried       to    resuscitate

this    person wit h a bag and mask and heart m a s s a g e                          for some minutes              but

r e a l i s e d he was     dead.        This    p e rson    could have        been Hr T H O M P S O N but          I

cannot     be    certain.         I was    then     called        by a female s u p p o r t e r        to assist

her with anot h e r          c a s u a l t y who was       lying       nearby.     This all          took    place
                       Cic^r-
on the     concourse at           the    rear    of the West S t a n d before              the       tunnel    which

lead to       the terrace.          The    casualty         the    female      supporter        called m e to

was    also     dead and        1 covered his        face w i t h an article              of    clothing , I

cannot     remember        if    it was a jacket            or sweater,          or any    colours          of the

clothing.         This     person       could also         have    b e e n Mr THOMPSON.

X am    certain that Mr T H O M P S O N was                one    of the two men          I have       d e s c r ibed

and was       not any      of the       other    c a sualties          I w o r k e d on that     day.

I cannot        describe any        of the       other      persons        I wo r k e d on that        day or

their     clothing.         The    reason       I remember Mr T H O M P S O N         is b e c a u s e 1 saw

him a g a i n being        taken    into       the Gym.

Further       to my sta t e m e n t      of 24t h Oct        1989       (241089)    w h en I was        shown

photographs           I am al m o s t    certain     that        the    person    p h o t o g r a p h e d was Mr

T H O M P S O N who    I attempted        to    resusc i t a t e at the          rear of the L e p pings

Lane    stand.

together wit in ti^e/se fisfl sergeant PS COX (POL PS COX)                                   'took      up position

in the       central      circle        of the       lower S o u t h S tand d i r e c t l y behind the

No 11 ing ham Forest             be n c h .



At    this      time    I could       see     that    the m a j o r i t y of the S p i o n Hop and            the

S o u th S tand was           full    of supporters,           however,         I could see       that     there

were      relatively          few s u pporters         congregating         in the West S t a n d a l t h o u g h

the    central         pens    did appear           to be the     fullest.



A bout 2 . 50pm         (1450)       I noticed that         the West S t a n d was           now filling

£5hortly before           the kick off              I saw that      there a p p e a r e d to be some             sort

of    d i s t u rbance    in the        Iqwer are a of the West S t a n d d i r e c t l y               be h i n d the

goal      area.



This      was follo w e d       by people           climbing    over    the     perimeter       fence and         I

could also         see    people        being       pulled upward       from the        lower are a of the

West      Stand    to    the seated area.



About 3 . 0 4 p m       (1504)       1 could see that           the s i t u a t i o n a p p e a r e d   to be

getting       out of hand a n d             that a large        number      of Liverpool          supporters

were      now stood on the              perimeter       track and more and more                 people were

trying       to climb over            the     perimeter     fencing.




I saw that one            p o s s i b l y two serials          of P o l i c e   Jere making          their way

Eiy now     I could see yhat             s upporters w ere       f ra n t i c:a lly try! n g t o c:1 irnb

over    the    perimeter        fencing.          Some    of those     that       had    climbed over were

limping.          The    central       pens of the West S t a n d         terracing a p p e a r e d         to be

e x ce ss iv el y full        however     I. could see that         there was           p 1 e n t y o f s pa c e i n

the    pen to the        left side        of the     terrace.



Whilst     stood on the touch              line    I saw an officer           run from the           direction

of the      central      area    of the      perimeter       fencing and he had               in his arms a

young     boy who a p pe ar ed        to be unconscious.               This       officer      placed      the

child on the football                pitch and was         joined     by two memb e r s          of the St

Jo h n ' s A mb ul a n c e    brigade who        immediately      began to a d m i n i s t e r       first aid

in the form of m outh               to rnouth arti f i c i a l    ventilation.



I then made my way to a gate                     in the    perimeter      fencing w h i c h / w a s        behint

the g oa I a r e a .          I t here    saw,    t h r o u.gh t he f e n c i ng , a 1a r g e numbe r o f

bodies     w hi c h a p p e ar ed    to be   lifeless.           I could see that one of                   the

bodies was        that       of a man and the         left    leg of his denim jeans a p p e a r e d

to be stai n e d with blood.



The m a jo ri ty of the          bodies were        blue     in c o m p l e x i o n and w^fe        just    piled

on top of each other.

gate along        the    chain and onto           the football       pi/ch.



By this       time   there were          in large     number     of dist r a u g h t Li v e r p o o l

supporters        on the       pitch and they were a s s i s t i n g          the       emergency        services

to try and        revive      some     of the bodies         dragged      from the terrace.



S ec t io ns   of a dv e r t i s e m e n t   boarding had been torn from the siding and

this was       being jased as mak e s h i f t          stret c h e r s   to take the bodies           toward

the Penistona' Rd end of the ground.



Whilst     I wlas a s s is ti ng       other    officers at the          gate    1 was aware        of a

loud haiier        however       these       instructions       could not be heard above                  the

mass    confusion.



Once   the     remainder        of the       bodies    had been      removed     from the       pitch      I

rejoined my serial             and under        i ns tr uc t i o n of Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

answer    question        from the Liverpool             supporters.



When   the stadium           had been        cleared of all        the s u pporters        I returned           to

the N o r t h S ta n d wit h my serial and               stood by and further              instruction,,

Dear Mr Bone,

                                          Re: Hillsborough Stadium


Further to our telephone discussions, I enclose four VHS cassettes containing what I
understand to be all the Hillsborough material retained by the BBC. I also enclose three A4
sheets containing notes and a plan which I believe should shed some light on the contents of
these tapes, although they were prepared by the Sports Department some years ago now and I
have no personal detailed understanding of their contents. My understanding is that the four
cassettes contain the material referred to in the note as the “9 video tapes”.

The tapes are copies of the original VHS cassette copies retained by the BBC. In the event
that Lord Justice Stewart-Smith requires access to those originals, please let me know so that
the necessary arrangements can be made.

 Given the sensitive nature of this material I should be grateful if the copies would be returned
 to me when you have finished with them.

  ^oWs sincerely

                                 HILLSBOROUGH


    The 9 video tapes include all of the BBC material recorded between
    1438 (the first shots of the crowd in the Leppings Lane end stand)
    and 1550 cn Saturday 15th A p r i l , 1989.

    The main scanner output was recorded in London.  Apart from a 6 minute
        tape transfer of 'SUE' material at 1611 everything is in real
(    jm e .

    The BBC had 8 cameras working into the main scanner, a plan of their
    positions is attached;   Five video recorders were at Hillsborough to
    record the various cameras:-
    CAMERA 1 Main wide angle on gantry                   1459   - 1634
           4 Ground level    at half way line            1459   - 1612
           7 On a slung rostrum in the Leppings           1459 - 1634
              Lane end stand
           8 Two positions.
              a)  In tunnel entrance                      1455 - 1522
              b)  Ground level at end opposite Leppings
                  Lane.  From 1522 the camera was in
                  the tunnel for interviews
           2 Narrow angle    on gantry, and preview mix  1631   - 1640
         5/6  In line with   18 yard lines.   Camera 5   1450   - 1515
              at end nearest to Leppings Lane.    This
              camera was unavailable to 1515

There are some recording breaks because of incident replays in the
football. Camera 8 goes to black when it moves between its two fixed
positions.

BBC Sport also had a single camera unit at Hillsborough,                    called 'SUE'
(Sports Unit Electronic). .

All of the above recordings were made in real time.

There was also a BBC Leeds ENG unit at Hillsborough during the
critical period.  His recording is in tape time.  He says that
Nottingham Forest material was shot between 1415 and 1430 and the
Leppings Lane Liverpool sequences between 1437 - 1450.  His filming
inside began at about 1508.

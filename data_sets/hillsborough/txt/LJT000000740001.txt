         You will see from^the heading to this notepaper that I have an
         interest in a subject with which your name will ever be
         associated.  Indeed I have a lifelong interest in sport and
         its management, but appointment as Chairman of the Football
         Licensing Authority has wonderfully concentrated that interest
         on football and its spectators.

        Although the Government had initiated the enabling legislation
        for the Football Licensing Authority before the events of
        Hillsborough on 15 April 1989, the remit which I have been
        given is very much influenced by Hillsborough and indeed by
        the reports which you presented.

            ^ eSe early ?ays       Authority, much of my time and that
        of the members is being taken up with assessing the task and
        listening to those affected by or with a direct interest in
        the functions of the Authority.  I firmly believe that if the
        Authority is not only to discharge its remit effectively but
        also to do that with suitable regard for the sensitivities of
        those directly concerned, I need to understand the backcloth
        to Hillsborough and its aftermath as fully and as deeply as I
        can

       I should accordingly be grateful if you could spare me a
       little of your time to talk informally and off the record
       about matters raised in your inquiry which may be relevant to
       cne task on which I am embarked If you are so willing perhaps
       you would suggest some alternative dates and times convenient
       to you. From my own point of view this could not be before
       November.

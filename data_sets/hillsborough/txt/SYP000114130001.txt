                I    continued             my      allocated                 duties.

               At     1415       hrs       the          crowd          became       more     dense         with       large       queues         forming          at

At    1440     hours          the    crowd        pressure            was    so     great          that          a    number          of

persons        were          assisted        from        the       crowd     comolaininq                 of          being          crushed.

seemed        trapped          in    the     rush.

Large        numbers          of    Liverpool            supporters            were          now       becoming                extremely

relieved           the       pressure        at       the    tm^rfst^les            to       a   manageable                    degree.           I

              th®    gate        through          which             I    passed.

              After        the       gates       had       been          again         closed        persons          were       still          climbing

              I formed           a    definite             opinion/That                   a    deliberate             effort          on    the       part    of a

              various        degrees.

              At    1505     hours          on    the          instruction                of    ground             control       I attended             on    the

              that     a    number          of    these             seemed          to    be    dead.

              For    approximately                    40       minutes            I assisted                 with    the    movement             of    dead    and

             /injured        persons             from          this          area      onto     the          playing       area.           I assisted
•r,v
              with     the       removal          of       a    number            of     obviously             dead       persons          to    the

              At    approximately                 1600          hours               nas       directed             back    to    the       turnstile          area

G+*           at    the     rear       of     the      West             Stand       where       I was          again       engaged          in a s s i s t i n g

              with     injured           and      dead          persons.

              At    1730     hours          I attended                   a     de-briefing               in    the    North          Stand       and    was

              eventually              returned             to       Woodseats             Police             Station       where       I terminated

              duty     at    1900        hours.

There seem to be three issues arising from all this:

       -            as well as one specific to the reply“ u
    will have to draft for the Home office to send to
     iverpool City Council - what avenue is available if the
    po ice and licensing authority refute the complaint                               but
     he complainant is unsatisfied?                               I would prefer to know

   ls unfortunate, since it is contradicted by the,"
   correspondence since that meeting.                               From copy
   correspondence in the papers G2 sent F8 I see that
      Councillor Chase has written to the Chief Constable of
      West Midlands (12 September) and the Football League
       (13 September), criticising the evidence shown to them as
      too selective and inconclusive, and criticising a refusal
      by the club and licensing authority to allow them to
      inspect the ground.


      As things stand there seems to be a fundamental
      difference between Liverpool City Council; and the club,
      licensing authority and police at Coventry.


      (in)   I have no way of disproving the police and local
      authority's view that there was no serious overcrowding.
      Nevertheless it seems clear from some of those involved
      (several supporters who have recorded statements for
      Liverpool City Council) that there was some crushing
      outside the turnstiles, and people were alarmed there.     I
      am not yet convinced that the police (generally) get
      crowd control outside stadia right every time, or that
     they are always in a position to respond should there be
     a sudden further increase in congestion (eg if one or
     more turnstiles become inoperative or there is a further
     surge of late arrivals at the back of the queue/crowd
     outside, just when things have reached a very difficult
     point.


I think we should discuss our joint response to these letters.
Copy recipients may of course also wish to comment.     I am also
drawing this case to their attention in view of the session of
evidence with Lord Justice Taylor tomorrow (Tuesday
17 October).

 It is understandable that following the tragedy at

  ongestion or delay occurs while large numbers of spectators

Mistakes were made at Hillsborough, by the police and by
   ers.     Nevertheless many officers made valiant efforts to
effort     lnjured and save      that day, and determined
  forts are made every Saturday by all services concerned to
ensure the safety of spectators at football matches.

to reconsider his attitude to the police, who continue to
serve the public well and professionally, often in difficult,
and demanding circumstances.

 Dear Sir,

 With reference to the crowd management problems involving

                          °f Protests from Everton fans, to this office we
              sollclt a response from you regarding the police operation
         £ L V1SltOrSKS0CtiOnS °f Hi5hfield Road on the day in question?
         basic corroborated allegations are as follows:-

                     °fficers on dutY to the visitors turnstiles area of
                  £ Blue Stand did not operate a queueing regime   No



     o                              ?                                  i                 28

     That repeated requests by fans for a delayed kick-off were
     to t h e ^ a i l u ^ o f ^ r o ^ ^ 11 t h e .c o n s i s t e n oy of fans s tatements
     ,  ^     ta ilure of crowd su p e r v i s i o n at the Sky Blu e Stand it
     would appear this decision was somewhat misplaced as manv
     fans did not access the turnstiles until after 3.15 p.m.

     Police communications were confusing and on occasion failed
     Officers are reported to have held heated arguments am^aJt'
     themselves on the terracing behind the goal concerning the
     overfilling of the Everton section.  InltancSI of p S i c e ?adio
      allures have also been identified.  In the wake of Lord
     i s ^ f Csome^concern?nUnentS ^         P°liCe communic^ i o n s this matter

     Reasoned complaints to police officers from individual fans
     were often met by abusive language and misleading claims.

                               - 2 -




As officers -of the West Midlands force acted as agents for Lord
3 9eV9 27 2 8e,ndy^ r i* ?on;efn« .this authority that recommendations
3,9,19,27,28 and 29 of his Interim Report appear to have been
compromised on the basis of these allegations.

Quite clearly Coventry City Football Club and the local authority
have; much to answer for and a dossier of fans statements will
be forwarded to Lord Chief Justice Taylor, the Football Association
Football League, Football Supporters' Association and Coventry
City Council    With regard to the police operation at the visitors
sections of Highfield Road I suggest the enclosed allegations
require investigation.                                 y     b

Mr. Ian Roxburgh,
Chief Executive,

CV1 5RR.



Dear Mr. Roxburgh,


With reference to the crowd management problems involving Everton supporters at
Coventry City's ground on Saturday April 19th last.

Following a torrent of protests from Everton fans to this office I wish to
solicit a response from you regarding the existing General Safety Certificate
for the Highfield Road stadium.                                              e


Hi  S i e? atp°n!^^Hssted^below, raise serious questions about the adequacy
the Safety Certificate in the wake of Lord Chief Justice Taylor's Interim
                                                                                    of

Report particularly in relation to recommendations: 3: 9 - 1 3 - in- iq- 0 7 - anH
28. As the licensing authority we are concerned that Coventry City Council         as
a responsible authority, investigate these matters forthwith.

The basic allegations are as follows:-

     severe crushing and unrelieved pressure at the 4 turnstiles allocated to
     visitors in the Sky Blue Stand-. . Arrivals at the back exceeded the rate
        turnstile flow and no queueing regime was imposed throughout:

    severe crushing and unrelieved pressure occurred at the egress eate
    adjoining the stand and terracing areas, which visiting stand o ccupants
    had to exit after the game:


-   overpacking in the visitors' pen behind the goal was not relieved until
    half-time when police officers allocated an adjoining pen to a number of
    Everton fans.  This pen already contained Coventry City supporters:

    Police officers misled and misinformed fans about a delayed kick-off
    Some officers blamed the overcrowding to the turnstiles on the fans
    themselves.
 4




 Currently we are formulating a dossier based on statements taken by my staff.
 The consistency and clarity of the allegations suggests that an investigation
 is warrented by yourselves, the football authorities and the Football
 Association.

 I am lure you will treat this matter with the utmost urgency.   I await your
 reply! in anticipation.

 Yours sincerely,




' Cllr. Harry Chase,
  Chair Hillsborough Working Party.

                 Dear Councillor Chase

                 SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
                 COVENTRY CITY V EVERTON
                 19 AUGUST 1989

                 Your letter dated 23 August 1989, received by facsimile transmission
                 addressed to Mr Iain Roxburgh, my Chief Executive, has been passed to me
                 for reply as it is this Department in conjunction with the City Secretary
                 that has responsibility for overseeing safety at sports grounds.

                 Your Working Party would seem to be making a number of serious allegations
                 concerning safety standards at Coventry City Football Club's Highfield Road
                 Stadium, however, as a preamble to my reply you should be aware of the !
                 following facts.

                 Immediately on publication of the Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor's interim
                 report into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster a meeting was called by the
                 City Council of all those parties interested in safety at sports grounds
                 namely s-                                                      ’

                 4   West Midlands Fire Service

                 This group which has always met on a regular basis was immediately
                 reconstituted into a Formal Advisory Group and it was agreed that future
                 meetings would also include representatives from the West Midlands
                 Ambulance Service and a Supporters Group.

                                                                                  Continued

    I must entirely refute this suggestion, On analysis of the figures,
    at no time was a density of more than 44 person per 10 m 2 of terrace
    prevailing on the visitors terrace. The, pen did not contain any
    Coventry City supporters.

4   The Match Commander (Police) in charge of policing matters on
     19 August entirely refutes the claim that his officers misled and
    misinformed fans about a delayed kick-off. There was never any
     suggestion of delaying the kick-off. Police officers are there to
     assist the fans, not to attribute blame.

I would be pleased to inspect your dossier of complaints when it is
complete, but I must say that on the unchallengeable information available
to me I feel that the matter does not warrant any further investigation.

Yours sincerely

 LIVERPOOL   L69 2DH




  Dear Sir

  I am directed by the Chief Constable to reply to your letter dated the 23
  August 1989 about the difficulties experienced on 19 August 1989 by some
  Everton supporters, and other related matters.

  I am aware of the content of the letter sent by you to the Chief Executive
  of Coventry City Council which arrived in time for its content to be
  discussed by our Advisory Group.  The Director of Economic Development and
  Planning will reply to you on behalf of the Advisory Group, but as
  Match Commander on the day I will comment on the points in both letters
  which relate solely to the policing of the event.

  Since the Taylor Enquiry, recommendations 1, 2 and 3 have been addressed by
  the Advisory Group, and as a result the capacity of the Highfield Road
  Ground has been re-adjusted to 26218.  Of that number, 5849 is allocated to
  visiting supporters;  2789 for those seated and 3060 for those standing.
  On the date in question the attendance was 17981 which included 5540
  visitors, 2578 of whom were seated and 2962 standing.

  Closed season improvements carried out in the visitors seated area were
  designed to separate the covered from the uncovered area. Those
  improvements allowed the club to re-introduce reserved seating for the
  convenience of seated supporters and to make marshalling and stewarding
  more effective.

  For the match itself, our intelligence indicated that between 4-5000
  Everton supporters would attend the match and that the overall attendance
  would be in the region of 19,000.  It became apparent quite early on in the
  week that the seated and standing overspill areas for visiting supporters
  would be required. That information was relayed to the club and
  re-inforced on Friday morning as a result of information received from
  Liverpool. The policing operation was adjusted to accommodate a capacity
  crowd in the visitors areas. The tactics used by the Police have been well
  practiced in the recent past and reviewed in the light of the events at
  Hillsborough and the recommendations made by Taylor.




THE O F f l C £ R D E A L IN G W IT H TH E C O R R E S P O N D E N C E IS   .   ^   B i r C f t                EX T E N S IO N      - 3 5 1
 We have experienced larger visiting support and never before had
 allegations of crowd problems, either inside or outside the ground which
 were beyond our control and which could have prejudiced safety.

 At the pre-match briefing the potential for a capacity visiting contingent
 and our response to it was dealt with in detail, and sufficient reserves
 identified, again in line with the recommendations made by Taylor.

 The club informed us that almost 2000 tickets had been sold before the
 match and that a further 600 were to be made available for sale on the day;
 again a normal practice.

  The four turnstiles in question are described by the club as being slow.
^ Their potential rate of flow indicates an ability to admit one person every
  4 seconds, that rate correlates very well with the capacity for that
  viewing area (recommendation 19).

 Two of the four turnstiles into the Sky Blue Stand were initially allocated
 to ticket holders and two for those wishing to pay.   Our deployment
 comprised 8 officers and a Supervisor and 2 mounted officers.   At
 2.15pm we were aware of a build-up of supporters at those four turnstiles.
 This was seen on the ;ground cameras and reported by the Officer Second in
 Command of Operations, who was at the scene.   It was apparent that the
 queuing was to the two pay gates but at that time, the queue was orderly
 and good humoured. There was no queuing at the ticket turnstiles.    At that
 time there was not need to increase Police presence at that location.

 The situation was monitored and at 2.25pm there was evidence of an increase
 in the size of the queue and an additional 10 officers and 2 mounted
 officers were deployed to that area.  It was congested in the immediate
 vicinity of the turnstiles but along its length, supporters were queuing in
 twos and threes. At that time, it is true to say that more people were
 arriving than were passing through the turnstiles.  Those joining the queue
 again did so in twos and threes.  There was a separation of ticket and cash
 queues and it is reported by the Sector Commander that those wishing to pay
 cash formed orderly queues, whereas those with tickets were not so orderly.
 There was an attempt made to form the ticket holders in to some sort of
 order using horses and foot patrols, but because of complaints, the tactics
 used by mounted officers were eased.  I was able to view the events on the
 video and there was no request from the Sector Commander to deploy other
 available officers to the scene.  I was satisfied with the tactics being
 used and the number of officers deployed to what was a relatively small
 crowd. By 2.40pm the cash sale gates were re-designated "ticket only" to
 ease the congestion outside the tickets turnstiles.

 There is no funnelling at those turnstiles and therefore, the verbal
 advice and containment tactics from the mounted and the 18 officers was
 ample to control the 400-500 supporters who were outside the ground.  I
 think you will agree that the number of officers at that location was
 appropriate to deal with the numbers waiting, but we could do nothing about
 the rate of flow through the turnstiles. Our tactics and availability of
 resources was fully in line with the letter and spirit of recommendation 28.
                                         -   3   -




      I am aware that by 3.12pm there were no queues at any of the four
      turnstiles mentioned. There were the inevitable late arrivals who
      experienced no difficulty in gaining access to the seated area.   You will
      see from the details given in the third paragraph of my letter that the
      number of visiting supporters was under the reviewed capacity.   The "Green
      Guide" density recommends 54 persons per 10 square metres.   A 15% reduction
      in that figure results in a recommended density of '46. On Saturday the
      actual density averaged out at 44 persons per 10sq.m.   I have had the
      opportunity to view the video of the crowd which shows there to be ample
      room in the visiting standing area.  The Director of Economic
      Development and Planning will respond to you in more detail about
      densities and video footage which completely refutes the allegations
      contained in your letter to the Chief Executive.
( )
      At 3.00pm it was estimated that there were 400 spectators waiting at the
      four turnstiles, and at that time I still had 18 patrol and 4 mounted
      officers in attendance. The presence of that crowd did not constitute
      either a public order or a public safety risk.   I was able to police the
      crowd inside and outside the ground, and the mere fact that there were
C*    people who could not get in in time to view the kick-off is not sufficient
      justification to warrant a delay in the kick-off.   That option was
      considered by me prior to the players taking to the pitch.   That fact was
      relayed to those still waiting outside the ground.   They were
      understandably unhappy and frustrated about their delayed entry, but in the
      circumstances were quite orderly.   It is interesting to note that one
      complaint related to a persistent refusal to delay the kick-off, yet in the
      letter to the Chief Executive one of the complaints was that we misled fans
      about a delayed kick-off!   There was little the Police could do to
      relieve that frustration as we had no control of the speed of entry of
      those fans into the ground.   I saw no justification to order the kick-off
      to be delayed and on reflection I still consider that to be the right
      decision.

      There is no doubt that a number of people were frustrated at not being able
      to get into the ground in time, even though most had arrived early enough
      to do so. I would say that the 400 outside the ground probably arrived
      near to the kick-off time. Nevertheless, the fact that quite a few of
      them were frustrated can have implications for public order with
&     consequential safety ramifications.  The mood of a few visiting supporters,
      and only a few, made marshalling and stewarding thereafter more difficult
      than it should have been, but I can fully understand their feelings. On
      Monday morning I expressed my views to the club on the delay caused by the
      turnstile configuration and other related matters.  That was discussed at
      the Advisory Meeting on 23 August. The outcome of that meeting will be
      outlined in the letter from the Council.

      In relation to your third point, I recollect that the communications on the
      day were good and that there were no systems failure.  The volume of radio
      traffic was reasonable and did not pose any operational problems to the
      experienced operator, nor did the volume of information being fed into the
      Command Post.  I am not aware of any heated arguments or disagreements
      between Police Officers in the overflow section behind the Everton goal, or
      in any other area. It is true that officers spoke strongly to one or two
      fans. I have viewed the video of that section of the crowd and it
      appeared well behaved, requiring little intervention by the Police.
                                       -   k   -




   Nothing occurred which would have led to a 'discussion' on policing tactics
   or action.  I certainly saw no arguments between officers.  My enauiries
   since receiving your letter confirms that fact.

   Referring now to the last allegation about the attitude of my officers.
   Thley were briefed to act in a courteous, firm and positive manner and to
   communicate a philosophy of professionalism in dealing with both home and
   visiting supporters.

   We tried to deal with a frustrated section of the crowd with firmness and
   understanding but it was perhaps inevitable, where the tempers of some of the
   fans were becoming frayed, that there was a breakdown in effective
   communication.   At the end of the day, allegations of curtness from both
   sides were inevitable and understandable.

   If I may touch briefly on the letter you sent to Coventry Council, there is
   no evidence whatsoever from the video to support the allegation that there
   was severe crushing or over-packing of the visitors pen which we refer to
   as the overspill area. I can make the video of this available to you,
   which will show quite clearly that conditions within the crowd generally were
   comfortable and in the pen referred to specifically by you, you will see that
   conditions were very comfortable indeed.

    I listened with interest to some of the comments made on Radio Liverpool
    and you may have heard that I responded to them all.  Some of the comments
    about the absence of police , the time taken to get into the ground and
    that some fans were still queuing at 3.40pm were wholly inaccurate and
    unhelpful.

   Like many other grounds, including Goodison Park, the visiting supporters
   are kept in until the streets are relatively clear of home supporters. You
   will fully understand the reasons why we continue to employ that tactic.
   There were 6 announcements made to the visiting fans that this would be*
   done and as far as I am aware, there was no severe overcrowding on the
   approach to the exit gate. Bearing in mind we were under the reviewed
   capacity for that area, there was nothing exceptional in the size or
   density of the crowd which would have warranted police or steward
   intervention. Our Police box is situated just 10 metres from that exit
   gate.  It is elevated some 5m above the crowd and the windows at the front
   face out on to the main exit gate and have excellent views of the
   crocodile which forms behind that gate. Police Officers manned those gates
   and assisted with the stewarding of the exiting fans and I, as Match
   Commander, had an un-restricted view of the exodus of fans, saw nothing
   exceptional to justify the allegation that there was severe crushing at
   that location.

   I hope the above comments have eased your fears over the conditions
   reported to you. I can assure you that everything possible was done on
   the day to allow the match to take place in a safe environment. Having had
   the opportunity to again review the events of the day I am satisfied that
   the spirit and letter of the Taylor report were followed and that there
   were no safety problems at the ground.

Mr. Geoffrey Dear,
Chief Constable,
West Midlands Police H.Q.,
Colmore Circus Queensway,
BIRMINGHAM    B4 6NQ



Dear Mr. Dear*

     Following the recent complaints froin Everton Supporters
regarding aspects of crowd safety at the Coventry City -v-
Everton match on Saturday, 19th August, 1989, members of the
Hillsborough Disaster Working Party were invited to visit
the West Midlands Police at 'M' Division Headquarters in
Coventry.  This meeting took place on Wednesday, 6th
September, 1989.

     Unfortunately, the meeting did not resolve most of the
issues we raised.    The supporters complaints centred around
the lack of police control and poor turnstile facilities
outside the Sky-Blue Stand from 2.15 p.m.   onwards and
localised overpacking on the terraces from 2.35 p.m. The
edited police video of the scenes outside the Sky-Blue Stand
did not commence until 2.57 p.m. and offered a very
restricted view; the video of the terraces was inconclusive
and the still photographs of the terraces were taken during
and after half-time.   The video evidence neither proved or '
disproved the supporters' complaints.

     I had hoped that we could have either supported the
fans' complaints and then taken the appropriate action to
ensure such problems do not happen again or that we could
have been reassured that the complaints were unfounded.   To
be left doing neither is a most unsatisfactory situation.

i cannot comment on whether you were able to see the game or not - that is
sometning you must take up with the Club.   I would refute anv allegation
you make about overcrowding in the over-flow section because its- capacity
has been almost halved.                                             Pdciuy


                        6SC0rt coaches int0 the Cifcy and I do not know of any
      Clubs that d0>  You Wl11 probably get that facility on semi final
marches but certainly not for a normal league game. We do escort coaches away
from the ground and will continue to do so.                 -

I refute entirely the allegations that you make in relation to possible
crowd safety issues, and again point to the fact that our evidence has been
seen by the media and by your Council Working Party and they were entirely
satisfied that there were no problems on the terracing behind the goal.
Any problems you experienced would have been very localised but not continual.

In reply to your question - we have learned, we continue to keep on learning
as we deal with people in large crowds.  You will be aware that Coventry City
    fh1Srf°HCe f ^ - inn the forefront of CTOWd safety and crowd entertainment,
and the Club and this Division are very proud of the facilities provided and
our record in maintaining public order and ensuring public safety at
football matches.

I am not attempting to apportion any blame, but you should not under-estimate*
or under-sell the responsibility of those attending football matches to
behave in a responsible manner, and also to take on board the lessons learned
as a result of the Hillsborough disaster.

It is regretted that you feel the way you do and I hope the above facts have
been able to allay your doubts.


Yours sincerely




Superintendent

                 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUEST

                     OPERATIONAL ORDER




INFORMATION


The Hillsborough Disaster Inquests are to be resumed in a limited
form, with the agreement of all parties in Sheffield, at the
direction of H.M. Coroner, Dr Stefan Popper. The Inquests will
commence on Wednesday, 18 April 1990 and on this and the following
day, the venue will be the Memorial Hall (rear of Sheffield City
Hall), Holly Street, Sheffield. Thereafter until their conclusion
the venue for each Inquest will be the Medico Legal Centre, Watery
Street, Sheffield.

Advance information suggests that relatives and friends of a large
majority of the deceased will attend individual inquests in respect
of their loved one or friend. In addition, a number will travel to
hear the general evidence which will occupy much of the first day.

Social Workers of the bereaved families' areas will accompany some
of those attending relatives groups.

A solicitor, Mr Doug Fraser (Silverman & Livermore, Solicitors,
Liverpool) will act as advocate for the bereaved and is, with a few
exceptions, instructed on behalf of the Hillsborough Steering
Committee. Exceptions to this include those families represented by
Rex Makin, Solicitors of Liverpool.

A number of other "interested parties" to the hearings have been
accorded representation by H.M. Coroner and a representative will
attend on behalf of:-

South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Eastwood
& Partners and Trent Regional Fire and Civil Defence Authority.


INTENTION

Under the direction of Assistant Chief Constable, J. M. Jones, to
assist and service the needs of H.M. Coroner during the Inquest
hearings.

To facilitate the presentation of all evidence gathered into the
deaths of each individual deceased at Hillsborough, within the
parameters laid down by H.M. Coroner at the pre-Inquest Review held
on 6 March 1990, namely; the presentation of evidence in
relation to WHEN, WHERE and WHY (in the medical sense - i.e. cause
of death) each person died.
                                       - 2 -



2.3   To carry out the above two objectives in a professional, even-handed
      and sensitive manner, whilst catering for the diverse needs of the
      bereaved families, other "interested parties" and members of national
      and local media and newspaper representatives.


3.    METHOD


3.1   Individual files have been prepared, including a summary of
      evidence, supporting statements of witness, visual material and
      continuity information.

3.2   The sumamry has been circulated in all cases to Mr Fraser and the
      solicitor representing each bereaved next of kin or their nominee.

3.3   A West Midlands Officer (the "Presenting Officer") will give oral
       testimony of the summary in each case. In addition, the pathologist
      will give oral evidence of his post mortem examination and findings,
      together with any other witness whom H.M. Coroner has thought
      necessary or prudent to call to give evidence in person.

3.4   Each Presenting Officer has been allocated individual files for each
      deceased about whom he/she will give evidence.

3.5   A jury will be selected by random from a panel of Sheffield
      residents summoned for Coroner's Jury Service. A West Midlands
      officer has been appointed Jury Usher.

3.6   A List of Hearings has   been drawn    up by the Listing Officer, in
      consultation with H.M.   Coroner.     In general terms, eight cases are
      listed per day (except    18.4.90 -   two cases and 4.5.90 - 5 cases),
      although some slippage   may arise    due to a case(s) over-running its
      allotted listing slot.


4.    ADMINISTRATION

4.1   The "Coroner's Team" will be based at Furnival House, Eyre Street,
      Sheffield, within walking distance of Memorial Hall and

        profit going to local hospitals.)

        In special circumstances i.e. times of distress, officers should use
        a refreshment ticket to obtain drinks etc for the family (in
        addition to the normal allocation).

4.4     Storage and Security

        The Manageress of City Hall/Memorial Hall will provide, on request,
        rooms where documents may be securely deposited overnight.
        Alternatively, confidential documents may be deposited at Furnival
        House. Unlike Furnival House, there is no alarm
        protection of the building, although a Security Officer patrols the
        complex out of hours.

        A label badge will be worn for the purposes of officers being
        readily recognisable as police officers.


4.5     Transition from Memorial Hall to Medico Legal Centre

        At the conclusion of the hearings on Thursday, 19 April 1990 all of
        the equipment constituted in the Memorial Hall will be vacated to
        Medico Legal Centre for commencement of proceedings there at 0930
        hours, Friday, 20 April 1990.

4.6     Medico Legal Centre (Venue 19-4.90 - 4.5.90)

        The Medico Legal Centre is located some one half mile north of the
        City Centre and is the usual venue, in Sheffield, for routine
        Inquest hearings. Consequently, it does not share many of the
        problems associated with constituting a Coroner's Court, 'ad hoc',
        in a City Centre location. Further, a routine ought to have been
        established by this time regarding the attendance of families,
        media/press and members of the public alike.

4.6.1   Car Parking

        Ample on-street parking is available in the roads adjacent to the
        Medico Legal Centre. The rear car park will NOT be used.

4.6.2   Medico Legal Centre Reception

        Access to the centre for all except authorised personnel will be via
        the Watery Street entrance to the reception.

        Coroner's Team officers will be in possession of yale keys allowing
        entry via the door leading from the rear car park.

4.6.3   Families/Social Workers/Solicitors

        A room, located on the ground floor, adjacent to the reception, will
        be provided for the above parties to consult privately prior to an
        individual inquest commencing.
                                         - 9 -


4.6.4   Media/Press

        A portacabin has been provided for media/press representatives,
        given the limitation on numbers in the Centre itself permitted under
        the Fire Regulations.

        As at Memorial Hall, a 'live relay' of Inquest proceedings will be
        undertaken by Quadrant Video Services.

4.6.5   The Coroner's Court

        The Coroner's Court is located on the first floor. A one-way
        working access route into Court will be adopted; entrance via the
        Main Entrace (adjacent to the 1st floor landing) whereby the
        Presenting Officer will escort the family party from their room on
        the ground floor. Exit, following that individual hearing will be
        via a second door, via corridor to an adjacent waiting room. Having
        had the opportunity to ask any informal questions, or to regain any
        lost composure, the Presenting Officer may then escort the group
        away from the premises, to make their own way, or to a nearby
        facility (see next paragraph).

4.6.6   Crookesmoor Community Centre

        Sheffield Social Services, Hillsborough Task Team have provided
        facilities in this Centre, situated in Addy Street, Crookesmoor.
        This may be utilised as a convenient location for the bereaved,
        those who accompany them, and, where necessary, Presenting Officers
        to debrief or discuss the proceedings. Light refreshments will be
        provided there, arranged by Social Services.

4.6.7   Refreshments

        Arrangements as for Memorial Hall (see paragraph 4.4).

4.6.8   West Midlands Police Crew Room

        A second portacabin is situated in the vicinity of the rear car park
        for use by West Midlands personnel.

        A Max Pax machine, supplies and kettle will be on hand there. One
        telephone which may be used either (a) as an exchange line or (b) as
        an extension to the Medico Legal Centre telephone system.

        A desk top photocopier will also be available.


5.      COMMUNICATIONS


5.1     Telephone exchange facilities are available at Furnival House and
        Medico Legal Centre. Portable telephones are issued to ACC Jones,
        Detective Superintendent Beechey and Inspector Sawers.
                                          - 10 -



5.2   All officers will be in possession of their issued "bleeps".        (See
       separate list.)

5.3   Fax facilities are available at both Furnival House and Medico Legal
       Centre (Office, off reception).

5.4   Briefing

       A briefing will be held in the Briefing Room at Furnival House at
       1900 hours, Tuesday, 17 April 1990 under the direction of ACC J.M.

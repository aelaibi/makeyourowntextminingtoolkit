Mr. Allan Green, Q.C.,
Direcor of Public Prosecutions,
Headquarters,
4-12 Queen Anne’s Gate,
LONDON.  SW1H 9AZ.


Dear Director of Public Prosecutions,

Your recent decision to not proceed with prosecutions against
individuals or organisations involved in the Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster disturbs and perplexes this Authority, given the weight,
emphasis and clarity of evidence already available on public record.

I request that you provide this Authority with all the relevant
criteria, utilised by the Crown Prosecution Service in this instance, in
formulating your decision.

For your information a formal protest has been forwarded to the Home
Secretary on this matter.

Yours sincerely,




Councillor Harry Chase,
Chair,
Hillsborough Working Party.

                   Thank you for your letter of 6th September 1990 addressed to
                   the Director of Public Prosecutions about the Hillsborough
                   Football Stadium disaster and the decision not to institute
                   any criminal proceedings. The letter has been passed to me
                   for reply.

                   The possibility of criminal proceedings being instituted was
                   given the most careful consideration.  The same evidential
                   criterion was applied in this case as is applied in all cases
                   considered by the Crown Prosecution Service.  This criterion,
                   set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, is whether or not
                   there is a realistic prospect of a conviction based on the
                   available evidence.

                   The case was thoroughly investigated by the West Midlands
                   Police.  The investigation produced extensive evidence; and in
                   addition, all the evidence and documentation received by Lord
                   Justice Taylor's Public Enquiry was made available to the
                   Crown Prosecution Service.  After a very full and thorough
                   scrutiny of all this material, the Director concluded that the
                   evidence was not sufficient for there to be a realistic
                   prospect of convicting any person or corporate body of any
                   criminal offence. In reaching this conclusion the Director had
                   the benefit of the advice of two experienced Leading Counsel.




                                                                                                       c o ntd. ..

the Director's decision.  I can assure you, however, that the
decision was.reached only after the most careful deliberation
and analysis of all the available evidence and the relevant
law.

      Dear Sir,

      Re: Hillsborough Enquiry


      British justice - NO - how can lawyers or any persons connected with the
      judiciary advocate a parallel between the police at Hillsborough and the
      Zeebrugge tragedy (Daily Mail front page 5th August)

      Police officers are homo-sapiens - NOT ROBOTS - they do the job they do
      because, on the whole, they are a caring sector of our sick society. Perhaps
      there were errors of judgement and slow responses to the overwhelming horror
      of the unfolding cataclysm BUT can any other human being be adamantly certain
      of his or her reactions to any given set of circumstances?

      In the case of the Zeebrugge disaster ALL the passengers were innocent and
      faultless. This cannot be said of the Hillsborough situation when, had all
      the supporters had tickets, arrived on time and behaved in a civilised and
      sober manner, this calamity would never have occurred and my thoughts to-day
      need not be with the police officers involved. These officers must be already
      extremely distressed after such a harrowing experience.

      It is time our police force received the support it deserves in its frequently
      thankless and dangerous task of maintaining law and order in situations which
      are often very volatile.

Deal Sir,
                                    HILLSBOROUGH,
            Having SOT read the actual report, (please send me a copy), only the
    Daily ikpiess version (which is most likely -wrong), but still I feel I must write
you,      The Police, either collectively 02 individually, cannot of course be
    charged vdth manslaughter as yon must know; and you should ring Inspector
    Duckenfield now to reduce his and his family’s anguish slightly, as soon as
    possible.    The persons who caused the manslaughter were other Liverpool fans,
    either known 01 unknown.    The Police may have failed to prevent it, out it is
    the persons who IX) it who are charged*    A father is not guilty of murder, when,
    having let his child play out, the child gets murdered, liven though it could,he
    said that he should have foreseen it and kept the-child in.
                The Police did not push and shove, or try to get xn the ground without
    tickets, or be drunk; it was the fans tiho did that.      The fans should be able to conducl
    themselves seasonably, even if there were no Police there at all.       Other people
    have to do so when shopping in crowds or queuing in a motorway holdup.        Had Chief
    Inspector Duckenfield not opened the gates the crush "would have been outside;
    he would then have been blamed for keeping them closed.       Someone else also
    thought they should he opened, and they had only a second to ctecxde; not all
    night like Justice Taylor.     It’s all very well knowing what should have been done
    with hindsight#
                it must he significant that both matches resulting in loss of life by
     crushing     involved Liverpool fans. When Belgium prosecuted the fans, no one,
     not even Justice Taylor spoke up to say the police shpuLd nave been prosecuted
     and not the fans*
                The fans and their representatives now think they have been cleaned of

     all blame.
                The Police may be inefficient, 1 think generally speaking they are;
     but it must be difficult to be efficient at a job like that.
            I            hope you read this yourself, not just one of your underlings 5
     although I doubt whether you will even see it.       Please send a copy to

            R Edey Esq




            Dear Mr Edey

            I refer to your recent correspondence to the Chief Constable of South
            Yorkshire Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Right
            Honourable Lord Justice Taylor.  The correspondence has been passed to
            me by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police.

            I am, responsible, on behalf of Mr G Dear, Chief Constable of West
            Midlands Police, for the conduct of the investigation into the events at
            Hillsborough on 15 April 1989-   My responsibilities are not only to
            service the needs of Lord Justice Taylor's Judicial Inquiry, but also to
            provide the necessary facts for the Coroner's Inquests into the 95 who
            died, which at this time are scheduled to commence early next year.
            Consequently the enquiries we are undertaking are most thorough.   If,
            during the course of assembling the evidence, allegations of criminal
            offences arise then these will be dealt with via normal procedures.
            However, at this stage, there is still a lot to be done before we are in
            a position to consider the issues you raise.

            I am grateful for your letter and I have noted your concern.

            I .have passed a copy of the letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions
            for his information.

            Yours sincerely




                                                                                 (j- 7 A U G 1989




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT            Birm.ing.hain.
18th May 1989.


The Director of Public Prosecutions,

Westminster,
London.

Dear Sir,

Disaster at Hillsborough.

     Would you please let me know as soon as possible whether you intend
to institute proceedings against the Directors of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club for manslaughter of those who died in Hillsborough stadium
on 15th April 1989.

     Mr. Justice Taylor went on record at a preliminary hearing, before
taking any evidence, that he would not be looking at a crime having been
committed or apportioning blame for what occurred.

     The terrible fire at Bradford four years ago made it clear beyond
all reasonable doubt that there must be immediate access to the pitch
in an emergency. The government guidelines published in 1986 lays this
down as a requirement for safety at football grounds. I would hardly
have thought that anybody with a grain of common sense could have looked
at it in any other way. Had there been fencing not allowing access to
the pitch at Bradford, instead of 56 deaths, the death toll would almost
certainly have been numbered in hundreds.

     Yesterday, Mr. Trevor Hicks testified to the Taylor Enquiry that
he saw one of his daughters being manhandled over the fencing. It had
unfortunately been too late and both his daughters died in the crush.
Mr Hicks tells me he is willing to testify at a trial for manslaughter.

     It is in the public interest that the gross criminal negligence which
has occurred is brought home to football management. If the sanction
of the criminal law is not invoked, further tragedies are much more
likely. The deaths which occurred at Hillsborough were wholly avoidable.

     Had access to the pitch been available whatever the circumstances
outside the ground those penned behind the fencing could have been allowed
on to the pitch before the police felt obliged to open the gate. Hie
police outside could have informed the Security Officer inside that they
had an emergency on their hands and to relieve pressure they needed to
open the gate. He could then have ordered the opening of the fencing
allowing access to the pitch before the gate was opened and no deaths
would have ensued.
     I have to tell you, sir, that if you inform me that you do not intend
to prosecute in this matter I will, in the public interest, be seeking
judicial review of the decision of the Stipendiary Magistrate at Sheffield
given on the 3rd May, refusing me consent for a private prosecution.

Yours faithfully,

       Dear Sir

       I have been asked to reply to your letter of 18 September sent
       to the Solicitor-General, but addressed to the Office of the
       Director of Public Prosecutions.

      At the present time a full criminal investigation is being
      conducted by the West Midlands Police in to the disaster which
      occurred at the Hillsborough football ground in April of this
      year.  When this enquiry is complete the Director of Public
      Prosecutions will consider the evidence that has been obtained
      and a decision will be reached upon prosecution.

      I return herewith a further letter addressed to the Department
      of the Environment which appears to have -been inadvertently
      enclosed with the letter which I have referred to above.

      Yours faithfully

   lavish funds for the improve­
   ment of grounds.
      Considering the general tenor
  of the report it is surprising that
  rt should recommend the atten­
  dance of more policemen at
  matches; surely it would be b e t-'
  ter if these discredited people j
  kept well away from them in
  future and left arrangements to
 the good sense of the partici­
 pants, including the players.
     An advantage of this for ec­
 centrics who do not think pro­
 fessional football is the most
 important activity which goes
on in this country might be that
policemen excused from attend­
ing matches could spend more
tim e catching muggers and
other criminals and making the
streets safer for their potential
victims to walk about in. But I
expect there is a fallacy in this
somewhere.

      their homes with the sun splashing around them,
      lighting up the passages all the way back to
the kitchens.
     The houses were part of Beulah Terrace. A wall separating them was only
  knee-high and had never really been noticed during the 36 years the women
  were neighbours. ‘Your roses look a treat,’ one woman said to the other.
 They grew between the stone slabs paving a small courtyard. The yard also
  had a' low wall and on the other side
  was the road. ‘I’ve been pleased with

                 22 September 1989

                 The Director of Public Prosecutions
                 4 Queen Anne's Gate
                 Westminster
                 London
                 SW1.


                 Dear Sir

                 Disaster at Hillsborough

                 I feel that I must pursue with you my contention that there is a prima
                 facie case of manslaughter against the Directors of Sheffield Wednesday
                 Football Club. In this connection I refer to my letter to you of the
                 18th May, and your reply of the 3rd June.

                 I understand from Mr J Mervyn Jones that the correspondence I conducted with
                 the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, and the Right Honorable
                 Lord Justice Taylor has been passed to you by him for your information.
                 I do not know whether you have a copy of a letter written to me by Mr T Watson BA
                 Assistant Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police dated the 15th June
                 and so I enclose a copy. I also enclose a copy of Mr J Mervyn Jones letter
                 to me of the 2nd August.

                 The deaths and serious injuries which occurred in Hillsborough Stadium on
                 the 15th April must be laid at the door of the football club. They knew
                 that the Liverpool spectators could not be properly accommodated on the Lepping
                 Lane terraces. They knew that serious crushing of spectators had occurred
                 in 1981 and that there were broken arms, legs and rites requiring hospital
                 treatment. They knew that on that occasion the gates had to be opened and
                 about 250 spectators used the pitch as a place for safety. They knew that
                 the police said after that incident that 10,100 was too high a figure for
                 safety on those terraces. The figure was not reduced.

                 The 1981 incident led to the terraces being sub-divided into pens. They
                 did nothing to ensure that those pens were properly monitored so that they
                 were not overfilled unsafely. They did nothing to ensure that there was
                 immediate access to the pitch as a place of safety in an emergency as laid
                 down by Paragraph 215 of the Government's Green Guide. In fact the gates
                 in the perimeter fencing were not designed as exits thereby ensuring that
                 in an emergency there was no means of escape. Having had previous warning
                 in a crushing incident that such access would be required in an emergency
                 such conduct is so grossly negligent it must be looked upon as criminal.




                                                                             ’'"it
                                                                                 *

           It was in fact the cause of the disaster. Had the perimeter fencing allowed
           access to the pitch the pressure in pens 3 and 4 could have been relieved
           and Gate C need not have been opened until a sufficient number of spectators
           had gone on the pitch to enable the 2400 spectators outside the ground to
           be assimilated on the terraces without death and injury resulting.

           In any event Lord Justice Taylor finds in Paras 108 and 112 of his interim
           report that only 21 of the dead and only 30% of those who were injured entered
           through Gate C after it opened at 2.52 pm. in other words 74 of the deaths
           and 511 of the injured would have been casualties regardless of the opening
           of Gate C.

           The reason I have felt it necessary to write to you again is because Mr Mervyn
           Jones forwarded my letter to Mr Wright of the 6th July and because Mr Justice
           Taylor's interim report gives further reasons for manslaughter charges to
           be preferred against the management of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.
           I am also puzzled at the approach by the police to criminality for this disaster.

           When Mr Watson wrote to me on the 15th June the West Midlands Police had
           gathered together all the information put to Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry.
           I was told then there was no evidence to suggest the offence of manslaughter
           had been committed and accordingly no criminal charges had been brought.
           In his letter of the 2nd August Mr J Mervyn Jones told me that the West Midlands
           Police had to provide the necessary facts for the Coroners Inquests into
           the deaths. This is referred to in Paragraph 15 of Lord Justice Taylor's
           report. The final sentence reads: "I am assured by Chief Constable Dear
           and Assistant Chief Constable Mervyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further
           evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to the history of events
           which emerged at the hearing".

           Yet Mr J Mervyn Jones letter to me went on:- "If during the course of assembling
      >    the evidence (i.e. for the Coroners inquests) "allegations of criminal offences
           arise then these will be dealt with via normal procedures". If Mr Justice
           Taylor was told that it was unlikely that there will be any further significant
           evidence forthcoming these comments are difficult to understand. It would
           seem to suggest that the police had made up their mind not to lay charges
           despite what was said in the letter to me.

           What particularly exercises my mind in all this is that there is abundant
           evidence of reckless disregard of life and lint) by Sheffield Wednesday Football
           Club not for the first time and in exactly parallel circumstances which clearly
           establishes a prima facie case of manslaughter. The police should have acted
           and not concerned themselves with the Coroner's inquests. Unless it is an
           act of God violent death must be looked upon as criminal, in the first instance.
           This has not been(happening as evidenced by the Herald of Free Enterprise
           disaster where it took an unlawful killing verdict by an inquest jury and
           a further two years deliberation to decide that a ship going to sea with
           its doors open constituted a criminal offence!

           I agree it is important to be able to establish a case to put before judge
           and jury which has a reasonable chance of success. One can be too hasty.
           I believe the arrest of the captain and first mate in the recent incident
           on the River Thames to be a case in point. I read that Scotland Yard sent
           a report on this incident to you for determination within two weeks of the
           disaster I I do not believe that tragedy was any more than a problem of navigation
           which is by no means criminal. There may of course have been a look out
           problem.
- 3 -



On the other hand I have little doubt that the ignition of a pile of rubbish
under a wooden stand at a football ground which went up like a tinder box
with the loss of 56 lives amounts to manslaughter and that the Directors
of Bradford City Football Club were extremely fortunate in 1986 not to be
charged.

I enclose a copy of a letter I have written to Mr J Mervyn Jones for your
information.

Yours sincerely,

           Dear Mr Edey

           I refer to your recent correspondence to the Chief Constable of South
           Yorkshire Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Right
           Honourable Lord Justice Taylor.  The correspondence has been passed to
           me by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police.

           I am responsible, on behalf of Mr G Dear, Chief Constable of West
           Midlands Police, for the conduct of the investigation into the events at
           Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.  My responsibilities are not only to
           service the needs of Lord Justice Taylor's Judicial Inquiry, but also to
           provide the necessary facts for the Coroner's Inquests into the 95 who
           died, which at this time are scheduled to commence early next year.
           Consequently the enquiries we are undertaking are most thorough.  If,
           during the course of assembling the evidence, allegations of criminal
           offences arise then these will be dealt with via normal procedures.
           However, at this stage, there is still a lot to be done before we are in
           a position to consider the issues you raise.

            I am grateful for your letter and I have noted your concern.

            I have passed a copy of the letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions
            for his information.

            Yours sincerely

   Dear Mr Edey

   May I reply to your letter of 12 June on behalf of the Chief Constable.

   As you know the tragic events which unfolded at the Hillsborough
   Football Stadium on 15 April 1989 are being considered in the most
   intimate detail by Lord Justic Taylor's Inquiry.  An independent enquiry
   team from the West Midlands Police have conducted exhaustive enquiries
   and furnished the Inquiry with all the relevant available information.

   If it had been felt at any time during the gathering of information that
   criminal offences had been committed then the appropriate investigations
   would have been commenced.  At this stage there is no evidence to
   suggest that an offence of the nature you suggest has been committed and
   accordingly no criminal charges have been brought.

   Yours sincerely

          HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

          Your letter dated the 22 September 1989 and its enclosures,
          addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions, has been passed
          to me for reply.

          I can confirm that copies of the correspondence which you have
          conducted with the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Lord
          Justice Taylor and Mr J Mervyn Jones have been passed to the
          Crown Prosecution Service.     You will be aware that Mr Dear, the
          Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police is conducting a
          criminal  investigation to all aspects of the H il ls borough
          Disaster and that Mr Jones is responsible for the investigation
          on Mr Dear's behalf.       The Crown Prosecution Service are in
          regular contact with Mr Jones and once the invest ig at i on is
          complete a report will be submitted to the' Director of Public
          Prosecutions so that the most full and careful consideration can
          be given to the possib il it y of instituting proceedings against
          any persons or other bodies who may be criminally responsible.

          You can be assured that all the matters which you raise in your
          letter relating to the S heffield Wednesday Football Club will be
          considered.

M r J Mervyn Jones.

This publication is an excerpt from the Revised Statutes of Quebec. It has been
taken from the loose-leaf edition o f the consolidation prepared by the Direction
de la refonte des lois et des reglem ents and published by the Quebec Official
Publisher.
C onsolidation is the final stage of the legislative process. The first stage comes
when a Bill is tabled in the National Assem bly. The consideration of a Bill
com prises four stages: introduction, passage in principle, detailed consideration in
com m ittee, consideration of report from committee and passage. The Bill is then
assented to by the H onourable the Lieutenant-Governor. In the final stage, that
Bill, now an Act, is “consolidated” by the Direction de la refonte: it is added to
the other R evised Statutes. This consolidation of all the statutes in force — a
general and perm anent consolidation — is in effect an update of texts which
have been printed previously: first individually when they are tabled in the
A ssem bly, then in Part 2 of the Gazette ojficielle, and finally in the annual
com pilation of statutes.
Once the R evised Statutes have been proclaim ed in force by the Governm ent,
they becom e the law o f the land. M ost of them — in num ber around 400
— are available as separate excerpts in the sales outlets of Les Publications
du Quebec.
Readers seeking further inform ation on the contents of this statute are referred to
the Notice, at the beginning o f the publication.

                 Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry

     I refer to your letter of 23rd May 1989 to the General
     Secretary of the ACPO at New Scotland Yard which was passed
     to me for my attention, and enclose six copies of the ACPO
     Submission to your Inquiry, together with the relevant
     Appendices.   Although the bound document incorporating the
     Appendices is not marked 1Confidential1 there are some papers
     in it (e.g. the minutes of Police Conferences on Football)
     which are clearly not public documents.   I am sure you will
II   be mindful of this point in your use of the various papers.

     If there are any particular aspects upon which further police
     evidence or information is required I will be happy to oblige
     on request.

     I should mention that the formal minutes of the latest series
     of post-season police conferences on football are not yet
     available and will be forwarded in due course.

     Mr. David Phillips (Secretary of the ACPO Sub-Committee) and
     I will be glad to meet The Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Taylor if he
     wishes.

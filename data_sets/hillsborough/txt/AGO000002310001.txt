Mr. Allan'Green, Q.C.,
Direcor of Public Prosecutions,
Headquarters,
4-12 Queen Anne’s Gate,
LONDON. SW1H 9AZ.


Dear Director of Public Prosecutions,

Your recent decision to not proceed with prosecutions against
individuals or organisations involved in the Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster disturbs and perplexes this Authority, given the weight,
emphasis and clarity of evidence already available on public record.

I request that you provide this Authority with all the relevant
criteria, utilised by the Crown Prosecution Service in this instance
formulating your decision.

For your information a formal protest has been forwarded to the Home
Secretary on this matter.

Yours sincerely.




Councillor Harry Chase,
Chair,
Hillsborough Working Party

        Thank you for your letter of 6th September 1990 addressed to
        the Director of Public Prosecutions about the Hillsborough
        Football Stadium disaster and the decision not to institute
        any criminal proceedings. The letter has been passed to me
        for reply.

        The possibility of criminal proceedings being instituted was
        given the most careful consideration.  The same evidential
        criterion was applied in this case as is applied in all cases
        considered by the Crown Prosecution Service.  This criterion,
        set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, is whether or not
        there is a realistic prospect of a conviction based on the
        available evidence.

        The case was thoroughly investigated by the West Midlands
        Police. The investigation produced extensive evidence; and in
        addition, all the evidence and documentation received by Lord
        Justice Taylor's Public Enquiry was made available to the
        Crown Prosecution Service. After a very full and thorough
        scrutiny of all this material, the Director concluded that the
        evidence was not sufficient for there to be a realistic
        prospect of convicting any person or corporate body of any
        criminal offence. In reaching this conclusion the Director had
        the benefit of the advice of two experienced Leading Counsel.




                                                                                           contd...

I am sorry that you and your colleagues are not satisfied with
the Director's decision^ I cart assure you, however, that the
decision was .reached only after the most careful . j deliberation
and; analysis of all/the. available evidence and the relevant
law.

intention          of    passing             through.              I shouted                  at       some    and        as    many       ^s

using       the    horse          as    a    barrier         we     were               able       to    filter        out       of       this

 running.           It       looked      as     though       a    confrontation                    was    imminent.               I went

 beyond       the     half      way       line       and    made       uniformed              officers           form       up    in a

 the    p r o g r e s s of    the     Liverpool             fans.        Some       of       t h e m were,           crying,               Some

 were    frustrated.                 Some       were       angry.            It    did       not    help       to h e a r        the       mass

 of    Notts,       fans       tiehind         chanting          and     goading.              They       seemed        unaware             of

 the    tragedy.

 4,H0pm             This       was       the    first       lull        in    the       sequence          of     events          since       I

 left    the     police         room.           I looked          at    my        watch       it w a s     4,20pm.               I became

 aware      that      my      radio       was     still       working.              There          were     public          address

 announcements               and     the       ground       slowly           emptied.

 5.00pm             Given       hot       drinks.           Mustered              serials          in N o r t h     Stand         and

 spoke     to    officers            distressed             by    experiences.

 About     5.30pm              I went          to g y m n a s i u m     which       was       being       used as           a    temporary

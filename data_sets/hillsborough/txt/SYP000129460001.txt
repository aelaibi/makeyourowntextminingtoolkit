            Step 2: Draw line from intersection on reference line to walking speed
                                                                                                                                          ISL
                    ( —2.0). N ote intersection on width o f corridor scale.
            Width o f corridor «=* 2.2 m for higher fire intensity
                                   1.35 m for lower fire intensity

         5.4 Effect of rate o f movement. I f it is expected that because o f numbers or
         infirmity people using the escape route would probably be forced to move much
         more slowly than the assumed speed o f 2.0 m/s, then a corridor o f greater width                                                       75 L
         should be provided. In the example o f 5.3.1 the minimum corridor width, for an
         assumed speed o f movement o f 0.2 m /s, would be 5.8 m at the higher fire
         intensity and 3.7 m at the lower fire intensity. If such widths were not practicable,
         it might be necessary to reduce the glazed area, or at least to keep it well above
         floor level to allow people to lessen the exposure to radiation by crouching
                                                                                                                                                    Glazed
         down as they pass the glazing.                                                                                                            'screen            A) VERTICAL SCREEN

         6.1 Requirements for rooflights. Normally there is no need for rooflights to have
         fire resistance in relation to internal fire, but where they form part o f the ceiling
         it will be necessary to ensure that their internal surfaces have a certain minimum
         flame-spread classification and to restrict their number, area and disposition.
         R oofs may be required to withstand external fire from such hazards as radiation
         and burning brands. BS 476: Part 3 gives details o f fire tests from which roofs
         may be given designations. With suitable fixings, supports and joints, all forms         Limit of zone

-.Dear Sirs,
                Sheffield Wednesday Foofcball Club Ltd.
                      ' Phase II Contract
        Thahk you for your letter dated 24 July.
        Whereas we cannot deny that Messrs. Tarmac have been
working at the bottom of Splon Kop we believe you have weakened
your case for an extension because only three or four men
were at the ground during last week.        More labour could have
been gainfully employed on other critical items.          For an
example# wo r k c o u l d have commenced on the tunnel at the North
end of Spion Kop.                     /
     We agree that more breaking out on the West stand has
been necessary.      The additional work involves demolishing a
f a t h e r 175mm of slab and forming a chase into the front
beam.
        Two days elapsed, Friday, 20 and Monday, 23 July without
any work being carried out on this critical operation of breaking
out.      For this reason it is unlikely that we will grant an
extension to the contract.
        If you are confident that work can be completed on programme
by working overtime and employing more men we have no reason to
refuse permission for these steps to be taken.
Your enclosed programme though showing progress to date and
Main Contractors work does not indicate final completion.       we
assume that all the work will be done by 11 August but it is
of vital importance that you discuss the delivery of the
steelwork with Peter Ward Engineering and together provide a
finished programme.
     There is no mention in your programme of the work to b©
completed after 11 August.   Though these items are not
critical they do want completing as soon as possible.   Would
you therefore extend the programme to include this work.


                             Yours faithfully.

       We have today inspected the clips completed by your workman
yesterday.          Th© workmanship on most of the clips is far from
s a t i s f a c t o r y . B o l t h o l e s and edges have been cut using burning
equipment which is contrary to the specification.                 Many of the

Dear Sirs., ...
                        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.,
                        Phase II Contract
      Thank you for your letter dated 23 July requesting permission
to use concrete supplied by Messrs. Trumix.
      We are willing to grant permission providing the Specification
is met in full.            You must be satisfied that concrete can be placed
within the time limit specified if their batching plant in Warren
Street is used.            It is also of vital importance that the batched
weights are given on the delivery tickets and we wish you to obt*in
their agreement to comply with this requirement.
      Would you also please forward for our examination, before
any concrete is delivered, details of the mix to bn used and the
alive analysis for both fine and course aggregates.




                                       Yours faithfully.

             Dear Dr. Eastwood,

             I wonder if you would be good enough to let me have the position
             to-date for the work being undertaken to qualify for our certificate
             of numbers to be admitted to the stadium.

             If you would indicate either in writing or by the use of a gant chart,
             the programme that you have for the whole of this work to be completed,
             bearing in mind that our first home match is August 11th, I would
             be greatly obliged.

             Dust refresh my memory please, how do we apply for the necessary
             certificate or is that the need to be supplied by Mr Eric England

   Dear Sirs,
                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d . ,

           We thank you for your letter dated 24th July 1979 in
      respect of the above and note your comments.

           We are also concerned that we have been delayed                                          oncertain
      sections for reasons which are outside our control.

           We did write to you on the 18th July about obstructions                                                   at
      the Spion Kop end effecting items 23, 25 and 40

              To-day the 24-th July Tarmac are still working on the Spion
      Kop,

           The work to the West Stand has been delayed by the
      additional work involved in the cantilever slab*  The shuttering
      to this slab would have been completed by now if we had not had
      this additional breaking out work.

           In view of this delay we consider it not unreasonable to
      request an extension and under the circumstances request your
      favourable consideration in this respect.

           We shall however use our best endeavours to expedite the
      contract and consider that overtime working may be a solution
      to the problem to bring us back on programme.

           We enclose with our detailed programme for each section of
      the contract for your observations and comments.

      Yours faithfully,
                                                                                                                                                       f-c.                 L - r b .,

      Present:                                    Mr.                                   - Tarmac Construction Ltd.
                                                  Mr.               J. Strange          - Eastwood & Partners


      5.1       Previous Minutes
                                                  The m i n u t e s of site mee t i n g No.                           ^ , held on 21 June,
                were approved as a true drecord of the proceedings.                                                                      The
                originals were signed b y Mr.                                               Strange.


      5.2       Progress
                                                  Mr.                            reported that all posts would be
                concreted b y either Friday,                                              20 July,           or early Monday,            23 July.
                The contract work would then be complete w i t h the exception
                of site welding the rails followed by painting.


      5.3       Delivery of Steelwork
                                                   Mr.                            said that since Tuesday,                   11 July,
                completion of the work had been delayed because certain lengths
                of handrail had not been delivered b y S haw Engineering Ltd.
                The m issing steel had been delivered on 17 July, but this
                resulted in two concrete pours being postponed.                                                                   Mr.
                said that                           all steelwork was n ow on site.
                                                   The base plates for the barrier posts on the N.W.
                terrace had not yet been returned to site by Shaw Engineering

                                                                      Registered in E ngland — No. 1134531

       5.4      Information required by Contractor
                                 Mr.          confirmed that there was no
               outstanding information required critical to the
               progress of the work.


      5.5      Testing Existing Barriers
                                 Mr. Strange said that testing on the West terrace
               was finished and approximately one third of the barriers on
               Spion Kop had been tested.            It was already evident that
               a few rails would require replacement together with clips
               and bolts.            Instructions would be passed to Shaw
               Engineering Ltd.         so that replacement materials could be
               ordered for the whole of the remedial work.
                                 This work will not involve the Main Contractor
               except that any new items fitted would require painting.
                                 It was agreed that Messrs.   Tarmac should leave
               site once their contract work was complete.             Shaw
               Engineering Ltd. would return to do the remedial work
               on barriers that had failed to satisfy the load test and
               when replacement was complete Tarmac would return to do
               the final painting.


      5.6      Next Meeting
                                 It was agreed that no further formal site
               meetings were necessary.

                       Minutes of Site Meeting No.                                            1 held on Tuesday 10 July 1979


                 Present
                                     Mr. E. England                                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

                                                                                            Hallamshire Builders Ltd.

                                     Mr.              J. Strange                            Eastwood & Partners


1.1                   Site Establishment and Access
                            Mr.                                              said that he wished to bring two cabins to
                      site.               t was agreed that one would be positioned adjacent to
                      Messrs.            T a r m a c ’s cabin behind the North stand.                                         Access to this
                      area would be from Penistone Road.
                            The second cabin would be located behind the West stand
                      wit h access gained from Leppings Lane.                                                    Mr. Strange advised
                      Mr.                                             that the gate at this end was not high enough
                      to allow access for a ready mixed concrete lorry.
                            Mr. England requested that he be contacted when the
                      cabin for the West stand arrived.                                                 He would then agree its exact
                      location.


1.2                   Working Hours
                            Mr.                                              said that the basic working day would be
                      between 08.00 to 17.00.                                            Mr. England agreed that arrangements
                      could be made for leaving gates open after 17.00 if required.




                                                                         Registered in England - No. 1134531
                                                                     SHEET 2.

      Access into the ground at weekends would not cause problems
      providing sufficient notice was given.


1.3   Security
            Mr. England requested that Hallamshire Builders site
      staff be vigilant and warn off any unauthorised persons that
      may enter the ground through unattended gates.
            Mr. Strange said that no persons, other than the club
      ground staff,    are to go on the pitch.


1.4   Information Required by Contractor
            Mr,           requested copies of the bar schedules.
      Mr.   Strange handed these over wit h the exception of those
      for the staircase at the rear of Spion Kop.
            Mr.           then gave to Mr.   Strange a short   list of
      items requiring qualification.      Mr. Strange said that as
      these involved structural details he would provide the
      information after the meeting.


1.5   Hut adjacent to Spion Kop.
            Mr.           asked about the contents of the hut
      located at the East end of the South stand seated terracing.
      Mr.   England explained that this hut was used to serve
      refreshments to spectators on Spion Kop and requested that
      it be moved onto the Spion Kop terrace.      Mr.         said this
      would necessitate building the hut on a brick wall to provide
      a level base.    It was agreed that the hut should be dismantled,
      stored for a short period at the position indicated on the
      drawing and re-erected in its new location after completion
      of the new emergency exit.


1.6   Gates at Lepping Lane End
            Mr.        asked whether the pitch perimeter gates at the
      L e p p i n g ’s Lane end were to be altered in a similar way to that
      indicated at the Spion Kop end.     Mr. Strange said that South
                                                                         SHEET   3 .

      Yorkshire County Council had not requested any alterations
       and it was not intended to do any work on these.            Mr. England
      said that he thought it advisable that better exits be
      considered at this end of the ground for the benefit of the
      Police and St.          Johns attendants.    Mr. Strange said he would
      discuss this with the South Yorkshire Constabulary and
      instruct the Contractor accordingly.


1.7   Programme
             Mr.                 said that he could not provide a programme
      until after holding discussions with the steelwork supplier.
      However, w ork would commence on site later in the week.            The
      parapet walls on the West stand would be demolished together
      with the Spion Kop pitch perimeter wall at the four new gate
      positions.        Preparing the damaged terracing ready for repair
      with    ’R e e b a f i l l ’ would also be started.


1.8   Nomination of Steelwork Sub-Contractor
             Mr. Strange said that it was proposed to nominate Peter
      Ward Engineering as the sub-contractor for the steelwork.
      Mr.                   said that he would have no objections to this
      nomination.           Mr. Strange said he would write to Hallamshire
      Builders and then inform Peter Ward Engineering of the
      a p p o i ntm en t.


1.9   Concrete Supplier
             Mr.                said that he proposed to use concrete
      supplied by R.M.C Ltd., collected in small batches from their
      Callywhite Lane depot.           Mr. Strange said that this was unlikely
       to be accepted because of the long travelling distance.            If
      R.M.C.       Ltd were still to be considered as the supplier their
      nearby Hollywell Road depot w oul d probably be acceptable.
      Mr.    Malthouse agreed to submit formal proposals after discussions
      wit h his supplier.

Dear Sirs,
                      Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                       Certificate of Ground Safety
         Mr. England has passed to us a copy of your letter
of 5 JUly.
         It is in fact correct to point out that various
documents were sent to representatives of the disciplines on
the Working Party on 21 June and that no copies were sent
directly to you.       This was, of course, intentional.       Prom
the beginning we have understood that informal consultation
could take place with the various disciplines without your
office being involved.       At various times we have held meetings,
carried out inspections and have agreed matters over the telephone
As part of this same informal procedure we sent copies of our
tender d i v i n g s for stage 2 of the wnfck to the various members
of the Working Party who might wish to suggest amendments.            A
number    Of   changes have in fact been made as a result of
thisconsultation including, for example, a change to the layout
of the steps round the exits in the North stand and the fitting
of three; hinges to the emergency gates leading on to the pitch
instead of two.       The drawings have now been modified and
were re-issued to the contractor earlier this week.         This
    informal way of achieving agreement has been most useftfl to us
    and we believe it would not have been appropriate for you to
    be sent copies of all the provisional drawings, many of which
    were to be changed within a f e w ‘days*
                 Sfe trust we can continue to work in this way with the
    third and final stage of the structural work which involves
    upgrading the fire protection in the South stand and a few
    other minor matters.                                             Once we have received approval to our
    proposals from the technical members of the Working Party, we
    will then deposit with you a complete set of the drawings
    which show the "as built" construction.
                 We will, if you so wish, send yew copies Of all the
    provisional drawings but we would strongly prefer that these
    should not be distributed through your office since this
    would inevitably lead to delays.                                                       It is now apparent that
    t&e great majority of the work will be complete before the
    start of the season but we are trying to have as few items as
    possible unfinished at that time.                                                           Using your office as a
    postbox would be certain to result in a greater proportion of
    unfinished work.
                 May I add that we have much appreciated being able to
    work in this informal and constructive way and we Consider our
                                  June to be part of the informal procedure.                                                It
    was     n   o t     in^tnded to be dilcourteous to your offioe,

             Type B l. Posts for the ramp to the rear of the Kop were promised for
             delivery on Saturday, 14th July. A t the time of w riting, none of these
             materials, critical to completion of the contract, have been delivered
             and in consequence conrete ordered for today has had to be cancelled.

             It has been minuted at the progress meetings that there would be no
            problems in supplying the balance of outstanding material to the contract
            to meet the programme requirements. This is now clearly not the case and
            we would inform yourselves that should this contract now over-run, any
            cosrs or hquiaarea damages incurred by ourselves w iii be levied against

                 With regard to the raker plates for the Type J strengthening
                posts, it was arranged in con{unction with M r.             and
                M r.        k hen ^ e provisional 3 N o . plates were fixed,
                that owing to the fact that the "style 3" Bolts would not pass
                through a 22 mm d ia . hole, then the drillings in the plates
                would be acceptable drilled at 24/25 mm.        A ll the remaining
                plates have been delivered to site on Friday, 13th July at
                22 mm diameter and in consequence only the vertical bolts
                ha^e been fixe d , the horizontal bolts can be fixed after the
                plates have been re -d rille d .

      Further to the telephone conversation with M r. Strange of today
      and to our copy letter to Messrs. Shaw Engineering of today's date,
      it appears likely that the contract may over-run through shortage
      of materials.

       Whi 1st we w ill endeavour to complete the contract on time    "“"T
       (pending immediate delivery of materials), should the contract    !
       over-run because of the above situation, then we must seek
       from yao welvcs, an extension of time with costs*

      2.1            Previous Minutes
                                Mr,                                               said that he wished to have recorded that
                     Messrs.               Tarmac had not yet completed their work on Spion Kop.
                     Mr.     Strange had said at the last meeting that Tarmac s hould be
                     finished at the front of Spion Kop by Friday 13 July.                                                                     The
                     remainder of the minutes were accepted as a true record of
                     the proceedings.                                            The originals were signed by Mr.                       Strange.


      2.2            Programme
                                Mr                                                tabled an unfinished programme for the
                     critical items of wor k to be completed by 11 August.                                                                     The
                     finished programme would be forwarded to Eastwood & Partners
                     after Hallamshire Builders Ltd.                                                had discussed the delivery
                     of the steelwork with Peter Ward Engineering.


       2.3           Progress
                                Mr.                                               reported progress on the critical items

                      (a)        New Exit at East end of South Stand open seating
                                Demolition had been completed and the existing metal
                                 fence removed.                                     The t i m b e r hut would be moved and

                   shuttering erected by the end of the week.     Posts and
                   handrails would be delivered by Friday 27 July.      It
                   was agreed that the handrails should be welded on
                   site to ensure that good alignment was achieved.

             (b)   Remedial Work to Areas of Damaged Terracing
                   The nosings of steps at Leppings Lane end were almost
                   complete.   Relevelling the steps under the West stand,
                   North end, would be done during the week commencing
                   Monday 6 August.

                   Breaking out areas of terracing on Spion Kop continued
                   though the presence of Messrs.    Tarmac was delaying work
                   at the South side.   Mr.             added- that the total
                   area to be concreted was slightly larger than indicated
                   on the drawing because it included covering the new
                   post foundations installed by Messrs.    Tarmac.   Mr.
                   Strange said that all the work was subject to final
                   remeasurement and Hallamshire Builders Ltd. would be
                   paid for areas actually concreted.

             (c)   New Emergency Exits at the bottom of Spion Kop
                   The perimeter wall had been cut out and the mesh
                   fencing and posts removed.     Delivery of the new gate
                   frames was now the critical item for completion.

             (d)   New Precast Concrete Step Units and Barriers in North Stand
                   The seats had been taken out last week and drilling the
                   holes for the locating dowels was in progress.      The precast
                   units were being manufactured and would be fixed during
                   the week commencing 30 July.     Once the barriers had been
                   delivered the insitu landings could then be cast.

             (e)   New Escapes from West Stand
                   Demolition would be complete by the end of the day.
                   Mr.            said that he wished to make a writt en request
                   for an extension to the contract period for this work
                   because of the additional breaking out necessary after it
                   had been discovered that the existing reinforcement had
                                                                    SHEET     3

               been cast too low down In the original cantilever slab.

               Demolition to the boundaries shown on the tender drawings
               had been substantially completed by Thursday 19 July
               but not trimmed back to a neat line.

               Mr.   Strange emphasised the importance of casting these
               slabs before 3 August so that they were capable of
               sustaining loads by the first home match on 11 August.

         (f)   Alterations to Exit from North side of Spion Kop
               This work had not started.    Mr.    Strange said that there
               was no reason for this delay.       The tunnel had been
               cleared by Messrs.   Tarmac on Thursday 19 July.


   2.4   Labour Employed
               Mr.   Strange asked how many men had been employed on the
         contract during the previous week.        Mr.           replied
         that five or six had been employed either at the ground or
         making the precast step units.     Only three m e n had been
         employed yesterday but seven today including the sub-contract
         driller.
               Mr.   Strange suggested that more men should be brought
         to the ground to supplement the present numbers and requested
         that daily labour returns be sent to Eastwood and Partners
         at the end of each week.


   2.5   Delivery of Reinforcement
               Mr.             reported that reinforcement for the contract,
         with the exception of the staircase at the rear of Spion Kop
         would be delivered today.     Copies of the reinforcement drawings
         had been handed over by Mr.    Strange before the meetings


   2.6   Delivery of Structural Steelwork
               Mr.             agreed to pressure Peter Ward Engineering
         for the delivery of the following items, which are critical
         to progress.

               (a)    Gates for the new exits at the b ottom of Spion Kop.
               (b)    Handrails and posts for the new exit at the East
                      end of South Stand.
                                                                        SHEET     4

                 (c)   Barriers for the North Stand exits.
                 (d)   Front posts and rails for the West Stand exits.


   2.7    Gates at Leppings Lane End
                 Mr.   Strange said that a decision had been made to
          improve access onto the perimeter track at three of the
          existing gate positions.      Hallamshire Builders Ltd. would
          be instructed accordingly and the work added to the present
          contract.     The work would be done during the season between
          home matches and the fencing made secure before each match.
          It was agreed that the work be discussed in detail at a
          later meeting.


   2.8    Information Required by Contractor
                 Mr.            requested copies of the latest revisions
          of the drawings showing the West Stand exits.         Mr.   Strange
          said these would be issued that afternoon.      Mr.
          confirmed that there was no other outstanding information
          required critical to the work but reinforcement schedules
          for the staircase at the rear of Spion Kop would be wanted

                              The minutes of site meeting No 3,                                                held on 21 June, were
                approved as a true record of the proceedings.                                                               The originals
                were signed by Mr. Strange.
      ,3 Progress
                              Mr                                    reported that work on the west terrace was
                completed,                     with the exception of welding and painting 'x'
                type rails,                       on Friday 22 June.
                              Excavation for bases on the Spion Kop began on
                Monday 25 June and was continuing on programme.                                                                 The majority
                of the bases would be excavated by Friday 6 July.                                                                     Mr
                said that scaffolding erected by the Jehovah's Witnesses,
                across the South exit from the Spion Kop was restricting movements
                of materials.                                Mr Strange said he was aware of the difficulty.
                Mr                                 confirmed that access was still clear through the
                tunnel and ajong the ramp at the North side.




                                                                         Registered in England - No. 1134531

 4.4 Delivery of Steelwork
             Mr.           again confirmed that delivery of steelwork
       was far enough in advance of excavation for the wor k to
       continue on programme.       Mr. _____   said that the steelwork for
       the additional handrails shown on drawing 1610/12xA would be
       delivered from the suppliers during the we e k commencing
       9 July.
 4.5   Information required by Contractor
             Mr.         explained that because the existing rails were
       corroded it was proving difficult to weld on the new
       'x' type rails.    Mr. Strange said that a decision on the action
       to be taken would depend on the results of the load tests.               If
       the existing rails failed the test,        new ones would be provided,
       but if they passed,    a sleeve would be welded over the new and
       existing rails to provide a suitable connection.
        ,    Mr.         confirmed that the badly corroded bolts and
       ohipe- on the west terrace selected after the last meeting,            had
       been replaced wit h new.      Tes ti ng these barriers could now
       proceed.
 4.6 North West Corner Terrace
             Mr.    Strange said that the existing barriers strengthened
       by the insertion     of a new post,      type J, had been successfully
       tested.     The remaining posts could            be manufactured and
                                                 novJ
       installed.                                       ^
 4.7 Spion Kop,      Existing Barriers
             Mr. Strange said that he would inspect,          after the meeting,
       the existing barriers for any obvious signs of weakness.               These
       w o uld be remedied prior to testing.       Mr.          said he would
       make notes of any necessary wor k and make arrangements for the
       work to be carried o u t .
 4.8 Paint
             Mr.    Strange confirmed that       China blue,   with undercoat 18,
       by Crown     Paints, was the colour      given to him by S.W.F.C.        Ltd.
                                                                       SHEET    3 .



EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




        He suggested that the apparent mismatch wi t h the existing colour
        was due to the effects of weather on the old p a i n t .
  4.9   Tunnel on Spion Kop
               Mr.          said that,   although not noted on the drawings,
        the existing fence round the top of the tunnel entrance had
                             5haw/
        been cut away by -Staw Engineering Ltd.         Mr. Strange requested
        that any records of time spent on this operation be submitted
        promptly.
    10 Weather and Obstructions
               Mr .            confirmed that no delays had resulted from
        inclement weather and that no further obstructions had been
        encounted during excavation.
  4.11 Next Meeting
               The next site meeting will be held on We dnesday 18 July

Dear Mr. England,
              Report on Tenders for the Construction of New
           Emergency Exits, Alteration to Existing Staircases
           and Repairs to Existing Reinforced Concrete Members
                           and Terracing
     Tenders have been received from four of the five firms who
were invited to tender.     These were opened by mp on Wednesday,
July, in the presence of John Strange.     The total tender sums
given in the documents were as follows
     Hallamshire Builders Ltd.
     Tarmac Regional Construction Ltd.
     George Longden Construction Ltd.
     Camm (B. & H.) Ltd.
     Rock Building Construction Ltd.          Declined to tender

     The arithmetic in the two lowest tendevs has been checked.
No errors were found.
     fihese tenders include a B.C. sum of £          our estimate for
the steelwork sub-contract, which is the figure we requested be
insetted by the tenderers prior to us receiving the sub-contract
tenders.
     We have since received four tenders for the steelwork.        The
Eotal tender sums given in the documents were as follows.:9-
      Peter Ward Engineering
      R. Kent Sheet Metal Co. Ltd.
      Norman Tate & Sons Ltd.                           (given over
                                                         the telephone)
      George Shaw Engineering Ltd.
      R. Clark & Sons Ltd.                  Declined to tender

      The arithmetic in the document returned by Peter Ward Engineering
 has been checked and it was found that together with two small
 errors the contingency item of £|    had not been included.        Their
 revised total tender therefore becomes £
      Messrs. R. Kent returned a blank copy of the document with a
covering letter stating a total tender sum of            Again this
fiigure did not include the,contingency item which brings their
total tender sum of £
      The main contract tenders should now be adjusted by the
difference between the sub-contract tender and the £       inserted,
also making due allowance for the percentage profit added by the
main contractor on this Prime Cost item.
     Hallamshire Builders tender then becomes fil           and
Tarmac's £_________ ,  A total of £_____   is included in each of
these figures as a contingency.
     From an administration view and for continuity of site work
it is a pity that Tarmac submitted the higher figure.     However,
we understand that you have been reasonably satisfied with the
work recently completed by Hallamshire Builders at the Training
Ground and we can see no objections to awarding them the contract
for this next phase of work.                     I
     Following my telephone conversation with the Chairman, we have
informed Hallamshire Builders that their tender ls:successful and
  h w e asked that they make necessary preparations to begin work
■>immediately.
     We would propose to Hallamshire Builders that they enter into
a Sub-Contract with Peter Ward Engineering for the supply of
the steelwork.

                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                           Certificate of Ground Safety
     We have been very concerned to find that the length of
wall in the South stand for which you have requested 'one
hour fire resistance' is considerably greater than we had been
led to believe would be requested.         This is particularly serious
for the Club because we find the Superlux material which was
proposed as the external leaf on each side of the existing
walls is enormously expensive.         It Is therefore going to be
necesaary to demolish all these walls and rebuild.
     This is embarrassing both to us and to the Club because
estimates of cost on which their application f$? * grant was
based are now likely to be exceeded and extra grant may not
be forthcoming.
     We are preparing detailed proposals and a cost estimate
for the Club's consideration at the end of next we<|k but in
the meantime, I thought you should know the serious concern
which has been expressed and that the Club is highly likely to
wish to have the whole matter re-opened.


                                       Yours faithfully,
                                                                          FILE

                                              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
          Minutes of Site Meeting No. 3 held on Thursday, 21 June 1979


Present:                       Mr.                                               -    Tarmac Construction Ltd,
                               Mr.                                               -    Shaw Engineering Ltd.
                               Mr. J. Strange                                         Eastwood & Partners


3.1           Previous Minutes
                     The minutes of site meeting No. 2, held on 7 June, were
              accepted as a true record of the proceedings With the exception
              that where reference is made to Mr                                                                       this should read
              Mr.                                                   Mr. Strange amended and signed the originals,

3.2           Progress
                     Mr.                                              reported that excavation through the concrete
              of the lower section of the N.W. terrace had been difficult and
              work was now three days behind programme.                                                             Two more men were to
              be employed on site to bring work back on programme.
                     On Monday 25 June the three 'J' type barriers would be
              fixed ready for load testing and by Thursday 28 June all the new
              barriers erected at the West end would be complete and painted.

3.3           Delivery of Steelwork
                     Mr.                                              reported that sufficient steelwork had been
              delivered on 11 June to prevent work being delayed.                                                              Mr.
              said that the remaining steelwork was being fabricated.




                                                                    Registered in England -   No. 1134531
                                                                   SHEET   2.


EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




        Mr.            confirmed that delivery of steelwork was far
        enough in advance of excavation for the work to continue on
        programme.

  3.4   Test Cube Results
              Mr. Strange requested that a copy of the test
        certificate be sent directly from the laboratory to Eastwood
        & Partners.    He confirmed that testing by Pioneer Testing
        Services Ltd of Leeds was acceptable.

  3.5   Setting out Barriers
              Mr.           confirmed that the difficulties setting out
        some of the barriers on the West terrace had been overcome,
        following discussions with Eastwood & Partners.

  3.6   New Length of Handrail
              Mr. Strange handed over copies of drawing 1610/12XA showing
        an additional length of handrail at the bottom of the exit
        ramp from the Spion Kop.     Mr,        was asked to order and
        fabricate the posts and rails.

  3.7   Weather Conditions
              Mr.           said that weather conditions since the last
        site meeting had not affected progress.

  3.8   Obstructions Encountered
              Mr.           reported that no further obstructions had
        been encountered during excavation other than those previously
        recorded with Mr.

  3.9   Welding onto Existing Rails
              Mr,       reported that because    the existing rails were
        badly corroded it was proving difficult in some instances to
        form the welds when fixing on a new rail.      Mr. Strange said
        this could probably be overcome by inserting a larger connecting
        sleeve between the two tubes.      He said he would inspect the
        rails in question after the meeting and at the same time decide
        which of the existing corroded straps and bolts required
        replacement before load testing commenced.

  3.10 Load Testing
           Load testing, beginning with the barriers in the N.W.
       corner, would probably be started by Eastwood & Partners
       on Tuesday 26 June.

  3.11 Next Meeting
           The next site meeting will be held on Wednesday 4 July
       at 2.00 p.m.

      Building Regulation standards may be accepted for the
      evacuation of up to 20 persons, depending upon circumstances
      and at the discretion of the Fire Authority.

It is considered that in new buildings, external stairways should
only be used where site or design restrictions make it impracticable
to have all stairways within the building. Where such a stairway is
to be provided, consideration should be given to partial protection
from the weather by some permanent cover, or in the case of a stair
providing escape from a storey, the floor level of which is 40*
(12. m) or more above the level of the ground, such stairway must
always be protected.

External Stairways for Secondary Means of Escape Purposes

1.   The stairway shall comply in all respeots with the requirements of
      the current Building Regulations which, amongst other things, specify
      various stair widths goings and risers for different purpose groups,
      and be constructed in accordance with the requirements of the Building
      Surveyor.

2,   Windows and doors in the building served by the esoape stairway shall
      be provided with fire resistance if they are within the following
      distances from the stairway:—

     Horizontally            1.830m (6,0m) measured from the nearest point of
                                           the window or door to the nearest
                                            edge of the stairway or landing.
     Vertically (down):-     9.150m (30*0")     "     "     "       "     "
     Vertlcally (up):-       1,830b (6 *0 ")   "     "      "       "    ”

     The windows shall be provided with half hour fire resisting glazing
     and the opening lights restricted to the minimum required for
     ventilation purposes*

     Doors (other than a door opening onto the stairway from the topmost
     storey) shall be half hour fire resistant and self-closing.

3*   (a)    All doors opening directly oirte the stairway shall be made to
             open in th6 direction of egress onto a landing at the same level
            “as the point of egress, and be so arranged that there is no
             obstruction or restriction of the landing when the door is fully
             open*

      (b)   Fastenings shall be iif a type that will permit the doors to be
            readily opened from within.

      (c)   If it is necessary to recess the doors, the materials used should
            have a fire resistance equivalent to the doors,

4.   The notice "FIRE EXIT” in 127mm (5") high green letters on a white
     background shall be fixed on or near to each door in such positions
     that they are clearly visible to all persons in the rooms in which
     the exit doors are provided.

5.   The stairway shall be adequately illuminated at all levels, the
     lighting switches being positioned adjacent to the exit doors* Eaoh
     switch must operate all external illumination,

6.    Current Building Regulations require that stairways with a total rise
      of more than 6 metres (20 feet) shall be adequately protected from
      the ifeather,

7#    In exceptional circumstances where because of site conditions it is
      extremely difficult or impossible to construct a stairway in accordance
      with the foregoing requirements, a relaxation of this standard may be
      oonsidered after consultation with the Local Authority, A formal
      application for relaxation of Building Regulations will be required
      in this case.

      NOTE With regard to items 3(b), 4 and 5, the architeot should
      "rrT consult the Fire Service before detailing these facilities*

FIRE RESISTING DOORS AND SCREENS

1*  Guidance as to construction of fire check doors is contained
    in BSS 459: Part 3 : 1951; otherwise, doors that satisfy the
    test requirements of BSS 4 7 6 : Part .1: 1953 x*ill "be acceptable,
, ,:providing, that a centre rebate is incorporated on double doors and
,   the frame is provided with a stop to BSS 459 standards. The hanging
    stile of all fire resisting doors must be stamped with the           >'
    manufacturers name or mark, the number of the appropriate British
    Standard and the reference -f PI or 1 H, as may (  be appropriate,

2*    Door frames must comply with the same standard* It is essential
      that the rebates be a minimum one inch in depth,

      BSS 459 specifies that the "stop” may be screwed on to frames
      accommodatiftg half hour resisting doors, but with one hour fire
      resisting door frames the "stop11 must be worked out of the solid
     and the frame pressure impregnated;with fire retardant Solution at
      manufacture, .      '                              . r

     One hour fire resisting, self-closing doors must be hung ion three
     hinges, .                                .r :>

3* Efficient self—closing devices crust be fitted, preferably hydraulic.
    (Garden gate springs are not acceptable; neither are risihg butt !-V
   hinges, except for a limited number of applications — see item 7(b)*

4* Where double doors are fitted, there shall be a one inch centre
   rebate and a selective closing device to ensure the doors close
   in the correct sequence. One leaf of a pair of double doors should
   be indioated "Push" on one side and ’'Pull", on the other, to ensure
   correct operation,

5*   Cabin hooks, foot holding devices and self-closers which lock at 90°
     must not be fitted*

6, If it is found necessary to maintain a mid—corridor separating door in
   the open position, this can be achieved by fitting a magnetio holding
   device with direct connection to the fire alarm system, ;

.    In residential occupancies, i«e. OldPersons* Homes and Flatlets,
     Hotels, Hospitals, etc,, it may be necessary to install smoke
     deteotor heads in addition to the above, therefore, it. is essential
     that the Fire Prevention Officer and Building Control Officer be
     consulted before installing a magnetic holding device,

7* Fire Resisting Glazing

      (a)    (6mm) thick wired 'glass panes of 12 sq, fi;. (l*2m^) in area
     is allowed in half hour fire resisting doors and partitions. The

      (56 mm) deep and 1-J" (44 mm) wide, with the rebate w6rked from the
     solid material and a minimum depth of . j f ' (13 mm),- Wood beading,
     which, should be not less thanJr1’ (13 mm) wide, should have a metal
      capping protection. Alternatively! non-combustible "beads may "be used*
      These should neither melt nor disintegrate in any x-ray at temperatures .
      up to 900 C, A push pad or bar is required on doors within the area
      of g l a z i n g * - •                ■

   (b) In the case of doors requiring -g- hour resistance to collapse and
   20 minutes* resistance to passage of flame, the construction should "be
   as described in item (a) except that the beads may be unprotected wood
   or other material having a melting point of not less than 650 C. Thes&
   doors may only be used in positions allowed by E11(2), E9(l)(a)(i)f
   E13(2b) or El8 (6 )(c)(ii) of the Building Regulations, i*e,

      (i)   A dooivdn   wall requiring not more than half hour fire resistance

         Note of a meeting between the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)
                      and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

                     Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield: 2nd April, 1979

PRESENT:         Representing the Club

                 Dr. W. Eastwood (Consultant)
                 E. England (Secretary)
                 H. E. McGee (Chairman)
                 R. Whitehead (Director)

                 Representing the Working Party

                 Dr.            (Sheffield Area Health Authority)
                 D. iurst (South Yorkshire Police)

                                   (South Yorkshire County Council - Administration
                                                                         Department)

                 H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe, Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and itwas hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
2.    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the aim should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for m a x i m u m crowds.

3.    That as much work as possible should be carried out in the close season,
bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's Witness Rally had
also to be borne in mind.

2.    Discussion on Standing Areas

A.    Spion Kop

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1.    That the siting and angle of the new barriers to be installed be the subject
of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

2.    That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral barriers (hot of the
climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
central block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).

3.    That, in view of the clearance time of Ilf minutes compared with the
8 minutes specified in the Guide, the means of escape be discussed in detail
between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (including the re-sltlng of the gates
In the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
an increase In their number).

4.      That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
m a x i m u m possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

5.    That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
be tested to the appropriate standards.

6.    That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
crush barriers and the scoreboard structure^be the subject of detailed discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

7.   That the Club's longer term proposals for the improvement of the means of
egress be unanimously welcomed.

8.    That the m a x i m u m capacity of the Splon Kop be determined after the foregoing
points have been resolved.

  2 .1         Apologies for Ab'sence
                     Mr.                                   Shaw Engineering Ltd.                       had rung just before
               the meeting to give his apologies for absence.


  2.2          Previous Minutes
                     The minutes of site meeting No.                                               1, held on 24 May, were
               accepted as a true record of the proceedings.                                                      The
               originals were signed by Mr. Strange.


  2.3          Programme
                     Copies of a proposed construction programme had been
               received on 5 June.                                         This indicated completion of the
               West terrace by 28 June and the whole of the works during
               the week ending 22 July 1979.                                               The programme was considered
               acceptable by both M r . England and Mr. Strange.

    2.4   Concrete Supplier
               Tarmac Construction Ltd. had written requesting
          permission to use Ready-Mix Concrete Ltd. as their concrete
          supplier .      Mr. Strange said that at this particular
          plant the fine aggregate is often made by mixing crushed
          stone dust and a fine sand.      This would not be acceptable
          to Eastwood & Partners.      The fine aggregate must be a
          natural sand.      Subject to this and being absolutely in
          accordance with the specification he had no objections
          to R.M.C. Ltd. supplying the concrete.      He emphasised
          that it was the contractors responsibility to ensure that
          the concrete was the correct mix and that the delivery
          tickets should bear the batched weights.


    2.5   Progress
               Mr.             reported that work was on programme and
          the excavations for all the barriers on the West terrace
          would be complete by the end of next week.


    2.6   Delivery of Steelwork
               No barrier steelwork had been received from Shaw
          Engineering Ltd.      Mr. Strange reported that in a telephone
          conversation, held before the meeting, with Mr.            , he
          had been told that the material was being cut to length and
          the first of the barriers promised for delivery on Monday
          morning, 11 June.      Mr.           said that it was essential
          that steelwork be delivered immediately.      If not, work
          would have to be done out of sequence and the excavations
          left open on the West terrace.      A return would then have
          to be made to concrete the west terrace bases involving the
          effort of double handling all equipment across the ground.
               Mr,              agreed to press Messrs. Shaw Engineering
          for delivery of the steelwork.

     2.7   Concrete Test Cubes
                It was agreed that a set of 3 cubes would be
                                                                        O
           taken every third load,             approximately every 10m , with
           cube to be tested at 7 days,             the remainder at 28 days.


    2.8    Setting out Barriers
                Mr.                      said that towards the South side of
           the West terrace the foundation blocks were not involving
           the same number of steps as were shown on the drawing.
           Dr. Eastwood explained that the widths of the steps
           varies round the ground,             so that   the number of steps over
           a foundation block m ay not be exactly as on the typical
           detail.       It was important to adhere to the plan size
           of the base and not to the number of steps encountered.
           It was likely that the width of the terrace treads
           increased from one end of the terrace to the other.


    2.9    Weather Conditions
                M    r   .   s   a   i    d   that due to exceptionally heavy
           rain during the afternoon of Wednesday,              30 May, work

DRAFT LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL FOR SIGNATURE BY THE
HOME SECRETARY



THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER



As you know, I have been considering the representations which have been made
about the Hillsborough Stadium disaster on 15 April 1989. The disaster was of course
fully investigated by the late Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Taylor, but concern has been
raised about a number of features of the case and material considered by some to
represent new evidence has been brought to our attention. These and related matters
were raised in the Granada Television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

My officials have thoroughly examined the alleged new evidence and the allegations
made in the Granada television programme and have concluded that there are no
grounds for establishing a new public enquiry. The material has also been considered
by the Attorney General’s Office and the DPP’s Office. None of those who have
examined the material consider that there is evidence to justify a new public enquiry,
a re-opening of the inquest, or the prosecution of individuals. But I am certain that
continuing public concern will not be allayed with a reassurance from the Home
Office that there is no new evidence. I therefore propose that there should be an
independent examination of the alleged new evidence by a senior legal figure - a
respected judge (serving or recently retired), or perhaps a senior Counsel. It will be
important to ensure that whoever undertakes the task is sufficiently senior and
respected to command public confidence. My personal preference would be for a
judge. The proposed terms of reference are:

‘T o carry out an independent examination and advise whether there is new evidence
relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which provides
sufficient grounds for:

       i.      the Secretary of State for the Home Department to establish a further
               public inquiry;

        ii.    the Attorney-General to consider applying to the High Court under
                Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for another inquest;

        iii.   The Director of Public Prosecutions to consider bringing criminal
               charges against any person;

        iv.    The relevant Chief Police Officer to consider taking disciplinary action
               against any police officer.

Or whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public interest.”


F:\OPPU\COMPLNTS\LONGSUB\PE0Q07MA.DOC
There will need to be a public announcement of the establishment of the independent
examination. This will require careful handling. I am sure that the announcement
will have to be made in the House. But I shall want to make sure that the ground is
properly prepared before the announcement is made with those outside Government
with a close interest in the Hillsborough disaster including the Hillsborough Family
Support Group.

I should be grateful for the Lord Chancellor’s advice on a suitable figure to lead the
independent examination, and for your comments and those of copy recipients on the
proposed terms of reference by 12 June.

Copies of this letter go to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Lord
Chancellor, the President of the Council, the Minister Without Portfolio, the Secretary
of State for National Heritage, the Director of Public Prosecutions and
Sir Robin Butler.

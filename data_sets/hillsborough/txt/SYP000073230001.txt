            season ticket holders and used the voucher                                 in the books to obtain a £6

            ticket for Leppings Ln standing which we got from the tifket office at

            We d i d n ’t stop on the way but were subjected to traffic ^relays at^ ^ffd

            of M63 by Stockport which probably delayed us for about an hour.

            People were having a drink on the way to the match either in their

            vehicles or outside               pubs,    but not outside the normal.                    Police were

checking    people in vans for drink and confiscating cans off others.

We arrived in Sheffield about           1.50 pm (1350) and parked in a side road

off the Woodhead Rd about 5 - 10 minutes walk from the ground.

Although there were Police          in the vicinity we d i d n ’t receive any

directions or escort to the ground.             There was a lot of joviality

arjwsngst people but no disorder or drunkenness on the way to the

ground.    There were no organised queues at the turnstiles just people,

about thi^ee deep,       filtering through the turnstiles.             Bobbies were

  arcjy^ng fans at the tu r nst iles .        There was one Policeman at each

 u/ nsti1e entrance but no stewards.            Outside the main gates there were

lots of people milling around,           not making any effort to get         in.     They

  emed either to be looking for tickets or waiting for friends.                       On

the way to the ground I saw a man,            the other side of the river from

the main gates,       being swamped by supporters and it seemed obvious to

 e that he was touting,         although I c ould n’t see what was in his hands

except he was clutching a wad of paper in his hand.

Once    inside the ground I ca n’t honestly remember seeing any police

officer or stewards.                   wanted to 4 / in either of the end
                 c a t  c>i e tc n o s / St                   i ypfl
terraces but we could not see any signs t o y 'd jf j' e p y u s to those

positions.        If there were any signs t h e ^ t y ^ ^ ^ T a v e been badly    sited.

We d i d n ’t see any gates open other t h a n ^ h e       turnstiles and nobody

climbing    in.     I handed my ticket     in at the turnstile         and they left me

  ,th the stub.        As we c oul dn’t see any directions to          where we wanted

   go, we went down the tunnel with the intention of moving to the

 ides when we got in.     There were no police e(r stewards at this point

       were able to walk freely down the ^un/i'e 1 until we reached the

terrace where there was just a mass of people.  We had to push really

hard through the crowd for about 20 feet to the left in P e n ^ / t .   I

d i d n ’t see anybody drinking      in the ground but at about 2.40 pm

(1440)    there was one lad amongst three or four of his mates,                  who was
                                                                               PAGE        3

really drunk.      He was the only one that      I saw who was really drunk.

We stood at position one on the grid from at 2.10 pm (1410).                 The

crowd at that time w a s n ’t too bad, what y o u ’d expect.        I ate my pies

and read the programme.          People kept arriving and by about 2.35          (1435)

it became uncomfortable and experienced this first surge at this time,

we were    pushed onto the barrier but then the surge eased off.                About

three or four minutes        later   I experienced another surge which again

pushed me onto the barrier which lasted a little              longer before it

eased off.     T h a t ’s when       ducked under the barrier and stood in

front of it.     There was a third surge again we stood where we were                  .

A fourth surge occurred, a really big one, at about 2.55 pm (1455)

that swept me down to the second position.             That    I have indicated on

the grid.     I came up against a barrier at this position,            the crush

d i d n ’t ease off at this time, my arms were      pinned down,      I found

difficulty in breathing.          A lad with glasses    in his mid twenties brown

hair wearing a denim jacket, was literally bent double over the

barrier screaming with pain,          shouting for people to move back.

Another    lad about seventeeen was facing into the stand said he was

going to faint as he c o u l d n ’t breath.     I got my hands free and held

his chin up to help him breath.           His eyes were fluttering and appeared

to be lapsing into unconsciousness.           He had fair hair,     t h a t ’s about

all    I can remember.     The   lad with the glasses managed to make some

space for himself and was able to get underneath the barrier to the

other side.     I took the opportunity to follow him as I had earlier

experienced being crushed onto a barrier.           People were screaming for

someone to open the gates and let them out.             Policemen and

Policewomen were taking no notice of the people.               The teams had

already come out by then.

Once    I had got infront of the barrier       I thought      I would have been all

right but that w a s n ’t the case,      people were still     coming into the pen.

                By this time people at the front were trying to climb the front fence
C /\" i
fANi3           One    lad in particular was doing a grand job by pulli'ng others onto the
o v e &
                fence out of the crowd, and over the top.

                People were being       passed overhead.       I co ul dn’t believe that the            game

                had kicked off while this was going on.                 I was in this     position      until

                  but 3.15 pm (1515),         I climbed over the dividing barriers between pen

                  and 5 and managed to get onto the pitch through gate five.                      There

                must have been about a couple of hundred on the pitch by this time.

                The Police had already put a cordon across the pitch before I had got

                out onto the pitch.

                People were being attended to and resuscitated by fans,                     some St Johns

                Ambulance and Police Officer.            One officer asked me to get some

                oxygen,    but there just w a s n ’t    any./fThere seemed to be two types of

                Policemen on duty that day.          The/caring kind and o thers who c o u l d n ’t
                                                                    A
O ff            care    less.     Officers were stil4 trfeati/ig fans like dirt.              There was no

                co-ordination none whatsoever.           i f rern               d with one officer and he
c o w tj& r i
                just burst      into tears.    \E/en whe^tv the               were ripping down the

                hoardings to make make-shift stretchers some                    police were standing

                around talking,       doing nothing.

                I was    looking for my mates for ages, and eventually f o u n d w h o

                seemed to be in a very poor state,           crying.           H e ’d lost one of his

                shoes,    he was carrying his sweater and his shirt                 was open to the

                waist.     There was even blue      paint from the front fencing on his

                throat.     This was about four o ’clock            (1600).     Shortly later we saw

                who had made his way up into the stand.                  We    told him to stay where he

                was and that we would see him later.                I know     people must have died, but

                I d i d n ’t witness anybody actually die, and I d i d n ’t help anyone who

                was    injured.     I just stayed with [            |l a s k ^ ^ a Police Sergeant what

                was happening and he d i d n ’t know.

                There were loudspeaker annoucemen'                                           H and another

         telling us the game had been abandoned and to stay where they were.

         We were sat on a wall    by the halfway line on the South Stand drinking

         wate r .

         It must have been about 5.30 pm (1730) when we all got back to the car

         because a kind person living on the estate where we had parked

         let me use her phone to ring my sister-in-law at 5.20 pm (1720).

         On the way home         complained that he cou ldn ’t raise his left arm




                the game was stopped there was total     chaos.   No organisation,

                ne in charge and very poor communications between the police and

             the fans via the loudspeaker.       It was obvious there was no first

         aid and ages before an ambulance       came onto the ground.

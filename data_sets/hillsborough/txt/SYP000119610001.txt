At   1,45 p m approxi m a t e l y ,         I went b ack out onto the p i t c h and I was

At   2.00 p m a S t e w a r d p o i n t e d out to me a g r o u p of 3 or 4 Liverpool

s peak to the m and found that                   they w ere fro m N o r t h e r n Ir eland and

seemed decent           lads.       I advised the m to take off their Li ve rpool

understand,         but    it wa s at the bac k of m y m i n d that this cou ld cause

p r o b l e m s , but I k n e w that cross           tr ansfer wa s       impossible.

At    2.30 p m I rem em be r           looking at m y w a t c h to see h o w the n u m b e r s were

going,     I w a s s u r p r i s e d to see b o t h the Ko p and South S t a n d a p p a r e n t l y

Leppings Lane w a s           three q u a r t e r s f u l 1 (plus)        but      lots of roo m in the

Just after 2.30 p m I n o t i c e d that                the upp er       level of the e l e v a t e d

for so meone to get s e r i o u s l y h u r t .            It's a p r o b l e m that we hav e wit h

all    the big clubs          that visit us,           but f o r t u n a t l e y a p r o b l e m we have

managed      to o v e r c o m e w i t h our ow n s u p p o r t e r s .     It star t e d w h e n       the ne w

K op was opened and at that                    time I was e m p l o y e d on V i d e o C a m e r a duties

in the Po l i c e C o n t r o l .        W e spent a long time trying to i d e n t i f y the

several O f f i c e r s at the b a c k , w h i c h resul t e d in m a n y e j e c t i o n s and

arrests.        We seemed to hav e crac k e d              that p r o b l e m w i t h i n a few home

g ames and the sam e went                for obsc e n e chanting.           We seemed to be              lucky

as far as racist cha nt s g o , even though we hav e had b l a c k p l a y e r s ,

but we h ave alw a y s ha d a p o l i c y of              ’fir m but f a i r ’ .

Just after        that time           {still    just after      2.30 pm)        I re member th inking

that the Live rp oo l           train must be          late or s o m e t h i n g , b e c a u s e of the

lack of numb e r s         in the Liverpool            end.     I w a l k e d dow n to Pol ice

w r e c k e d a p u b somewhere.

By this time the s u p p o r t e r s wer e b a i t i n g one an other f rom one end to

p a r t i c u l a r l y bit t e r w h e n c h a n t i n g .     I said to q uite a few,            "Do that

a g a i n and yo u ' r e o u t ."        I c o n s i d e r e d taki ng one out as an exa mp le                  to

see if it w o u l d set tl e           them down,         but e v e r y time X had str on g words

w i t h o n e , his m a t e s w o u l d p lead w i t h me that they w o u l d                 look aft er

Liverpool        fans.       Some w ere s t a r t i n g to put            their    legs over the wall

as if to get to the Liver po ol                    end and I thoug ht that              if these

identify the Liverpool                 suppo r t e r s         in this stand there will be some

big p r o b l e m s .    The a t m o s p h e r e w a s g e t t i n g tense        in a l 1 areas n o w and

I thought        that the game had better get st arted soo n or we will have a

problem.         It was      then it went          thro u g h m y m i n d     that there should be

some p r e - m a t c h e n t e r t a i n m e n t on the pitch.             A l 1 these pe o p l e

e n c a p s u l a t e d here and noth i n g for the m to d o .                  I was s u r p r i s e d that

the b ig a d v e r t i s i n g pe o p l e didn't              lay som e t h i n g o n , but   I th ought

that the p i t c h q u a l i t y wa s m o r e          im po rtant       to the g a m e .     I wa s n ' t

At   3.00 p m s o m etime about kick off time                         (it cou ld hav e b e e n just

thought       that there was going to be a p i t c h i n v a s i o n .                      I h a d n ’t a radio

so I c o u l d n ’t m o n i t o r what was g oing o f f .                 I saw m o r e of t hem behind

was going o f f .          I remember feel i n g q u i t e angry,                 thinking,      "What       the

B i r m i n g h a m s i t u a t i o n all over again,          but   I think that       this one has

got the p o tential           to be a lot w o r s e .           I k n e w I was onl y one m a n , but

I seemed to be h o l d i n g them b a c k , I was p l e a d i n g w i t h               the fans to sit

I have never          seen suc h anger on suc h a large scale before.                               I tried

problems,          but    I knew that       cross transfer             was     impossible.

At 2.30          pm I remember        looking at my w atch to see how the numbers were

going,          I was    s u r p r i s e d to see both the H o p and S o u t h S ta n d a p p a r e n t l y

full,    but L i verpool           accommodation          only half           full.       The     centre           pen on

Leppings Lane was                three quarters         full     (plus)        but lots of room in the

stands and wings.

Just    after 2 . 3 0          pin I noticed that the upper                   level      of the e l e vated

terrace          <NW)    was   getting quite        full arpk-.t^y had star t e d w i t h the

pushing wave.                 1 thought    how stupid they were and how ea s i l y                             it was

for someone             to get s e riously hurt.               It's a problem that w© hay* with

all    the big .elutis that visit us,                    but    fortun a t l e y a prob l e m we Have

in the Po l i c e Control.                We spent a long time trying                      to i d e n t i f y the

culprits          that were       starting       the wave,       and we dealt w i t h it by putting

several O f f icers at the back,                   which       resulted in m a n y e j e c t i o n s and

arrests.           We se e m e d to have         cracked that           problem w i t h i n a                      home

games and the same went for obscene                            chanting*           We                       toe lucky

as far as          racist       chants go,       even th o u g h we have had JblaCk p l a y e r s , :

but we have always                had a policy of          "firm but fair*.                      ,

                  had no shirt on,              a supporters          scarf a r o u n d his wrist,          I think he had

                  a flat     cap on.          My crowd were shouting               to me directly,           ’Get    him,        get

                  Notts,     s u pporters were            insensed.        I heard,        “They all       ought to fucking

time     I was       in th e r e ,          they were             generally          well    behaved and            I saw        no

We    then     walked          to    the W a d s l e y J a c k         Publi c/Kouse              in W i s e w o o d ,     arriving

(1415).

The     t h re e    of    us    then        had a         steady walk                 the    ground along               Wadsley        Ln,

in a n      orderly         fashion and                I saw      nothing            of a n y        note.

We w a l k e d      down Leppings                 Ln and         towards          the      turnstiles,                as a        local

supporter           I am       familiar           with      the       general         layout          of       the    ground,          I was

intending           to    enter          through        the      larger         of    the       two       blocks        of      turnstiles

in L e p p i n g s       Ln.     As      we     neared      the       turnstiles              the     crowd          t h er e     became

quite       d e n se and         the       fans were          spilling            out      into       the       rd.     I saw         two

mounted        Police          Officers           standing            in L e p p i n g s        Ln    near       to     the       road

giving       access         to      the       turnstiles.             T he y were          trying          to    contain           the      crowd

and    I heard           one     of      the     two O f f i c e r s       shout         to     us a n d        the     people         around

us    to    "hold        b a c k . ” I c o u l d see             that     they were              trying          to     hold       back      the

majority           of    the     people          from      converging             upon        the     turnstiles.                 They      were

Police       Officers            on foot          scattered within                    the       c r owd.        We w a i t e d        as    the

Officer        had       told       us     until       we w e r e      let      through          to       the    turnstiles                in a

group       of a b o u t       50     or      100.     We w a l k e d     to      the      r i ght        hand       turnstile             in the

large       block        mar k e d       1-16.

I n i t i a l l y we      could walk              freely         to    the      turnstiles,                but as         I neared           them

the    crowd        became          very        dense      and    I could            feel       myself          being        pushed

from       behind,        we     were         uncontrollably               being         carried along                  in the         crowd

of    people.           I was able              to    look a b o v e         the t u r n s t i l e s           and    I noticed

members        of       supporters              climbing         onto        the roof           of    the       turnstiles             from

off    a blue           fence       which        is    positioned            to      the      rig h t      of    the      bl o c k .       I sa w

there       wa s    a Police             Officer        standing           on     to p     of    the       t u r n s t i l e s , he w a s

wearing        a flat          cap,        he    d i d n ’t t r y a n d         stop any             of    these        supporters,               in

fact       I didn't         see       him       even approach              a n y of        them.          At    l e ast      50

supporters              scaled        the       turnstiles            wh ils t I was             present             outside.          I

As    I neared           the     turnstile             I only had            view        of     one m a i n          gate       and    this

main     gate        ’A ’ .

It w a s      quite         uncomfortable                being          pushed      towards          the       turnstile,            I

c o u l d n ’t m o v e        of m y       own accord,               it w a s     very       cramped.            I passed          through

the     turnstile             without         much       trouble           and    I handed           the       operator         my

ticket.         I h ad        become         separated             from my        cousin and              his       friend.

I entered            into        the      enclosure           at     the    rear       of    the     W Stand,           there        were

lots     of     people           about       in the          enclosure           but     it w a s n ’t a            crush     like

inside        the        enclosure,           we       had    lost       his     friend                        and     he    d i d n ’t

terraces            without         him.      We       began       to m o v e     through          the        enclosure         and       I

heard a         roar        from       the    crowds          inside        the     ground,          I assumed              that     the

match        ha d    started.             It w as       about        3.03pm       (1505)          when        we w e r e     in the

enclosure            at     the     back      of       the    stand.

People        were        coming          from around              the     side     of      the    stand         from       pens     6 and

7.     About        20    people          came     from       that       direction           in all,           I heard        one        of

these        people         say,       "somebody             is d e a d     on the          pitch."           I wanted        to     see

what     was        happening             so we        made       our    way     to a s t a i r c a s e          at    the    rear        of

the     W Stand.            When       I reached             the     top    of    the       W S t a n d we          s t o o d at     the

back     and        I had a         clear         view       of    the     pitch.

I could         see       the     fences          which       bound        the    pitch and              contain        the

supporters               in the        pens       b e l o w us.         I could        only       se e    s m all      sections           of

at     the    front         of    the      stand.        I then          saw a Po lic e            Officer            run    onto        the

pitch whil st               the     g a me    was       in    play,        he w a s w a v i n g          his a r m s        about     and       he

ran     to    the        r e f er e e .    Th e    game       w as      stopped        and     the       players were

subsequently                led     from      the       field.

I could         see        large       numbers          of        peop>le on        the      pitch        below        just     in f r o n t

of     the    terraces,             there         were       people        lying       on the        playing           area and

others        walking           around.          I could also               see       p e op l e     climbimg           over       the

boundary           fencing           in f r o n t       of     the    pens       to    get       onto     the      pitch.          I was

some     distance            away         and    I r e m a i n e d at         the      b ac k      of    the stand,                Ic o u l d n ’t

see    what        w as    happening             in the         pens       below.

After     about           15 m i n u t e s       I heard         the P A s y s t e m               announce          t h a t the          game

had    been abandoned,                     but       advised         spectators             to     r e m a i n in t h ei r

positions.            I only          just       heard         the    message          as    there        was a great                deal       of

noise     in the           s t a n d at         the    time.         It wa s      a subsequent                 tannoy

announcement               that       requested              fans     to    lea v e      the       g r o un d ,    I think           it wa s

about     4pm       (1600)           w h e n we       left      the       stand.

bodies        to    see      if we         could        identify anyone.                    I declined and                   d i d n ’t    look

at    anyone.After               a short             revisit         to    the    ground           to    look      for                     we

what     I have           witnessed,             then        I would        be w i l l i n g        to    do      so.    I have

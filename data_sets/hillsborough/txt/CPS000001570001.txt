Dear Sirs

RE: ADLINGTON y. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your two letters of 5 January 1999 addressed to this office.

Your request to be given the reasons why the CPS is not intervening in this private
prosecution is still being considered. I regret that I am unable to give you a date when
a decision will be made however I shall contact you as soon as it is known.

Attached is a copy of our latest letter to the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

The Crown Prosecution Service is now ready to give you voluntary disclosure o f the
documents in our possession on the same basis as for the other parties to this
prosecution. It is a matter for you whether you wish to accept this offer or not.

In order to assist you I have enclosed a copy of the Schedules of the material in our
possession at this office.

Please contact me to arrange a date and time for any required inspection of these
documents.

Yours faithfully




George R Croston
Prosecution Team Leader

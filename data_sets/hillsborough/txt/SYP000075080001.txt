             I am a single man living at the above address with my mother.
                                                 o rT
             I have been going to Liverpool Football Club Matches for the last

             eight years.           I try to attend as many of the matches as I can.           When I

             go to a Match at Anfield I normally stand in the                'K O P ’, and so am used

             to tightly packed crowds on the terraces,

            On Saturday        15th A p r i l, 1989 (150489),     I went to the F . k j Cup semi

             final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.                The Match was to be

             played at Hillsborough Football Club, Sheffield.

             I bought a ticket for the Match from a friend.                The ticket was for the

            Leppings Ln terraced area of the ground and I paid eight pounds for it,



                                                                                          and his

             broths r                      who lives at         e same address.   My brother
                                                                                 PAGE           2

                         was also with us, he lives at the same address as I do,

             We started out for Sheffield at 11am (1100) on the day and travelled

             up the M62.        We stopped off at the last service station before

             reaching Sheffield to have a snack.

             We eventually got into Sheffield and parked up about             1 mile from the

             ground.        It was about   1.30pm (1330) when we parked up.

             We walked to the ground, my brother knew the way because he went to

             the identical match last year.

             When we reached the ground we just joined onto orderly queues there

             was only about 20 in our queue.             We got through the turnstiles quite

             quickly and handed my ticket          in.

             Once inside the ground we walked stra>g'fit to the tunnel and straight
                                                 _<£• -----------------------------------
             down it.        We had free access thpafugh the tunnel.       When we came out

s.oe         onto the terracing it must,.Have only been about 2 pm (1400).
                                     /
                                                                            I think
                                                                           ---------
             I stood in Pen 4 aba    wo thirds of the way down the terraces.   At

             this time the crowd''in the pen was beginning to get packed but not

             "jam pa ck e d’. It was still fairly easy to move^a ps rt ft .

             The c rowd steadily be came more and more t xjj>r€ly packed.         At about 2.

 S Q •£-     £ 3 pm (1453)     I felt a surge from behijpwT'and was pushed forward towards

              surge the crowd springs ba<;,k' but this time it d i d n ’t. We were very

             tightly packed my f e e t / t i e re off the floor.     I had my hands holding

             onto the fence bracing myself and keeping fjy^self from going down on

             the floor. I could feel a hand grabbing / fy right calf but there was

             nothing    I could do I c ou ld n’t move,

             Still the crush got worse          it was increasing steadily all the time

             It was extremely difficult to ^feathe            because of the pressure on   my

             chest.          I shouted to the Poli/ce "Help me I ’m dying" and at that time I

             really         did think   I was goinjj todie.

             The Police were shouting to the             crowd to push back but it was
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                SI 934

impossible to move.      They obviously d i d n ’t realise how serious the

situation was.

I got seperated from the others except ta'f'                          who was

directly behind me.      Eventually hs senaged to climb up over me and

over the front fence.       I was    alsar   trying to climb out but I couldn't

get out of the crush.      C/yi      Pkz & A M

I felt that I was beginning tolfall asleep but I knew I had got to get

out.     I put my right arm up one last time and a fan who was on the

fence leaning over took hold of my hand and wjrist and pulled me. With
           0 * rT  P>*WS
his help I managed to get to the t o p s n          the fence where    I collasped

from exhaustion.     Two P o 1ice W r f c e
                                          cers
                                            t  came along and lifted me down

from the fence and lay me on my side on the pitch.              I lay in that

position for about      15 minutes as        I was dazed and weak.

When I eventually got up I wandered about on the pitch and managed to

find my brother and                 We then saw             and joined up with him.

Eventually I began to try and help other fans I've got no idea of what

time   it was because    I was still     in a dased condition.        I was too weak

to help anybody out of the crowd and so went and rejoined my brother

and friends.

After a further rest in a seated stand which I beleive to be the North

Stand.    I left the ground with the others at about 4.30pm              (1630).     We

walked back to the car and reached it at 4.45pm             (1645).

We then drove off towards home but stopped off at the first service

station in order to make our respective phone calls home.

We eventually arrived back in Liverpool at about 7pm (1900).

         I would just like add that there were a large number of Police    in a
OrT"
                across   centre of the pitch.   I think they should have been

         used to help the injured fans.

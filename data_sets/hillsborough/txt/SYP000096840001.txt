   Dear Mr

   On or about 4 January 1990, a memorandum was forwarded to you requesting the
   supply of a written account of your involvement - if any - in the Hillsborough Inquiry.

   I realise that you are probably deeply absorbed with your University studies, but I
   would be most grateful if you could contact me personally as soon as possible to
   discuss this matter.

   My daytime direct line telephone number is Sheffield 523438, if you would care to ring.
   Alternatively, please mark any written submissions “confidential" and address them to
   me at Force Headquarters Management Support Unit, Snig Hill, Sheffield. If you were
   NO T involved in any way, please telephone to confirm same.

   On a personal basis, I sincerely hope that you are enjoying your studies and I wish you
   much success in the coming years.

   Yours sincerely




^ (S h id f Constable

Telephone conversation 4.45 pm Friday 28 April 1989 with Belinda
Nortcliffe.

POINTS OF INFORMATION

1.   No self serving statements are to be taken from any officer from
     another police force.

2.   We can ask the West Midlands Police Enquiry Team for Criminal
     Justice Act statements in relation to none South Yorkshire Police
     officers.

3.   Counsel would like a separate Appendices/Report about these
     officers from other forces:

         (a)   How did they become involved

         (b)   The arrangements regarding this, ie how it is arranged,
               is there anything in writing

         (c)   What briefing did they receive from the South Yorkshire
               Police and from their own force, if any

         (d)   Identify these officers by rank and position

         (e)   What did they do at Hillsborough

HOME OFFICE/PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS

1.   Please provide details of the numbers of officers involved at
     Hillsborough (Belinda suggests this must be factual in terms of
     the Operational Order but so far as Operational Support and for
     duty officers responding, if this information is not available
     to respond with - 'and an unknown number of officer,s responded by
     way of operational support and °ff d ut y . ' ) \

2.   How many were injured

3.   How did they come about their injuries

In respect of 3, advises that the letter of the 20 April 1989 applies
that tne question goes further and could be classed as a breach of the
Contempt of Courts Act.  Our reply to that question should bes

       "The South Yorkshre Police are not in a position to
       answer that question and cannot speculate on it.  This is one
       of the matters obviously under investigation by the West
       Midlands Police Force and the Public Enquiry ultimately,
       it is a question which cannot be accurately or reliably
       answered."
By way of general information, Miss Nortcliffe advises that
questions on a purely factual nature can be answered.  Any
speculative questions must be given the answer as above.   If
in any doubt, please consult.

contacted, Peter Metcalfe is still at the

               the Assistant Chief Constable                (Operations) with the South Yorkshire

               Police.          On that day I was on duty at the Sheffield Wednesday Football

               Club      (Hillsborough)      on the occasion of an F.A. Cup Semi-Final match

               between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers,.                               Shortly after

               the commencement of the game a dangerous                       crushing situation developed

               in the Leppings Lane end of the ground which required swift action to

               prevent serious or possible fatal                    injury to the spectators.              This

               the track and allowing spectators to escape and take up positions on

               the track,,         It was also necessary to assist several                      people over the

               top of the fencing to relieve                congestion in the Leppings Lane end of

               the ground.

All these specators were accommodated on the track surrounding                                     the

pitch and, apart from an abortive attempt- to move some supporters

into the Kop end at half time,                   remained there for the rest of the

had been sustained prior to and during the evacuation of the Lapping

Lane end.

After the match an acrimonious meeting took place                              in the Secretary's

office,      between Mr. Bert McGee,               Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday

F.C.,      Mr. Eric England,         Secretary S.W.F.C.,              the Chief Constable of

S ou t h Yo rk s h i r e Po 1 i ce , Mr. J „H . B ro w n 1ow a n d m y s e 1f .       T h e me e t in g

lasted for about half an hour and was mainly concerned with the

events on the Leppings Lane end just after the start of the match,,

Mr. McGee supported by Mr. England was extremely critical                                  of the

po 1 i ce a c t i o n f i r s 1 1y f o r a 11 ow in g it t o d e v e 1 o pe a n d s e co n d 3.y f o r

the manner by which the problem was                         resolved.

It was pointed out to both Mr. McGee and Mr. England that

situation and conventional methods of control had failed.                                   By this       i.


mean the use of uniformed police officers,                           loud hailers and police

horses to relieve the most congested areas of the Leppings Lane end

had failed.         Because of the possibility of serious                       injury and worse,

I had instructed that the gate was opened and spectators brought out

                                                                               •

had personally assisted several                    spectators         to climb over the fence.

Mr. McGee expressed the view that the action of bringing spectators

out onto the track was completely unnecessary and had had the effect

of making the ground look                '’u n t i d y ’.   He was obviously upset and said

that because of our            (the police) action it was unlikely that

            When I pointed out, that had we not acted as we did,         then there was a

            real    chance of fatalities he replied       'Bollocks   no-one would have

            b e e n k i 11 e d " !

            The atmosphere throughout the meeting was hostile and there seemed to

            be a total        failure to appreciate, what might have occurred had we not

            taken the action we did.

            Relationships between officials of the club and ourselves were

            strained for some time after the semi— final although it is true to

            say that things did revert to the normal          co-operative working

            relationships after a relatively short period of time..

  My full neuiis xfa -RmjfciLiHjames Goslin. On Saturday 11 April 1981 I was_
  the Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) with the South Yorkshire
  Police. On that day~I--was~on duty at the~Sheffield Wednesday Football"
  Club (Hillsborough) on the occasion of an F.A. Cup Semi-Final match____
  between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers.       Shortly after

  in the Leppinas Lane end of the ground which required swift action to
  prevent serious or possible fatal injury to the spectators.      This
  actiorr'
         conststed of opening a gate leading~trom the terracingonto the
  track and allowing spectators to escape and take up positions on the__
  track.   It was also necessary to assist severalpeople over the top of
  the-fencing to re 1ieve“corrgest:ion in the teppings Lane end of the
  ground________________________________ ________________________ ____

                                          orrthertrack surrounding the-'
  pitch and, apart from an abortive attempt to move some supporters into—
  the Kop end at half time, remained there for the rest of the game.
  Several serious injuries i.e. broken bones, cuts and bruises, had been
  sustained prior to and during the evacuation of the Leppings Lane end—

  After the~match an acrimonious-meeting took”place in'the Secretary's
  office, between Mr. Bert McGee, Ch airman of Sheffield Wednesday F .C~^
  Mr. Eric England, Secretary S.W.F.C., the Chief Constable of South
                                       and myself.  The meeting lasted
                                    nlv mnrprnpfi with f-hp pypnts nn the..
  for about half an hour and was mainly
  Leppings Lane end just after the start of the match.     Mr. McGee
  supported by Mr. England was extremely critical of the police action
  firstly for allowing it to dpvelnp and secondly fnr the manner by.which-
  the problem was resolved                                        ________

  Tt was pointed ont- to hnhh Mr. Mt Gp p and Mr... Fngland that circumstances-
  beyond our control had brought about the crushing situation and
  conventional methods of control had tailed.          By this I mean the use
  nf Tmifnrmpd pnl irp off ir-pr.qf lnnd hail p x s and police horses to relieve-
  the most congested areas of the Leppings Lane end had failed.          Because
  of the possibility of serious injury and worse, I had instructed that
  the gate was opened and spectators brought out onto the track.          I

  an ideal position to assess the situation.    I had personally assisted
  several spectators to climb over the fence.    Mr. McGee expressed
  the—view that the-action of bringing spectators out onto the trade----
  was completely unnecessary and had had the effect of making the ground
  look 'untidy'. He was obviously upset and said that because of our
  (the police ) action it was unlikely that Hillsborough would ever-be---
  invited to host a semi-final in the future

  When I pointed out-that had we not acted as we did, then there-----
  was a real chance of fatalities he replied 'Bollocks - no-one would
  have been killed'I            :

  The atmosphere throughout the meeting was hostile and there seemed to
  be a total failure to appreciate what might have occurred had we
  not taken--t-he action we did----------------------------------------

  Relationships between officials of the club and outselves were strained
  for some time after the semi final although it is true Lo say Lhat-----
  things did revert to the normal co-operative working relationships_____

I was      requested to      construct      a    composite   scale plan   incorporating

information from the individual plans Cl to C248.


Some of the plans relating to particular individuals contained more than

one location of identification.                 I was instructed to incorporate on the

composite plan, only          one location of each category         for any individual.

In any category,          the location nearest to the        ground perimeter would be

used.


I have     prepared a       plan from    information supplied to       me, of     the West

Stand     and    Terrace, Sheffield      Wednesday      Football Club,Hillsborough,

Sheffield.        I have     incorporated on the plan as accurately as possible,

location "dots" for         each individual victim, using the          same colour code

as    on the individual        plans, and       using the    criteria described     in the

previous paragraph.          fach "dot" is marked with the "body number" of the

victim.         If more    than one identification location was available on the

individual plans,          the "dot" is contained        within a black circle.        The

scale size of each "dot" is 0.4 metres diameter.


I have retained in my possession and can produce the "master" plan drawn

                     kop end of the N orth Stand*                             It was at             that      time   1 first     became aware

of    problems with the            crowd behind            the goal         at the Leppings         Lane        end

of the ground.               My first     thought was           that    there was a pitch             invasion

starting at that              end of the       ground.          *ie started to film-those                events

at 3.03pm.           By 3 «0 6 pm I had        reaiissa         that what was          Happening        was      not a

pitch    invasion and that              there       haa been a problem with                o v e r c rowding          in

the    pens behind the Leppings Lane                       end goal.          People    in the      pens were

trying to        climb over       the     perimeter         fence,          Police Officers         were

trying    to assist           them and       I saw that         people were        lying     on the      pitch

obviously        injured.        By this       time we have moved towards                    that     end of

the    pitch         but w h e n supporters         had overspi lied and were wan d e r i n g

ar o u n d on        the pitch we started            to have         problems with them,,            Borne

thought we were              press and were abusive and threatening                          towards       us.

As a result we m o v e d          into       the    centre      of    the    pitch.

At 3,,3'ipm we         took    further- shots            of the West Stand w hich showed                   that

the    central        pens    behind    the goal          on the terrace         had been       relieved of

the    volume        of supporters        in them.

At 3, 5 0 p m we        started     filming         in      the      gymnasium    behind, the North

Stand.          This had oeen set up to receive                      injured supporters ana we                    haa

        I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police currently attached

        to the Underwater Search Unit based at Claywheels Lane, Sheffield*

        On Saturady 15th April 1989 I was on duty in connection with the F.A.

        Cup Semi-Final football match between Liverpool F.C. and Nottighara Forest

        F.C. to be played at Hillsborough football ground, Sheffield.

        The Underwater Search Unit forms part of the South Yorkshire Police

        Operations Division and my duties for that particular day involved being

        part of a video camera crew with the brief to film various events during the

        course of the day. The crew was made up by myself, Police Constable

                            and Police Constable

        At 2.if0pm that date we were standing on the perimiter track at the kop end

        of the North Stand. It was at that time I first became aware of problems

        with the crevd behind the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

        My first thought was that there was a pitch invasion starting at that end of the

        ground, ^fe started to ^ilm those events at 3»03PBK'T~By 3»06pm I had realised

                         (CJ Act, 1967, s.9: MC Act, 1980, s. 102: MC Rules, 1981, r.70)
                                                                                           £.
            Continuation of statement of


            that what was happening was not a pitch invasion and that there had been

            a problem with overcrowding in the pens behind the Leppings Lane end goal.

            People in the pens were trying to climb over the perimeter fence, Police

            Officers were trying to assist them and I saw that people were lying

            oa the pitch obviously injured. By this time we had moved towards that end of

            the pitch but when supporters had overspilled and were wandering around on the

            pitch we started to have problems with them. Some thought we were press and

            were abusive and threatening towards us. As a result we moved into the centre

            of the pitch.

            At 3.31pm we took further shots of the West Stand which showed that the

            central pens behind the goal on the terrace had been relieved of the volume

            of supporters in them.

            At 3 «50 pm we started filming in the gymnasium behind the North Stand. This had

            been set up to receive injured supportos and we had been directed there by

            Detective Superintendent McKay and instructed to film what was taking place.

            He told us that the gymasium was to be used as a temporary mortuary.

            As we filmed commentary was given over the sound recording equipment. The

            equipment we used is battery powered, it therefore not being prcticable to

            film continuously. However we took shots of events in the temporary mortuary

            up until 5 •30pm. I have since viewed a working copy of the video tape and the

            film, with the sound recording and commentary, shows what was taking place.

            I;<can identify the video tape by the exhibit label attached signed by me.

            I would add that the film footage taken shows what was happening in the

            gymnasium at selected intervals as events progressed. Between takes the

            general conditions did not significantly change in respect of the numbers of

            people present, the level of noise and the tasks being undertaken.

          Further to my previous statement regarding the events at Hillsborough

          on the 15th April,      1989.

           I have been asked to describe in more detail my observations and

         duties in the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium.

          As I have stated the first time I became aware that there had been a

          problem in the ground was at about 3.10pm when Chief Inspector Beal

          came into the gym and told us to clear all the tables away as the area

         was to be used as a mortuary.          The only other times I can recall with

          any accuracy are 8.30pm that night when I had a ten minute break and

         went outside and 5.30am-the following morning when I went off duty.

          Almost immediately after the instruction had been given by Mr.         Beal

          bodies began arriving.          They were being carried by police officers

          and civilians alike,      some being carried bodily,    others on stretchers

          and others on noticeboards which had been converted.

           Initially the scene was one of great confusion with people bringing

           in bodies who were obviously dead and wanting to leave them and get

          back as quickly as possible to help those who were still         in the crowd

          and injured.
MCSLOY                           KEITH     TAYLOR                              PAGE


It was quickly realised that it would be necessary to prove

continuity in relation to the bodies and to this end I went to each

group who brought             in a body and instructed     that at    least one officer

must remain with the body.                 It struck me as odd   at   the time that

there were not a great number of relatives or friends with the bodies

that were being brought             in.

The relatives that were with the bodies were obviously deeply

distressed and wherever possible were given every assistance by the

police officers present.                 They were initially allowed to remain with

the deceased.              I do however recall two instances where people became

so upset that they were shouting and becoming a danger to the people

there.       There was no alternative but to forcibly remove them from the

area until they calmed down.                 In both cases the people calmed down

apologised for their understandable reactions and thanked us for

u n d e r s t an di n g.

As I was going to each body that arrived I                 soon became aware that at

the rate the bodies were arriving it would                 soon be    impossible to

accommodate any more.              I expressed my fears to D e t . Superintendent

McKay and we decided that the bodies should be arranged in rows of 12.

There were a number of doctors who seemed to arrive with the

casualties and they were quickly establishing whether a casualty was

dead or otherwise.              There were eventually I believe five doctors,

some of whom had attended the match as spectators and after the first

check for obvious signs of life they went through all the bodies in

the mortuary and formally certified life extinct.

As soon as possible a supply of Gen 18, Sudden Death Reports,                was

obtained and these were handed to the officers who were accompanying

the bodies with instructions that they should be completed as fully
MCSLOY                  KEITH   TAYLOR                                  PAGE      3


At first as bodies arrived there was naturally some considerable

noise as people were asking directions,       expressing anger and other

emotions.    The scene was one of confusion with police officers openly

crying,    some younger officers so stunned by what they saw they could

not even express their emotion.      Det.   Superintendent McKay quickly

took command of the situation and directed members of the CID, many

dressed in casual clothing to carry out tasks which quickly brought

some form of order to the situation.

At a very early stage it was realised that the scene inside the gym,

in particular the area where the dead were being dealt with, was one

that only those whom it was necessary to expose to should see it and

a control was put on the door.      With the exception of the relatively

few relatives who initially came in the only other persons allowed in

that area were members of the emergency services, many of the police

officers as I have described were casually dressed,          as they had been

for other duties earlier    in the day.

Another operation that had to be carried out in relation to the dead

was to search the bodies and list and secure any property that may be

in their possession.     This task was undertaken in most cases by the

CID officers.     It should be said that many officers who were

accompanying the bodies were suffering,       some openly,    some inwardly and

for this reason the CID officers were used.

The bodies as I have said were laid in rows of twelve with sufficient

space and room around them for the tasks       to be carried out without

any liklihood of post mortem injury being caused.        In the first

instance bodies were covered with white paper tablecloths and a

little later a number of body bags were supplied by the ambulance

service.     There were a limited number of these and they were later

reused as they became available after some bodies were removed^to the
MCSLOY                  KEITH   TAYLOR                                   PAGE


Medico Legal Centre.    Where body bags could not be supplied then

blankets were used to cover the bodies.

Det.   Chief Superintendent Addis arrived at the scene later that

afternoon and took command of the question of identification of the

bodies.     It should be said that soon after    the bodies had arrived

there was obviously friends and parents arriving at the gym.         They

were directed to the rear of the North Stand and I understand from

there taken by coach to Hammerton Road Police Station.

By what I would estimate to be around tea time of that day all the

bodies had been searched etc.     and we were   left with the task of

identification.     Mr. Addis briefed all the officers who were to be

involved in the task,    in the main still the CID officers.      He briefed

them fully and clearly explaining that the process which had been

agreed between himself and Mr.     Popper,   the Coroner, was that polaroid

photographs would be taken of the head and shoulders of the

deceased.     These would be displayed on screens in a passageway which

ran alongside the gym coming out in the gym at the other end of the

building.     Screens were sent for and a viewing area was constructed

which allowed relatives the privacy required for the identification

and kept from them the scene in the mortuary.

Once the identification had been carried oat then the officer

accompanying the body,    together with a CID officer from other

divisions and supportive workers such as social workers and

churchmen,    took down what details were required.

The gym became sectioned into three.         One end holding the dead,    the

middle section holding the officers who had brought in the bodies and

the other end holding the relatives after the identification.

Once an identification by photograph had been made the photograph

bearing the body number was brought through to me and a             of-------
MCSLOY                 KEITH   TAYLOR                              PAGE


officers working under me.     The body waa checked against the

photograph,    cleaned and made presentable before being wheeled on a

trolley into the identification area.     Once identified the body was

then taken to an outer door where it way transported to the Medico

Legal Centre by ambulance.

The officers who were carrying out this harrowing task were without

exception well seasoned officers with considerable experience.      They

acted with total reverence and respect for both the dead and the

relatives who attended for identification.

I have twenty one years service in the police force and have had to

deal with death in many forms during this time.     I cannot recall an

incident which could be compared to what took place on that day and

the problems that we as an organisation were presented with.      We had

people dead with friends and relatives already there wanting to know

what had happened and if their worst fears had been realised.      In the

months that have passed since that date I have thought on many

occasions of what was done and how it was done.     In the cold light of

day and with the advantage of hindsight,    I can think of perhaps one

or two things that could have been improved in relation to the

handling and disposal of relatives and the deceased.     These would

only have assisted in the administration side of the incident and I

can say that I was there in that gymnasium possibly longer than

anyone else.    I saw nothing which I could describe as irreverence,

coidheartedness or disrespectful and had this been the case I would

have taken steps to ensure that this was corrected.

              As    1 have   stated   the   first    time      I became aware                 that    there    had Peer; a

              problem    in the ground was at about 3. 1 0 p m when Cnief                              inspector Beai

              came    into the gym and told us to                 clear all              the taoies     away as the area

              was    to be used as a mortuary.              The        only other            times    i can recall with

              any a c c uracy are 8 . 3 0 pm that        night when                 I nad a ten minute          break ana

              went    outside and 5.30am         ohe following                    morning wnen       1 went    off duly.

              Almost    i m m e d iately after     the   instruction nad been g i v e n                   by    M r . Beai

              bodies    began arriving.          They were          being           carries by police          officers

              and    civilians alike,       some    being      carried uoc:t i y . others                on stretchers
anci others           on    n o t i ceboards                 w h i ch     had c e e r t    converted.

In itia lly          the    scene             wa s    one     of       great     confusion             with      peopie          bringing

in    bodies        who     were          obviously               dead     and      wanting           to   leave        them        ana       get

back       as    quickly            as    possible            to       help     those      who        were     s t i J. 1   in      the       crowd

and       injured,

it    wa s      quickly         realised              that        it     would      be    necessary            to       prove

coht i n u i t y      in    r e 1 a t i on           to    the      bodies       and      to     tnis      ena      i   went        to       eat:h

must       remain       with         the       body.           It      struck       me    as         odd a t            the      time         that

there        were     not       a    great           n u mb e r     of    relatives            or     friends           wun      the         bodies

that       were      being          brought           in.

The       relatives         that were w i t h                     the     bodies were               o b v i o u s i y ' deeply

McKay and we decided that                                   the bodies           should          be' ar r anged             in rows           of     Vd .

There were a number                           of doctors who                  seemed to arrive with                           the

As    soon as       possible a supply            of Gen    IS,     Su d d e n Death Hsports,               was

ostained and tnese were                handed to the officers wno were a c c o m p a n y i n g

the bodies wxtn            instructions          that    they should be           completed as             fui iy

as    poss i b l e .

At    first as bodi es a r r i v e d there was                 nat u r a l l y some     conside rable

noise as       people were asking            directions,           expressing anger ana other

emotions.           The scene was       one of      c o nfusion with            police       officers         opemy

cfyiiiq ■ some younqer             officers       so stunned by wnat              they saw         they       could

not even express            their    emotion,,          Det.    Bupe r i ntenaent h c K a y quickiy

took     command of        the si t u a t i o n ana ai rected members                  of    t n e .Liu,    many

dressed      in casual          clothing    to    carry out        tasks w m c n        quic k l y Drought

some form of order to the                  situation.

At a very early staqe               it was       realised that          the scene           insiae      the §ynt,

in particuiar           the area where           the aead were         D e i   ng dealt with,           was      one

that     only 'those whom          it was    necessary to expose, to should see                            it and

a control       was      put on the door.           with the         exception of the              relatively

few    relatives wno            initially    came       in the     only other          persons allo w e d            in

that area were memb e r s            of the       emergency        services,       many       of    the poJ.it.*
                                                                                   .

officers       as      I have    d e s cribed were       casually.dressed,              as    they nad been

for other        duties     earlier     in the      day.

Another       o p eration       that had to be carried out                 in relation             to   tne aead

was to search the bodies and                     list and secure any              property that may be

in their       possession.          This    task was       undertaken           in most       cases      by    the

CID officers,,            It should be said that many                   officers who were

a c company inq the         bodies we re sufterinu,                some    openly,          some    inwardly ana

for this       reason the CID officers were used.

The    bodies as         I have    said were       laid    in rows of twelve with sutticient

space and        room a r o u n d them for         tne t a s k s     to be      carried out without

any     liklihood of        post mor t e m       injury    being       caused.         In the       first

instance       bodies were         covered wit h whi te paper                  tablecloths          and a

•tittle later a number               ct    body bags were         supplied         by the a m b ulance

service,        1 here    were      a limited number           of these and            they were       later

reused as 'they became available                     after    some       bodies were           removed to 'the

Medico Legal        CerfC r e .      inhere body joags could not be s u p plied then

aft e r n o o n and took       command of the          question of             id e n t i f i c a t i o n of the

bodies.        It should be said                that soon after          the bodies        had arrived

there was       o b v iously      friends and        parents arriving              at the gym.,          They

were    directed      to the        rear    of the North Stand and                 I u n d e r s t a n d from

there    taken by coach to H a m m e r t o n Road Pol ice Station,

By what       I would estimate             to be aro u n d    tea time of that                 day all     the

bodies    had been searched etc,                   and we were          left with the task            of

identification.            M r . Adaie          briefed all     the officers             who were to be

involved      in the      t a s k , in the main        still     the CID officers.                 He briefed

them fully and           clearly explaining            that     the      process w hich had been

agreed    between himself and M r . Popper,                     the Coroner,             was   that   polaroid

photographs would            be     taken of the head ana shoulders                       of the

deceased.        These w ould db d i splayed               on screens           in a passageway which

ran alongside        the gym         coming out       in the gym at             the other        end of the

building.        Screens were             sent    for and a viewing area was                   constructed

which allo w e d      relatives           the    privacy   required for            the    identif i c a t i o n

and kept from them the               scene        in the mortuary.

Once    the   identif i c a t i o n had been          carried out             then the     officer

a c c o m panying   the    body,      together wit h a CID officer                    from other

divisions       and s u pportive workers              such as       social       workers and

churchmen,       took     down what         details    were     required.

The    gym became        s e ctioned       into three.        One       end holding        the    dead,      the

middle    section        holding     the        officers who     had brought             in the    bodies and

the other       end holding         the     relatives after             the    identification.

       Further to my previous statement regarding the events at Hillsborough
      on the 15 ia April 1989.

      I have been asked to describe in more detail my observations and duties in the
      temporary mortuary in the gymansium.

      As I have stated the first time I became aware that there had been a problea in
      the ground was at about 3.10pm when Chief Inspector Beal came into the gym
      and told us to clear all the tables away as the area wasto toe used as a mortuary.
      The only other times I can recall with any accuracy are 8.30pm that night when I
      had a ten minute break jaaltaid® and went outside and 5*30am the following morning when
      I went off duty.

      Almost immediately after the instruction had been given by Mr. Beal bodies began
      arriving. They were being carried by police officers and civilians alike, some
      being carried bodily, others on stretchers and others on noticeboards which had
      been converted,

      Initially the scene was one of great confussion with people bringing in bodies who star
      were obviously dead and wanting to leave them and get back as quickly as possible to
      help those who were still in the crowd and injured.
      It was quickly realised that it would be necessary to prove continuity in relation
      to the bodies and to this end I went to each group who brought in a body and instructe
      that at least one officer must remain with the body.    It ■m s. struck me as odd at
      the time that there ?/ere not a great number of relatives or friends with the bodies
      that were being brought in.

      The relatives that were with the bodies were obviously deeply distressed and
      wherever possible were given evez*y assistance by the police officers present. They
      were initially allowed to remain with the deceased.    I do however recall two
      instances where la peolple became so upset that they were' shouting and becoraming
      a danger to the peojble there.   There was no alternative but to forcibly remove them
      from the area until they calmed down. In both cases the people calmed down
      appologised for their understandable reactions and thanked us for understanding.

      As I was going to each body that arrived I soon became aware that at the rate
      the bodies were arriving it would soon be impossible to accomodate ail any more.
      I expressed my fears to Det Supt. McKAY and we decided that the bodies should
      be arranged in rows of 12.

      There were a number of doctors who saadataiiz seemed to arrive with the casualties
      and they were quickly establishing whether a casulaty was dead or otherwise.
      katexax SfaayzasracBtaaiifx There were eventually I believe five doctors, some of
      whom had attended the match as spectators and after the first check for obvious
      signs of life they went through i&mzmstixes all the bodies in the mortuary and
      formally certified life extinct.

      As soon as possible a supply of Gen 18 , Sudden Death reports was obtained and
      these were handed to the officers who were accompanying the bodies with instructions
      that they should be completed as fully as possible.

      iaxfckexiHfc At first as bodies arrived there was naturally some considerable noise
      as people were asking directions, expressing anger and other emotions. The scene
      was one of confusiion with police officers openly crying, some younger officers
      so stunned by what they saw they could not even express their emotion.
      Det. Supt McKay quickly took command of the situation and directed members of the
      C.I.D., many dressed in casual clothing to carry out tasks which quickly brought
      some form of order to the situation.
At a very early stage it was realised that the scene inside the gym, in particular
the area where the Jb dead were being dealt with was one that only those whom it was
necessary to expose to should see it and a control was put on the door.   With the
exception of the relatively few relatives who initally came in the only other persons
allowed in that area were 2aiiaaxSi£ members of the emergency services, many of the
police officers as I have described were casually dressed, as they had been for toher duties
earlier in the day.

Another operation that had to be carried out in relation to the dead was to search the
bodies and list and secure any property that may be in their possession. This task was
undertaked in most cases by the MS3L C.I.D. officers*   It should be said that magy
officers who were accompanying the bodies were suffering some openly some inwardly
and izxzxd&xzttdx for this reason i&Egx   the CID officers were used.

The bodies as I have said were laid in rows of twelve with sufficent space and room around
them for the tasks to be carried out without any likelyhood of post mortem injury being
caused. In the first instance bodies were covered with white paper tableclothes
and a little later a number of body bags were supplied by the ambulance service.
There were a limited number of these and they were later reused as they became available
after some bodies were removed to the medico legal centre.    Where body bags could not
be supplied then blankets were used to cover the bodies.


Det. flh. Supt Addis arrived at the scene later that afternoon and took command of
the question of identification of the bodies.    It should be said that soon after
the bodies had arrived there was obviously friends and parents arriving at the gym.
They were directed to the rear of the North Stand and I understand from there taken by
coach to Hammerton Road Police Station.

By what I would estimate to be around tea time of that day all the bodies had been
searched etc and we were left with the task of identification. Mr. Addis briefed all the
officers who were to be involved in the task, in the main still the CID officers.
He briefed them fully and clearly explainang that the process which had been agreed
between himself and Mr. Popper the Coroner was that polaroid photographs would be taken
of the head and shoulders of the deceased.      These would be displayed on ±z screens
in a pasageway which ran t v h e x alongside the gym comming out in the gym at the other
end of the building.   Screens were sent for and a viewing area was constructed which
allowed relatives the privacy       required for the identification and kept from them the
scene in the mortuary.

Once the identification had been carried out then the officer accompanying the body
together with a CID officer from other divisions and supportive workers such as social
workers and churcmen, took down what details were required.

The gym became sectioned into three. One end holding the dead, the middle section
holding the officers who had brought in th bodies and the other end holding the relatives
after the identificat ion.

Once an identification by photograph had been made the kefiyxBuakaxz photograph bearing the
body number was brought through to me and a team of officers working under me. The
body was checked against the photograph, cleaned and made presentable before being
wheeled on a trolley into the identification area.   Once identified the body was then
taken to an outer door where it was transported to the itorfeitaxyx Medico Legal Centre
by ambulance.

The officers who were carrying out this harrowing task were without exception well seasoned
officers with considerable experience. They acted with total reverence and respect for
both the dead and the relatives who attended for identification.

I have twenty one years service in the police force and have had to deal with death in
many forms during this time. I cannot recall ann inciderrt^Mch could be compared to what
took place on that day and the problems that we as af\13©5y0were presented with.is We had
people dead with friends and relatives already there wanting to know what had happened
and if their worst fears had been realised. In the months that hasre passed since that
date I have thought on many occasions of what was done and how it was done.
    In the cold light of day and with the advantage of hindsight I can think of.perhaps
    one or two things that could have nteeen improved in relation to the handling and
    disposal of relatives and the deceased.    These would only have assisted in the
    xj3H0«2x administration side of the incident and I can say that soa&ziafxfeka I was there
    i n that gymnasium possibly longer than anyone else. I saw nothing which             I
    could describe as irreverence, coldheartedness or disrespectful, and had this been the
    case I would have taken steps to ensure that this was corrected.

    (-"'^With reference to my previous statement dated 27th April,        1989,

           relating to the Hillsborough Disaster.

           Elaborating on the events as I saw them,    in the the temporary

           mortuary which was set up in the gymnasium behind the North Stand

           within the confines of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground,         I

           would like to add that probably without exception nobody present had

           ever encountered the situation that was to follow.      From the

           direction given by Chief Inspector Beal that the gymnasium was to be

           cleared to make provisions for a temporary mortuary and to receive an

           unknown number of deceased persons from the Leppings Lane end of the

           ground,    did everybody present - in my estimation - behave commendably

           Faced with a completely unpredictable set of circumstances,        Police

           Officers    including members of the Special Constabulary,   Doctors,

           members of Religious Orders - and many others who volunteered

           their expertise,    assistance and compassion,   conducted themselves

           admirably.

           Initially,    I recall the body of a young boy being brought   into the

           mortuary and he was accompanied by a uniformed Police Officer I




                                                                           z.

  believe was             from the R o t h e r h a m Division.           The body was        car e f u l l y

  carried and             laid    (as all    s ubsequent bodies were that                 I saw brought

  into the gymnasium)               and p o s i t i o n e d    in the far      left hand corner of

  the d e s i g n a t e d area.        The same Police Officer who was o b v i o u s l y

  totally o v e r c o m e and crying,               clea r l y was      simply showing his

  emotions and dee p sorrow.                     I b r i e f l y related m y s e l f     to this

  situation,          b eing a father of 2 y o u n g daughters,                  and     I fully

  a p p r e c i a t e d and a c c e p t e d the O f f icers          reaction.     I remember          seeing

  hi m still v ery tearful               and d i s t r e s s e d a few hours         later and         in

  spite of being a p p r o a c h e d by a senior                     Police Officer and advised

  to both          leave the confines of the g y m n a s i u m and go home,                     he

  de c l i n e d    to do so and remained w i t h               the y oung pitiful         victim.

  W i t h i n a short space of time, m o r e and m o r e bodies wer e received

  having been brought                to the tem p o r a r y m o r t u a r y by all m a n n e r of

  m e a n s and persons.            For a time,         the s i t u a t i o n was n a t u r a l l y

  con f u s i n g and in slight d i s a r r a y because,                 again not only were

  tota l l y u n p r e d i c t e d circu m s t a n c e s      s u d d e n l y forced on those

  present,          but    in a number of cases               those present       i.e.    civilians,

  su ppor ters a c c o m p a n y i n g      injured and deceased,             who had never            ever

  w i t n e s s e d or ex p e r i e n c e d such a d i s t r e s s i n g and d i s t r a u g h t      scene.

  W i t h other Police Officers,                  mainly       those from H a m m e r t o n Road

  CID,     I assisted            in receiving and          laying out bodies b eing brought

  each to be able to attend and v i e w w h e n                        it became necessary.

  Though      i n itially some bodies w ere b e i n g                  left   in situe

  unaccompanied,              I believe      that    it was Mr.         Mckay,   CID Superintendent,

  who called above a general                     level of noise,          for Police Offic e r s            to

   remain w i t h any d e c e a s e d they brou g h t                into the gymnasium.

tragedy were o b v i o u s l y suffering fro m some sort of injuries and

whilst     they wer e     initially carried           to the site of the t e m porary

mortuary,      they wer e      then transf e r r e d      to an area at the far end

a t t e n t i o n from those persons a v a i l a b l e and capable              to render       it.

One pe r s o n brou g h t    in still alive but               looking very pallor and

grey    in his face,        and a p p eared to be s e r i o u s l y       injured,      was

laid on the g y m n a s i u m floor        in a s e m i c o n c i o u s position.        I went

had s u f f i c i e n t l y rec o v e r e d to mak e his own wa y out of the building.

Du r i n g the course of that same a f t e r n o o n and evening thro u g h to the

early hours of Sunday,                16th April,     1989,       I assisted      in rec e i v i n g   the

bodies of those vict i m s of the disaster.                        These bodies w e r e       laid     in

rows of twelve fro m the back to the front of the g y m n a s i u m and I

recall     some of them being covered by w h i t e paper clothes.

Subsequently,        body bags were mad e a v a i l a b l e by the South Y o r k s h i r e

A m b u l a n c e who w e r e present     in small      numb e r s    initially but        increased

in manpower,        being c o m manded by Mr.           Hopkins.

If possible,        the b o d y A identified and the p r o p e r t y from it itemised

was    in progress.            Certainly,         those a f f e c t e d were further             comforted

by police and social workers,                      etc.,     who w e r e also present.

W h e n both dead and            injured persons w ere                 first brought      into the

members of Religious Orders      and many others who volunteered

their expertise, assistance and compassion,    conducted themselves

admirably.

Initially,   I recall the body of a young bay being br ought into tne

mortuary and he was accompanied by a uniformed Police Officer I

aelieve was from the Rotherham Division,,.   The body was carefully

carried and laid (as all subsequent oodles were that I saw brought

into tne gymnasium) and positioned in the far left hand corner of

the designated area.     Tne same Police Officer who was obviously

totally overcome and crying,    clearly was simply showing his

emotions and deep sor row.    I briefly related myself to this

situation,   oeing a father of £ young daughters, and I fully

appreciated ana accepted the Officers reaction.     i remember seeing

him still very tearful and distressed a few hours later and in

spite of being approached by a senior Polics Officer and advised

to both leave the confines of tne gymnasium and go home, he

declined to do so and remained with the young pitiful victim.

Within a short -space of time, more and more bodies were received

having been brought to the temporary mortuary by ail manner of

means and persons.     For a time, the situation was naturally

confusing ana in slight disarray be cause, again not only were

totally unpredicted circumstances suddenly forced on those

present, but in a number of cases those present i.e. civilians,

supporters accompanying injured and deceased, who had never ever

witnessed or experienced such a distressing and distraught scene.

With other Police Officers, mainly those from Hammerton Road

CID,   1 assisted in receiving and laying out bodies being brought

in, these being lined 10 to a line with sufficient space around

each to be able to attend and view when it toecame necessary.

Though initially some bodies were being left in situe

                                                                                  S62

unaccompanied,   I believe that it was Hr,, hckay , c.ii.) Superintendent,

who called above a general level of noise,         for Police Officers to

remain with any deceased they brought into tne gymnasium.

Some of those conveyed from the immediate location of the

traaedy were obviously suffering from some sort of injuries and

whilst they were initially carried to the site of the temporary

mortuary,   they were then transferred to an area at the far ena

of the aymnas iurn proper where they received immediate medical

attention from those persons available and capable to render it.

One person brought in still alive tout. .looking very pa 1-ior and

grey in his face, and appeared to &e seriously injured, was

laid on the gymnasium floor in a semi concious position,,                1 went

to attend to him and comfort him and after about halt an hour

or so, the man who gave his details as ____________________

had sufficiently recovered to make his own way out of the building-

During the course of that same afternoon and evening through to the

early hours of Sunday,     16th April,    1989,   I assisted in receiving the

bodies of those victims of tne disaster,,          these   d o   dies were i-aicl in

rows of twelve from the back to the front of the gymnasium ana i

recall some of them being covered by while paper c 1 otnes.

in manpower,    being commanded by Mr,, Hopkins,

If possible,    tne body identified and the property from it itemised

and logged, though in the first place the property was bagged ana

remained with the body.

All dealings and procedures concerning trie aead bodies „ apart f rom

some early confusion which arose when they were first Drought into

the gymnasium, were carried out in as proficient and collected manner

        as they could be in tne given ci rcumstances.

        Later in tne evening, a procedure was introduced whs re by relatives of

        the deceased     having first viewed P o l a r o i d photographs which had

        been taken earlier of the dead oy SOCO's and displayed on the board

        in a cor r idor outside tn'e gymnasium ~ were shown ana asked to

        identify a body which was presented to them on a wheeled stretcher

        and taken to an area away from the temporary mortuary which was

        parti tioneo off from other on-going activities.        Needless to say,

        there was overwhelming distress and heartbreak by both relatives arm

        friends of the deceased, ana Police Officers and the like, as this

        was in progress.    Certainly,   those affected were further comforted

        by police and social workers,     etc. , who were also present.

        Once identified,   the bodies were taken through a rear door of the

        building to -a waiting ambulance before being conveyed to the

        mortuary until eventually approximately 20 remained laid b u t .on tne

        gymnasium fioor.

        When both dead arid injured persons were first D r o u g h t   into tne

        temporary mortuary ar ea , they were attended to by 4 or 5 doctors who

        were present at the Ground and offered their professional assistance

        in the best way they could.      They were able to pronounce death in

        some cases out at tne same time, provide artificial respiration to

        others as did all sorts of unknown people«

Statement of Stephen Iilley    DC 491

With reference to ray previous statement dated 27th April, 1989, relating to
the Hillsborough Disaster;

Elaborating on the events as I saw them, in the temporary mortuary which was set
up in the gymnasium behind the North Stand within the confines of the Sheffield
Wednesday Football Ground, I would like to add that
xajcxiJisrt nobody present had ever encountered the situation that was to follow.

Eai±HH±Kg Prom the direction given by Chief Inspector Beal that the gymnasium
was to be cleared to make provisions for a temporary raortary and to receive
an unknown number of deceased persons from the leppings lane end of the ground,
did everybody present - in my estimation - behaSre Kite commendably.

Paced with a completely unpredicatble set of circumstances, Police Officers including
Specs members of the Special Constabulary, Doctors,
acaxbExtxtheyzocBHM - and many others who volunteered their expertise, assistance
and compassion, conducted themselves admirably.

Initially, I recall the body of a young boy being brought into the mortuary
and he was accompanied by a uniformed Police Officer I believei was from the
Rotherham Division*   The body was carefully carried and laid(as all subsequent
bodies were that I saw brought into the gymnasium) dlncA, positiomtin the far left
hand corner of the scxaac designated area.   The same Police Officer
overcome and crying, clearly was simply showing his emotions and deep sorrow.atad:
I briefly related sSilig l8is situation,to* being a father of 2 young daughters,Hyasa&f?:
and I fully appreciated and accepted the Officers reaction.     I remember seeing him
still very tearful and bxkxksbs distressed a few hours later and inspite of bejng
approached bg a senior Police Officer and advised to both leave the confines of the
gymnasium and go home, he declined to do so and remained with the young pitiful victim.


Within a short space of time, more and more bodies were received having been brought to
the temporary mortuary by all manner of means and persons.     For a time, the situation
was naturally confusing and in slight disarray because, again not only StfLsjCK totally
unpredicted mdnaackxGOt circumstances suddenly fccHSsackHst forced on those present, but
in a number of cases those present i.e. civilians, supporters accompanying injurid
and deceased, who had never ever witnessed or experienced such^distressing and distraught
scene.

With other Police Officers, mainly those from Hamaerton Road CID, I assisted in
receiving and laying out bodies being brought in, these being lined 10 to the line
with sufficient space around each to be able to attend and view when it became
necessary.   Though initially some bodies were being left in situe unaccompanied, I
believe that it was Mr.MeKay, CID Superintendent, who called above a general level of
noise* for Police Officers to remain with any deceased they brought into the gymnasium.
Some of those conveyed from the immediate location of the tragedy were obviously
suffering from some sort of injuries and whilst they were initially carried to the
site of the temporary mortuary, they were then transferred                           the
far end of the gymnasium proper aadzscfeiaHi3adxtiBKjWheig^|hey received immediate
medical attention from those sjm persons available/to render it. .. ,.

One person brought in still alive but looking very pallor and grey in his face,
anda appeared to be seriously injuried, was laid on the gymnasium floor in a semi­
conscious position.    I went to attend to him and comfort him and after about half
an hour or so, the man who gave his details as
                      Liverpool                          had sufficiently recovered to
make his own way out of the building.

During the course of that same afternoon and evening through to the early hours of
Sunday, 1$th April, 1989, I assisted in receiving the bodies of those victims of
the disaster.     These bodies were laid in rows of t&31 from tesckxfcB the back to the
front of the gymnasium and I recall some of them being covered by white paper clothacs
Subsequently, body bags were made available by the South Yorkshire Ambulance who
were present in small numbers initially but increased in manpower, being commanded
by Mr. Hopkins.

Property from each deceased was itemised and logged and if possible the body identified

If possible, the body was identified and the property from it itemised and logged ,
though XK±fc in the first place the property iBoiaiHEixsatifekxtiia; was bagged and remained with
 the body.
All dealings and procedures concerning dead bodies, apart from some early confusion
which arose when they were first brought into the gymnasium, were carried out in as
proficient and collected manner as xfexQaauM they could be in the given circumstances.

Later in the evening, a procedure was introduced whereby relatives of the deaeased -
having first viewed polaroid photographs which had been taken earlier of the dead by
SOCO's and displayed on a board rak2 ±(3az±hazg3raBtx±$8H in a corridor outside the
gymnasium - were shown and asked to identify a body which was presented to them on
a wheeled stretcher and taken to an area away from the temporary mortuary which was
partitioned off from other sB±±x±k±as on-going activities.      Needless to say, there
was overwhelming distress and heartbreak by both relatives^*®* and friends of the de>
 creased, and Police officers and the likes as this was in progress.       Certainly, those
affected were further comforted by police and social workers, etc., who were also
present®*
Once identified, the bodies were taken tkraughaa rear door of the building to a waiting
ambulance before being conveyed to the mlortuary until eventually approx. 20 remained
laid out on the gymnasium floor.

When both dead and injured persons were first brought into the temporary mortuary area,
they were attended to by 4 or 5 doctors who were present at the Ground and offered their
                                                                                  P- T O .

professional assistance in the best way they could.   They were able to pronounce
death in some cases but at the same time, provide artificial respiration to others
as did all xoagfrfcxx sorts of unknown people.

The efforts put into the running of the temporary sgsnuaaaiaBx mortuary in the gymnasium
by whoever, izihHiagkkziiaxzxeKyxjiaii who adapted themselves quickly and professionally,
I thought were tremendous and fajfenrfxga&x they conducted themselves accordingly giving
the consulation and consideration to those who needed it.

        At 9.00 am Saturday, 15 April 1989, I paraded for duty and made my way to

         the Hillsborough Football Ground to police the F.A. Cup Semi Final between

        Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                                                   1% duty for that day was to be in a

         serial supervised by Inspector Ellis and Sergeant Tissington.



        The briefing for the match took place at 10.00 am in the North Stand and

        we        were          briefed             as       to       our         overall             duties             by       Chief           Superintendent

        Duckenfield.                      Following this we were then briefed as a serial by Inspector

         Ellis.             We were told that our duties were in Wallsend Road, where parking

         space had been made available for transit vans of Liverpool supporters.

        We were told to search supporters as they alighted from the vehicles, and

         also to inspect their tickets.                                              We were told that at the commencement of

         the game we would be on standby duties, and at the conclusion of the match

         we were               to go onto the perimeter track of the pitch.

                          (CJ Act, 1967, s.9: MC Act, 1980, s.102:                MC Rules, 1981, r.70)


            Continuation of statement of                Julie Anne NESBIT

             Following the briefings I took refreshments and took up position with the

             rest Of my serial in Wallsend Road for 11.15 am.



            Wallsend Road is a single carriageway road with one carriageway in each

             direction.      It is situated off Halifax Road opposite the railway station.

             The other end of Wallsend Road is a dead-end.                             The car park we had for the

             transit vans was at the far end of the road and was not very large.                                  As we

             did not    know     how many vehicles to expect                          we   parked vehicles   as    they

             arrived down one side of Wallsend Road until                             we reached the car park, and

             then we started filling that.



             Early on very few vehicles arrived but the occupants of those that did

             were searched and tickets were inspected.                           Some of the vehicles had cans

             of beer/lager inside but none of the occupants wished to take alcohol out

             of the vehicles.        The fans who arrived early were not drunk.                         However, the

             fans that were arriving later in the transit vans had obviously consumed

             alcohol    on     the   journey.     Despite having                 had       a drink,   they were     not

             disruptive at this time.



             Further    up Halifax Road,        away from the ground,                      was   the coach park.     We

             noticed    that many fans were beginning to walk down Halifax Road towards

              the ground.       With other members of my serial I stood at the junction of

             Wallsend Road       and Halifax Road. Whenever a                         transit van turned into the

             road we would       direct it         where to                 park and itwas then searched as I have

            .previously stated.

 As more fans were walking down Halifax Road we believed we were better

 employed at      its junction with Wallsend Road.                            I do not know how many

 transit vans we parked as I did not count them, but I would estimate there

 were no more than 20.



 As the time got nearer to kick off more and more people were walking down

 Halifax Road.       Some of them did not have tickets and were standing by me

 trying     to buy   then from other         fans.            When questioned by me about not

 having a ticket they said such things as, 'I've never had a ticket but I

 always get into the ground', or 'I'll buy one on the way down'.



 Many of the fans who were walking down the road were in large groups, most

 of whom were carrying and consuming alcohol.                                The groups were the full

 width of the pavement.           They were drinking from cans, bottles and litre

 and half bottles.        They were carrying extra bottles and cans with than and

 had      then in shirt    and    trouser pockets.                   Many of     then were drunk and

 staggering but they were not disruptive.                          Some of the lads were stopping

 and sitting on a wall near me to drink.                            Those who looked particularly

 drunk or had large quantities of alcohol with them I went over and spoke

  to.      I obviously did not want          to antagonise then but I asked why they

 hadn't stayed in Liverpool           to get drunk as they didn't seem capable of

 getting to and watching a football match.                            I got replies such as, 'We're

 alright',     'we sober up when we get into the ground', and 'we always watch

  football like this'.

        Continuation of statement of          Julie Anne NESBIT

        As time passed DS Tissington, who was the only member of our serial to be

        issued with a radio,           informed me and other members of our serial to try

        and move the crowds along to the ground.



        Shortly before 3.00 pm, when there were only a few stragglers making their

        way to the ground, our serial began to walk down Halifax Road intending to

        go to Claywheels Lane.           There were many empty bottles and cans along the

        road.



        As we got onto Claywheels Lane we met up with a number of other serials

        under the comnand of Inspector Charles.                     At this time a radio message was

        received by the Inspector, who then told us to make our way to the ground.

        At    that   time   I did not know why.               As we             got onto Leppings Lane and

        approached     the ground I noticed a crowd of people outside the ground:

        there was also a number of police officers about.                           Inspector Charles asked

        on the radio for further instructions and told us to make our way into the

        ground.      I made my way in through an open gate, at the side of which was

        an     ambulance.



        I noticed people were being carried out of the Leppings Lane terracing to

        the ambulance; others were running up to me and shouting such things as

        'murderer' and 'you're fucking killing us in there'.                           Because of this, and

        the fact that I was still unaware of what was happening,                              I made my way

        into the Leppings Lane terracing through the tunnel.                             I stood and looked

        down towards the pitch trying to assess the situation.                            I saw total panic

        - people were everywhere and were still coming and shouting in my face.                           I

 saw DC Hubbard, a colleague from Rotherham, on top of the perimeter fence,

 and many other officers were also on top of this fence leaning over from

 the pitch side into the terracing.                                Below them people were everywhere.                    I

made my way down the terracing in front of the West Stand in pen 4 and

 began   telling people who were standing                                      to get out            through the tunnel.

Many people were reluctant to do so, stating they were looking for people.

 I then began physically pushing them backwards as it was apparent to me

 that no one would find anyone until the pen was cleared.                                                As I made my way

 down I noticed people climbing over the fence separating pens 3 and 4.



A colleague shouted me to go through the gate and onto the pitch to help

 carry out the fans who were by the gate.                                       He helped me onto the pitch and

 I then began helping to lift people from the inside of pen 4 and laid them

 on the pitch.     I helped carry out three or four bodies, one of which was a

young girl with short dark hair wearing jeans and a Liverpool shirt.                                                   The

 others were all men, one of whom was of a very heavy build.                                                 All of these

 bodies I laid on the pitch wherever I could find a space.                                                    All of the

 bodies I carried out I did so with the help of other officers.



On returning      to   the gate                again I could not                              get   through due   to other

 officers who were there, so I walked round the ambulance that was on the

 pitch and went to the gate at pen 3.                                 Here, there was a chain of officers,

 and the bodies were being passed along it to get them out of this section

 of the terracing.       At       that time I saw my husband, Chief Superintendent

 Nesbit,   inside the terracing of pen 3, helping other officers with the

 removal of bodies.      I got into the chain and helped here for some time.                                             I

then moved on to help with the removal of bodies off the pitch.                                   Due to

the lack of stretchers, advertising boards were used and fans who were on

the pitch and not injured were bringing them over for us to use.



I started lifting the bodies onto the stretchers with other people who

then carried them away.          As one was taken away I lifted the next body on,

and so on.



Many of the fans who were on the pitch were helping with this and carrying

the bodies off, but some of the fans were very angry and were shouting.

As the fans had less to do we were asked to form a line across the pitch

to contain the fans in their own half of the ground.                            Many were obviously

beginning to realise what had happened and were very distressed.                                 I tried

to comfort them as best I could.



Following this, a mesage was passed over the ground's P.A. system that the

game was abandoned.        The crowds then began to leave.                         When the terraces

were empty I started to help move the fans who were still on the pitch out

of the ground.      Many were upset and needed consoling.                       When the ground was

eventually emptied I joined other officers who were sitting in the North

Stand.    I then returned to Claywheels Lane and went of duty at 8.30 pm.



The previous year,       that is in 1988, I was also on duty at the semi final

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                       My duties on that occasion were

-the supervision,      control     and   searching             of      Liverpool   fans      outside   the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.          Having had the opportunity of seeing on tele-

         vision and video the scenes outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles in 1989,

         I can say they bare no resemblance to those in 1988.                          The spectators in

         1988 were boisterous and in high spirits but generally they                           were good

         humoured and co-operative.        They did not object to being searched and they

         responded to our requests and directions.                          The fans began arriving well

         before the kick off time and at around 3.00 pm, because there were very

         few spectators in Leppings Lane and at the turnstiles, I was released from

         my duties and went into the West               Stand just as the game conmenced.            WhenI

         left the turnstiles in         Leppings         Lane         there were no queues -just afew

         people standing around who were not causing any problems.

            to      that      time       I had          little          or    no    command          experience          of    public        order

            situations                 whatsoever.

            During         the         winter          and    early          spring       of       1979/1980       the    Steelworkers

            strike         took         place          in    the       Sheffield          area       and    I became          heavily

            committed              to    the       provision             of    that       public       order       situation.

            Additionally,                 I was             involved          in    the       policing       of    League         football

At    that       time       Sheffield             Wednesday             were       in       the    second          division             and

although          there          were    some          crowd       problems,                nothing          of    a    very       serious

nature          occurred.

We    learned          some       weeks       prior          to    the       date       of       the    1980       FA       Cup    Semi       final

that       that       match       was    to       be    staged          at       Hillsborough.                    As    a    result,          I

eKamined          all       our    previous             documentation                   concerning                the       policing          of

major       football             matches          with       capacity             crowds          at    that       stadium             and,       in

the       light       of    my    experience             of       the       public          order       situations                of    the

Steel       strike          and    the       general          situation                in a       public          order          sense,       I was

not       satisfied          that       the       policing             arrangements                which          had       appertained

hitherto          at       Hillsborough                were       adequate             to    deal       with       the       occasion             that

we    were       confronted             with       in    1980.              I therefore                gave       instructions                that

we    should          completely             re-think             the       situation             and    draw          up    a    policing

policy          and    contingency                plan       to    adequately                police          the       1980       semi-final

cup       tie    with       an    anticipated                crowd          in    excess          of    50,000.              That       was

carried          out       and    the    Police          Operational                   Order       which          came       into       being

for       the    policing          of    that          match       is       still       the       backbone             of    that       which

appertains             to    this       day       to    the       best       of    my       knowledge,             although             of

course,          with       the    passing             years,          it    has       been       honed       and       refined          to       take

account          of    changing          circumstances                      at    the       ground       and       with          local       road

systems.              The    policing             arrangements                   for    the       1980       semi-final                proved          to

be    a    superb          success,          no    doubt          as    a    result          of    good       crowd          behaviour,

good       weather,          and    teams          travelling                from       totally          opposite                directions,

north       and       south,       which          obviated             the       need       of    traffic:         congestion                on    the

motorway          systems          and       that       type       of       thing.

The       following          year       in    1981       we       learned,             again,          that       Hillsborough                was

to    host       an    FA    Semi-Final                Cup    match.              The       teams       in    that          match       were

Tottenham             Hotspur       and       Wolverhampton                      Wanderers             and    the       date       of    the

match       being          Satruday          11    April          1981.           To    the       best       of    my       recollection
we      again       had       adequate          time       to    pre-plan          that       match.

There         are       occasions             after    drawn          matches       when       police       forces          have       to

plan         such       matches          at    very    short          notice,       but       I believe          in    1981       We       had

more         thatn       adequate             time    to    prepare          our    planning.              Based       on       the

success            of    the       previous          year       in    1980    we    followed          the       ’m i x t u r e    as

bef o r e ’.            The       only    difference             being       that,       on    this    occasion,                both

teams         were       approaching             the       City       from    the     south      -    that       is    travelling

north         on    the       M1.        Tottenham          fans       travelling             either       by    the       A1    or    M1

and       the      Wolverhampton                Wanderers             supporters          coming       from          the    Midlands

travelled               by    a    number       of    routes,          mostly       using       the    A38       and       joining          the

Ml      so    that       both       teams       were       approaching             the    City       from       the    same

direction.                   In    the    event       that       caused       problems.              There       were       traffic

accidents               and       other       matters       which       resulted          in    the    late          arrival          of

fans         at    the       stadium.

I have            been       given       the    opportunity             of    having          sight    of       the    minutes             of    a

debriefing               for       the    F.A.       Cup    Semi-Final             between       Tottenham             Hotspur             FC

and      Wolverhampton                   Wanderers          FC       held    at    Hillsborough,                Sheffield             on    11

April         19 8 1 ,       with       the    Police       Policy          File    No.       122/02/08          and       can    confirm

that         the    bundle          of    the    documents             under       that       reference          number

accurately               reflect          the    events          of    the    day    and       the    inquiry          which

resulted            from          the    slight       crushing          in    the     Leppings         Lane          end    resulting

from         the    late          arrival       of    fans       at    the    last       few    minutes          before          the       kick

off.

I       remained         as       Divisional          Commander             for    ’F ’ D i v i s i o n     until          November

198H         when       I transferred                back       to    C.I.D.       duties       as    head       of    the       Force

C.I.D.             During          my    time    in    office          there       the    sub    divisional                Commanders

of      FI    Division             changed       on    several          occasions.              Initially,
    '                               i
Superintendent                     Stark       was    a Sub-Divisional                   Commander,             followed          by

Superintendent                     David       Chapman,          who    was       then    succeeded             by

Superintendent                     Dpuglas       Lock       (now       retired).              Each    of    those          officers
was    aware,          and    dealt       personally              with          many       of    the       routine          league

matches       staged          at    the       Hillsborough                 Stadium          and       it    was       only       on    the

occasion          of    a    major       match       such     as       a    semi       final          cup       tie,       or    one    in

which       intelligence             dictated           was       potentially                   troublesome,                that       I would

personally             take    command          and     attend             at    the       ground          in    uniform          to    do       so.

During       my    time       at    *F*       Division        we       experienced                   difficulties                in    our

relationships                with    the       Hillsborough                 Club,          insofar          as    the       activities

of    their       official          stewards          was     concerned.                    The       respective                duties       of

police       officers          and       the    club     stewards                at    football             matches             are    quite

clearly       defined.              There       were     many          occasions,                however,             when       I felt          the

stewards          totally          abrogated          their        responsibility                      and       blatently             ignored

incidents          to       which    they       should        have          responded.                 Such       was       my    concern

that    on    18 A u g u s t        1981       I dictated              a    memorandum                to    Acting

Superintendent                Walter          Smith     and       Inspector                Calvert          on    FI       Sub-Division

regarding          that       concern          and    giving           them          precise          instructions                as    to       the

briefing          of    stewards          for    the     future.                 I have          been       allowed             sight       of    a

photostat          copy       of    that       memorandum,                 dated       18.8.81,             under          Policy       File

BE201       instructing             those       officers           to       formally             brief          the    stewards             as    to

their       precise          terms       of    reference           and          duties          and    their          relationship

with    the       police       officers          who     were          detailed             to       duty       inside          and    outside

the    ground          in    the    immediate           vicinity                of    the       entrance          and       exit       gates.

I have       been       allowed          by C h i e f    Inspector                   Ross       of    the       West       Midlands

Investigation                Team    to       have    sight        of       a    transcript                of    evidence             given       by

ex    Police       Superintendent                Douglas           Lock          to    the       Inquiry,             being       conducted

by L o r d    Justice          Taylor,          into     the       hillsborough                      Disaster.              At    one       point

in    his    evidence          Mr    Lock       makes       reference                 to    succeeding                Mr    Chapman          at

FI    Sub-Division             and       attending          the        Sheffield                Wednesday             Football          Ground

with    myself          and    probably          Mr     Chapman.                 He    also          makes       reference             to    the

fact    that       thereafter             there       was     a    formal             agreement             that       the       police

would       assume          many    of    the    duties           of       the       stewards.              I absolutely,                   and
quite       unequivocally,                    refute          that    suggestion.                    I    cannot          say       that       I

did    not       visit          the     Sheffield             Wednesday             Football             Ground          with

Superintendent                    Lock,       for       I very       probably             did    on       a    number          of

occasions             in     connection             with       perfectly             routine             negotiations.

However,           it      is     certainly             not    the    case          that    there             has       ever       been       any

agreement,              oral       or    in w r i t i n g ,         (formal          or    informal),                   which       in a n y

way    alters           the       duties       of       the    steward          and       those          of    the       police

Having          said       that       I would           also    wish       to       state       for       the       record          that

being       aware          of     the    inadequacies,                the       age       and    often             the

incompetence                 of    the       stewards,          in    the       interests             of       public          safety          I,

as    ground          commander,              always          felt    it       necessary             to       ensure          that       we

had    a    police           officer(s)             available             to    assume          the       duties          of       the

stewards          should           trouble          arise.           In    essence,             I suppose                one       could

say    that       we       were       acting        as    a    longstop,             but    by       no       means       did       we    ever

seek       to    assume           the    responsibilities                      of    the    stewards,                   nor    should          we       do

so.

I have          been       asked        to    comment          on    the       question          of       the       radial          fences

erected          on     the       Leppings          Lane       terracing.                 I have          been          given       sight       of

documentation                   under        Policy       File       P22/0S/08             (referred                to    earlier).                 I

have       been       asked        to    comment          on    the       question          of       the       gates          at    the       rear

of    the       radial          fences        beneath          the    West          Stand       on       the       Leppings             Lane

terrace.              During          the     negotiations                prior       to    the       erection                of    those
fences,       the       Fire       Brigade             were          anxious             to    satisfy          themselves              that       the

gates       when       closed          and       locked          would          be       "under        the      control           of    the

Police".           Clearly,             the       purpose             behind             their       concern           being       to       ensure

an    adequacy          of       safety          precautions                   in    the       public        interest             in a n

emergency.              In       interpreting                   that       requirement,                   I understood                 that       to

mean       that    police          officers                should          be       in    possession              of    keys       and       in a

position          to    open       those          gates          to       ensure          adequate           evacuation                in a n

emergency.              To       the    best          of    my       knowledge                that     took       place       on       each       and

every       match       for       which          I was          ultimately                responsible                and     to    the       best       of

my    knowledge             it    has       been       so       ever       since          1' l e f t      *F*     Division.                 I never

understood             that       requirement                   to    mean          that       a    police        officer          would          be

physically             and       personally                stationed                by    each       of     those       gates          before,

during       and       after,          any       particular                match.              We    have       certainly,              as    police

officers,          been          in a       position             to       open       those          gates       in     plenty          of    time

for    an    emergencey                evacuation,                   for       example,             if a     terrorist             bomb       alert

was    to    arise.              However,             where          the       gates          were     to    be      locked        back       in

the    fully       open          position,             as       at    a    semi-final                tie     where          all    the

supporters             at    the       Leppings             Lane          End       followed           the      same        team,       police

*control*          of       the    gates          was       a    redundant                concept.

I would       comment             that       on       Page       46       of    the       transcript              of    evidence             given

by    Mr    Lock       to    Lord       Justice             T a y l o r ’s          Inquiry,           he    makes          reference             to    a

meeting       that          he    had       at    the       Sheffield                Wednesday              Football          Ground          with

Superintendent                   Chapman,             myself          and       "somebody              from       the       Club",          who    he

identifies             as    Mr    Chester.                 I completely                      refute        that       suggestion             and

accept       that       later          in    his       evidence                Mr    Lock          agreed       that        was    a mistake

and    that       he    intended             to       refer          to    Mr       England.              However,           for       the    record

it    should       be       noted       that          during          my       tenure          of    office          the     Secretary             of

the    Sheffield             Wednesday                Football             Club          was       Eric     England          and       he    was       the

only       Secretary             whom       I ever          personally                   dealt       with       in a        professional

way.        Although             I know          Mr    Chester             he w a s           not    in     post       at    the       time       and       I

Prior to my c ompu lso ry medica l retirement                from the South Y o r k shir e Police Force,

following a domestic accident in the Spring of 1989,                       I was a Chief superintendent

w i t h that Force.        P r i m aril y m y career has been C.I.D.       orientated,   apart   from a few

short spells in uniform.              I was pr omoted to the r a n k I held on my retirement          -

Chief Superintendent           - in October      1979 and transferred from C.I.D.         duties to   'F

D i v i sio n at H a m m e rton Road Polic e Station,         Sheffield.    Prior to that time I had

little or no command experience of public order situations whatsoever.




During the winter and early spring of 1979/1980 the Steelworkers strike took place

in the Sheffield area and I became hea vil y co mmitted to the pr ovi sion of that

public order situation.              Additionally,     I was involved in the policing of League

football matches at the Sheffield W e d n e s d a y football ground at Hillsborough.                      At

that time Sheffield Wedn esda y w e r e in the second d ivision and altho ugh there were

some crowd jarfoblems, nothing of a very serious .nature occurred.

We learned some weeks prior to the date of the 1980 F A Cup Semi final that that

m a t c h was to be staged at Hillsborough.       As a result,     I examined all our previous

d oc ume n t a t i o n concerni ng the policing of major football matches w i t h ca pacity

crowds at that stadiumn and,        in the light of m y experie nce of the public order

situations of the Steel strike and the general s itu ation in a public order sense,

I was not satisfied that the policing arra nge men ts w h i c h had a ppertained hitherto

at H i l l s b o r o u g h w er e adequate to deal w i t h the occa sio n that we wer e confronted

w i t h in 1980.   I therefore gave in str uctions that w e should co mpl ete ly re- thi nk

the si tuation and draw up a policing policy and c ont ing ency pla n to adequatel y

police the 1980 semi-final cup tie w i t h an ant icipated crowd in excess of 50,000.

That was carri ed out and the Police O p erat ion al O rder w h i c h came into being for

the policing of that m a t c h is still the backbone of that w h i c h appertains to this

day to the best of m y knowledge,        althou gh of course, w i t h the passing year;’
                                                                                       ., it

has bee n honed and refined to take account          of ch anging circumsta nces at the ground

and w i t h local road systems.      The policing arrangements for the         1980 semi-final

proved to be a superb success,        no doubt as a result of good crowd behaviour,             good

weather,   and teams travelling from totally opposite directions,              north and south,

w h i c h obviated the need of traffic congest ion on the m o t o r w a y systems and that

type of thing.




The following year i n ' 1981 we learned,       again,   that H ill sb o r o u g h was to host an FA

Semi-Final Cup match.       The teams in that m a t c h were T o t t e n h a m Hotspur and

W ol ver h a m p t o n W and erers and the date of the m a t c h being Satur day 11 Ap ril   1981.

To the best o f mv r e c o llection we again had adequate time to pr e-plan that match.

There are occasions after drawn matc hes w h e n police forces have to plan such

matc hes at very short notice,           but   I beli eve in 1981 we had more than adequate time

to prepare our planning.           Based on the success of the previous year in 1980 we

fo llowed the     'mixture as before'.          The only d iff ere nce being that,          on this

occasion, bot h teams were approaching the Cit y from the south - that                        is travelling

n or th on the Ml.      T o t t e n h a m fans travelling either by the A1 or Ml and the

W o l v erh ampt on W anderers supporters coming from the Midlands travelled by a number

of routes, m o s t l y using the A38 and joining the Ml so that bo th teams were

approaching the Ci ty from the same direction.                  In the event that caused problems.

There were traffic accidents and other m a tte rs w h i c h resulted in the late arrival

of fans at the stadium.




I have been given the op portunity of having sight of the minute s of a debriefing

for the F.A.Cup^-8~6Ii>i-Final b e twe en T o t t e n h a m Hotspur FC and W o l v e r h a m p t o n

that reference number accura tel y reflect the events of the d ay and the inquiry

the late arrival of fans at the last few minut es before the kic k off.




I remained as Divisional Commander for               'F' D ivision until N o v e m b e r    1982 w h e n I

tr ansferred b a c k to C'.I.D. duties as head of the Force C.I.D.                    During m y time in

Douglas L o c k (now retired).        Each of those officers was aware,     and dealt

persona lly w i t h m a n y of the rout ine league m a tch es staged at the Hil lsb orou gh

Stadi um and it was only on the occasion of a major m a t c h such as a semi final cup

tie, or one in w h i c h intelligence dic tat ed was potenti all y troublesome,           that X

w ou ld personal ly take command and attend at the ground in u n i f o r m to do so.




During m y time at     'F' Divi sio n we ex perienced dif ficulties in our re lationships

w i t h the H i lls bor ough Club,   insofar as the activities of their official stewards

we re concerned.     The respective duties of police officers and the club stewards at

football mat ches are quite clearly defined.           Th ere we re m a n y occasions,    however,

w h e n I felt the stewards totally abrogated their r e s p ons ibi lity and b lat ently

ignored incidents to w h i c h they should have responded.          Such wa s m y concern that

on 18 August    1981 I dictated a m e m o r a n d u m to Acting Superintendent Walter Smith

and Inspector Calvert         on FI S u b -Div isi on r egarding that concern and giving them

precise insfrTftctions as to the briefing of stewards for the future.               I have been

allowed             of a photostat copy of that memorandum,         dated 18.8.81,       under

Po licy File ff2201 instructing those officers to for mal ly brief the stewards as to

their precise terms of reference and duties and their relati onsh ip w i t h the police

officers who wer e detai led to duty inside and outside the grou nd in the immediate

vi cin i t y of the entrance and exit gates.




I have been allowed bjr Chief Inspector Ross of the West Midl ands Investigation

T e a m to have sight of a transcipt       of ev idence given by ex Polic e Superintendent

Douglas L o c k to the Inquiry,      being c onducted by Lord Justice Taylor,       into the

H i l lsb orou gh Disaster.    At one point   in his ev idence Mr L o c k makes refe rence to

succeeding Mr Chap man at FI Sub- Division and attending the Sheffield W edn esda y

F ootball Ground w i t h myself and pr oba b l y Mr Chapman.       He also makes ref erence to

the fact    that thereafter there was a formal agreement           that the police w o u l d assume

m a n y of the duties of the stewards.         I absolutely,    and quite unequivocally,        refute

that   suggestion.     I cannot    say that   I did not visit    the Sheffield W e d n esd ay

F ootball Ground w i t h Superintendent Lock,       for I very prob abl y did on a number of

occasions in connection w i t h per fectly routine negotiations.             However,   it is

ce rtainly not the case that there has ever been any agreement,               oral or in writing,

(formal or informal), w h i c h in any w a y alters the duties of the steward and those

of the police officers in acting as agents of the club.                  The only m a n n e r in

w h i c h police officers have acted as agents of the club is in practising their

authority,    under Regu lat ion 15 of the Ground Regulations,          to eject persons from

the ground.     Regulation 15 was introduced during the era of m y re spon sib ilit y for

policing arrangements at the club.            The rule change and the negoti ati ons leading

up to it had no relevance, whatsoever,           to the relat ion ship b e twe en stewards and

the police in any other respect         .




Having said that      I w oul d also w i s h to state for the record that being aware of the

inadequacies,    the age and often the imc omp eten ce of the stewards,          in the interests

of public safety I, as ground commander,           always felt   it nec ess ary to ensure that

we had a police officer(s) av ailable to a ssume the duties of the stewards should

trouble arise.       In essence,   I suppose one could say that we w e r e acting as a

longstop, but by no mea ns did we ever seek to assume the resp ons ibil iti es of the

stewards,    nor should we do so.

I have been asked to comment           on the q uestion of the radial fences erected on the

Le ppin gs Lane terracing.        I have been given sight of d o c u m e n t a t i o n under Policy

File P22/02/08      (referred to earlier).          I have been asked to comment on the

quest ion of the gates at the rear of the radial fences b e ne ath the West                    Stand on

the Leppings Lane terrace.            During the negotiations prior to the er ecti on of those

fences,    the Fire Brigade were anxious to satisfy themselves that                   the gates wh en

closed and locked w o u l d be "under the contr ol of the Police".                  Clearly,   the

purpose behind their concern being to ensure an adequacy of safety p recautions in

the public interest       in an emergency.         In interpreting that requirement,           I

understood that      to me an that police officers should be in possess ion of keys and

in a position to open those gates to ensure adequate evacuat ion in an emergency.

To the best      of my kn owledge that t ook place on eac h and every m a t c h for w h i c h I

was u ltim ate ly responsible and to the best of m y knowledge it has bee n so ever

since I left      'F' Division.       I never understood that requirement            to m e a n that a

police officer would be p hys ical ly and personall y stationed by each of those gates

before,    during and after,      any particular match.         We have certainly,       as police

officers,    bee n in a position to open those gates in plenty of time for an

em ergency evacuation,       for example,    if a terrorist bomb alert was to arise.

However, whe re the gates were to be locked b a c k in the fully open position,                      as at

a semi-final tie where all the supporters at the L eppings Lane End followed the

same     team,   police   'control'   of the gates was a redundant         concept.




 I wo uld comment     that on Page 46 of the transcript           of evidence given by Mr L o c k to

Lord Justice T aylor's Inquiry,         he m akes reference to a m e e ting that he had at the

Sheffield W e d n esd ay Football Ground w i t h Superintendent Chapman,             myself anci|

that suggesti on and accept     that later in his evidence Mr L o c k agreed that was a

mistake and that he intended to refer to Mr England.            However,   for the record it

should be noted that during m y tenure of office the Sec retary of the Sheffield

We dne sday Football Club was Eric England and he was the only Secretary w h o m I ever

not in post at the time and I have had no dealings w i t h him.

              I am       the       owner       of    premises         trading    as                                       s'i t u a t ed

              at                                            .✓Sheffield.




              The       premises          themselves            are    situated                   the     Sheffield           Wednesday

              Football             Stadium.           The      Leppings    Lane       turnstiles     are       approximately

                          away          from    the      shop.




              On    Saturday             15th       April      1989    I was    working    in m y    shop       with     Mr




              At    approximately                   12.30pm      that    day    seven    male    persons        entered        my    shop.

              They       were       rowdy       but      not    in a n   aggressive       manner.         It    became        obvious

              to    me    that          they    had      been    drinking       alcohol,    six     were       not   drunk      but      one

              appeared             to    foe u n d e r    the    influence.

                                                                                                                                                          S36



             During       the     time      that       the       youths          were       in    or       about          my    shop       two       of    them




             Whilst       the     two      were                                                           I was       having          a    general

             conversation             with       all       of    them.           I asked          them          if    they          had    tickets             for

             the    match,        two      of    them        said         they       had,    the          others          said       they    h a d n ’t . ^

             I said       to    them       "fancy          coming          all       this    way          without          tickets".                 They

             said     " D o n ’t w o r r y       about,         us    w e ’ ll       get    in".           The       youths          did    not       say       how

             they     were      going       to       get     into         the    match       and          I did       not       ask       them.

             Believing          that       trouble          would          be    caused          at       the    ground             X decided             to

             dose      my      premises          at    1pm       and       go    home.




             All    I. c a n    say     about         the       youths          in    relation             to    their          description                is

             that     they      were       all       white,          in    their       early          20s       and       spoke       with       a

             Liverpool          accent.              Even       though          two    of    the          youths          stated          that       they       had

             tickets        for      the    match          I never          saw       them.




             Although          the    seven          youths          were       under       the       influence                of   alcohol           the

             only    thing        I saw         in    their          possession             was       a    can       of    cola       which          they

             were    all       drinking          out       of    in       turns.

segregating            Home         and     Away         fans.         It 'is my          belief         that       they        regard

that     as     the          primary means                by w h i c h        they       avoid      crowd trouble.

Stewards         are        trained         in that             procedure.               Their      task       is       simply        to m a n

discuss         with        him     the     emergency             procedures              which would               be    involved              in

stopping         the        game     and       evacuating              the     Ground.            To m y       knowledge              t h ese

ca n no t remember however any instance where there was express

discussion and agreement with the Police that they would be

responsible for manning those perimeter gates               instead of Club

Stewards - it is just something that has always happened in practice

during my time with the Club. . Overall            I would say that there           is very

close   liaison oetweeh the .Club and the Police and this is

■particularly so having        regard to the -relationship- between Doug Lock,

and the South Yorkshire Police,,

On a match day the Police will have their own briefing sessions with

the Ground?    both a general      briefing for all Officers and specific

briefings for Officers        posted to different sections ar o u n d and within

the Ground?    as far as I am aware.          They also .brief our Stewards on a

sectional basis        ie.    the Officer dealing with policing            inthe West

Stand area will      brief    the Stewards who are working in.that -area and

likewise    the Officer      in charge of the Spion Hop will          b r ief the

Stewards   in that area and so on.          The Stewards will also be briefed

by Douglas Lock on match day? and since he has direct supervision of

those Stewards     1 leave that aspect to him although 1 am generally'

aware of what goes -on -and have         in fact from time to time atlsndea

at the request of the Police,         The earlier       briefing was on HOth March

(200300) and involved Brian Mole together with David Dowse and

Maxwell Holmes of       Leeds United, and Graham       Hover of Coventry City.               i.

For the 198S S e m i - F i n a l , which took place on 9th April      (090400)     of

that year,    the early briefing meeting       took place in the boardroom at

Hillsborough on 23rd March        (230300? with Hr, Moie present and with

Peter Robinson of Liverpool and Paul White of Nottingham Forest,                        It        .

involved discussion with the Police and the participating Clubs as to

which areas of the .Qro'und their supporters would ne attending,                 how

tickets would be colour-coded and marked for each s£t of supporters,

where    car parking arrangements and parking of coaches would De

organised and matters of that nature.

For the 1989 S e m i - F i n a l - t h e r e was no such prior meeting with- the

Police      '. understood they felt one was not necessary as the gams

involved effectively an action replay of the year before,                 when   me

same teams were involved and once again Nottingham forest                 fans were

to be a c c o m m o d a t e d in the1 Bpion Kop arid the South Stand areas;, and

the Liverpool     fans would be accommodated          in the Nortn ana Wes c b l a n d ■

My own re co 11 e ct ion of the Semi Final which took place in 1988. is that

everything went extremely s m o o t h l y , and indeed 1 have        ret erred   to tne

file    I kept for that fixture and the records           indicate that we had

comparatively     little -by way of damage to the Ground afterwards.                There

were    in fact a couple of letters from supporters afterwards.

appreciation, for tlie way in which the game- had been organised arid

stewardea.        My own recollection is tiiat there were no problems in-

getting the fans into the Ground on time for kick-off that'year,                                   but

my memory is that         the Liverpool         fans    in particular arrived earlier

chat year -than they did f or the '1989 Semi Final.--

.The draw for the T „A . Cup Semr-f i n a i .took place on Monday,                         20th March

(HQ0300).        I was telephoned by Steve C l a r k , the Competition Secretary

of the Football Association,               that morning before the meeting of the

F .A . ' took   place,,   He asked me to contact the Police to confirm that '

if H i 11sbo rough were awarded the Semi-Pi nal between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest,          that they would once again insist upon the

Nottingham Forest fans being accommodated in the Spi.on Kop and South

Stand a r e a s .   As a result        I spoke on the telephone to Chief

Super intenaent Brian Mole who               confirmed that that would be the case.

I was aware of the Police reason for so insisting - it enabled them

to nave more effective            control over the flow of fans into the Ground,

since the Nottingham Forest fans,                  in journeying from Nottingham,

would normally arrive at the Penistone Road end of the Ground via

junction 34 of the Ml, and Liverpool                    fans would exit the Motorway so

as to arrive at the Leppings Lane ena v i a                    the A61. from Junction 3& of

the Motorway*

1 telephoned Steven Clark and confirmed what Chief Superintendent Brian

Mole had told me „          The Semi-Final at n i l isborougn was                   later confirmed

by tele phone and this enaoled us to put arrangements                           m     hand tor the

1 recall        that a couple of days before the Semi-Final                     the P .A.

telephoned to enquire -whether the Club would be providing a Doctor

positioned near the playing area,,                  Arrangements had already been made

by I                  for -the Club Doctor,            Doctor Bill Purcell,            to attend

and he had been allocated a               ticket which would seat him in the South

Stana in the pen behind the               dug - o u t »    I t e l ieve- the F ,A, were

concerned about the presence of a Club Doctor because of a recent

event which had received some              publicity?        where a Bristol Rovers;

player had been injured on the field and had swallowed his tongue and

needed emergency treatment,,

1   now   turn to events that occurred on the day of the match,'

13th April?      1989   (150489),        1 arrived at the Ground between 7(0700)                     and

7„8 0 a m ( 0 7 3 0 ) Immediately after arriving              I    walked right   round 'the

Ground, as is my normal         practice before a g a m e , to check for myself

the general     state of t h i n g s .     I would he looking to see?             for e xample,

that the Ground was generally.tidy.

I had a number of tasks to perform                 that morning such as finalising

T ,V .• arrangements',    including means of access for television crews,

dealing with the        issue of passes?         co-ordinating arrangements for a

luncheon to be held involving Management                     of the Z competing Clubs?

and F„A„ Officials and local             dignitaries.             The guests started to

a r rive s ho r 1 1y after   11 am (1100) ,

I recall?     during the course           of that morning?           that   1 met with Douglas

Lock      in the reception area in the South Stand offices ana talked to

him about the arrangements for the day,,                     It is normal     for Doug Lock

to seek me out on a match day to enquire whether                        I had any special

instructions for him and the Stewards,                     On this occasion I needed to

talk to him about arrangements for opening the turnstiles.                           That

arose because originally we had agreed with the Police that the

turnstiles would open at         IE noon        (1200)?     and a potential       problem had

then arisen as a result of some               information that was           inserted     m    tna

Liverpool P r o g r a m m e » for Liverpool        fans,    tne previous week.

That arose because Sheffield Wednesday played Liverpool at Anfield on

Saturday?     8th Apr i I (080400)? and the Sheffield Police had arranged
                                                                                                       PAGE

 tor an article to be inserted; in the Liverpool Programme giving -

 instructions to Liverpool            fans as to their journey from Liverpool                                  to

 ;::!net f ie i.ci for the i- ,A « Cup Semi—s-'inal , arrangements for car parking

 etc. , and it was stated in that document                    that       "Gates will            be opened

 from 11am <110U >, with pre-match entertainment and refreshments

avaiiabie     inside .the G r o u n d ” .     Subsequently the Police                     realised that

 tnis information clashed with the arrangements that they had made

with m e , for the turnstiles to be opened at 12 (1200) and 1 was asked

oy   inspector Sewell,         as I recal1 ? whether we could assist by having

 iurnsti ie -Operators triers to open a few of the turnstiles early if

there was a build-up of spectators outside,                          1 had confirmed there

would be no problem with t h a t , since Stewards and Turnstile Operators

had standing      instructions        to be at the Ground no later than 11am

 (110G)    on the Semi-Final         day.

During trie hours leading up to the start of the game                                   I was busy

dealing with a variety of organisational matters,                                  As is my normal

practice 1 would,           from time to time, walk out of the office and check

the position in the Ground itself,                    Thus,   for example,                on mors than

one occasion I walked down the players'                   tunnel to see how the

spectators were building up, and my principal                            recollection           is that

matters were outside the Ground,                 I remember walking up the private

road that runs alongside             the river from the D i r ec t o r s 8 entrance to

the Leppings Lane entrance.                 The Police had created a sterile area

along     part of that       roadway,   by erecting barriers just beyond Gate C

at Leppings Lane e n d , and a further series of carriers near the

“dog-1 e g ” corner     close to Gate                1 did in fact have to speak to" t h e .

Police there to arrange for some cars to be allowed to park within

■the sterile area,           since visiting dignatori.es from Nottingham Forest

had been allocated parking spaces there.                         As 1 recall there was a

those 2 barriers -- perhaps of                  the order of 8-~':0 Officers at each

barrie r „

The   last occasion when 1 visited the Lappings Lane end oefore

problems built up later was probably shortly after 2 pm '(1400),                                    but I

cannot put anything             like an exact time on i t .             However my

rscolI set ion of the situation at Leppi ngs Lane at that time was that

the 'number of Liverpool               supporters was starting to build up                         there

was a substantial            group of them present but I would not say that the

area was packed solid.                  1 can say that nothing about the scene at

that time struck me as                 unusual or potentially dangerous.

Subsequently 1 was             in and out of the office             (.1 had placed myself- in

Sharon Lane's office that afternoon)                     at intervals ana on more than

one occasion 1 would have walked down the players'                             tunnel    to see what

was happening on the pitch and on the stands .and-.'terraces,. from

inside the Ground.-             It was still          the case that it was noticeable that

Liverpool       fans were slower building up in the North .Stand and the

west Stand areas than the Nottingham Forest f an s ...

I   had agreed with the media and with the television crews in

particular as to how they should position themselves                              prior to

commencement of the match because they wera anxious to film the teams

coming out onto the pitch.                 In particular Brian.Clough,                the

Nottingham Forest Manager,                was very much in the news at that time

because he had been banned from the touch-1ine and I knew that they

were anxious "-to film him and were aware that he had been allocated a

seat in the pen immediately b e h m a                  the dug-out.        As I recall,            I was

out on the pitch when the Liverpool                      team came out, and just after
                                                                                     PAGE

they came onto tne pi tch Doug Lock came up to me and told me that

Gats C had either beer; opened or broken down at the Leppings Lane end

and as I recall he told me that about 300-400 people had entered

through the gate.        I said '1' would go and see what the problem was and

I immediately pushed my way through the photographers                  in the area and

walked up the      playe r s 5 tunns 1 »   At .'that stage the No11 ingham F o rest

team were also on the pitch,          but the photographers were waiting for

the arrival   of Brian Clough,        I believe.

I walked out of the Ground and around through the sterile area to'

Gate C at Leppings L a n e »      1 imagine the match must have kicked off at

about that time but 1 cannot be certain.. Once tne,teams were out on

the pitch the noise from tne huge crowd inside the stadium was such

that   it would     be difficult      to tell from outside whether         the kick off

had taken place and in any event             I   was   concentrating on    the problem

in hand.     In going through the sterile area I             aid,   of course,   pass

the groups of fool officers who were on duty at each set of barriers,

and when I arrived at Gate C tne gate was                partially open,     A mounted

Police Officer was positioned outside the gate and there was a line

of fans walking      in and as I recall he was shouting to the fans

indicating to them that they should not come through in that queue

unless they had a ticket*          The fans who were walking through were

holding up the tickets for him to see that they had one.'                    there

seemed to be a number of fans              around who did not have 'tickets and

could not get access as a result.

As I walked/through the g a t e •I recollect that there was a couple of

Police Officers' stationed just            inside   it and one of o u r .Stewards,

                        to whom I spoke.         Looking at him heseemed       a bit

shaken?    and 1    asked him whether he was all           right and      heanswered in

the affirmative.        I was intent on making my way to the Police Control

Box to find out exact ly what was going on and to .do that                  1 had to
                                                                         page;    i a
                                                                         S55

waiK around the southern co,-' ner of the West Stand and go through a,

gate adjacent to turnstiles    19-22 to get to tne Box.      That gate was

manned by Club Stewards who also man the exit Gats E at that         point,

ana they let me through.

I cl imbed up into the Police Control .box and I recall that Chief

Superintendent David Duckenfield was there with Superintendent

Bernard Murray and I believe 2 other Officers,::      When. 1 looked out of

the window of the Police Control Box 1 noticed for the first time

that they were a large number of Liverpool        supporters on tne pitch

around the Liverpool    goal area,   that other supporters appeared to be

seeking to -.climb over the perimeter fence to gain access to the

pitch/.and some were also    climbing or being pulled up from the back

of the terrace up to the seated area in the West Stand.         I cannot say

whether the gates in the perimeter fence were open at that s t a g e — -

tnere was such a mass of people around that it would not nave been

obvious.     I recall, that I asked what was happening and was told       Chat

people were being crushed in the pens because of pressure from

behind.    No reference was made at any stage to the gate having been

opened, and it was    clearly an urgent situation where     I did not wisn

to interfere -with the Police operations.       They were giving

instructions over their personal      radios to Officers as to.how they

should deal with the situation on the Ground,       and I recall   that Chief

Superintendsnt Duckenfleld was talking to the Police Officer wno had

control    of the Tannoy system tailing him to keep talking to tne. crowa.

As 1 recall    the message that was being   repeated over tne Tannoy -al

that stage was asking    the crowd to keep -calm and remain patient

without giving any reason why •--■ ie without explaining the nature of

the emergency that -.had- arisen.    I recall   that I did ask whetner    tnere

were any fatalities and Hr. Duckenf'ield replied !!I believe so, y e s “ „

The impression I had was that there was-a confused situation,         and I
                                                                                           p a g e ;:
                                                                                           S5S>;

heara the Police        giving    instructions- to deploy m en -at the front of

the perimeter fence and to seek bolt cutters,

I left the Police Control. Room and went back to the D i r e c t o r s 5 area

via the Kitchens of the Riverside .Suite , seeking out F.A,                       Officials/

in particular Graham Kelly,            the Chief .Executive, to advise him of

what was happening*          I met him in the off i ce s ’ area,          as   I recall, near

the Boardroom,       and I told him that what was involved outside was not

a pitch invasion but was a .major             incident and I took him and Glenn

Kirton of the F.A.        back to the Police Control B o x .            W h e n we entered

the Control Box you could see             through the window that there were a

number of people        in obvious distress and r e c e i v i n g :m o u t h to mouth

resuscitation.        In discussions with the Police             it was agreed that the

match could not be re-started but               the Police were anxious not to

announce that fact to the fans aecause they f eared that fans who
                                                         “



might then leave the Ground would impede access to the emergency

services.  Consequently whilst the Police announcer was still talking
                          ■'               ‘                   . ■ -.
to the crowd at regular intervals over tne T a n n o y .' I believe no

formal a n n o u n c e m e n t was made even at trial stage that we had a major

i ncident   on'our    nands.

After a short while         1 left the Police Control Box again with Graham

Kelly and G lenn Kirton,         ana fir. Kelly said that he wanted               to convene

a meeting in the Boardroom with representatives; of all 3 Clubs,                            i-«A,

Officials and the match referee.               Between the 3 of us we gathered the

various people together           its the Boardroom where a meeting took place

and ws discussed the abandonment of the match and agreed that, we

would not formally announce            it was abandoned until the Police

considered that       it was safe to do so,           having regard to their           concern

a o su t acce s s f o r e m er.gency vs h i c 1es .   I recall   t h a t d u r i n g the

meeting Doug Lock entered the room and said he had a message from

B r i a n Clough that    he was putting his players          i n the bath and taking.,

them home,      or words ,to that effect,

Subsequently      I recall that I went back to the Police Control 8 o k and

was there when the announcement was made over the Tannoy that the

match was formally abandoned, - the crowd were informed that there was

a major      incident and they were asked 'to remain patiently                 in their

places until      they were advised by the Police that they could disperse

in an" orderly manner,         without    impeding the emergency -services.              As I

recall      the announcement was effective ana later the supporters did

leave the Ground in an orderly fashion.                                           ,

As to access      to the Ground generally,             for an all   ticket game       I would

expect each turnstile to admit at a rate of about 80Q per hour with- a

area at Leppings Lane on 13th April                   (13Q400) we expected to have

full       capacity   (10,100) and t h e i r - t i c k e t s , w o u l d indicate that they

should gain entrance through turnstiles A---G.                  with 7 turnstiles

operating      1 appreciate that it would take a period of time before all
                                                  .

spectators      could be admitted.         However,       given that the, turnstiIes

were to be opened no later than "12 noon ( 1200) for a kick off at 3 pm

(1500) and given the experience of the previous year where there had

been no difficulty witn spectators getting into the Ground                        (albeit

some will always arrive           late)    1 did not anticipate that there would

be a problem on 15th April            (150400)/         1 would expect that Basil J o n e s

would have put his.more experienced turnstile operators on the

turnstiles at the Kop end and Leppings Lane end,                    for the terraces,

that day.

1 would expect the Stewards manning Gate € (there were some 3 in

number)      to assist    in the orderly dispersal           of spectators once they

had come through the turnstiles,              for they would normally be coming

through at such a rate that it would be possible for Stewards to

direct them in a particular way.               Similarly       the gate in trie dividing

afternoons- and those Stewards would also direct spectators towards

the standing area in pens 3, 6 and 7 in the North West                      corn e r .    I

would not expect our Stewards to be standing on the terraces

themselves because         it is not an easy task to ask a Steward to stand

on the terraces surrounded, fly Away fans for any football match.

Those terraces are normally patrolled by Police with the assistance

of visiting Stewards where appropriate,                    1 know that there were.

Liverpool Stewards         in attendance at this game.            Apart from those who

may have entered via 'the turnstiles,                  a group of them arrived at .the

admission to the Ground as Liverpool Stewards.

in conclusion 1 have been asked to comment on two matters                         in case it

should be felt that they had any bearing on the tragic events of Ibth

         to the number that 'we do employ on a regular oasis?                and m o s s   numbers

         c a n 'be increased for certain matches         if a large crowd is expected,

         I nave read this Statement and it is true and correct to the best of

         my knowledge and belief.

                                    S T A T E M E N T


    I,     GRAHAM     HENRY    MACKRELL,   of '
                                    WILL SAY:-


    My date of birth is


    I am employed as the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football
    Club.     My employment history is as follows


    After completing my O-levels at school I joined Thornton Baker
»   (as     they     were then known), a firm of Accountants,            at        their
    Bournemouth office.            I qualified as an Accountant and became a
    Fellow of the Association of Certified Accountants in 1976.


    In     the interim I left Thornton Baker in about August 1974                     to
    join     the     staff    of   Bournemouth Football    Club,      and      I     was
    appointed Club Secretary shortly after that.


    At     that time Bournemouth were a Third Division Club but                     they
    were     in fact relegated to the Fourth Division the year                     after
    I     joined     them.     The facilities at the Club      were      therefore
    fairly     basic, but when the Safety of Sports Grounds Act                     1975
    ("the     Act")     became      law I was aware of it and of       the         Green
    Guide     that     was    subsequently issued.      The Club   was        not     of
    course     a designated Club within the terms of the Act                  because
    of     its status, but certainly work done at the Club thereafter
    had     regard to the provisions of the Act and the Green                  Guide.
    One     of the Directors of Bournemouth F.C. at that time was                     an
    Architect,        and he took a lead part in organising           alterations
    and     improvements to the Ground, but I worked closely with him
    throughout that t i m e .
                                                       - z -




In     November            1981          following an, ^approach               from          Luton        Town
Football Club I resigned my position at Bournemouth and became
Secretary        to Luton Town F.C.                     I remained with that Club until
I     resigned in November 1986,                        and virtually immediately there­
after     joined Sheffield Wednesday                         Football Club in my                    present
position.                                                          .'


When I joined Luton Town Football.Club they were in the Second
Division       and        won the Second Division championship that                                       year
becoming       promoted to the First Division.                                At that time            First
and     Second Division Clubs were designated under the Act,                                               and
as     Secretary               to     the Club Ihad responsibility                           for     safety
matters.             As        such        I     was       the    Club's representative                     at
meetings        of        the Committee set up by the Local Authority                                      for
the     purpose           of     licensing           the     Ground       under         the        Act.      I
reported        on        safety         matters        to       the    Board,         and     the        Club
retained        a firm of Consulting Architects who dealt                                      with        all
matters        relating             to    safety requirements.                  I      dealt        with     a
particular           Partner in that Architectural Practice, one Philip
Dodd     who     would           inspect' the Ground and the facilities                               on     a
regular         basis            to      ensure        that • we        did        comply      with        the
requirements of the Act and the Green Guide.


When     I joined Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as                                         Secretary
the     Club     had already an estabished system for                                   dealing           with
safety     matters,             licensing by the Local Authority and require­
ments     of     the           Act and the Gre'en Guide generally.                             The        Club
retained         Consulting               Engineers,             Eastwood          &   Partners,           who
performed        the            same      role       for     Sheffield         Wednesday            as     the
Architects retained by Luton Town F.C. had performed for them.
Similarly        in        my       position as Secretary I am .in                           effect        the
Chief     Executive              of the Club, and I have overall                             control        of
safety matters reporting to the Board on that as well as other
topics connected with the running of the Club.


Since      my        appointment               the      composition           of       the    Board         of
Directors        has not changed.                      The Chairman is Mr. Herbert McGee
%
    and     there        are 6 other Board members.          They are in           effect        a
    non-executive              Board who take nonetheless a close interest                      in
    the     affairs        of     the     Club and   who   regularly           attend     Board
    meetings.           There      are regular Board meetings,            perhaps 9          each
    year.         The Club is, to my knowledge, a little unusual in that
    the     members        of the Board betweeifcXtiem hold only 4.8% of                       the
    issued        share        capital and there is in fact no                single    entity
    who     has        anything     approaching      control of         the     Club.        Each
    member        of     the     Board,    in his non-executive          capacity,        takes
    special        responsibility           for a particular activity.             Thus        for
    example        Matthew Sheppard,          the Vice-Chairman,         is an Accountant
    and     responsible           for      financial matters.       Keith        Addy     is     a
    builder/developer              with     responsibility    for        the     Ground        and
    premises.


    Insofar as the full time management *of the Club is concerned I
    am assisted by 6 departmental heads as follows

    Douglas           Lock has special responsibility for security matters.
    I     have        seen and read a copy of the Statement he has                      already
    prepared,          and it accurately describes his position and role as
    Chief        of     Security.         He has primary responsibility                for     the
    recruitment,          training and supervision of Stewards and Gatemen.
    I     am     aware     of     the fact that       Stewards     are        given     written




<
instructions                 at     the commencement of each Season,                as     to     the
duties        they are required to perform etc.                       Furthermore,          at the
start        of     each Season, Mr. Lock organises training                             evenings.
There were 2 successive training evenings for the commencement
of      the         1988/89             Season,     on   one    of   which      there            were
instructions,                demonstrations etc.'laid.on for Stewards,                      and on
the     second           evening for Gatemen, Car Park Attendants and                             the
like.         I     was present throughout the first of those                             evenings
and for part of the second evening but I had to leave early on
the second evening to attend a Board meeting.                                At the training
evening video films dealing with emergency procedures etc. and
produced          by one of the country's Police Forces were shown,                                as
well as demonstrations given on First Aid techniques, mouth to
mouth -resuscitation                      etc.    and talks also by the Fire               Brigade
personnel as well as Mr. Lock himself.


I     have        always considered Douglas Lock to be a very able                                and
reliable Security Officer, perhaps uniquely experienced in the
sense        that he was previously a Superintendent with the                                   South
Yorkshire Police Force in which capacity he had a good deal of
responsibility                    for    supervising      the    policing      of        Sheffield
Wednesday           Football             Ground at Hillsborough.         He is a man              who
has written and had published articles on policing of football
matches           and        because       of his background he has also                  been     of
assistance to me in liaison with the South Yorkshire Police.


                        is        the    Club     Caretaker     in   charge     of         general
maintenance.                  He has been with the Club some 40 years and                          is
in     fact        approaching retirement.                 Essentially he carries                 out
running           repairs of a maintenance nature,                   and will often carry
out     small           works           requested    by Mr.     Eastwood.       He        has     the
assistance of 2 men who work in his team,
         and there are also about 10 cleaners who are employed on
a regular part-time basis


The     Groundsman is                                    and he has a number of                 staff
working with him in keeping the pitch in good condition.
%
    In     my     capacity             as Secretary to the Club                  I     have        executive
    responsibility effectively for the overall organisation of the
    Club's        activities.                 As     such I am the         person           with        overall
    responsibility,                 for      safety matters,, and liaise directly                          with
    the     Working              Party       set     up    under=the       aegis          of      the     Local
    Authority.               This         Working Party consists             of        representatives
    from         the        Police          and     Fire    Brigade,       and        also        from        the
    Surveyors/Structural                           Engineers'        Department                   and         the
    Environmental                  Health         Department      of the     City           of     Sheffield
    (formerly               the' South Yorkshire Metropolitan County                               Council).
    These        meetings             are held on an annual basis for the                           purposes
    of     licensing the Club under the Safety of Sports Grounds                                              Act
    1975,       ”and the Safety Committee make a thorough inspection                                           of
    the     Ground           each year for that purpose.                    In the             past,      those
    inspections                  would       normally       take .place          in        about        August.
    However           in     1988 we brought the inspection forward to May                                     of
    that        year,       and the same is happening this year,                            the intention
    being        to        give       the     Club plenty of time            to           carry     out       any
    necessary              wor k      that        might    be required as             a     condition          of
    issuing the License.


    Prior -to              the        annual meeting of the Safety Committee                             it    is
    usually           the        practice          for Eastwood & Partners to                     carry       out
    their own thorough inspection of the Ground to make sure that,
    so     far        as we can, it is in first class condition before                                        the
    Safety Committee inspect.                           In fact as part of that process the
    Consulting              Engineer will issue a Certificate confirming their
    inspection,                 and      they are also required to carry out                            certain
    tests - for example tests on crush barriers.


    If     Eastwood              & Partners,            upon carrying out their                  inspection,
    came        across           any matters upon which they needed a decision                                  I
    would        be the person with whom they would liaise at the                                         Club.
    Similarly               if        there       was     any   member      of        the       Club     staff,
    including              Mr.        Lock, who thought that there was                          some     matter
    relating               to      the      structural          integrity        of       the     Ground       or

                                                                                                           .. / ..
otherwise          relating to the Green Guide or the Act, they                            would
draw        it to my attention and I wo u l d then deal with Eastwood &
Partners.          Thus, for example, Douglas Lock would not                         normally
have        direct contact with the Consulting Engineers -                           anything
he had-to do or say would be done through me.


I am also primarily responsible for- -liaison with the Police in
relation           to the policing of matches at the Ground.                      The       Club
signs        an     annual          Contract with the        South     Yorkshire        Police
Authority           for the provision of Police Officers on match days.
There         is     an    annual          meeting      called   by    the    Police        with
representatives                of     all 5 Yorkshire Clubs who come under                   the
jurisdiction              of        the     South    Yorkshire      Police.      They            are
Sheffield            Wednesday,             Sheffield     United,     Doncaster       Rovers,
Rotherham           and Barnsley F.C.               At that meeting there is usually
a     general        discussion relating to policing and football,                               and
it     is     invariably my practice to attend with a member of                                  the
Board        of Directors.            In addition to that annual meeting                   there
is     regular        liaison             with the Police throughout           the    Season.
Thus,        for example, when the Fixture List is published in June
of     each        year I send a copy to the Police for                      their    comment
prior        to     commencement             of     the Season and they        may    have         a
particular           request          in     relation to matches        on     the    Fixture
List.         I     recall,          for     example,    that last Season        we        had     a
fixture           against Newcastle United on Boxing Day and the Police
asked        us to bring the kick-off forward to 12 noon and we                                  did
so.         I do not recall them giving a particular reason for that
-     the position is that if the Police, with their knowledge of
policing           matters,         ask me to co-operate with them in                 relation
to     particular matches I will always attempt to do so in every
way     possible and I would not,                     for example,    require a detailed
explanation           from          them     as in that instance,       as to        why     they
wished a particular change to be made.


For     matches played at Hillsborough the Police Liaison Officer
(Inspector           Sewell)          would normally contact me a week or                    more
before        the match was to take place.                   For a normal match where

                                                                                            .. / ..
an     unusual        crowd was not expected the contact would be                             made
probably        to     find       out such details as             which     turnstiles           we
intended        to     open, what time they were to be opened                          etc.      so
that     he     could        be    sure    that      our    plans     for       manning         the
turnstiles            and     stewarding       the     Ground       complied        with        his
knowledge        of arrival times for visiting fans etc.                            If it were
a particularly large match where we--would expect,                              for example,
a     large number of Away supporters, as well as Home                              supporters
then     the degree of liaison will naturally increase as a                                   good
deal     of more detailed planning has' to go into the policing of
it     from the point of view of providing extra Police                                Officers
and,     from        the Club's point of view, deployment of                         Stewards.
Inspector            Sewell       is     assisted     in    his     liaison         duties       by
Detective        Constable Charlesworth stationed at Hammerton                                Road
Police        Station,       and I would have a degree of contact with him
as     well.         For example it would be-my normal practice,                           prior
to     a Home fixture, to speak to the Secretary of the                                visiting
Club     for     information             as to the number of Away               fans     to      be
expected        having regard to their ticket sales etc. and I would
pass that information on to the Police to assist them in their
planning.


The      average       gate       this year at Hillsborough has                  been      about
20,000        fans.         For    the     normal     or    average        attendance           the
Contract        with        the Police will lay down the number of                       Police
Officers             who are deployed.               That    number       can       however be
increased        at         the discretion        .of the Police Authority                 if     a.
particularly heavy gate is expected,                        for example, or indeed if
the      Away fans are expected to be unruly.                       Where the number is
being increased'it is not the practice of the Police Authority
to     discuss and agree with me beforehand how many extra Police
they      will involve.            I have never required them to agree extra
numbers          with me or queried a Police invoice                      for manning - the
invoice         is in fact related to the size of the gate as set                               out
in     the Contract with them,               save for some matches such as                      the
F .a .    Cup     semi-final, which would be charged on                         a    different
basis.          The Accounts for the Club indicate that for the                               year
%   ended     May 1988 the Club paid a total of £97,731 to the                                          South
    Yorkshire Police for policing the...Ground. ,0f that sum a total
    of     £39,800 related to the policing costs of the 1988 F.A. Cup
    semi-final between Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C.


    I- am aware of the fact that the South Yorkshire Police draw up
                                                       **” -2    *   •

    an     operational           plan for each Hoirfe^game at                  .Hillsborough               and
    they do not normally provide a copy of that plan to a Club.                                               I
    have however in the past asked for one if only out of interest
    to      see     how        they       organise    the_ deployment                 of        Police      in
    controlling crowds, and when I have asked I have been provided
    with a copy.


    In     my dealings with the Police over the years,                                in relation to
    Hillsborough              policing,        I   would say that they have                       made      it
    plain     that        they regarded the function of Stewards                                 from      the
    Club     as     directing people to their seats, and                              manning           gates
    around        the Ground.             They very much regarded the Police                            being
    in     charge of crowd control generally, both inside and outside
    the     Ground,           and indeed the written instructions to                              Stewards
    which     we        issue every year take these factors                           into        account.
    They     were       drafted by Douglas Lock and approved by me, and                                       I
    have     no     doubt           he    drafted them having                regard        to     his      own
    experience           as     a        Superintendent         with     the     South           Yorkshire
    Police.


    I     would say that in my experience in the context of                                       policing
    within        the     Ground, the Police are most concerned                                 about      the
    question        of segregating Home and Away fans.                           It is my             belief
    that they regard that as the primary means by which they avoid
    crowd trouble.


    There     are        contingency plans agreed with the Police, to                                      deal
    with     an emergency situation at the Ground. Arrangements                                            with
    the     Police        basically           cover evacuation of the Ground                          in     an
    emergency           and     all        Stewards are trained in               that           procedure.
    Their     task        is        simply     to man and open the               gates           to     allow

                                                                         -                              . . / ..
%   people        out of the Ground in an orderly fashion.                                 Before        each
    game     the       Police meet with the'Referee and discuss                               with        him
    the    emergency procedures which would be involved in                                      stopping
    the    game        and evacuating the Ground.                     To my knowledge                 these
    emergency          procedures           have been tested during match days,                            to
    ensure        that     they work p r o p e r l y ,...f.ndtthe test procedure                         will
    involve        the    broadcast of a messagS- over the tannoy,                               by       the
    Police        Operator,       which will act as a signal to the                             Stewards
    and    the      Police Officers to take their positions for                                  dealing
    with     an emergency situation.                         In that context I would explain
    that     the        tannoy system is one where the Police Control                                    Room
    has     the        ability     to           operate it as well          as       the      Club       Disc
    Jockey/Announcer,              but the Police have an override facility so
    that     they can cut across any announcements being made by                                          the
    Club     Disc        Jockey        in        order to      broadcast         a    message.            The
    procedure           for emergencies involves the Police control of                                    the
    tannov         system        and        I       cannot     envisage     a        situation        where
    emergency          messages would be broadcast by Club staff.                                If, for
    example,           I became aware of an emergency which necessitated                                     a
    tannoy        announcement,                 I   would report that to the                  Police        so
    that     they        could make the announcement,                     rather than           make        it
    myself.


    As to contingency plans for coping with spectators coming into
    the Ground, this is done on specific occasions when the Police
    would     be        aware that visiting supporters who may have an                                     all
    ticket        arrangement, might have a contingent arriving                                  without
    tickets        or,     for     example, where they might                         expect     a        large
    number        of     spectators to arrive who would be seeking                                  to     pay
    cash     at        the turnstiles.                They would then           have       arrangements
    with     us for turnstiles to be opened to admit such                                     spectators
    or,     in     the     case        of an all ticket match,                   they       would         have
    arrangements           made        to remove spectators without tickets                               from
    the     vicinity of the Ground.                      That,    for example,          happened very
    recently with 'the Middlesbrough game where the space available
    for     Middlesbrough . supporters was severely restricted due                                          to
    the     closure        of the west stand area following the                               events        on
%
    15th       April.             The Police anticipated there might be a lot                            of
    Middlesbrough                 supporters and had contingency plans in                        place,
    to     my knowledge, to hold spectators arriving without                                    tickets
    at     a     nearby Police sports ground.                       Other than that I am               not
    aware of any other contingency plans- to deal with the question
    of a mass of spectators arriving fp?-'entrance such as happened
    at the semi-final on 15th April.


    I     have        stated that Stewards are instructed to man                           all       exit
    gates        from the Ground, but the exception to that is the gates
    in     the     perimeter fencing which allow access onto the                                 pitch.
    During       the period that I have been with Sheffield Wednesday I
    cannot        remember any instance where those gates were manned by
    Stewards           - it is Police who are normally stationed along                                 the
    perimeter and I believe that the numbers of people standing on
    the        perimeter          would         be     kept as low as      possible        to        avoid
    obstructing the view of spectators behind the fence,                                    I cannot
    remember               however        any        instance     where   there    was          express
    discussion              and        agreement with the Police that they would                         be
    responsible              for manning those perimeter gates instead of Club
    Stewards           -     it is just something .that has always happened                              in
    practice          during           my time with the Club.             Overall I would              say
    that        there        is        very close liaison between the Club                  and        the
    Police        and        this        is     particularly so having            regard        to     the
    relationship between Doug Lock and the South Yorkshire Police.


    On     a     match           day     the Police will           have   their     own     briefing
    sessions           with        the        Ground, both a general briefing               for        all
    Officers               and     specific           briefings     for   Officers        posted         to
    different              sections around and within the Ground,                    as far as             I
    am aware.              They also brief our Stewards on a sectional basis -
    i.e.        the Officer dealing with policing in the west stand area
    will brief the Stewards who are working in that area and like­
    wise        the        Officer in charge of the Spion Kop will                        brief        the
    Stewards           in        that area and so on.              The Stewards will also                be
    briefed           by Douglas Lock on match day,                   and since he has direct
    supervision              of        those     Stewards I leave that            aspect        to     him

                                                                                                     .. / ..

from     time to           time attended briefing sessions.


F.A.     Cup           semi-finals have          been held at Hillsborough in                1987
(Leeds        v. Coventry City);             in 1988 and 1989.           These latter two
games         have        both     involved       Liverpool     F.C.      and    Nottingham
Forest F.C.               In     1987 the match was moved to a Sunday at                      the
request        of the Police because they anticipated there might be
difficulties              with     Leeds     United     supporters.         Chief        Super­
intendent              Brian Mole was in charge of the policing as                       indeed
he     was     for        the 1988 game.          For the 1987 game I do           in        fact_
have     a     copy        of the Police operations mannual which                      is     the
written        instructions issued by the South Yorkshire Police for
policing           the game.       I cannot now remember            exactly            when    I
obtained           a     copy     of that - it may well have been                 after       the
fixture        took        place and to the best, of my recollection I                        was
given        a copy when I requested it because I was interested                               to
see     how they were organising the match from their end.                                   That
match         took        place     on Sunday,       12th April,     1987        and     a    few
weeks        before            there   was abriefing meeting arranged at                      the
request        of         the Police.        The earlier briefing was              on        20th
March        and        involved Brian Mole together with David Dowse                         and
Maxwell        Holmes of Leeds United,                and Graham Hover of              Coventry
City.        I attended, with my assistant,                  Sharon Lane.


For     the        1988        semi-final, which took place on 9th                 April       of
that     year,            the early        briefing meeting took          place        in     the
Boardroom              at Hillsborough on 23rd March with Mr. Mole present
and     with           Peter     Robinson        of Liverpool      and    Paul     White       of
Nottingham              Forest..       It involved discussion with the                   Police
and     the        participating Clubs as to which areas of the                          Ground
their        supporters           would     be attending,       how tickets        would       be
colour-coded              and marked for each set of supporters, where car
parking            arrangements            and     parking    of    coaches       would        be
organised and matters of that nature.

    For     the 19 89 semi-final there was"~no such prior meeting                          with
    the     Police - I understood they felt one was not necessary                                as
    the     game        involved effectively an action replay of                    the    year
    before,        when     the     same teams were involved         arid      once        again
    Nottingham           Forest     fans were to be^accommodated in the                    Spion
    Kop and the south stand areas,                 and ..the Liverpool fans would be
    accommodated in the north and west stand a r e a s .


    My own recollection of the semi-final which took place in 1988
    is     that everything went extremely smoothly,                 and indeed I have
    referred          to the file I kept for that fixture and the                     records
    indicate          that we had comparatively little by way of damage to
    the     Ground        afterwards.          There    were in   fact    a     couple           of
    letters        from     supporters         afterwards,   including        one     from        a
    Liverpool supporter who expressed his appreciation for the way
    in     which        the game had been organised and stewarded.                    My        own
    recollection           is     that there were no problems in              getting           the
    fans     into        the Ground on time for kick-off that year, but                          my
    memory       is      that     the    Liverpool fans      in   particular          arrived
    earlier that year than they did for the 1989 semi-final.


    The     draw        for the F.A. Cup semi-final took place                 on     Monday,
    20th     March.        I was telephoned by Steve Clark, the Competition
    Secretary of the Football Association, that morning before the
    meeting        of     the F.A. took place.           He asked me to contact • the
    Police       to      confirm        that   if Hillsborough     were       awarded           the
    semi-final           between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, that they
    would        once again insist upon the Nottingham Forest fans being
    accommodated           in     the Spion Kop and south stand areas.                     As     a
    result        I spoke on the telephone to Chief Superintendent Brian
    Mole     who confirmed that that would be the case.                       I was        aware
    of     the     Police reason for so insisting - it enabled                       them        to
    have     more        effective control over the flow of fans                    into        the
    Ground,        since the Nottingham Forest fans, in journeying                          from
    Nottingham,           would     normally arrive at the Penistone Road                       end
of     the       Ground via Junction 34 of the Ml, and Liverpool                             fans
would          exit the Motorway so as to arrive at the Leppings                            Lane
end via the A61 from Junction 36 of the Motorway.


I. telephoned               Steve      Clark and confirmed       what      Chief       Super­
intendent             Brian         Mole   had   told^Tme’.     The      semi-final            at
Hillsborough was later confirmed b y "telephone and this enabled
us     to       put arrangements in hand for the printing                    of       tickets
etc.


I    recall that a couple of days before the semi-final the F.A.
telephoned            to      enquire whether the Club would be providing                       a
Doctor          positioned           near the playing area.           Arrangements            had
already          been made by                        for the Club Doctor,              Doctor
Bill        Purcell,          to attend and he had been allocated                 a    ticket
which          would seat him in the south stand in the pen behind the
dug-out.            I believe the F.A. were concerned about the presence
of     a Club Doctor because of a recent event which had received
some publicity, where a Bristol Rovers player had been injured
on the field and had swallowed his tongue and needed emergency
tre a t m e n t .


I    now        turn to events that occurred on the day of the                         match,
15th        April,          1989.      I arrived at the Ground           between        7     and
7.30 a.m.             Immediately after arriving I walked right round the
Ground,             as is my normal practice before a game, to check                          for
myself          the     general state of things.              I would be     looking           to
see, for example, that the Ground was generally tidy.


I    had        a     number        of tasks to perform that          morning         such     as
finalising             T.V.     arrangements,      including means of access                  for
television              crews,         dealing    with   the     issue      of        passes,
co-ordinating arrangements for a luncheon to be held involving
Management             of     the 2 competing Clubs,          and F.A. Officials              and
local dignitaries.                   The guests started to arrive shortly after
II   3. • m•
I     recall, during the course of-that morning, that I met                                      with
Douglas         Lock in the reception area in the south stand offices
and     talked to him about the arrangements for the day.                                   It     is
normal          for Doug Lock to seek me out on a match day to enquire
whether          I    had     any     special instructions           for       him     and        the
Stewards.             On     this     occasion I needed to talk to                   him        about
arranaements               for opening the t u r n s t i l e s .    That arose             because
originally            we had agreed with the- Police that the                        turnstiles
would open at 12 noon,                 and a potential problem had then arisen
as     a    result           of some information that was                inserted          in     the
Liverpool            Programme,           for Liverpool fans, the previous                      week.
That       arose           because Sheffield Wednesday played                   Liverpool          at
Anfield          on Saturday,         8th April,       and the Sheffield Police                   had
arranged             for     an    article     to be inserted        in        the     Liverpool
Programme             giving       instructions to Liverpool fans as to                         their
journey              from     Liverpool       to    Sheffield      for     the       F.A.         Cup
semi-final,                arrangements       for     car parking etc., and                it     was
stated          in     that       document     that "Gates will           be     opened          from
II a.m.,              with        pre-match        entertainment     and         refreshments
available              inside       the     Ground."      Subsequently           the        Police
realised             that this information clashed with the                      arrangements
that they had made with me,                    for the turnstiles to be opened at
12     and I was asked by Inspector Sewell,                        as I recall,            whether
we     could assist by having Turnstile Operators there to open a
few        of    the        turnstiles       early if there        was     a     build-up          of
spectators outside.                  I had confirmed there would be no problem
with that,            since Stewards and Turnstile Operators had standing
instructions                to be at the Ground no later than 11 a.m. on the

semi-final day.


During          the        hours leading up to the start of the game                         I     was

busy        dealing with a variety of organisational matters.                                    As is
my normal practice I would,                    from time to time, walk out of the
office and check the position in the Ground itself.                                    Thus,       for
example,             on more than one occasion I walked down the players
tunnel          to     see        how the spectators were building up,                      and     my
principal             recollection is that Nottingham Forest were filling
%   up     their        end        of    the Ground at a    quite     early     stage,          but
    Liverpool           supporters were not.'           '-As- I recall that in fact             was
    remarked        on by several members of staff* during the course                             of
    that     day.        From time to time I would also walk outside to see
    how     matters           were outside the Ground. I remember                  walking        up
    the     private           road        that   runs alongside the     river        from       the
    Directors'          entrance to the Leppings~Lane entrance.                    The Police
    had     created           a     sterile area along part of that           roadway,            by
    erecting barriers just beyond Gate C at Leppings Lane end, and
    a     further series of barriers near_the "dog-leg" corner                           close
    to Gate E.           I did in fact have to speak to the Police there to
    arrange for some cars to be allowed to park within the sterile
    area,        since        visiting dignatories from Nottingham                  Forest had
    been    .allocated parking spaces there.                   As I recall there was a
    group     of foot officers of the South Yorkshire Police                          manning
    each     of        those        2 barriers - perhaps of the order of 8                  -     10
    Officers at each barrier.


    The     last occasion when I visited the Leppings Lane end before
    problems built up later was probably shortly after 2 p.m., but
    I     cannot        put anything like an exact time on it.                     However        my
    recollection              of        the situation at Leppings Lane at that                  time
    was     that        the number of Liverpool supporters was starting                           to
    build up - there was a substantial group of them present but I
    would        not say that the area was packed solid.                  I can say that
    nothing        about the scene at that time struck me as unusual                              or
    potentially dangerous.


    Subsequently              I     was     in and out of the office    (Ihad        placed
    myself        in                         |'s office that afternoon)       at     intervals
    and     on     more than one occasion I would have walked                        down        the
    players'           tunnel to see what was happening on the pitch and on
    the     stands        and           terraces,   from inside the    Ground.         It        was
    still        the     case           that it was noticeable that      Liverpool              fans
    were     slower building up in the north stand and the west stand
    areas than the Nottingham Forest fans.
I     had agreed with the media and with the television crews                                      in
particular              as to how they should''position themselves prior to
commencement                of     the match because they were anxious to                        film
the     teams           coming          out onto the pitch.       In   particular             Brian
Clough,           the       Nottingham Forest Manager, was very much in                           the
news     at        that          time     because    he A s d ; been . banned          from       the
touch-line              and I knew that they were anxious to film him                             and
were     aware              that     he     had been allocated a seat           in     the        pen
immediately                 behind        the dug-out.      As I recall,    I was        out       on
the     pitch           when the Liverpool team came out,                 and     just        after
they     came onto the pitch Doug Lock came up to me and told                                      me
that     Gate           C     had either been opened or broken                  down     at       the
Leppinas           Lane end and as I recall he told me that about 300
400     people              had entered through the gate.              I said I would              go
and     see what the problem was and I immediately pushed my                                      way
through           the        photographers          in    the_ area and    walked        up       the
players'           tunnel.              At that stage the Nottingham             Forest          team
were     also           on the pitch, but the photographers                     were     waiting
for the arrival of Brian Clough,                          I believe.


I walked out of the Ground and around through the sterile area
to     Gate        C at Leppings Lane.                   I imagine the match         must        have
kicked        off at about that time but I cannot be certain.                                    Once
the     teams were out on the pitch the noise from the huge crowd
inside the stadium was such that it would be difficult to tell
from      outside whether the kick off had taken place and in                                      any
event         I     was concentrating on the problem in hand.                          In        going
through           the sterile area I did, of course, pass the groups of
foot      officers               who were on duty at each set of barriers,                         and
when      I       arrived           at Gate C the gate was          partially          open.         A
mounted           Police           Officer was positioned outside the                  gate        and
there         was       a line of fans walking in and as I recall                           he     was
    shouting        to the fans indicating to them that they should                                not
come through in that queue unless they had a ticket.                                    The fans
who      were walking through were holding up the tickets for                                      him
    to see that they had one.                    There seemed to be a number of fans
around          who did not have tickets and could not get access as a
result.


As     I    walked through the gate I recollect that there                              were              a
couple          of Police Officers stationed just inside it and one of
our        Stewards,                                  tj^ipwhom I spoke.         Looking             at
him he seemed a bit shaken, and I asked him whether he was all
right        and        he answered in the affirmative.                 I was     intent                 on
making          my     way to the Police Control             Box to find out          exactly
what       was         going    on and to do that I          had to walk        around           the
southern             corner     of    the    west stand      and go      through        a    gate
adjacent             to turnstiles      19 - 22 to get to the Box.               That        gate
was        manned        by Club Stewards who also man the exit Gate E                                   at
that point,             and they let me through.


I     climbed           up into the         Police Control Box and I recall                  that
Chief            Superintendent              David     Duckenfield       was there           with
Superintendent                 Bernard Murray and I believe 2 other Officers.
When        I     looked out of the window of the Police Control Box                                      I
noticed           for     the first time that they were a large number                                   of
Liverpool              supporters      on the pitch around the Liverpool                         goal
area,           that     other supporters appeared to be seeking to                         climb
over the perimeter fence to gain access to the pitch, and some
were        also        climbing or         being pulled up from the back               of           the
terrace up to the seated area in the west stand.                                I cannot say
whether           the     gates in the perimeter fence were open                      at         that
stage           - there was such a mass.of people around that it                            would
not        have        been     obvious.       I recall that        I    asked     what              was
happening              and was told that people were being crushed in                                the
pens        because of pressure from behind.                     No reference was. made
at     any        stage        to    the gate having been opened,               and     it           was
clearly           an urgent situation where I did not wish to interfere
with        the        Police operations.            They were     giving       instructions
over        their personal radios to Officers as to how they                                should
deal with the situation on the Ground,                       and I recall that Chief
Superintendent                 Duckenfield was talking to the Police                    Officer
who        had       control        of the Tannoy system telling            him       to         keep

                                                                                             *   *   i   • •
talking           to the crowd.                As I recall the message that was being
repeated over the Tannoy at that stage was asking the crowd to
keep    calm and remain patient without giving any reason why                                              -
i.e.    without explaining the nature of the emergency that                                              had
arisen.            I        recall       that        I did ask whether           there    were           any
fatalities              and       Mr. Duckenfield replied "I .believe so,                           yes".
The    impression I had was that there was a confused situation,
and     I     heard the Police giving instructions to deploy men                                          at
the front of the perimeter fence and to seek bolt cutters.


I left the Police Control Room and went back to the Dire c t o r s '
area        via        the       kitchens of the Riverside Suite,                    seeking             out
F.A. Officials,                     in         particular      Graham    Kelly,          the        Chief
Executive,              to advise him of what was happening.                         I met him in
the     offices'             area, as I recall near the Boardroom,                        and I told
him          that            what        was     involved      outside      was     not        a    pitch
invasion           but          was a major incident and I took him                       and       Glenn
Kirton        of        the F.A. back to the Police Control Box.                               When       we
entered           the Control Box you could see through the window that
there        were           a     number        of    people in       obvious       distress              and
receiving              mouth to mouth resuscitation.                     In discussions                  with
the     Police              it     was     agreed       that ' the     match       could           not     be
re-started              but       the Police were anxious not to announce                                that
fact        to the fans because they feared that fans who might then
leave         the           Ground        would       impede access         to     the     emergency
services.               Consequently whilst the Police announcer was still
talking           to the crowd at regular intervals over the Tannoy.                                        I
believe           no        formal announcement was made even at                         that        stage
that we had a major.incident on our hands.


After        a short while I left the Police Control Box again                                           with
Graham        Kelly              and     Glenn Kirton,         and Mr. Kelly said              that        he
wanted            to            convene         a    meeting     in   the        Boardroom               with
representatives                    of all 3 Clubs, F.A. Officials and the                            match
 referee.              Between the 3 of us we gathered the various                                  people
 together              in       the Boardroom where a meeting took place and                               we
 discussed              the       abandonment          of the match and agreed                 that        we
would     not formally announce it was abandoned until the Police
considered        that it was safe to do'~so, having regard to                          their
concern        about     access for emergency vehicles.                  I recall        that
during        the meeting Doug Lock entered the room and said he had
a message from Brian Clough that he was putting his players in
the bath and taking them home, or -wards to that effect.


Subsequently           I recall that I went back to the Police                        Control
Box     and    was      there when the announcement was made                    over      the
Tannoy        that the match was formally abandoned, the crowd                           were
informed        that there was a major incident and they were                           asked
to remain patiently in their places until they were advised by
the     Police        that     they could disperse in an             orderly          manner,
without        impeding        the    emergency services.          As I     recall        the
announcement           was effective and later the supporters did leave
the Ground in an orderly fashion.


As     to access to the Ground generally,                  for an all ticket             game
I     would expect each turnstile to a’dmit at a rate of about 800
per     hour     with        a good operator on it.          I am aware         that      for
spectators        for        the     standing area at Leppings Lane               on     15th
April     we     expected to have full capacity                  (10,100)       and     their
tickets        would indicate that they should gain entrance through
turnstiles        A     - G.       With 7 turnstiles operating I                appreciate
that     it     would        take a period of time before             all       spectators
could     be admitted.             However given that the turnstiles were to
be      opened no later than 12 nopn for a kick-off at 3 p.m. and
given     the - experience                of the previous year where            there     had
been     no     difficulty with spectators getting into                     the        Ground
(albeit        some     will always arrive late)            I did     not       anticipate
that     there would be a problem on 15th April.                      I would          expect
that                               would      have   put   his    more      experienced
turnstile        operators           on     the turnstiles at the         Kop     end     and
Leppings Lane end,             for the terraces, that day.


I     would expect the Stewards manning Gate C (there were some 3
in     number)        to assist in the orderly dispersal of                     spectators

                                                                                        • •/   9   •
    once     they        had     come through the turnstiles,             for     they         would
    normally        be      coming U n u u y U at such a rate that it                would           bp
    possible         for       Stewards     to direct them in a           particular            way.
    Similarly         the       gate in the dividing w^ll at the rear                     of        the
    west     stand         which       divides the area behind turnstiles A                     -      G
    from     the     area covered by turnstiles 1 1 - 1 6                 w o u l d be     manned
    by      Stewards,           even     though    it     was     open   throughout             that
    afternoon,            and    those Stewards would also               direct      spectators
    towards         the     standing       area in pens 5, 6 and 7 in                the       north
    west      corner.           I would not expect our Stewards to be                    standing
    on      the terraces themselves because it is not an easy task                                    to
    ask      a .Steward to stand on the terraces                     surrounded          by     Away
♦   .fans    for     any        football match.          Those terraces        are       normally
    patrolled by Police with the assistance of visiting                                  Stewards
     where     appropriate.             I know that there were Liverpool Stewards
     in     attendance           at this game.       Apart from those who                may    have
     entered        via        the turnstiles, a group of them arrived                     at       the
     Club's     offices on 15th April and I authorised their admission
     to the Ground as Liverpool Stewards.


     In     conclusion I have been asked to comment on two matters                                     in
     case it should be felt that they had any bearing on the tragic
     events         of 15th April - they relate to the provision of                             first

     aid equipment and loudhailers for Stewards.


     In      1988     the       Local Authority          Environmental         Health      Officer
     inspected            wi t h specific reference to this item and wanted the
     Club      to provide such equipment as was considered necessary by
     the St. John's Ambulance Brigade.                          I spoke to Peter Wells, the
      Duty     Officer of the St. John's Ambulance,                      Sheffield area,              and
      he provided me with an extract from a booklet listing what was
      required.            I     gave     that    to I                   who    organised              the
      purchase        of        the     equipment.         I am     not aware     whether              the
      Environmental              Health Officer came back to ch eck that they had

      been purchased.

cover.      They          will have details ol-Cbur Fixture List                 for        the
Season     and        a       degree      of local knowledge as     to     the     likely
attendances.                  If there is any variation in that Fixture                 List
they     are     notified           and     they are also   notified       of     special
occasions such as the holding of an F.A. Cup semi-final at the
Ground.         They          were sent a letter prioirto the match on                  15th
April     this year and asked to provide adequate cover and                             they

confirmed they would do so.


Prior to the incident the Club provided no loudhailers for the
use     of Stewards but I was aware that the Police had them                                for
their     own        use.        The Tannoy system was in my view the way                    to
deal     with        any        announcements that needed to be made              to        the
crowd     and        the        system     is such   that   announcements         can        be
directed        to        particular sections of the Ground including                       out
 into the Leppings Lane area to people outside the turnstiles.


 The     number of safety stewards we employ is not a factor which
 is     raised       for discussion at Safety Committee meetings in                          my
 experience          of        attending such meetings.         I believe        that        the
 Club     would stand comparison with virtually any other Club                                in
 the     country in relation to the number that we do employ on                               ^a
 regular        basis, and those numbers can be increased for certain
 matches        if        a     large crowd is expected, this        being        done        by
 agreement between Doug Lock and the senior stewards.


 I     have read this Statement and it is true and correct to                                the

 best of my knowledge and belief.

               At about 9.'00am', ('0900)' we set off to Sheffield in a Budget Hire Ford'

       We went to the Pheasant                      Inn,        Station Lane, Ought i br id g e , and had a

       meal and a drink,,                We had about- four drinks each and left the pub at

       about 2 . 0 0 pm' C"140G)„                We walked a short way down Station Lane to a

       bus stop.          A bus came more or less immediately and we all travelled

       by bus to just before Leppings Lane end.                                We ar r i v e dr .aV^.t he ground at

       about 2, 15p!u._( 1415) arid walked into L'ep p i ng s :Lane a|d long, by the

       wall to the turnstiles.                          I could see a crowd of. abo/lit a thousand or

       more around the turnstile a r e a . ' There was no system of queueing, and

       there were no stewards outside and only two policemen on horseback

       and one on foot standing near the turnstiles.                                    The two policemen on

       horse were by the blue perimeter                             railings near to the back of the :

       crowd.      E v e r y b o d y was         pushing to get to the two sets of turnstiles.

                          had left us at the turnstile area as he had a seat ticket

       and the five of us with standing tickets eventually made                                    it through ,

       the turnstiles,            the smaller set directly opposite the tunnel                          into the

       standing areas.             I went to the toilet and when we came out, we all

       went   into'.-the ..tunnel because th at s'the^fftLy way                          I know we could get

       into the standi ng areaXj. n the West Eitand.   People were going down the

                                         gats           of some sort which appeared to be just left

       of the tunnel            looking back,,                  We stepped down the terracing heading,

       for the right             hand side              of the penned area.       I would say      that the

       terracing was             near full              and we had to squeeze in between           people to

       get to where we wanted to stand.                              It was at this point that we became

       partially separated from my uncle Mai calm.                               We ended up standing

       about.arms         length from the front fencing about halfway between the

       gate onto the pitch and the fence separating us from the penned area
 to our right.     I saw that Hal colrn had ended up in the bottom' right

 hand corner of the "penned area,           I was not aware of the        presence of a

 side gate between the penned areas 'and am unable to say if it was

 opened at any tirfie,’       '

    had been standing there a couple of minutes when I realised we:

 couldn't move our feet but the pressure was causing the                  crowd to sway
   • . ■ .' '     ■      ■'    . ■
 from the waist up and because of this I put first one arm and then

 the other onto the front caging to steady myself..                The swaying got

 less and less until        no-one   could move from the chest down.          There was

 great   pressure from behind causing me and presumably everyone else to

be squeezed against         the people    in front.       At this point   1 was     aware

 that Keith and Nicola were          in front of me and I saw that Arthur was

 in front but just to my left.            I could see that his chin had dropped

 to his chest and his eyes had closed.              I shouted to see if he was all

 right but he d i d n ’t respond,        I still   had my arms at shoulder height

 so I slapped his cheek and shouted again but he d i d n ’t respond,                           I

asked my brother Keith if he was okay and I could see his mouth

moving but no sound and it was obvious he was having difficulty

 breathing,    Nicola was crying and her eyes bloodshot and- face: was

■ flushed.

 I was also aware of three young           lads who were unconscious beside me

with their heads slumped to each other,               I .also, had- a man grabbing my

 face from behind and screaming about a heart attack,

 I was aware that the f r^nt gate '"'had been opened                wa^^Jjeirig cl-Ofed

 by two poM-.ceffieiv. who wer-e who were     putti'-ng^t ^ h e shoulders' t'o^t^to'

 keep it s h u t . . The Police behind the goal and the Stewards were

 shouting for everybody to get hack ^and~~5oine .people were              climbing onto

 us to get on (the railings at the fro^it,            A few momejn^s be f o^e :whe n

 people began climbing out I r emepibe r; a policeman with

 knocking peoples hands off the fencing,              Peopl-e carried on climbing
over and the fencing and the police and stewards stood back because                1

think they suddenly realised what was happening.

After some minutes      1 became aware that the pressure had eased from

behind and 1 saw Arthur slump to the ground and I fell., backwards but

my feet were stuck as there were people ''.slumped over my legs and

Keith who •
          ’d gone down as well'.       The crowd dispersed considerably avid

two people      pulled me free as my legs were trapped by the bodies.        I

was eventually walked through the gate and the people sat me on the .

pitch.      When they had pulled me clear we attempted to pull Arthur

clear and released him.         We lifted him with the help of others over

the side railings as there were two many people around the front

gate.,..    1 then sat down and cried and after a few minutes     later I went

out with a lad who had been consoling me and 1 think a policewoman.

'1 hey     helped me onto the pitch and eventually to the side of tne

South Stand.       I sat on a little wall at the area behind the stand.;         I

aware of a policewoman speaking to me asking details when I, saw

Arthur being wheeled past on a trolley.         I pointed out my uncle

Arthur .and she took .me-' into the caravan,     I saw through" the window.•of.

the      caravan and whilst walking to it ,that there were people working

on him, banging his chest and he had a vent and tubs in his mouth. <

The      policewoman .offered a cup of tea after shutting the curtains.

1 was eventually taken to the

                                             'We' eventually all met at

another      centre by Hamrne rton Road station in a house   in Ought ibri-'dge.

We arranged transport home and were        collected, by friends arriving,

1 have read my statement and would like to add tnat when i saw the

gate being opened T saw people start to come through the gate but did

not see it as any kind of stampede or rush.

Ford    transit,       I don *t know the number of which.                 We travelled

through Runcorn,          Stockport and Snake Pass and into Sheffield,                   parking

at OUGH'I I 3RIDGE,        about five minutes drive from the ground.



we arrived in Sheffield between 10.45am                      (1045hrs ) and   11.00am

(‘1"!ijiJnr s > »    We went to the rheas ant             Inn, Station Ln, Ought i Bridge,

and had a meax and a drink.                   We had about four drinks each and .left

the pub at about 2,00pm             (1400hrs),           We walked a short way down

Station Ln to a bus stop.                 A bus came more or less immediately and

we all travelled by bus to just before Lappings Ln End.                           We arrived

at the ground at about 2 . 15pm (1415hrs > and walked into Lappings Ln

and long by the wall to the turnstiles.                        I could see a crowd of

about a thousand or more around the turnstile area.                           There was no

system of queueing,             and there were no stewards outside and only two

policemen on horseback and one on foot standing near the

turnst i1e s .        The two po 1i cemen on ho r se wera a y            the b 1ue perimete r

railings near to the back of the crowd.                        tveryjbody was pusning to

get to the two sets of turnstiles.



                    had left us at the turnstile area as he had a seat ticket

and the five of us with standing tickets eventually made                          it through

the turnstiles,          the smaller set directly opposite the tunnel                   into the

standing areas.            I went to the toilet and when we came out we all

went    into the tunnel          because thats the only way I know we could get

into the standing area in the West Stand.                           People were going down

the tunnel          in dribs and drabs and we went             into the penned area on the

right because thats where we went                      last time.      We got into this

p e n n ed ar e a a b out f iv e mi nut es bef o re the player s came out a n d as           I

got to the end of the tunnel and as 1 did I looked back and saw a

just    left of the tunnel         looking back.         We stepped down the   terracing

h &ading for the righ t han d sids of th e pe n n ad a rea.            I w o u 1d sa y

Inat    (.he terracing was       near •full and we had. to squeeze      in between

people to get to where we wanted to stand.                    It was at this point tha

we became     partially separated from my uncle Malcolm,                We ended up

standing about arms          length from the front fencing about halfway

between the gate onto ths pitch and the fence ssparating us from the

penned area to our right,               I saw that Malcolm had ended up in the

bottom rigt hand corner of the penned area.                    '1 was not aware of the

presence of a side gate between the penned areas and am unable to say

i f it w a s o pe n e d a t a n y t im e .



We had been standing there a couple of minutes when I realised we

couldn’t move our feet but the pressure was                  causing the crowd to sway

from the waist up and because of this I put first one arm and then

the other onto the front            caging to steady myself.         The swaying got

less and less until, no-one            could move from the chest down.          There wa

great    pressure from behind causing me and presumably everyone else to

be squeezed against the people               in front.     At this point   I was aware

that Keith and Nicola were             in front of ms and 1 saw that Arthur was

in front but just to my left.                 i could see that his chin had dropped

to his chest and his eyes had closed.                    I shouted to see if he was

all    right but he d i d n ’t respond.          I still    had rny arms at shoulder

height so I slapped his cheek and shouted again but he d i d n ’t

respond.        I asked my brother Keith if he was okay and I could see

his mouth moving but no sound and it was obvious he was having

difficulty breathing.             Nicola was crying and her eyes bloodshot and




I was a 1so aware of three young              1ads who were uneoncious besiae me
with their heads            slumped to each other.                         I also had a man grabbing

my f a ce fr om fa&h 1 n d a n d sere a m i n g a b ou t a h ea rt a11 a c k .



I was aware that the front gate had been opened but was being closed

it to keep it s h u t .           The Police behind the goal and the

Stewards were           shouting for everybody to get back and some                                    people were

c 1 i!Tibx ng o yito    us Io ge t on the rax 1 1 ngs at the f r o n t .                             A f ew rnOiftsnt s

before when people began climbing out                            I remember a policeman with a

stick knocking peoples Hands off the fencing.                                       People          carried on

climbing over and the fencing and the police and stewards stood back

because     I think they suddenly realised what was happening.

After some minutes             I became aware that the pressure had eased from

behind and 1 saw Arthur slump                          to the ground and I fell backwards                             but

my feet were stuck as there were                             people slumped over my legs and

Keith who *d gone down as well.                          The crowd dispersed considerably and

two people         pulled me free as my legs were trapped by the bodies.                                                I

was eventually walked through the gate and the people sat me on the

pitch.          When they had pulled me clear we attempted to pull Arthur

clear and released him.                    We lifted him with the help of others over


railings as there were two many people around the front                                              gate.        I

then sat down           and cried and after a few minutes                           later I          went out with

a lad who had been consoling me and I think a policewoman.                                                     They

helped me onto the pitch and eventually to the side of the South

Stand.          I sat on a little wall at the area behind the stand.                                              I

aware of a policwoman speaking to me asking details when I saw Arthur

being wheeled past on a trolley.                              I pointed out my uncle Arthur and

she took me into the caravan,,                          I saw through the window of the

caravan and whilst walking to                          it that there            were    people             working

on him,     banging his         chest and              he had a vent            and tube in his mouth.                      The

          I was eventually taken t

                                                          We eventually all met at

          another        centre b y Hammerton Rd station in a house   in O u g h t i B ridge.

          We arranged transport home and were          collected by friends arriving

          home abut 3. OOam        (OSOOhrs) the following morning.



          I have read my statement and would like to add that when 1 saw the

          gate being opened         I saw people start to come through the gate but did

          not see it as any kind of stampede or rush,



          I have since         returned to the ground and would say that we were

          standing somewhere         in front of the crush barrier that was badly

                We opened the pub at about                           11.30am     (1130) and business was quiet,

                At; 12 midday                      (1200) about 3 or 4 Liverpool             supporters j a m e   into tbs'

                pub,        they ordered their drinks and stood by the bar,                              |/alking to m e ,

                they informed, me that they~~wer.a- Liverpool                               supporters and they all had

                Liverpool-accents,                           they were dressed casually not in the Liverpool

                colours although I                           think one was wearing a Liverpool           scarf,

                Whilst they were                           in the pub they were well behaved in good humour and

                could be described' as merry although they were not drunk.
                                                                         : PAGE

They were polite and talked to me on a number of occasions,             in

between serving      customers from the conversation I had with them I

ascertained that they had travelled on the train from Liverpool .to

Sheffield with other Liverpool         supporters and although none of them

had tickets for the setyi final match it was their intention t.o go to

the Hi 11.sborough ground and gain entry' into the stadium.

They even asked me to go to the ground with them and I said that they

would not get in without a ticket,         but although I cannot exactly

remember how they said that they were going to get in they said it

would be easy as they had doqe it before and tlp.era were o.t<u?r

Liverpool    f$ris- who had come down with them, without tickets t^ho were

goijcig to get in the ground as well.

Also in the pu^ at the same time there were a small group of

Nottingham Forest fans but they did not have any conversation with

myself or the, Liverpool fans and these people          left the pub at about

1 .30pm <1330).

At about    1 i/i-Spm (1343)   I was asked by the Liverpool    supporters to

call them a .taxi to take them to the Hillsborough football            stadium,

the first two occasions         I tried to phone for a taxi the line was

engaged.     I eventually got through at about        1.55pm   (1355) and booked

a taxi for them with a company called City.Cars,           I think,   this taxi

eventually arrived- at about 2.30 (1430)          to 2.45 .(1445) and took the
           \     .-“i -'f .., x.. '- ,-... i--    ■■■ ...  ;: -      •
Liverpool supporters to the ground.

During their Sta'/ at the ,pub I am unable to say exactly how much they

consumed in the way of alcoholic drinks,           but they were drinking

steadily all the time they were there.

The group of Liverpool         supporters were aged, in their mid twenties,

well   presented in casual dress.        I had no doubt to'N^l^eve that''■what

they told me about not having tickets was not true.

I left the pub at about 4.30pm         (1630)   that day and made: my way home.

Matilda Street, Sheffield.             On occasions when they are busy at the pub I

will go down and help them out and on Saturday 15th April this year

          was by herself in the pub, so I went down to help her out.

We opened the pub at about 11.30am and business was quiet.

At 12 midday about 3 or 4 Liverpool Supporters came into the pub, they

ordered their drinks and stood by the bar, talking to me, they informed me

that they were Liverpool supporters and they all had Liverpool accents,

they were dressed casually not in the Liverpool colours although I think

one was wearing a Liverpool scarf.

Whilst they were in the pub they were well behaved in good humour and

could be described as merry although they were not drunk.

They were polite and talked to me on a number of occasions, in between

serving customers from the conversation I had with them

I ascertained that they had travelled on the train from Liverpool to

Sheffield with other Liverpool supporters and although none of them had

tickets for the semi final match it was their intention to go to the

Hillsborough ground and gain entry into the stadium.

They even asked me to go to the ground with them and I said that they

would not get in without a ticket, but although I cannot exactly remember

how they said that they were going to get in they said it would be easy as

they had done it before and there were other Liverpool fans who had come

down with them, without tickets who were going to get in the ground as

well.

Also in the pub at the same time there were a small group of Nottingham

Forrest fans but they did not have any conversation with myself or the

Liverpool fans and these people left the pub at about 1.30pm.

At about 1.45pm I was asked by the Liverpool supporters to call them a

taxi to take them to the Hillsborough football stadium, the first two

occasions I tried to phone for a taxi the line was engaged.                               I eventually

got through at about 1.55pm and booked a taxi for them with a company

called City Cars, I think, this taxi eventually arrived at about 2.30 to

2.45 and took the Liverpool supporters to the ground.

During their stay at the pub I am unable to say exactly how much they

consumed in the way of alcoholic drinks, but they were drinking steadily

all the time they were there.

The group of Liverpool supporters were aged in their mid twenties, well

presented in casual dress.                 I had no doubt to believe that what they told

me about not having tickets was not true.

1 left the pub at about 4.30pm that day and made my way home.

               I am a Detective    Inspector    in the South Yorkshire Police       presently

               stationed at Attercliffe Police Station.

               As a consequence of the disaster at the Hillsborough Football Ground

               on Saturday   15 April     1989 (150489)   I was deputed to take charge of

               Police operations at the Medico Legal Centre?             Watery Street,

               Sheffield.    This is the of f i c ial rno r t uary and coroners office for the

               Sheffield area.

               My duties commenced on the evening of the incident and the first task

               related to the receiving and accounting for 94 deceased persons.

               Working with the mortuary staff, my officers,             (one Detective Sergeant

               and six Detective Constables)       began to receive bodies at 10.05pm

               (2 S 0 5 ) that evening.   The deceased arrived in batches of three having

               been transported by ambulance from the temporary mortuary at the
Ground.

On their -arrival,      each body was stripped,     weighed,   measured and ‘given

an individual-,n u m b e r .   On each occasion the body was accompanied by a

police officer who identified it either to myself or to Detective

Constable 638 Weigol-d.        All   clothing and personal     possessions were

documented and detailed in the          ’Other than F o u n d 5 property register.

Throughout the night the bodies were          received at the Medico Legal

Centre and the 94th victim arriving soon after 7am (0700)              the next

morning Sunday 16 April         1989 (160489). The bodies were put in shrouds

and placed in the mortuary duly numbered as stated previously.                 On

the completion of the removal operation and reception at the Medico

Legal Centre,     some 20 bodies      remained unidentified.      In each of these

cases    I received a Polaroid photograph of facial          features of the

deceased.

Throughout the whole of that day Sunday 16 April             1989 <160489) we

were    inundated with friends and relatives of the deceased who

attended at the mortuary to identify or view the victims of the

disaster .

During the course of the day all of the unidentified victims were

identified by persons who attended at the Centre.              The procedure in

each case was for individuals to examine the Polaroid photographs

which were on a display stand and identify the deceased in that way.

Thereafter a formal       identification took place by individuals

physically viewing the body.           In every case the identifications

proved positive and no problems were experienced with the method

adopted.

The ensuing days -involved myself and four other officers dealing with

the friends and relatives attending at the mortuary to view bodies

and/or make enquiries about funeral arrangements.

Post mortem examinations of the 94 victims took place over a two day
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             S‘
                                                                                              32

         period Sunday 16 and Monday 17 April              1989    (16/170489),       A team of

         five     Pathologists    lead by Professor Alan           Usher were responsible for

         carrying out the autopsies.         The    results of those examinations are

         subject of separate       reports from the Pathologists,              but in nearly

         every case the cause of death was found to be ’Traumatic Asphyxia*."

         In addition to the involvement of the four officers who assisted me

         throughout my duties at the mortuary,              I called on uniformed officers

         to assist    in several    duties in the rwrtuary.            These    involved movement

         of the deceased persons into and out of the viewing area.

         There is only one single viewing area in the building and there were

         occasions when people were kept waiting,                 but I was able to placate

         them and t h e r e   were no complaints about this difficulty.

         Throughout that week my officers shared in the grief of the friends

         and relatives of the deceased,           but were    compassionate,         understanding

         and very professional       in their handling of a quite unique situation.

         They were a credit to the South Yorkshire                 Police and a shining

         example to us all.        Those officers were:-

  detailed in the 'Other than Found' property register.                                             Throughout the

  night the bodies were received at the Medico Legal Centre and the 94th

  victim arriving soon after 7am the next morning Sunday 16 April 1989.

  The bodies were put in shrouds and placed in the mortuary duly numbered

  as stated previously.                On the completion of the removal operation and

  reception              at   the   Medico   Legal        Centre,                sane       20    bodies   remained

  unidentified.               In each of these cases I received a Polaroid photograph

  of facial features of the deceased.

  Throughout the whole of that day Sunday 16 April 1989 we were iiundated

  with friends and relatives of the deceased who attended at the mortuary

  to identify or view the victims of the disaster.

  During the course of the day all of the unidentified victims ware

   identified by persons who attended at the Centre.                                             Hie procedure in

  each case vras for individuals to examine the Polaroid photographs which

  were          on   a    display    stand and      identify                 the         deceased    in that   way.

  Thereafter a formal identification took place by individuals physically

  viewing the body.                 In every case the identifications proved positive

   and no problems were experienced with the method adopted.

  The ensuing days involved myself and four other officers dealing with

  the friends and relatives attending at the mortuary to view bodies

   and/or make enquiries about funeral arrangements.

   Post mortem examinations of the 94 victims took place over a two day

   lead by Professor Alan Usher were responsible for carrying out the

   autopsies.             The results of those examinations are subject of separate

  death was found to be 'Traumatic Asphyxia'.

  In addition to the involvement of the four officers who assisted me

  throughout my duties at the mortuary, I called on uniformed officers to

  assist in several duties in the mortuary.                                     These involved movement of

  the deceased persons into and out of the viewing area.

  There is only one single viewing area in the building and there were

  occasions when people were kept waiting, but I was able to placate them

  and there were no complaints about this difficulty.

  Throughout that week my officers shared in the grief of the friends and

  relatives of the deceased, but were compassionate, understanding and

  very professional in their handling of a quite unique situation.                                   They

  were a credit to the South Yorkshire Police and a shining example to vis

  all.           Those officers were

  P.C.

  My duties and those of my officers concluded on Friday 21 April 1989

  when ws each returned to our normal posting.

             I live at the above address alone which is a suburb of Chesterfield

             situated at the southern side of the town.

            At about 2 , 2 0 pm (14-20) o/f S a t u r d a y , 15th Apri^r",1989 (15048V)    I was

            walking along Chajtswortyh Road tow^f,ds Baslmj/                          /

            As I was walking along the road towards The Brampton Post Office I

             noticed a constant flow of traffic which was moving very slowly

             coming from the Baslow area, which is to the west of Chesterfield,

            and travelling towards C h e s ^ r f ^ e 1 d town celitre\x

             I noticed approximately 9 poaches ahnd I presumed th^t t(ney contained

             passengers who we^er<fc.ra.yjJ \ ling to the Football Match being played at

            Hillsborough,          Sheffield,   between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

             I noticed that people on the coaches had red and white scarves and

             banners with "Liverpool" Written thereon.             I noticed these items on
                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                   S51

        several of the coaches.

         I also saw several motor cars with red and white scarves hang ing f r om

        the w i n d o w s »

         I thought it strange that the vehicles should be in Chesterfield at

        all as if the vehicles had travelled from Merseyside then they were

        not taking the direct route to Sheffield.            However,   it may well be

         that the vehicles had not travelled from Merseyside at all.

        The persons on the coaches and in the motor vehicles were not

         behaving unruly and I did not notice anything untoward regarding

         their behaviour.

         I am sure that the vehicles contained Liverpool           supporters and not

         supporters of Nottingham Forest as obviously Nottingham is a city

         near to Chesterfield.

        When 1 noticed the time, 2.20pm          (1420),   I knew that the vehicles

         would have difficulty in reaching Hillsborough in time for the 3.00m

         (1500) kick off.

         To travel      from Brampton to Sheffield City Centre by public transpor

         takes in the region of about 30 to 40 minutes.

                                                                                   IGN 8

              I live at the above address with my mother




              At about     1.30pm     (1330)    on Saturday 15 April        1989 (150489)   I was

              travelling home after having finished work on the above development,

              I was with                         Peter Marjoram, and we travelling along

              Halifax Road, Sheffield in a Nissan Pick-up truck motor vehicle

              belonging to the company.

              Peter was driving the vehicle and ^X was sat alongside him.

              We were travelling along Halifax Road towards the city centre.

              As we approached the junction of Doe Royd Lane, which was on our

              left,   I saw that the pelican c r o s s i n g ,       situated at that junction,        had

              been activated by persons wishing to cross the road.                    The lights
                                                                      PAGE
                                                                      S50

changed to ’red' and Peter     caused the van to stop at the crossing in

order to allow the pedestrians to cross.

At that time our vehicle was     positioned on the nearside of the

carriageway.     Halifax Road is a dual    carriageway road with two lanes

on either side.

I saw two elderly females start to cross the road from our nearside

and as they did so I became aware of a motor vehicle approaching the

crossing from our offside,     it appeared to me that it had been

travelling at high speed,    the driver had not noticed the pelican

crossing and the fact that the lights were at red against him.

Although I did not hear the sound of screeching tyres or harsh

braking the vehicle pulled up suddenly at the crossing and I saw it

dip forwards on its suspension as if the driver was having difficulty

in controlling    it.

The vehicle was dark grey in colour and I believe that it was an

Austin Montego or something similar       in shape to that model.   I did

not ascertain the registration number.

I am sure that the vehicle contained five men, two in the front and

three in the rear.      I saw items of red and white clothing within the

vehicle which I thought to be football sup porters’ shirts or scarves.

As we were inside a van we were fairly well elevated and could see

down into the grey coloured vehicle.

The two pedestrians     crossed the road and I leaned across the cab and

looked down at the grey coloured car through the offside window.

The front passenger was staring up towards us and when we looked back

towards him he seemed to take offence and although I could not hear

him I am sure he said the words     "FUCK OFF", which is fairly easy to

lip read.

This man appeared to be suffering from the effects of alchohol.

I noticed that all the occupants of the vehicle were holding what
                                                                       PAGE
                                                                     : S30

appeared to be cans of beer.     I am sure that the driver was also

holding a can.

The traffic signals changed and the grey vehicle was driven off

quickly towards Hillsborough and out of our sight, we then left the

main road and travelled to the Sicey Hotel      public house,

I cannot be more explicit    in describing the men in the grey car but I

would say that they were aged about S0-30 years and they were all

white.

Peter and myself then travelled to the Sicey Hotel        public house,

Sicey Avenue, Sheffield,    arriving at about 2.00pm     (1400) and I

believe that Peter dropped me off at the pub and he then travelled

back to Oughtifaridge.

I went   into the public house which is about 3 miles from the

Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.

I noticed that there were about 12 Liverpool        football supporters   in

and around the public house.     They were   in high spirits and generally

noisey but they w e r e n ’t causing any trouble.    I realised that they

were Liverpool   supporters by their accents.

1' believe that they left the pub at about 2.30pm (1430).        I would not

say that they appeared drunk.     I didn't speak to any of them and 1

didn't overhear any conversation relating to how they were going to

gain entry to the match,    nor did I see any football tickets.

In relation to the grey coloured motor vehicle I described earlier I

am unable to state whether they were supporters of Liverpool        or

Nottingham Forest as both teams     play in red and while strips.

            Club and for the past four years            I have beej^' a season ticket holder.

            During this time I have attended at all Liverpool home games but not

            to away games other than Cup Matches.

            My nephew, I                        is alySfcT'-a. season ticket holder,

            i^ 12 years r / f a a e a n d a lt e n ds/ the majorxT^y^of_jg4mes witTh^me,

            Prior to~~tfie FA Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough on the 15th April,

            1989 ( 150.48-9) I had obtained tickets for the West Stand for both

            myself and my nephew

            On the 15th April        (150489)   I attended at Hillsborough with
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                           .S49

and by 2pm (1400) we had taken our seats          in the stand,    overlooking

the Leppings Lane Terrace.         Our seats were slightly to the right of

the goal when looking towards the pitch.

My first recollection of something being wrong on the Terrace in

front of me was just        after the game kicked     offand just prior to a

policeman going onto        the pitch to stop the     game.   I saw      a male person

climb over the barrier between the terrace and the pitch and just

flap over as if he was dead.         At this time a number of other       people

were trying to climb        the fence in order to     getonto the pitch.    I was

never aware of people climbing          into the stand. It was obvious      that

the people trying to get out were         in a state of panic and I could see

that all these people were from the same section of the terrace

immediately behind the goal.         A pitch invasion never entered my head

and I could clearly see that people in the terrace were being crushed

by the sheer weight       of numbers.

It was at this time       that I decided to     leave th stand and try and

provide some assistance below.          I knew people were injured and by

this time there appeared to be people on the pitch who were dead.

These people had either been carried over the fence or through a

gate,    I d o n ’t know which.   There appeared to be thousands on the

pitch.     I know that there w a s n ’t but it seemed that way and it

appeared to happen in seconds.

I told my nephew to stay where he was in the stand and I made my way

down the stairway intending to go onto the terrace to provide

assistance.      When 1' reached the bottom of the stairs         near to the

tunnel    beneath the stand,      I could not   go any further because people

were already being carried out of the tunnel to the open area between

the tunnel and the turnstiles.          It was a matter of going to these

people to try and revive them but it soon became obvious that a

number were already dead.         As I went from one to another,      others were
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S49

         being brought out and the numbers were increasing.      There were a

         number of police officers trying to revive     people and supporters were

         also helping.     It seemed a long time before an ambulance arrived

         although 1 could not be specific about time in that situation.          I

         know that I was screaming for someone to get ambulances to us.         There

         were never enough ambulances even when they did arrive and people

         were just being   lined up against the wall of the stand to wait for

         treatment or to be taken to hospital.      It was obvious to me that a

         number of these people were dead when they came from the tunnel.

         On that afternoon I would say that I attempted to revive at     least

         five people by mouth to mouth and cardiac massage.      All these people

         were dead but I had to try,      I do remember one lady in her forties

         wearing a red sweater.      She was still breathing and we managed to get

         her into an ambulance.

         All the time I was tryiung to revive     people I was aware of both

         police officers and supporters trying to save lives all around me.

         Everyone   I saw did a marvelous job.

         I assisted with injured people until about 4.20pm     ("1620) when I

         returned to the stand to collect my nephew and then returned home.

                                                                                IGNED

            I am the Director of my own company,



            At 1.30pm (1330) Saturday,                15th April,         1989 (150489)    I finished wrk

           at the above site and together with

            drove to                                                            to pick up some furnitue

            for a neighbour.             After     collecting this, myself and                       traveled

           along Halifax Road towards an address at Piper Road, Long 1e y , whes

           we were to drop the furniture off.

           At this time we were                 in a.Nissan Pick-up truck belonging to the

            compa ny .

           As we approached the junction of Doe Royd Lane,                            on our left,    I sa<

            that the pelican crossing at that junction has turned to "red" as

            there were people at the crossing waiting to cross.                            I pulled up t
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         S48

the crossing   in the nearside lane? and the two elderly female

pedestrians began to cross from left to right in front of us.

Halifax Road at this point,       the road is a dual    carriageway road with

two lanes on either side.        As the two pedestrians     passed in front of

the van I became aware of a car approaching the crossing from behind

in the offside   lane.    I could see the vehicle clearly in the w :ng

mirror and it was travelling at high speed with the driver apparently

unaware that the lights had changed to red against him.            The yshicle

was within 50 yds of the crossing when it began to brake sudderty.

There was no screaching of tyres but the vehicle dipped consideably

onto the front suspension and came to an abrupt halt at the sid of

my van in the offise     lane.    At one point I was extremely worrie

that it would not be able to stop in time and put out my hand t try

and attract the attention of the two pedestrians shouting to th«n to

stop where they were.

After the vehicle had stopped they managed to cross the carriageway

and I looked down from the cab into the vehicle.            It was a dark eey

coloured family saloon either an Escort or Montego and contained

mates, 2 in the front and three        in the rear.    They all appeared t«be

dressed smartly in casual        clothing with no apparent football    favors

or clothing on them.     However     I did see what appeared to be red

scarves in the vehicle.      All the occupants except for the driver ere

drinking what appeared to be Heineken lager from green Heineken

cans.   The driver was slightly obscurred from my view by the roof)f

the vehicle.

As soon as I looked down the front seat passenger seemed to take

offence and began shouting numerous swear words at me.            I could no

hear what he was saying due to the window being closed but it was

easy to lip read words such as “Fuck off".            I began to wind my wiiow

down to say something to him but the lights           changed to green and ie

vehicle set off at speed pulling away from us quite quickly.                                  I was

very annoyed with the occupants of the vehicle and it was obvious                                 to

me that they had been drinking heavily and displayed an aggressive

attitude towards myself and

I continued our journey,               dropping _________ at the Sicey Hotel Piblic

House, Sicey Avenue, Shiregreen.                        I then   returned to Oughtibriige

whe re I then called into the Pheasant Public House on J aw Bo ne H i 11 .

On   my a r r i v a l   there   I saw n u m e r o u s    people both inside and outsiie of

the pub.        These people were           clearly not regulars at the pub and due

to their accents           I took it that they were Liverpool supporters m

route to the Semi Final at Hi l.lsborfi(ugh. - |                          s S’.3!5pm <1433)    hen I

arrived at the Pheasant public house a'h^ I would estimate that |-»ere

were 25 Li ve r p ^ l ^ s u p p o r t e r s p r e se nt .

I entered the bar af'Hhe pub and saw
                                                                                drinking at,he

                                and                         I joined them and            bougt me
bar,

a pint.        I then became aware of two men behind me who were drinkig

shorts.        From their accents            it was obvious they w e r e Liverpudliar

and I began to talk and joke with them.                              The time was now 2.45pm

<1445) and I said to them something to the effect that they were

leaving late to get to the ground for the 3pm <1500) kick o f f .

One of the two men then said to rne "D o n ’t worry about t h a t , «%Jcno

either a gate will be open or o p e n e d " .                    At thif,    both men laughed-o

each other.             This statement struck me as being very strange:                        I w*

 puzzled as to how they could be so s u r e that they would find.a gal

 or gates open at such                 late time.         Neither men made any mention C a

 ticket o r s h o w e d me a ticket.              I have a t t e n d e d numerous football

 matches at Hillsborough and other grounds and the statement from te

 man made me wonder how he could be so sure that they would find a

 gate open at that late time.                   After my initial thoughts on the maler

 I dismissed it from my mind and continued drinking with my
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S4S

         colleagues.     The two men then left the       at 2i45pm   <        As they

         left they shook the h a n d s o f        and       It was apparent to me
                       ...          ■      1— t— L,... •• )          ;
         that      and       had also been speaking to the two men prior to my

        arrival.

         Following the news reports of the disaster and circumstances o-i it,

         the statement made by the Liverpudlians       in the Pheasant Public House

         the day before came to mind again.        It again struck me as being a

         very strange statement from a supporter attending a match at sith a

         late time.    It became apparent from the news that a gate at the

         ground had been opened to allow late comers       into the ground andl

         conjectured that the statement made by the man and the opening f the

         gate was connected.     It was for this    reason I contacted the Polce

         and reported what this'man had said to me prior to attending th«match.

           Junction of Orchard Street and the main road leading to

            the public house.               1s

                            on a sub-contract basis as and when work of that nature is

            required.

            When I arrived at the public, house I saw the landlord,

                          standing at the entrance and he was obviously vetting

            people before he allowed them access to the premises.
                                                                                        PAGE     2

I was aware that a semi-final football match was being played later

that day at the Hillsborough Stadium and the White Hart public house

is positioned on the main road leading from Sheffield,                         over the

Pennines,      to Manchester and the North-West of the country,                     This

public house      is regularly frequented,       otV   match days,           by football

supporters.                                               N\

I went outsidf the public house and I would estimate that about 80
             \    ..        :    -              \              -
persons were within the bar area, a mixture of Podt^ball Supporters

and local                                                                \

I easily ascertained that the football supporters were from Liverpool

as I could tell by their accents.

These people were behaving in an orderly manner and there was no

trouble.

The premises were very full and I was subsequently joined by my

friend                    We had a couple of drinks and due to the

premises being busy we decide^ tp v|,sit t|ie Pheasant public house

which is situated on Station Road at,Oughtibridge and is a short

distance away from the White Hart            public house.             The reason we chose

that public house      is due to it beTfig Tocated on a quiet side road off

the main highway and we assumed that football supporters may not have

found it.

                 and myself arrived at the Pheasant               public house at about

•1.15pm (1315) and we discovered that these               premises were also being

tfsed'by Liver^rdof' football supporters.           The premises consist of 2

rooiTrs,i   tf^e loung bar which is cornf ortably furnished and the                 public

bar which is used for games etc.             Outside the premises there              is a

terraced/paved area where benches and seats are used by customers

wishing to remain outside.        The terraced area was busy and I quickly

ascertained that a large number of the peop 1& / outside                           j- i rpoo 1

football supporters.                 ~                    j

                                                                                       S47

We entered the premises via the front door and turned right into the

lounge bar which was very busy and contained a large number of people

which included the regular customers and Liverpool                     football

supporters.       The supporters were in the main well behaved although

several were          rather noisey but nothing unpleasant.             I believe that I

overheard the landlord                    say that several of the supporters had

booked a table at the premises for a meal and that this was a regular

occurrence whenever Liverpool were playing at Sheffield.

        and myself were enjoying a drink and we struck up a

conversation with 2 Liverpool             supporters who were standing at the bar

next to us.                 and myself were wearing our working clothes and it

would be obvious that we had been working on a building site as we

were covered in cement dust and other debris.                      They asked us what our

occupations were and it soon became apparent that they were also

employed in the building           industry.    The men are described as followss-

1.' -Male, white about 30-35 years,            medium b u i I d , .5*7 t a l l , light

     brown hair,         collar length.

2.   As a b o v e .

I cannot describe them further other than they both spoke with

Liverpool accents.

One of them stated that he was a joiner and the other being a mason/

pavier.

At abouj/2.00pm          CT4-SG)                                        arrived at the

premises and he joined us in fhe ttmnge bar                            "   ~ - - J >

We continued to talk to the 2 Liverpool               supporters about the building

industry and I believe the conversation related to payments of

craftsmen as it is part of any duty to work our payments for sub­

contractors.

At about 2 .30 pm- (.143 0 ) I asked the men i f ' i t         wa*r -about time they     /

were leaving as it was a'tTmsj^derable distance between Ou>fhtrrtjrl.dge
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 547

          and the football   ground and I would estimate the distance at about

          two and a half miles.

          We told the men that they would have to park their car in the

          vicinity of the Texaco Filling Station,      near to Middlewood H os pi tal ,

          and walk to the ground from there.      One of the men said words to the

          effect that they were confident of getting      into the ground because

          the gate would be open or opened,      I am not sure which word was used.

          (Open or opened)   The 2 men did not appear to me to be potential

          trouble makers and they appeared to be decent people.         I didn't hear

          them say that they had tickets for the match,      nor did I see any

          tickets.

          The manner   in which one    of them said that the gate would be open or

          opened did not imply to      me that they were going to attempt to force

          entry into the ground.

          The S men with whom we had     been speaking left the public house at

          about 2.40pm   (1440) and    at that time the public house was almost

          vacated by all the Liverpool    supporters   leaving only the locals inside

          As far as I can recall there was no trouble at the premises.

              Further to my previous statement I would like to give the following

              additional         information.

              In respect of the pens beneath the West Stand at the Leppings Lane

      iy      end of Hillsborough Football Ground there are small gates directly

      &       beneath the West Stand in the lateral fencing giving direct access

              between the pe ns .                These gates have a common lock, the key to which

              is held in the. Pol i c:e Control Box and prior to each match the

              Inspector       in charge of the West Stand policing was given this key

              before each match to enable him to deploy officers                       into any pen to,
                                                                                       .
              assist with public order or any other emergency.                        Stewards were

              designated by the club to supervise the pens,                        I have no knowledge of

              what     instructions were given to the- stewards by the club.

              All      I ensured was that before the match each Police                     Inspector was
                                                                                                       PAGE

         satisfied that the regular stewards around the. ground were                              in place

         at every home match.                                  '                              .

 Farther to my previous statement I would like to give the following

 additional information.

 In respect of the Pens beneath the West Stand at the Leppings Lane end

 of Hillsborough Football Ground there are small gates directly beneath

 the West Stand in the lateral fencing giving direct access between the

 Pens.                 These gates have a cannon lock, the key to which was held in

 the Police Control Box and prior to each match the Inspector in charge

 of the West Stand policing was given this key before each match to enable

 him to deploy officers into any Pen to assist with public order or any

 other emergency.                                          Stewards were designated to supervise the Pens and

 it is my understanding that Sheffield Wednesday Club also had a key

 to these locks.

 I have been shown a letter dated 2.5.85 relative to a meeting later

 held on 29.7.85 which I attended.                                                                                I have no recollection of this metting

 but I note that at paragraph 2J stewarding of the new gates is mentioned.

             Continuation o f statem ent o f           JOHN RAYMOND FREEMAN

          So far as I am aware this stewarding was implemented and certainly before

          each match I controlled I always ensured that stewards were in place.

           I am self employed,       but untjijL^tar ch 1988 <000388)        I was a Police

        ^ -Officer in South Yorkshire Police.            On my retirement I was

           Superintendent stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station,                 in charge

           of " F 1" Sub Division of this Force,

           I served in "F " Division from 1979 <000079)               but from 1985 <000083)

           until my retirement,       one of my duties was taking charge of football

           matches at Hillsborough Football Ground.                  I regularly attended every

           football match at the Ground,        supervising police operations.            The

           last FA Cup Semi-Final       I attended was,        I believe, Leeds v. Coventry

           in 1987 (000087).     On that occasion I was              in charge of Communications

           and Ground Control.

           The policy in force at that time,          knowing it was going to be a

           capacity crowd, was to allow the pens at the Leppings Lane end - on
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              S46

          that occasion for Leeds fans - to fill up all at the same time, with

          no restrictions on entry.       As the pens began to fill Police Officers

          were instructed to ensure that the fans moved to the front and

          centres of each area,    otherwise large gaps developed and the whole of

          the crowd could not have been accommodated.       It was always found at

          any large capacity game that the centre pen filled first.

          There were many occasions when a small group of visitors were

          expected and they would be accommodated in either the centre pen, or

          the one directly under the Police Control Box, depending on the

          expected size of the visitors contingent.       If the number of visitors

          exceeded expectations then a further pen, adjacent to whichever pens

          were then open, would be opened to accommodate them,      but the unused

          pens were kept closed.       However where a capacity crowd was expected

          all    pens would be opened as a matter of course.

            I am a retired sales director and live at the above address with my

            wife.

            On Saturday 15 April 1989 <150489) I planned to play gpl'f at Concord

            at 1 pm (1300)„   The coUrse is about            from my homte, and my
                     \
            route there''<Lakes me past Hi 1 lsborough T-aotbal 1 Ground.   Knowing that

            the FA Cup Semi Final was being played at the ground on that day I

            set off early,           in case of traffic      congestion in the vicinity,       leaving

            home about          11.45am   (1145).      I drove alone    in my car, and was

            surprised to find very little activity near the ground as I passed.

            My route was -from Mai in Bridge along Dykes Lane down Wynyard Road,

            left towards Leppings Lane traffic lights,                    up Halifax Road —   passing

            along Leppings Lane, and past the ground entrance at that point.                         I
                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                      S45

passed there about       11.50am    (1150) and saw very few football

supporters and traffic was          light.   I saw that the Police had blocked

off the side roads to protect          residents’ parking, and I saw,            1 think,

about 50 policemen in that area.

Having time i n ^ n d     before meet i rig m y S ^ i e n d s , I stopped at the

"Si cey" on Sicey Averitt^ to pass t ime ’Ilnt-iJ) I met them.           I went       into

the pub and ordered a half          pint of lager, and sat down in the bar

loung.

I sat just to the right of the main entrance.               There were

appr o k imately fifteen people       in the pub.    The room has ’b a y s ’ around

its circumference and I sat at the end of one of the                  'bays"   nearest

the entrance,      with my back to the next       'bay’.    Sitting behind me were

three men, who were already there when I arrived.

After a few minutes       I became aware of their conversation.                I cannot

now remember the exact words,          but I gathered first(of all that they

were football supporters,          intending to go to the semi-final at

Hi 1 lsborpugFv>         '•x                                      ~

As I went to sit down I had noticed that these three men were as

follows;-

1.     Hid thirties,    black or dark brown hair,       cut slightly longer than

normal, with a dark moustache.           He was wearing black leather hip

length coat,       dark trousers.

2.     Mid twenties,    light sandy hair,     cut very short,     but not a crew

cut,    clean shaven, wearing red sweater,          crew neck and a pink shirt

collar worn outside,       light grey trousers.

3.     Mid twenties,    hair light brown and cut ear length, wearing a

tweed sports jacket.        I cannot describe this man as well as the

others as he sat farthest away from me.

As I listened to this conversation,           I heard this older man           (no.    1)

talking to the others,         saying that V^ey shoul'^ not worry about not
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             S45

having tickets.  They would meet up with "the others" ot^tside

Leppings Lane entrance.  They would organise as .many people as

possible to cause whatever trouble they could.  If enough trouble was

happened before, and this man seemed confident that this action could

be forced.

The sandy haired man (no. 2) asked how the "others" would know to

meet up at the right time.                  (No.        1) The other man said if they got

there for about S.15pm- (1415) he knew most of the other lads and they
          - -\ - \  -''I  \    ' : \              '   \      ‘'
could quickly be got organised.    He said "We've got to get as close
 '-. \ ' X '  \     '' ■     \    .. ’         '               '
to the turnstiles as possible."    He said when the gate was opened,
              \    i       \   ' ■)     '   '   \   •                          1      i
they would force their way through to "the back of the goal'1.
                               \ " '■
At this point one of the three men noticed I was listening, and they

glared at me           in an unfriendly way.I hurriedly drank                 the remainder

of my drink and left the pub.                       The    time would then be about       12.20pm

( 12 2 0 ).

I was in the           pub for about ten to fifteen minutes.                 I was able to see

these men as           I walked from the bar               to my seat, and as I stood up to

leave.

I know that these men were Liverpool                         supporters because nos. 2 and 3

had Liverpool accents.                No.       1 had an East Midlands/Nottinghamshire

accident.         They spoke of the Leppings Lane end arrangements as though

they were well aware that this was their team's end of the ground.

I did not place too much importance on the conversation I had heard,

and went to play golf.                On my way home in the car I heard on the

radio that there had been an incident at the semi-final, and

thereafter the conversation became more significant to me.

course of the public hearings of the enqui ry^&itrr ent ly being

condiiTted~~by d^&ij;jc^JFay^^r, prompted me to tell thTs^^i^t^e Police.

I must say that I gained the impression that the Police were being

          unfairly blamed for this course of events.

          On the day after the Hillsborough tragedy,    I discussed with a golfing
                                                                 /

                  the Hi 1Isfaorough Stadium where the mat ch was to cs played.                               On our

                  journsv to Niagara we passed several                           public nouses.     inere were

                  large groups gathered around the out slue of these houses arinning
from pint g la ss es .     The closer we got to the ground             Che larger the

groups outside the pujbs.          I saw that the .groups were wearing              red and

white scarves,      h a t s , clothes etc or a combination of garments

snowing    red and whits.,      On our arrival at the Niagara at

approximately '12.30 pm I ordered lunch                For myself and my son.          It

took sorns time for the meal          to be prepared ana it was not until

":.5:::>pns that ws left the Niagara for         the .Hillsborough ground.,          We got

into the »...eppings Lane end of the ground at approximately L «                      pm.

We took up a position on the terracing on the left hand corner

behind the goal,       level witn Ine touch!ine.            in our oaadock there

were' approximately 1130 people, I did observe that                 the paddock to our

right was very crowded and 1 commented to my son that                     it was    lucky

that we came to the paddock we were              in.

The Hop end of the ground was crowflsa with Nottingham Forest

supporters and It       looked to ms from where          I stood that the Hop was

full.     Appro;-; imatl ey five minutes after arriving            in the paddock my

son asked if we could go and look for some match programmes as we

were unable to purchase any outside the ground,                    we ieft the .paddock

and went to a caravan which was situatea beside the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.      Whilst there i observed that the majority of supporters

enter:;, no the ground went straight to the centre entrance to m e

terracing,,     I did not see any stewards ushering people to the two

side    paddocks where     I knew the left side had plenty of room.                  we

went    back to the left hand paddock arm took              up   a position at the

rear wail,     close to the paddock entrance.              1 was able to sit on the

the Liverpool      team who had come out onto the ground in training gear

to loosen up before tne match.              A steady trickle of tans          came into

the paddock up until the teams came out prior to the kick ot t »                          At

this    time ap&rokimateiy 2.50 pm I saw young boys ciimoing up onto

the periifigtsr fencing      in front of ms and       to my right.         My thoughts

at tne ■time were that had i csen on duty at the match I would have

put them back onto the terracing as             they were spoiling the view of

other fans and there was also tne risk of one of them going onto the

ground.      1 then thought no more of this as my attention was then

tasen up by persons        immediate iy i n front of me lifting other, fans up

into the.stand aooye my head.

1 lost count of the number of fans who had been 1 if tea up but 1

began to consider that the stand above my head must tie overcrowded

on top of us,     but    i dismissed this thought as i felt that the

structure would allow for overcrowding.              From the time the teams

came out and tne kick off, the steady trickle became heavier but .not

unusually h e a v y .    I did observe that the majority of fans coming

i nto tne g round to me srneXt of dr ink .         1 cou 1 d hear f r om the i r

sp ee ch t hat 1 1 was hea v i1y si u rred.      1 s pok e t o a   couple of m a 1e

fans wno jostled my son and u            was   clear from their demeanour that

they were drunk.        At the time of the K i c k     off X asked my son if he

could see alright and he informed me that he could.

1 was con'sidering that       if he .said "No'1 I woula have taken him to the

fence as 1 aid feel at that time that there was sufficient                     room to

get down to the front.         The fans    in our paddock were a y          no means

tightly packed.         Tne game started and from then until           i    observed

persons encroaching onto the pitch 1 cannot               recall any otner tans

coming onto our terracing.         1 say this because        1 was standing-- right

at the entrance to our p addock.           At this time I felt that fans had

invaded the pitch for some reason otner tnan tnat whicn finally

unfolded,-     The reason for my thoughts were because              1 couid see that

some of the fans behaviour on the pi ten couid.be described as

nothing   less than disorderly.          Several   fans were fighting with

police and were being        led away.     other fans were waving scarves              in

                                                                                       Si

            the air ana singing to the crowds       :i.n the padaock behind ■the goal,        I

            was   i n no doubt that these fans were heavy with dri rn<.         One tan ran

           the whole     length of the tie lei to the Nottingham Forest end and 1apt

            up ana down gesticulating ana waving his s c a r f      to the crowd.     He

            then ran back to the Leppings Lane end pursued by a police officer.

           One fan got up onto the crossaar of the Liverpool              goal and at one

            stage   I was fearful     that the goal might   col lapse „   He was finally

            pulled down by a police officer.        As time   passed it was     plain to.see

            tnat something other than a pitch invasion was taking             place and it

           was    clear that     it was unlikely that the match would os restarted.           1

            then saw the goal      nets on the Liverpool    goal being pulled down and I

            decided that it was time tnat 1 got my son out of the ground.             1 left

            the ground via the m a m      gate on the Leppings Lane end.,       1 thought i

           was one of the first out of the ground but there appeared to me to

            De hundreds on the road outside.        1 managed   to make my way back to

           Niagara Sports grounds arm remained ■there until 7pm when I got a

            taxi to Sheffield Station to get a train to Manchester.              1 would

            consider that the conduct of the crowd ar.ound me was generally

            good.    At no time did I see fighting taking       place     in the paddocks.

           On my arrival at the ground at 2, 05 pm tne conduct of the fans m

            the centre paddocks behind the goal was good.           The conduct of tne

                      I am a Sergeant in the Royal Ulster Constabulary presently stationed

                      at Greencastle in the County of Antrim.                                         On Saturday 15 April 1989 1

                      caught a Capitol Airlines flight from Belfast Harbour Airport to Leeds/

                      Bradford at 8.50 am arriving at Leeds/Bradford at 9.50 am.                                                                     My 14 year

                      old s o n , a c c o m p a n i e d                                    me on the flight.                             From Leeds/Bradford

                      Airport we caught a local bus to Leeds and then a train from Leeds to

                      Sheffield to watch the F.A. Cup Semi Final footabll match between Liverpool

                      and Nottingham Forest.                         We arrived in Sheffield around 12 noon and

                      immediately got a taxi at the station to take us to the Niagra Sports Club

                      which is a short distance                             from the Hillsborough Stadium where the match

                      was to be played.                     On our journey to Niagra we passed several public

                      houses.           There were large groups gathered around the outside of these

                       houses drinking from pint glasses.                                  The closer we got to the ground

                      the larger the groups outside the pubs.                                          I saw that the                            groups were

                      wearing red and white scarves, hats, clothes etc or a combination of

                       garments showing read and white.                               On our arrival at the Niagra at approx­

                       imately 12.30 pm I ordered lunch for myself and my son.                                                                 It took some

                       time for the meal to be prepared and it was not until 1.55 pm that we

                       left the Niagra for the Hillsborough ground.                                                We got into the Leppings Lane

                       end of the ground at approximately 2.05 pm.                                                We took up a position on

                             the terracing on the left hand corner behind the goal, level with the

                             touchline.                   In our paddock there were approximately 100 people, I did

                              observe that the paddock to our right was very crowded and I commented

                             to my son that it was lucky that we came to the paddock we were in.

                             The Kop end of the ground was crowded with Nottingham Forest supporters

                             and it looked to me from where I stood that the Kop was full.                                             Approx­

                             imately five minutes after arriving in the paddock my son asked if we

                             could go and look for some match programmes as we were unable to purchase

                             any outside the ground.                              We left the paddock and went to a caravan which

                             was situated beside the Leppings Lane turnstiles.                                           Whilst there I observed

                             that the majority of supporters entering the ground went straight to

                             the centre entrance to the terracing.                                     I did not see any stewards ushering

                             people to the two side paddocks where I knew the left side had plenty

                             of room.               We went back to the left hand paddock and took up a position

                             at the rear wall, close to the paddock entrance.                                             I was able to sit

                             on the terracing for about 15 minutes until I stood up to get a glimpse

                             of the Liverpool team who had come out onto the ground in training gear

                             to loosen up before the match.                               A steady trickle of fans came into the

                             paddock up until the teams came out prior to the kick off.                                            At this

                             time approximately 2.50 pm_I saw young boys climbing up onto the perimeter

                             fencing in front of me and to my right.                                     My thoughts at the time were

                            that had I been on duty at the match I would have put them back onto

                            the terracing as they were spoiling the view of other fans and there

                            was also a risk of one of them going onto the ground.                                             I then thought

                            no more of this as my attention was then taken up by persons immediately

                            in front of me lifting other fans up into the stand above my head.

                             I lost count of the number of fans who had been lifted up but I began

                            to consider that the stand above my head must be overcrowded on top

                            of us, but I dismissed this thought as I felt that the structure would
                            allow for overcrowding.                           From the time the teams came out and the kick

   off, the steady trickle became heavier but not unusually heavy.                                                I did

   observe that the majority of fans coming into the ground at this time

   smelt of drink.                          That is; the ones that stood close to me smelt of drink.

   I could hear from their speech that it was heavily slurred.                                                 I spoke

   to a couple of male fans who jostled my son and it was clear from their

   demeanour that they were drunk.                                  At the time of the kick off I asked

   my son if he could see all right and he informed me that he could.

    I was considering that if he said "No" I would have taken him to the

    fence as I did feel at that time that there was sufficient room to get

    down to the front.                          The fans in our paddock were by no means tightly

    packed.               The game started and from then until I observed persons encroaching

    onto the pitch I cannot recall any other fans coming onto our terracing.

     I say this because I was standing right at the entrance to our paddock.

    At this time I felt that fans had invaded the pitch for some reason

     other than that which finally unfolded.                                       The reason for my thoughts

     were because I could see that some of the fans behaviour on the pitch

     could be described as nothing less than disorderly.                                                Several fans were

     fighting with police and were being led away.                                            Other fans were waving

     scarves in the air and singing to the crowds in the paddock behind the

     goal.             I was in no doubt that these fans were heavy with drink.                                     One

     fan ran the whole length of the field to the Nottingham Forest end and

      lept up and down gesticulating and waving his scarf to the crowd.                                                  He

      then ran back to the Leppings Lane end pursued by a police officer.

      One fan got up onto the crossbar of the Liverpool goal and at one stage

      I was fearful that the goal might collapse.                                          He was finally pulled down

      by a police officer.                         As time passed it was plain to see that something

      other than a pitch invasion was taking place .and it was clear that it

      was unlikely that the match would be restarted.                                             I then saw the goal

       nets on the Liverpool g oa l                           being pulled down and I decided that it

       was time that I got my son out of the ground.                                           I left the ground via

                         the crowd around me was generally good.                                           At no time did I see any fighting

                         the conduct of the fans in the centre paddocks behind the goal was good.

                         The conduct of the police outside and inside the ground was excellent.

            I am a Sergeant    in the Royal Ulster Constabulary presently stationed

           at Greencastle      in the County of Antrim.     On Saturday 15 April    1989 I

            caught a Capitol Airlines flight from Belfast Harbour Airport to

            Leeds/Bradford at 8.50 am arriving at Leeds/Bradford at 9.50am.              My

            14 year old son, i                  accompanied me on the flight.         From

            Leeds/Bradford Airport we caught a local bus to Leeds and then a

            train from Leeds to Sheffield to watch the F.A. Cup Final football

            match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.         We arrived in

            Sheffield around 12 noon and immediately got a taxi at the station

            to take us to the Niagara Sports club which is a short distance from

            the Hillsborough Stadium where the match was to be played.            On our

            journey to Niagara we passed several        public houses.   There were

            large groups gathered around the outside of these houses drinking
                                                                       PAGE
                                                                       S1

from pint glasses.        The closer we got to the ground the larger the

groups outside the pubs.        I saw that the groups were wearing red and

white scarves,    hats,    clothes etc or a combination of garments

showing red and white.       On our arrival at the Niagara at

approximately 12.30 pm I ordered lunch for myself and my son.          It

took some time for the meal to be prepared and it was not until

1.55pm that we left the Niagara for the Hillsborough ground.          We got

into the Leppings Lane end of the ground at approximately 2.05 pm.

We took up a position on the terracing on the left hand corner

behind the goal,    level with the touchline.       In our paddock there

were approximately 100 people,       I did observe that the paddock to our

right was very crowded and I commented to my son that         it was lucky

that we came to the paddock we were in.

The Hop end of the ground was crowded with Nottingham Forest

supporters and it looked to me from where I stood that the Kop was

full.   Approximatley five minutes after arriving        in the paddock my

son asked if we could go and look for some match programmes as we

were unable to purchase any outside the ground.         We left the paddock

and went to a caravan which was situated beside the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.     Whilst there I observed that the majority of supporters

entering the ground went straight to the centre entrance to the

terracing.     I did not see any stewards ushering people to the two

side paddocks where I knew the left side had plenty of room.          We

went back to the left hand paddock and took up a position at the

rear wall,    close to the paddock entrance.       I was able to sit on the

terracing for about       15 minutes until   I stood up to get a glimpse of

the Liverpool    team who had come out onto the ground in training gear

to loosen up before the match.        A steady trickle of fans came into

the paddock up until the teams came out prior |o the kick off.             At

this time approximately S.50 pm I saw young boys climbing up onto
the perimeter fencing in front of me and to my right.       My thoughts

at the time were that had 1 been on duty at the match I would have

put them back onto the terracing as they were spoiling the view of

other fans and there was also the risk of one of them going onto the

ground.     I then thought no more of this as my attention was then

taken up by persons immediately in front of me lifting other fans up

into the stand above my head.

I lost count of the number of fans who had been lifted up but I

began to consider that the stand above my head must be overcrowded

on top of us,   but I dismissed this thought as I felt that the

structure would allow for overcrowding.      From the time the teams

came out and the kick off, the steady trickle became heavier but not

unusually heavy.     I did observe that the majority of fans coming

into the ground to me smelt of drink.       I could hear from their

speech that it was heavily slurred.     I spoke to a couple of male

fans who jostled my son and it was clear from their demeanour that

they were drunk.    At the time of the kick off I asked my son if he

could see alright and he informed me that he could.

I was considering that if he said "No" I would have taken him to the

fence as I did feel at that time that there was sufficient room to
                   t

         decided that it was time that I got my son out of the ground.        I left

         the ground via the main gate on the Leppings Lane end.         I thought I

         was one of the first out of the ground but there appeared to me to

         be hundreds on the road outside.         I managed to make my way back to

         Niagara Sports grounds and remained there until 7pm when I got a

         taxi to Sheffield Station to get a train to Manchester,         I would

         consider that the conduct of the crowd around me was generally

         good.     At no time did I see fighting taking     place in the paddocks.

         On my arrival at the ground at 2.05 pm the conduct of the fans in

         the centre paddocks behind the goal was good.         The conduct of the

         police outside and inside the ground was excellent.

               I am a Sergeant    in the R o y a 1 Ulster Constabulary presently stationed

               at Greencastle    in the County of Ant rim.       On Saturday 15 April      1989 I

               caught a Capitol Airlines flight from Belfast Harbour Airport to

               Leeds/Sradford at 8.50 am arriving at Leeds/Bradford at 9.50am.                   My

               14 year old son,                     accompanied me on the flight.              F rom

               Leeds/Bradford Airport we caught a local bus to Leeds and then a

               train from Leeds to Sheffield to watch the F .A. Cup Final              footbal1

               match between Liverpool and Nott i ngham F o r e s t .     We arrived in

               Sheffield around 12 noon and immediately got a taxi at the station

               to take us to the Niagara Sports      club which is || short distance from

               the Hillsborough Stadium where the match was tfibe p l ayed.              On our

               journey to Niagara we passed several          public hafc|ji.es.   There were

               large groups gathered around the outside of th|se houses drinking
                                                                              PAGE    2
                                                                              S1

from pint glasses.       The closer we got to the ground the larger the

groups outside the p u b s .    I saw that the groups were wearing          red and

white scarves,    h a t s , clothes etc or a combination of garments

showing red and w h i t e .   On our arrival at the Niagara at

approximately 12.30 pm I ordered lunch for myself and my son.                 It

took some time for the meal to be prepared and it was not u n t i 1

1 .35pm that we left the Niagara for the Hillsborough ground.               We got

into the Leppings Lane end of the ground at approximately 2,05 pm.

We took up a position on the terracing on the left hand corner

behind the g o a l , level with the t o u c hl i ne .   In our paddock there

were approximately 100 people,         I did observe that the paddock to our

right was very crowded and I commented to my son that              it was   lucky

that we came to the paddock we were in.

The Kop end of the ground was crowded with Nottingham Forest

supporters and it looked to me from where I stood that the Kop was

full.   Approximatley five minutes after arriving             in the paddock my

son asked if we could go and look for some match programmes as we

were unable to purchase any outside the ground.              We left the paddo ck

and went to a caravan w h 1ch was situated beside the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.     Whilst there I observed that the majority of supporters

entering the ground went straight to the cent re entrance to the

terracing.     I did not see any stewards ushering people to the two

side paddocks where I knew the left side had plenty of r o o m .            We

went back to the left hand paddo ck and took up a position at t he

rear wall,    close to the paddo ck ent r an e e.       I was able to sit on the

terracing for about      15 minutes u nt i 1 I stood up to get a glimpse of

the Liverpool    team who had come out onto the ground in training gear

t o loosen up before the mat c h .      A steady trickle of fans came into

the paddock up until the teams came out prior to the kick off.                   At

this time approximately 2.50 pm I saw young boys climbing up onto
the perimeter fencing in front of me and to my right.              My thoughts

at the time were that had I been on duty at the match I would have

put them back onto the terracing as they were spoiling the view of

other fans and there was also the risk of one of them going onto the

ground.           I then thought no more of this as m y attention was then

taken up by persons          immediately in front of me lifting other fans up

into the stand above my h e a d .

I lost count of the number of fans who had been lifted up but I

began to consider that the stand above my head must be over crowded

on top of u s , but I dismissed this thought as I felt that the

structure would allow for o ve r crowding.          From the time the teams

came out and the kick off, the steady trickle became heavier but not

unusually h e a v y .      I did observe that the majority of fans coming

into the ground to me smelt of drink.              I could hear from their

speech that it was heavily slurred.             1 spoke to a couple of male

fans who jostled my son and it was clear from their demeanour that

they were drunk.           At the time of the kick off I asked my son if he

could see alright and he informed me that he could.

I was considering that if he said "No" I would have taken him to the

fence as I did feel at that time that there was sufficient             room to

get down to the front.           The fans   in our paddock were by no means

tightly packed.           The game started and from then u n t i 1 I observed

persons encroaching onto the pitch I cannot recall any other fans

coming onto our terracing.            I say this because I was standing right

at the entrance to our paddo c k .          At this time I felt that fans had

invaded the pitch for some reason other than that which finally

u nf o 1d e d .    The reason for my thoughts were because I could see that

some of the fans behaviour on the pitch could be des c r i bed as

nothi ng less than disorderly.           Several   fans were fighting with

police and were being led a w a y .         Other fans were wavi ng scarves in
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                Si

         the air and singing to the crowds in the paddock behind the goal.             I

         was   rn no doubt that these fans were heavy with drink.      One fan ran

         the whole    length of the field to the Nottingham Forest end and lept

         up and down gesticulating and wavi ng his scarf to the crowd.        He

         then ran back to the Leppings Lane end pursued by a police officer.

         One fan got up onto the crossbar of the Liverpool       goal and at one

         stage I was fearful that the goal might collapse.        He was finally

         pulled down by a police officer.        As time passed it was plain to see

         that something other than a pitch invasion was taking place and it

         was    clear that it was unlikely that the match would be restarted.          I

         then saw the goal nets on the Liverpool       goal being pulled down and I

         decided that it was time that I got my son out of the ground.         I left

         the ground via the main gate on the Leppings Lane end.        I thought I

         was one of the first out of the ground but there appeared to me to

         be hundreds on the road outside.        I managed to make my way back to

         Niagara Sports grounds and remained there until 7pm when I got a

         taxi to Sheffield Station to get a train to Manchester.        I   would

          consider that the    conduct of the crowd around me was generally

         good.      At no time did I see fighting taking place in the paddocks.

         On my arrival at the ground at 2.05 pm the conduct of the fans in

          the centre paddocks behind the goal was good.       The conduct o+ the

          police outside and inside the ground was excellent.
                                                                               SIGNED

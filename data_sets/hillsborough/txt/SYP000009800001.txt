                 I live at the above address with my boyfriend                                                            and have

                 3.i v e d h ere         for ab o u t 18 m o n t h s .

                 I was at home               last year when            the same        semi-final       match between

                L i v erpool           and N o t t i n g h a m Forest      was     held.

                My house           is a terraced house with a large                         bay window which affords              a

9*4*4.7          good view onto Leppings Ln,                          and down the         road towards      the    entrance      to

                Hillsborough,                Leppings Ln        end,      altho u g h    from     inside   the    house    I cannot

                 see       the    front      gates.

                Last        year at        the sem i      final m atch         I/cannot         bring   to mind any       incidents

                 of    particular            drunkness      or disorder            I remember       people walking         in a

                steady           continuous        number     to the       ground.         1 saw    people walking         into the

                ground from about                  1 pm   (1300)      onwards.

                On most match days                  if at home          I go out the            front   door to    clear    up,

because      there       is    a    chip    shop    on      the    next     corner       and    a    lot       of    people

often      throw     their         papers    down      in    the    streets        ouibide.              in.is      i ~j

We were       all     seated        in the     front        room and        for    some       of the       time          I went

Just      before      this      crowd of s u pporters               came     it w ould         be about             2.40pm

drunk.     He was     s t aggering        in and out      of the      road and a double               decker

bus     going     slowly behind him           passed by him and he seemed to walk                           into

the     front     edge of the       bus and was         pushed across         the      pavement.        I then

saw this youth         stagger       back and go across             the    road,       I remember       this

incident was         clearly before           the   large      crowd of youths           came    down the

lane „

1 d i d n ’t wi t ness any real            dr unkness     i n this      large    g r oup af

supporters,          I wa i t e d about       ten minutes        before     I went       out    the    front       to

clear     up the     chip    papers       thinking      that    these     supporters w ould            be

in the ground by now,.

W hen    I went    outside     the    front       I looked firstly dowfo to the Leppings                           Ln

Hillsborough        ground, entrance,             I was   amazed there? were a huge                   number

of supporters waiting               to g et      into   the    ground / n d     there were        that many

that     they were s t retched            back   to and       intoWis      main L e p pings Ln.             This

caused     the    traffic     to be obstructed ana a lot                   of vehicles were

stationary,         I nave     never w i t n e s s e d    before a crowd of this                 size

waiting     to get     into the       ground.

My a t t e n t i o n was    drawn    in the      opposite      d i r e c t i o n and    I turned a/ o u n d

and saw     coming     down the       lane about another             two    hundred supporters

coming     towards me .        These       s u p p o r !ers wer e being      f o 1 lowed by yg r oups          of

po 1 i ternan „    1 walked away           from this      group towards my side                entrance        a

couple     of doors away,            I looked down again             towards       the ground entrance,

There     were about a group of forty                   policemen /standing             near    to the      tyre

s i"io p e n t ra n c e t h e y ape pared     to be looking        yowards       the huge        crowd that

were     still    p o s 11 1oned outs ide        the ground,

The     group of youths        that were         behind m§/ now         passed me making              there way

to the ground,

I stayed outside and                         was with me         I watc h e d   the      crowd trying          to

get     into the ground.            You    could see      a lot of      people         swaying and

pushing     in the     crowd this          seemed to      go on for a few minutes,                    I think
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                3884

  there ware a couple                 of supporters             on the     bridge   I d o n ’t know        if they

  were    trying        to      jump down to get                to the ground.

  The    next    think          I remember           is a lad aged about 20 years walking                       away

  from    the     crowd         towards       us,,      He was wearing       a tee shirt         red    in colour

  he had blonde              short    ha i r 1 relieve            clean shaven, had a fuliish                   face

  and was       of average            buiId.          1 saw him go to the butchers he was

  looking at us and he said                      "There are        people     dead down t h e r e ” , can           I

  use a phone,,              The   people      from the         butchers     let him use the            phone.

  After    this about a group of six Liverpool                             supporters          came    towards      us

  and    looked at us angr i l y and said                       " X hope y o u 1’re fucking           satisfied”         I

  was    very f rightened but                stayed where          1 was    hoping       that and watch i n g

  that    they want           past my h o m e ,

  Then    it became apparent                 to me       that    something       had happened.          A lot of

  people were making                 their way from the                crowd towards       us,    they a p p e a r e d

  to be    in shock and moving                   around      in a daze.          A lot of them were asking

r if they c o u 1d use the p h o n e „                   I let a c o u p 1e of them            in and     1et

  them have       the     use of my          phone.        They    said they were          father and

  daughter       but they d i d n ’t say anything about what                            they saw.         The   father

  said    "It was       un b e l i e v a b l e . "    but d i d n ’t     elaborate.        They stayed about

  half an hour          the daughter            was     very distress        and they even t u a l l y          left,

  the    father    saying          it would          be best     to get    her    out    in the fresh air

  walking about.              I let about another                 four    people    use    the    p h o n e , but

  after    this    1 just          closed the          door and stayed           in the    house,       there were

  j u s t I o o m any    p e o p 3.e o u t s i d e .

  Some    time    later       I can't       remember        how    long a couple          of ma r k e d    police

  cars    parked outside my house                      there was also an unmarked vehicle                       which

  1 think might          have      been a detective               vehicle.

  Ihere were about             five     policeman about             near    their       cars   trying     to    clear

  the    road to enable a mbulances                     to get     through.        There were a lot

 of supporters walking about a lot of them a p p e a r e d                                in a daze       seeming
                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                    3884

             to walk around aimless.                    I saw one y outh jumj/'on the            police       car    I

             c a n ’t give a description*                  He jumped severysl       times      on the    police          car,

             but    I moved away             from the window at this/point            fearing      someone might

             see me and have a go at my house window.

             Some       time    later     I went    to get    a paper    it would     be about 4. 3 0 p m           (1630)

             to bpm        (1700).        1 went    to the newsagents         in Leppi n g s    Ln and purchased

             a paper.           On the way       back     to my house    I saw a group of about                six

             youths        coming      towards     me down Leppings Ln,          they were Liverpool

             supporters,,              I heard one of them say          '‘W e ’ll get a fire       engine          that

             will       upset    t h e m ” I c o u l d n ’t describe    any of these youths.              When       I

             heard       this    I was       very ? ightened and went         straight      home and d i d n ’t come

             out again,          the     rest   of that    day or   night,,

             this years          final and       certainly most        of these    people      turned     up at the

             last minute           too near      to kick-off     time,    whereas     last year         the    crowds

             turned       up steadily and there a p p eared              no   problems      in fans gaining

             e nt r y     to    t he   ground.

             ihe police          seemed       to be doing     a weeks work      this year       trying        to    control

             the fans          going    in    the Leppings Ln end        of the ground.

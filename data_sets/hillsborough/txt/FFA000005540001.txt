             Dear Sirs,

             Hillsborough Disaster


            We have considered the Interim Report published on 4th August
            with our clients.  Whilst it is Taylor L.J.'s view that your
            client's decision to choose Hillsborough for the venue was
            "ill considered", Paragraph 271 of the Report makes it clear
            that he does not consider that this decision was causative of
            the disaster.

            The Report serves to reinforce the view that no legal
            liability should devolve upon The Football Association for
            their choice of the ground.

            This is, as you will appreciate, important in the context of
            your client's insurance policy under which our clients agreed
            to indemnify your clients subject to the terms and conditions
            of the policy against all sums which they "shall become
            legally liable to pay for compensation....".     If claims are


»           pursued against your clients they will be considered on this
            basis and no other. Thus, in view of the terms of the Interim
            Report and whilst we appreciate that each claim must be looked
            at on its own merits, we anticipate that if litigation is
           /instigated we will receive instructions to take an extremely
           (tough line and not to make any concessions.    Indeed, it may
           well be the case that following publication of the Report
            claims will not be pursued against your clients.      We trust
            that this will prove to be the case but if the position is
           otherwise we will, of course, let you know.
                                                                                                                                                                            Brussels
           Yours faithfully,
                                                                                                                                                                            Hong Kong

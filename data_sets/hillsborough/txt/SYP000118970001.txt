            On    Saturday,                15 A p r i l      19 8 9 ,    (150489)             I    came          on    duty       at    Hackenthorpe

            Police         Station           at       0830    and       shortly          afterwards                   along       with       several

            other          officers          was       transported                to   Hillsborough                    football            ground,             I

            was       in    charge          of     Serial         11    which          comprised                of    11    members          of    E2 Sub

            Division             and       all     with      the       exception             of    1,       were       not    familiar             to    me ,       I

            was       responsible                to    Inspector             Woodward             of    F       Division.

            The       first       six       officers          on       the    serial          list          were       allocated             in    the    area

            at    the       rear       of     turnstiles               1--8 a t        the    Leppings                Lane    End          before       the

            kick       off       to    ensure          that       fans       entering             the       ground          were       not    in

            possession                of    items          prohibited             by    th$       ground             rules.        (Banners,

            weapons,             missiles             or    alcohol).

            The       last       five       officers          and       myself          patrolled                on    the    upper          level

            concourse             of       the     North      Stand          to    maintain             order,             paying          attention           to

            the       refreshment                bars       and    the       betting          booth             there.

            Up    to       just       before          kick     off      time       there          was       a    steady       stream          of

            Liverpool             fans        to      the    North       Stand.

            Prior          to    kick       off       there       was    an       influx          of    hundreds             of    fans       to    the

            of    alcohol             to    drink,          but    there          were       too       few       of    us    to    take       any

such         a    late          time.

I       cannot         comment          on       the       actions          of    the       stewards           as       such        was             the

density               of    people          on    the       upper       level          prior       to    kick           off        that             I had       no

chance            of       gaining          e^try          to    the    North          Stand.

As      stated             before,          radio          reception             was    poor.

At       1503         myself          and    PC       3116       Ellis       arrested             a youth           <

for         drunk          and    incapable                on    the    upper          level       concourse              and           took            him     to

the         police          room.           Whilst          there       a    radio          message           was       received

requesting                  officers             to    the       pitch       area.           I left           PC    3116           with             the

prisoner               and       went       up    to       the    upper          concourse             and     managed                 to       find       tfrtsftp

members               of    my    serial          and       took       them       down       to    the        ramp       between                    the    North

Stand            and       the    Kop       but       were       prevented             from       going        onto       the           pitch.

After            several          minutes,             Inspector             Wallace          from       El        led    several                    officers

on      to       the       pitch       and       it w a s        only       then       that       I saw        hundreds                 of

supporters                  on    it.        I gave             assistance             to    carry       one        injured                 party          off

the         pitch          but    apart          from       that       stayed          with       other        officers                 on          the

halfway               1ine.

I must            admit          it    was       unnerving             being       on       the    upper           concourse                    amongst

hundreds               of       Liverpool             fans       hyped       up    at       the    possibility                     of       them

             e a r l fir    and    the   fear     of    the    chance      of    being    set    upon.     I feel   that,

             especially           when   a   serial      like       mine   was    split    up,    then    more   than    o ne

             radio,        mine,     should      have    been       made   available,       4nd    that   more    than    one

POLICE CONSTABLE 2980




HACKENTHORPE POLICE STATION




I    am    a   Police      Constable          in the      South Yorkshire         Police,        presently

stationed at Hackenthorpe Police Station, Occupation Lane, Sheffield.

At     8.30       a.m.     on     Saturday 15             April 1989,       I    commenced           duty     at

Hackenthorpe Police Station in order to perform public order duties at

the Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield, where the F.A. Cup semi

final       was     to     take       place     later      that day      between        the    teams        from

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

My specific role                was    to be      a member of Serial             Number       16 under the

direct supervision of Police Sergeant 1288 PAYNE.                                 Also in the serial

were       the    following        Constables;          115     HUCKSTEPP,       3066    HUCKSTEPP,          259

CONEY, 607 TAYLOR, 1715 BEST, 963 EVANS, 620 YATES, CERRONE and DUFFY.

Our       task    that     day     was       that prior    to     the    start    of     play        we   would

supervise turnstile gates A to G inclusive at the Leppings Lane end of

the       ground.         During       the    actual      play we       would    supervise       the      crowd

within the elevated section of the West Stand, and prior to the end of

the game, we were to take up a position outside the gates, in Leppings

Lane to supervise the exit of the crowd from the stadium.

Once      at     the     ground       a briefing       for all officers           took place          shortly

before 10.00 a.m. in the North Stand.                            After the general briefing, my



                                              O
serial was briefed by PS PAYNE on our specific duties, only he and one

other   officer      in   the      serial,      PC   YATES,      were     in   possession     of    a

personal radio.

Our instructions were to be in position on the turnstiles by

11.15 a.m. as the gates would be open from 12 noon onwards.

As a preventative         measure,       we were      to perform         searches     of incoming

spectators for       weapons or alcoholic                  drinks,prevent persons underthe

influence     of     alcohol       from      entering      the     ground       and   control the

behaviour of those          entering the         ground.         To achieve       this, we would

station ourselves immediately outside the turnstiles taking advantage

of the restriction they caused to the flow of persons into the ground.

Our briefing was supplemented by Inspector PURDY who was the officer

in charge of our serial, and later by Inspector SYKES.

As   instructed,     we   were     in    position     for when          the    turnstiles   opened

shortly after 12 noon.             Virtually straightaway supporters were at the

ground and started entering.                   At that time the flow of persons into

the ground was       light and steady, as                  did theother other officers of my

serial,    I was     able     to   search       the majority      of persons       entering        the

ground.     Any in possession of metal cans were asked to leave them in

the waste bins outside the turnstiles.                     Everyone who was asked did so

and practically everyone entering the ground offered themselves to be

searched and were         good humoured about it.                 The weather was fine and

quite     warm,    most   people        were    without    coats,        making    the   searching

easier.      Very    little     property was taken from those entering.                       I am

sure of a small penknife being seized and a young couple attempting to

enter the ground with two large cans of lager.

The unfortunate       consequences,            however, were that whenever an officer

either seized an item of property or arrested someone, then they would
have to leave their posts on the turnstiles and the remaining officers

would have to cover all seven turnstiles as best possible.                                       That was

not   a   cause         for   concern     though   as     I    could      see     another     serial       of

officers inside the turnstiles also checking persons into the ground.

In    fact     for      the    first    couple     of   hours,        although          we   were     busy,

everything went smoothly and there were no real problems,                                    although I

was    aware       of    several       people    coming       to    the     one    turnstile          I   was

covering,      with tickets         for the Nottingham Forest end of the ground.

However, the situation changed shortly before 2.30 p.m. when there was

a sudden build up of spectators completely filling the area in front

of our       seven      turnstiles.        Three or four times the                  crowd surged and

pushed forward, which resulted in me being trapped with my back to the

wall to the side of the turnstiles opening.

During       the    lulls     in   these    pushes,       my       priority       had    changed          from

checking      the spectators           into the ground,             to trying to         'funnel'         them

into the 'turnstiles' as quickly as possible.

The density of the crowd around me at this time was such that I had

difficulty         in    seeing    what    other   officers          were    near       to me,      despite

being only a few feet away to my right, I could only just see PC 115

HUCKSTEPP who was stood at turnstile gates A and B.

I could see no other officers of my serial although to my left I could

see Inspector PURDY.               He was stood on top of a railing at the end of

the   turnstiles near to the large                  gate       'C'.       He was     shouting at the

crowds       trying      to   encourage     them    tostop         pushing,       although       he       also

called over to us             to see that we were all               right.

A mounted officer             also came close in, infront of me and attempted to

stop the crowd from pushing but he was                             frustratingly ineffective                as

the crowd were tightly packed around the horse and seemed to have no

                                          _    4   _




fear of the animal.

At no time did the crush on the turnstiles relax despite the efforts

of the officers I could see, it became worse and a couple of times I

was pressed tightly back against the wall with people so close around

me that I was virtually unable to move and put in a position where I

was concerned for my own safety.

At   this   time we were       serving no purpose              at all,   any efforts    should

have been directed at the rear of the crowd where the pushing started.

Eventually I was again able to see Inspector PURDY who called for us

to 'escape' from the crowd by going through the turnstiles ourselves.

That message I passed onto PC 115 HUCKSTEPP after which I went through

turnstile A or B and we met again inside the ground.

Immediately I went back out via the large gate                      'C' to where Inspector

PURDY was up on the railing still trying to control the crowd.                              There

was also large numbers of spectators climbing on top of the turnstiles

and onto the wall above gate 'B'.

At   that    moment   a    young    boy       of       about   11   years   and   practically

unconscious was passed over the heads of the tightly packed crowd in

front of the turnstiles.           He was passed towards gate               rC r where I took

hold of him and carried him into the ground via gate                         'C' and to the

'Portacabin'      which had been set up as a property store in that area.

The boy was holding an          'inhaler', was very pale and short of breath.

Inside      the   Portacabin    were      other         officers    including,    I   believe,

Inspector WHITE and I left the boy in their care.

Again I went back         out of the ground via gate                 'C'.   The mood of the

crowd had obviously        changed and was               becoming quite     hostile    as    they

struggled     to get into the ground.                  One fan who was not in the crush

but the other side of the railing, dropped his ticket which went under
the feet of the crowd.                When he reached under the railing to try and

retrieve       the    ticket,    other    fans    thought     he was trying to         'jump the

queue' and actually kicked him.

It was       impossible to stop          the crowd pushing from the front near the

turnstiles as the pushing obviously started from well back.                            Therefore

in an attempt to relieve                that rush on the turnstiles, I went further

back in the crowd to where there are a set of wrought iron gates which

separate the stadium from Leppings Lane.

These were open but, as did a couple of other officers, we closed the

three pairs of gates to prevent any further pushing on the turnstiles.

The    difficulty with          those    gates    though was       that    although    the right

hand of the pair had a bolt which went down to the ground,                              the left

side    could       only be     closed    and    held   closed     using physical      strength,

which I did.

By    now     it was    between    2.50 p.m.       and 2.55      p.m.     and elements    of the

crowd        were    becoming    quite    hostile       and   desperate     to   get   into   the

ground.         I was subjected to quite a lot of verbal abuse from people

demanding to be let into the ground and others accusing me of causing

people to be crushed up against the gates I was holding closed.

It was impossible to reason with the majority of the crowd who could

not see what was happening in front.                     A couple of times I was told of

women and children being crushed up against the gates and so wherever

possible I allowed them to filter through.

About three times the weight of the crowd on the gates was more than I

could hold and large numbers would surge through before we could fight

the gates closed again.               The mood of the crowd was one of desperation

to     get    into the ground before             the game started.          I tried to assure

people        that     the    start     would     be    delayed,     something    I    genuinely
believed, but achieved little success.

Eventually         the    crowd     at    the    turnstiles       dwindled         and I saw that the

other      pairs    of wrought           iron    gates      had been opened.               Obviously         the

crowd pushing against the gates I was holding could see this and so I

had    to    let    people      start       flowing        through my        gate,       although      I   only

opened one half and tried to slow down their entry.

It was a minute or so after the crowd had passed through or around the

turnstiles into the ground and where I was standing was clear, that I

heard the first 'tannoy' announcement asking the Liverpool fans not to

push against the gates,                  at that time I did not know what gates were

being referred to.

All the officers outside the ground, including myself, then went into

the       sterile     area     to     the      rear   of    the   West     Stand.          I    was    not    in

possession of a radio but shortly after that I understand there was a

radio       message      as   there      was     some    mention     of the pitch and officers

began running around the West Stand towards the police control box.                                            I

ran with them around the police control end into the South Stand from

which I was           able     to gain access to the pitch.                        As I went          around I

could see large numbers of spectators on the pitch in what appeared to

be    a    straightforward            pitch     'invasion'.          The     main     crowds      of    people

appeared       to    be      coming      from    behind     the   goal       out    of    the   West       Stand

terraces and so I headed that way.

As    I neared        the     perimeter         fence      I could     see    the     fences      and      upper

bodies of people crushed against the fence on the south side of the

goal       mouth.        I    could      see    police      officers     at    gate       '3'   frantically

trying to pull people through the gate onto the perimeter track of the

pitch.

I went       to assist and saw that the people just inside the gates were
                                                     -    7   -




trapped    up to just above                  the waist.            Officers had hold of them and

were    trying       to        release     them     but       couldn't because       of     the weight           of

people    pressing             on   them    from further up the                 terraces.       I therefore

climbed up the left side of the open gates in an effort to pull people

up as     the      gates were           only wide         enough for a couple              of officers to

reach through side by side.                        However, even though I was able to grab

the hands of a number of people, it was impossible to release them.

In   order      that       I    could      use    both     hands     to    grab    people,      I    'bridged'

myself across          the open gateway half way up.                            In that position I was

able to help a number of people out of the terraces and across onto

the perimeter track.                    In that position I was above the crowd pressed

up against the fences and it was then I saw about five feet back from

the fence and just off to the right of the gate,                                    the head and upper

body of a man of about 20 years,                              clean shaven,        wearing I believe              a

dark coloured top.                  My attention was drawn to him because he was badly

discoloured          and        lifeless,        obviously        dead     or    dying    and       only    being

supported by the people crushed around him.

That    was     my    first         realisation          that     this    was    a major     disaster.             I

shouted       at     the       people      around        the man     to    pass    him    to me       but       they

obviously couldn't release him as they were still being pushed forward

by the mass of people further back up the terraces.

I shouted at the people to move back and pointed at the tunnel yelling

at them to leave that                    'centre south'           enclosure,      but no-one seemed to

move and I was just shouted down.

It eventually became apparent that there were large numbers of people

trapped       and     crushed         against       the       fencing      and    this     body      of    people

stretched back several feet.                        The few we were able to help out of the

terraces        onto the            perimeter     track were         having       little    effect         on    the
overall      numbers        who    needed        help    and        so myself     and    other    officers

decided we          had    to enter       the     terraces and pull people                 back   from the

fences.       To     do this       it was        necessary          to climb over        the top of the

depth of fans,            this we did and started pulling bodies back from the

crush, many of them lifeless.

Initially we would just pull bodies backwards to relieve the pressure

on the fence, but as more and more officers entered the centre south

enclosure, we were able to start concentrating on individuals.

Together with one officer I attempted mouth to mouth resuscitation on

one man in his late 30's, clean shaven, brown hair, whilst the other

officer attempted cardiac massage.                            We then changed over but neither

of us appeared to have any success.

By    this    time more           and more       bodies were           being pulled        back   from the

fences onto the terraces and there was little room for resuscitation

and so together with other officers,                            I carried the first man out of

the    terraces,          via    the     tunnel    under       the stand,         to the     sterile     area

where his body was left with a couple of officers.

I     returned       to    the     terraces         where           resuscitation was attempted            on

another man who I have little memory of, he was then carried to gate

'3' and passed onto the perimeter track.

Several others were picked up by groups of police and spectators and

we    carried       them either          to gate        '3'    or to where         the   fence had been

broken down near to the centre of the goals.

I    have    little        recollection            of    the        vast   majority of most         of   these

people       as    the    necessity        was      to        get    them   out    of that    enclosure as

quickly as possible to where                      they could properly be seen                 to.

During       this    time I was           aware    that there was             still     large numbers of

supporters          stood       around    in that enclosure,                doing nothing,        but their
very   presence    hindering the people      trying       to     help   the   injured.    I

tried to move      some of these away and told them to leavethe terraces

but    was   shocked   by    thehostile   reaction    I        received   from   some, and

amazed that some       actually still believed the game would continue                   and

were adamant that they wouldn't move.

Eventually all the injured were moved out of that enclosure and away,

I remained in      the area.       A couple of times I heard the              roar of the

crowd from the     Spion Kop and thought there was going to be trouble but

I did not become involved in that.

When the match was          finally abandoned,   I supervised           the departure of

fans    from   the West Stand out of the ground,               after which we were de­

briefed.

Finally it would appear to me that the cause of the problems was                         the

vast numbers      of   people trying to enter the              ground   in the last half

hour, many of these people had an overpowering desire to get into the

ground before the kick off and could not be reasoned with.

The only announcements I heard over the public address system was the

request for the "Liverpool fans to move back from the fences".

    I attach a contribution on the current police investigation
    following Hillsborough,       for Lord Ferrers' meeting on Thursday
    3 May.        Ms Moody and I will attend Lord Ferrers' briefing
    meeting at 10am.        I gather the main meeting itself is in the
    'television interview room' at the Lords, and the rendezvous
    point is 3.20 pm at the day pass office.


    2.    None of us was clear on what was happening in relation to
    the police investigation,       the criticism of Mr Wright, etc: the
    attached note should bring recipients up to date.        While there
    may well be more lessons to come from policing football -
    which will interest F8 - the present action^also of close
    relevance to F2, though some digging was necessary to
    ascertain that.


    3.    I should be very grateful if police issues could be dealt
    with first at the briefing meeting as I have to go to another
    meeting:       I have asked Miss Nicholson to arrange the agenda
    that way, if you are content.

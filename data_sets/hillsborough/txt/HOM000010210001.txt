As the House knows, the Chief Constable of the West Midlands
police was asked by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to
review   all     aspects   of   his     force's actions            during        the
disaster.      The West Midlands police authority have asked for
an assurance that the costs of these inquiries should not
fall on the West Midlands.      This is reasonable.               Arrangements
will be worked out for reimbursing the West Midlands police
authority the additional costs falling on them as a result of
their inquiries.




                           SUPPLEMENTARIES


Does "additional costs" include the cost of overtime worked
by West Midlands officers to cover the duties which cannot be
undertaken by officers seconded to the Hillsborough inquiry?

                                 Yes



Will South Yorkshire have to     Day?



South Yorkshire has made representations to the Home Office
about the costs of the inquiry and the Home Office will be
discussing the position with them as a matter of urgency.
BACKGROUND NOTE


Following     the Hillsborough disaster,              the    Chief   Constable    of the
West Midlands police was invited by the Chief Constable of South
Yorksh i re   to    set up   an   inquiry into all aspects              of the police
handling of the crowd before the match.


A   team   of West Midlands       officers was         established and        is in the
course of pursuing its inquiries in South Yorkshire and elsewhere.
It is now reporting to the Public Inquiry under Lord Justice Taylor
which was announced by the Home Secretary on 24 April.


The West Midlands Police Authority are anxious not to be left with
any   of   the     costs   falling      on    them.         Initially   at    least   the
responsibility       seems   to   lie        with   the     South    Yorkshire    Police
Authority.       They, however, now claim that their actions in calling
in the West Midlands police are overtaken by the setting up of the
Public Inquiry       and that the Government              should therefore pay        for
everything.


The question of how the costs of the police inquiries should be met
need further careful consideration.                 What seems very clear at this
stage, however,       is   that   the    costs      should    not    fall    on the West
Midlands.

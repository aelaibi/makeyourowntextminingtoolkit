             PC 1996 R. WATSON a VHS Video Tape                          recording                     in a box marked RJH2 the

             tape was marked E180 3 priority copying Gate C RJH 2 Leppings Lane A
                        CtOk
             to G T u r ns ti le s.

             I played this same tape on a player and routed the signal                                                                through

            an X- Calibre              II dual base time             corrector.                       I used the zoom facility

             on this machine to enlarge a section of picture showing t u r n st iles

            A-C       I also indicated on the picture using a "KEY" overlay image

            and Computer Graphics where each turnstile was situated.                                                                 This

             video signal         I routed through to a time and date generator which was

             set to Zero and into two             low band umatic                         recorders.                        I placed a new

             tape      into each machine and recorded 60 mins of information onto

            them.       After 60 minutes         I stopped the                     clock and VHS player and removed
                                                                                         PAGE         2
                                                                                         S972

the umatic tapes which were marked RJH2/ E/ 1A and RJH2/E18.                         I then

played the VHS RJH2 into second hour through the same system into two

new umatic tapes which after 60 minutes                   I again stopped the clock and

VHS Player.      I removed the umatic tapes from the machine which were

marked RJH2/E/2A and RJH2/E/28.                I again started the VHS through the

system and recorded the remaining                information onto two more new umatic

tapes until     the picture showed the turnstiles                 closed.     I then stopped

the VHS player and clock and removed the umatic tapes which were

marked RJH2/E/3A and R J H 2 / E / 3 B , I then rewound the VHS tape and

selected pictures _of turnstiles D~G on zoom with overlay graphics and

recorded the same onto umatic tapes RJ H 2 /F / 1/A and. RJH2 / F /1 /B ,

RJH2/F/2A and RJH2 / F /2B, RJH2/F/3/A and RJH2/F/3B up to the point

where the turnstiles          closed. Then I played a selected peice of RJH2

showing gate C which I enlarged on the zoom machine which I recorded

onto two new umatic tapes after which I rewound the tape and played

the same pictures through an insight enhancer and recorded a further

15 minutes     onto the umatic tapes.                Which I then stopped and removed

and marked RJH2/G/A and RJH2/G/B.                    I finally rewound the VHS tape,

R J HE and made a complete          copy of it onto the new E180 VHS Tape which

has marked R J H / 2 / H .    At 9am    (0900)       on Friday 12th May 1989 (120589)            I

recieved from PC 1996 R . WATSON              low band uniat ic tapes m a rked MAP / I/A

iiap 1, Map 3, Map 7, Map 8, and Map 9 .                  Us i ng M A P /1 /A I edited c e r t a in

pictures containung          crowd s c e n e s i n    pens 3 and 4 prior to 15s02s00 on

15-4— 89   (150489).     This     information I then copied onto a new low band

uniat ic tape which was marked MAP             1/D.      1 then e d i t e d and e ri1a r g e with

the zoom machine       part    copies of the tapes marked MAP               1, MAP 3, MAP 7,

MAP 8 and MAP 9 these edited segments and the complete                        copy of MAP       1/D.

I recorded onto_a further new u m a t i c tape which was marked PJW/1.                          An

the orginal     tapes and the edited copies               I returned to PC WATSON

personally.

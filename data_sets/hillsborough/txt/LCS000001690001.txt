Full of Scouse and Merseypride            On this tragic April day.                       Time’s getting on and so naturally
The gates were opened, we went inside,                                                    you feel something’s happened to those
It was the grimmest day for Merseyside.   When Nevin scored                                    close to thee.
In there it was like a cage.              All Evertonians roared                          And then near eleven o’clock on that night,
People fighting.in fits of rage,          The Blues had no notion                         you hear something awful, it gives you a
Was it death or to be alive?              That police regrettably opened                       fright;
We will always remember those 95.         The gate which proved to be hell door.          you’re needed in Sheffield, a place so far;
Told my mum I’ m coming home                                                              your daughter is there and you travel by car.
Sobbing down that distant phone.          To Heysel Stadium I went, to Hillsborough       But on the journey it seems far away;
Oh God why is life so unkind?               too                                           please God make her better is all you c a ftk
The game of life twists like a knife.     Why these horrific scars on my life?                 say.
People joking and having fun,             What did I do?                                  An then when you get there it seems so
I was to be a lucky one.                                                                       unreal,
For 95 lives it was the end.              In these words of a song                        it’s hard to recall what you really feel.
Scarves and flowers we did send.          ‘walk on, walk on’                              You want to be near her, never to leave;
Kenny Dalglish then sent me a letter,     Forever in peace                                 it seems so unreal; it’s hard to believe.
Saying things can only get better.        Life for survivors must inevitably go on        This is our daughter who went to the game,
                                                                                          and it was about eleven they found out her
                                          Goodbye to the unfortunate                           name.
                                          Goodbye forever                                  It’s GILLIAN EDWARDS, her friends must

                                          To friends we all lost                          The machines and the nurses we saw on
                                          Onward to Heaven                                     that night;
                                          Never forgotten.                                our daughter lay there, a pitiful sight.
                                                                                          She’s in the best hands, they’ ll look after
                                          R.I.P.                                               her there;
Things like this don’t happen to me,                                                      Northern General Hospital Intensive Care.
I thought as I fought for breath,                                                         We don’t read a paper or watch TV,
I shouted to the policeman for help,                                                      we just will our daughter as well as can be.
But he seemed to have gone deaf.                                                           Everyone’s started to rally around,
                                                                                          it’s lovely to see all the love all around.
The world outside the cage                                                                Strangers and friends, family too,
Seemed to carry on as normal                                                              give the support to see us all through.
Our fans were all trapped in,                                                             God is with her, we knew all along,          IIP
Each one treated like an animal.          FIFTEENTH OF APRIL                              then at the service we all heard that song
                                                                                          (YOU’ LL NEVER WALK ALONE)
“ Please help us” we all shouted,         It was the day of the semi-finals               It means so much more than it ever did,
As the panic settled in.                  We were all looking forward to the game         because God gave us back our little kid.
And then the time had come,               Little did we know that by the end of the day   But oh, how so sad for those who have
I just had to give in.                    Football would never be the same.                    died;
                                                                                          the millions of tears that must have been
This was it I knew                        The journey to Sheffield was a good one,             cried.
As I began to drift away,                 Until we got nearer the ground                  Liverpool people are renowned for one thing
I was in my own world now                 We heard about trouble outside there,           it isn’t the football songs that they sing;
This was my judgement day.                Order was nowhere to be found.                  it’s something much deeper, a thing they
                                                                                               might hide;
I thought about my mum and dad            As kick-off drew nearer and nearer,             it’s a sin in some cases, it’s a thing called
How would they cope with this terrible    The turnstiles got more and more packed,             PRIDE.
    news?                                 The police had a stupid idea,                   So now we will try to rebuild on this sorrow;
But now I knew I would lose.              I think that they ought to be sacked.           Who Knows, Who Cares What Happens
                                                                                              Tomorrow?
A hand was put on my shoulder             We now know that idea was a bad one,            We Know, We Care, and We’ ll Try Our Best.
A hand which saved my life                Caused the death of those poor ninety five,     It’s too late now for those at rest.
It pulled me back to reality              If the police hadn’t opened those gates,        But for fans of the future, we all must make
I could breathe, I was still alive.       Those supporters could still be alive.               sure,
                                                                                          that Mums, Dads and families suffer no
It felt like it must have been a dream    It was the day of the semi-finals,              more.
Or through someone else’s eyes this       We had all been looking forward to the
    disaster I could see                     game,
Surely something like this                And now, at the end of the day, we know,
Could never happen to me.                 That football would never be the same.

                   IBROX REMEMBERS:
          20 years of change at Glasgow Rangers
 On January 2nd 1971, 66 people were
 crushed to death at Ibrox, home of Glasgow
 Rangers Football Club, when thousands of
 fans made their way out of the ground after
 the Old Firm battle with Celtic. Many trailed
 down Stairway 13 and the fatal crushing
 ensued when the weight of numbers
 became too great, and the metal barriers
 gave way.

 It wasn’t the first major tragedy at the
 stadium. On April 5 1902, fatalities occurred
 during the Scotland v England international
 when terracing behind one of the goals
 collapsed, killing 26 and injuring 500.
 Amazingly the match continued as fans
 simply avoided the gaping hole, and the
 players themselves were unaware of the
 tragedy until half time when they found
 their dressing room full of the dead and
 injured. It was a signal that wooden
 terracing was on its way out.

             THE LEAVING OF LIVERPOOL
 Many words have been said and written
 about the contribution that Kenny Dalglish
 made to Liverpool Football Club. On the
 field as one. of our greatest players (if not
 the greatest), he masterminded triumphs at
 home and abroad with a combination of
 individual brilliance and unerring positional
 sense; as a manager he commanded equal
 respect, bringing 3 championships and two
 FA Cups to Anfield in the space of only five
 seasons. He shared a unique relationship
 with Liverpool fans throughout his 14 year
 career for whom his success alone would
 have been enough to guarantee legendary
 status.

 For so many of us, our happiest moments
 have been following the team we love.
 Whether it be League or Cup honours, we
 have been privileged to witness the great
 triumphs of a great club; on the field we
 would be narrow-minded to even complain
 about the sprinkling of failed campaigns
 that have been washed aside by a flood of
 honours. The desire for silverware at any
 level is insatiable, especially at a club like
 Liverpool where we have had a glut of the
stuff for nigh on 20 years and more. And
where else would we find a club like
 Liverpool? In the last 2 decades we have

 ‘Interlink’ is put together by a group of                    CENTRE
 people directly involved in the Hillsborough
 disaster and we know the kinds of different
 feelings that are involved in day-to-day life
 because we’ve been there ourselves. We
 produce the magazine every few months,
 and we like to receive your letters, poems
 and articles because we wouldn’t be able to
 produce a magazine without your contri­
 butions. ‘ Interlink’ is available by post (we
 operate a mailing list around Great Britain,
 and to many other countries), or from the
  Hillsborough Centre, Liverpool FC souvenir
  shop and development office, Radio City
  and Radio Merseyside, Liverpool Centre
  Library, national supporters clubs, and
  hopefully soon Goodison Park. If there are
  any other outlets available, please write to
  us at the Hillsborough Centre. There are
  still some copies of issue 6 and 7 left and in
  spite of the passing of time, they are never
  out-dated. We hope to produce the
  magazine in some format as long as the
  demand remains.

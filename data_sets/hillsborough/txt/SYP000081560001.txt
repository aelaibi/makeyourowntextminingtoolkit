radio, the Serial S e r g e a n t being the only Of ficer to have one.         Duties

at this        point    involved        placing     barriers across          Eskdale Rd and only

p er mit tin g       local    residents access.            At this     time there were a few

Li v e r p o o l    fans making         their way to the L e p pings Ln stand for the

op eni ng     of the ground             at    12 noon.



As gr ou nd opening            time     neared the number of supporters                 gra d u a l l y

inc re as ed and there               was a steady stream of fans to the ground.                           I

remember           that from       12 noon until about 2 .30           p.m.    (1430)    the number           of

fans wa lk i n g up to the ground seemed to                       increase once then s u d denly

decrease,          a l t h o u g h there was always a large            number of them walk i n g              to

the ground.



p ™      12 noon until 3 . 0 0 p m            (1500)    it bec^ne ap parent       that Isarge numbers

of fa r k were wa lking              up and     down Leppings L?k in search of anyone                     with

spare      ticWts.           These particular          fans seemed      to form into large            groups

along Leppi                 Ln and were asked to di sperse              by Officers w hich they

did only to gather a g a i n on some other                        part of the    route.        I was      not

asked,       personally,           by any Liverpool        fan if I knew of any spare

tickets,           although    I believe        other officers may have been.                  I do

remember           that several       Liverpool        fans were walk i n g where        there was a

public house.               This    h a p p e n e d on several    occa sions and because            I was

u n f a m i l i a r with the area            I could not tell        them.    Several      times      I

noticed that           certain fans a p p e a r e d to be going              to the ground only to

return down Le ppings Ln.                    This   o c c urred    c o nstantly during the

             afternoon.            A l t h o u g h t h ^ crowd seemed       in good humour there were

             numerous        fans who        I would            had been drinking and a l t h o u g h they were

             not too drunk they were                very bois terous and noisy.                  Mounted Branch

             increased d r a m a t i c a l l y « \ I remember           it w a s \ a   continuous      st r e a m of

             large numbers of fans,                sor^e who had been drinking,                  others who had

             not.     However,         the    crowd a p p e a r e d to be making         their way to the match

             with    no problems and from my own vantage                         point at the junct i o n of

             L e p pings Ln and Es kdale Rd,               ever ything a p p e a r e d     in order as they

             w a l k e d to the ground.           As kick off time approached,                    however,    more and

             more    fans were         increasing        their    pace,    some    running,      obv i o u s l y so as

             not to miss           the start     of the game.



                     prior     to 3.00p.m.         (1500)       I was a p p r o a c h e d by Police S e r g e a n t

             was a distur b a n c e          outside     the t urnstiles and several               other officers

             were making           their way there.             Upon arrival       I saw    large numbers        of

             Liverpool        fans,     I cannot       really say how many,             outside the ground gates

             •and at the turnstiles.               The    crowd was       not    pushing    or shoving,       but was

             m e r e l y made up of numerou s             people just mill i n g about ar o u n d the

 I then heard an officer ask forXmen to go                            into the ground beh ind the

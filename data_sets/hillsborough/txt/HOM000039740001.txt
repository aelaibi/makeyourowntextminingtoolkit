 Thank you for your letter o f 10 November.   I apologise for the delay in replying to it.

 It might be helpful if I explain that the task which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has accepted
 from the Home Secretary is to establish whether there is any significant new evidence about
 the Hillsborough Stadium disaster which was not previously available to Lord Taylor s
 Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary authorities. If there is
 significant evidence, he intends to see if it w ould have affected the outcome o f any o f the
 proceedings. He hopes to report his findings to the Home Secretary by the end o f the year.

 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has asked me to say that he is grateful to you for writing. He has
 noted the points you have made in your letter and will take them into consideration. W e
 also have the statements you made to the police on 7 May and 25 O ctober 1989.

  You suggest a meeting w ith the Judge. Before deciding w hether that w ould be useful, we
  would like to know more exactly what it is you would like to say to him that you have not
  said in your letter. Perhaps you could contact me to discuss this further.

  I look forward to hearing from you.

   Dear Mr Bone,

   Thank you for your lettez dated 25 N o v e mber 1997.
   I was somewhat       surprised by      its content.       As with     the Taylor
  Inquiry I have sat at home pat iently w a i t i n g to be called to
^ a s s i s t in evidence gathering, Yet you inform me that the sc rutiny
  is almost at a close, and therefore it now ap pe ars u n l ike ly that
  my concerns over the management of the. d i s aste r will be heard.
  It saddens     me   that    I need    to remind     such    eminent     people    as
  yourselves as to the importance of my involvement.
  (1) I was the only q u a l ifie d A m b u !aacemao to reach the epice ntre
  of the disastex duiiny the so called rescue effort.
  (2) The role of my ambulance way d e l i b e r a t e l y w i t h h e l d from both
  the Tayloi inquiry and from the C o m e r , y iv jrtgr c r e d i b i l i t y to the
  3.15 pm cut off t i m e .

  (3) I Q ive a different v e i » ion of t.he reaso ns A m b u l a n c e s were
  prevented from aett ir.u on the pi tel... t.. that given to the Taylor
  inquiry by Mr A Hopkins.


 The above puts me in an unusual posit'ion.               I am well placed to
 discuss the emergency service response,               I believe some people
 w*r.« petfect-ly     saveable,     something     I would      feel    h a p pier   to
 explain verbally,      I see no reason why Lord J u sti ce S t u a r t - S m i t h
 has not sought me out . Unless of course He has c o n c l u d e d that the
 victims were all dead by .3.1 L> pm. without ever m e e t i n g myself

    raise some serious doubts in my mind at. to thfe c r e d i t a b i 1 ity of

I ANTHONY JAMES EDWARDS will say:


I make this statement further to my statements o f 7,h May 1989 and 25th O ctober 1989

appended hereto.




In my statement o f 7lh May 1989, at paragraph 7, I describe how, when attempting to

enter onto the pitch at Hillsborough I was prevented from doing so by a police officer.

Both myself and the driver proceeded onto the pitch. We were obstructed from doing

so by a line o f approximately ten policemen who had formed a cordon across the

entrance to the pitch. One o f those police officers left the cordon and approached the

ambulance. He was not a senior officer he was a police constable. He stated “You

can’t go on there, they’re still fighting” . The time then was approximately 3.25-3.30

pm.




My driver then shouted Alan Hopkins (the Assistant chief Ambulance Officer). I told

him that the police officer had said that we could not go on the pitch. Alan Hopkins

stated that he did not care who said we could not go on. He told us that he wanted us

to go to the top o f the field and not to stop for anybody until we saw Paul Eason. This

surprised me because I thought Paul Eason was actually outside the ground.

He then told us to put our tw o tone horns on. He actually reached across and put the

horns on for us.

I was later informed that Alan Hopkins had seen the chaos at the Leppings Lane end

because he had been involved in getting the 10 year old victim into the first ambulance.




In order to reach the Leppings Lane end o f the ground we actually drove onto the
grass. I was unable to see Paul Eason in the melee o f people at the Leppings Lane end

o f the pitch. One possible reason is that SYMAS officers w ore police officer type

uniforms (White shirt, black tunic and trousers and black tie). It was impossible to

spot an ambulance man amongst a whole load o f police officers who were at the scene.

As I alighted from the vehicle just in front o f the goal, I started to try to do some

triage but it was clear that there were no other ambulances coming onto the field.




 In my previous statement dated 25 October 1989, I also refer to somebody kicking

me. The West Midlands police had interviewed me and kept referring to this incident.

They seemed to think that the person who had kicked me was Trevor Hicks and they

were simply trying to help me to identify whoever it was. They kept referring back to

this incident but on the scale o f things it was not important. It had shocked me at the

time but it was only a minor incident. Ambulance staff regularly receive minor Assault

in the course o f their duty. They wanted me to prepare a statement and asked if I

wanted to prosecute the person who had injured me. I cannot recall the names o f the

West Midlands police officers. They also showed me some photographs and a video

o f my ambulance coming onto the pitch at 3.35 pm.




In paragraph 8 o f my statement o f 7,h May, I describe how my ambulance w as loaded

►•with three casualties, a..nur«e , two policemen, two spectators, my driver and me. The

two spectators were Trevor Hicks and the nurse. I would like to add that I had

assumed that when we got to where the other ambulances were collecting ie the

gymnasium entrance the bodies would be taken off and triage carried out. However,

before I knew where we were, we were on Herries Road on our way to the hospital.

At this stage I would add that we had no difficulty in negotiating the ramp either onto
 the pitch or when we were exiting. This is contrary to a comment in the Taylor

 Report. (See paragraph 302),                    the driver o f the ambulance can confirm

 that we had no difficulty in negotiating the ramp when entering or exiting the pitch.

 After unloading the casualties at the Northern General Hospital we returned to the

 ground. I have since discovered that an Ambulance did get stuck on the ramp. It was

 driven b y __________________from Langley Ambulance Station, however, this had

 taken place before any Ambulance was ordered onto the Pitch.




 I recall that the scenes in the gymnasium were chaotic. It was full o f police officers. I
                                            r-          — .

can remember a young policewoman crying. I did not see many Senior ambulance

officers except for one a lead Ambulance man from M iddlewood Ambulance Station

who set up a drip in the gymnasium at around about 4.00 pm. Police officers were

laying bodies out in rows. Many o f the bodies had shirts over their faces. I can

remember row upon row o f blue jeans and trainers sticking out. Whilst attempting to

treat casualties I ran out o f orofarangeal airways. W e only had five or six o f these on

our vehicle. The vehicle was not classified as an emergency vehicle. We were just on

routine duty that day. One o f the things that occurred to me as I saw police officers

laying bodies out in the gymnasium was how few bodies had airways in them.

Inserting an airway into the mouth is one o f the basic techniques one would expect to

use if someone had suffered unconsciousness from crush injuries. I always wondered

how many o f those who died actually had resuscitation attempted on them by anyone

with basic medical knowledge.




At no time can I remember Hillsborough being declared as a major incident. I recall

that a Senior Ambulance Officer,                    was sent to fetch the major incident
 vehicle. When he arrived at Hillsborough he did not know how to use it. Also, there

 were paramedic crews standing by on Upper Thorpe awaiting further instructions.

These were never received.




I was not involved in any formal debriefing except an interview with a SYMAS

solicitor. The only debriefing took place in the mesh room, where many questions

were raised by staff, many said they phoned SYMAS and offered their services as they

watched the disaster unfold on TV.




A question I repeatedly asked myself after the disaster was ‘why on earth the

ambulance staff were not sent to the epicentre o f the disaster with their equipment?’.

The ambulance staff were either outside o f Leppings Lane or at the other end o f the

football pitch outside the gymnasium. In my opinion the Ambulance crews ought to

have been ordered onto the pitch with instructions to triage. It was w rong to send

only three vehicles onto the pitch. Even basic medical equipment was not available at

the epicentre o f the disaster, with injuries such as those suffered at Hillsborough, basic

but swift medical attention is required:

(a)    putting the injured into the recovery position;

(b)    clearing the airway so that the patient can breathe - often done by inserting a

       simple plastic tube o f the kind carried by all ambulances.

       It was largely young football fans who carried the dying and injured the length

       o f the football pitch on makeshift stretchers before they received any kind o f

       qualified medical attention. Many o f the injured were carried on their backs

       rather than in the recovery position because o f lack o f basic medical

       knowledge. It would be unheard o f in an equivalent disaster, on a train for
                example, for ambulance personnel to wait up on an embankment whilst the

                passengers carried bodies off the train.




12.    Only fourteen o f the victims were taken to hospital and three o f those were in my

       ambulance. I believe that more people would have survived had the ambulance

       personnel together with their equipment been directed to the Leppings Lane end o f the

       pitch as soon as the disaster unfolded. I repeat my remark from my previous statement

      that prior to the disaster I was not aware o f any Hillsborough plan or the role that the

      gymnasium was to play in it. I was not aware that the gym was the casualty clearing

      centre.

 I ANTHONY JAMES EDWARDS will say:              I was born oa 5.9.55.



 I work as an ambulance man on day work.                I joined SYMAS in

 September 1988.      I started part time and was promoted to day
                                                 /
 work   on   6th   March 1989.    I had previously been in the

 ambulance    service    in    1973   in   Liverpool    and    had    received

 qualified status.       I had done further training which lead to

me   being    admitted    as    a Fellow   of   the    Ambulance      Service

 Institute.         This is     a qualification        above    the    normal

standard but it is not a paramedics course although it is an

introduction to it.           I left the service in 1982 and went to

Sheffield Polytechnic to do social              studies.       I worked in

adult education until I rejoined the service.



On Thursday and Friday I worked a shift of 0800 hours to
1630 hours.



On Saturday Iwas to work          from 0900 hours to 1730 hours.           I

was with ____________ who is a qualified ambulance man and
was acting as driver.



The first I remember about the Hillsborough incident is when

we were taking a patient to the Northern General Hospital.

We heard control telling a crew from Rotherham to go to the

gym at Hillsborough where they would be met by a station

officer.     I thought that it would be some form of a fight

going on.     Our radio was on the day frequency which I think
is channel 3^.          We stayed on the channel all the way through

the   day.         We    did               change     to     ERC      — anay .atage. V'



It was about 1510 to 1515 hours when we we^re on our way to

the   Northern          General       Hospital.         We      arrived   at     Northern

General about 5 minutes later.                      There were various messages

coming over the radio but I was concentrating on the patient

in the ambulance.              We took the patient into the hospital and

it was sometime before 1530 hours when we got back to the

ambulance and started to clean up.                      We then gave the call to

control that we were clear.                    I made the call on channel

Control      then       told    us    to       goto    Hillsborough gym entrance

where we would be met by an ambulance officer.                               We did not

know which side the gym entrance was on and I was going to

use the radio to try and find out where the entrance was.

We went down to the traffic island on Herries Road which is

about     one   and      a     half    miles    away.           Control   then    gave   a

message to all mobiles.                    They repeated that it was for all

mobiles      and     said      that     they were          to   proceed   to     the   gym

entrance at Hillsborough as they had notification of some

fatalities.         I think this was around 1530 hours.                        We arrived

at the ground at about 1532 hours.                           There were no problems

in approaching the ground until we reached the junction of

Herries      Road,       South       and Penistone         Road.     There      were   two

ambulances in front of us and                  a police officer was directing

us to park behind them.                     A short time later,            probably no

more than a minute we were moved into the entrance while the
next ambulance was sent to the further gate.                            I saw

       standing outside the first entrance and pointing for us

to go into it.         The police officer shouted to us that if we

went to the second entrance then we would b^ able to get out

via the first entrance.                      said no and that he wanted us

to go into the first entrance.                 We did so.             We were met by

Mr.Hopkins       the      Assistant          C h i ef     Ambulance          Officer.

Mr.Higgins was         also   there.         Higgins       told us      to drive up

behind an ambulance which was already parked and almost at

the same time Hopkins told us to go on to the field.                                      At

this    stage    there        were    rows     of       police    with       vans        and

stretchers coming out of the entrance on to the pitch.                                    It

was clear that there were dead bodies on at least two of the

stretchers.      I would say the time was about 1535 hours.



We were stopped by a police officer at the entrance to the

corridor to the pitch.                The officer at the               front of the

ambulance said that we could not get through.                                Spectators

were shouting at us about a body on a stretcher.                             We stopped

and Hopkins came up to the ambulance and opened the door.                                  I

said    that    the    police      officer    said       that    we    could       not    go

through    and    he    replied       that    he    wanted       us    on    the    pitch

immediately.          He said that there were casualties at the far

end of the ground and he needed us on the pitch and that we

were not to stop for anyone until we got to the far end of

the ground.           He told us to put our two tones on and go

through.         We    did    as     we   were      told    and       went    past       the
                 policemen.      It was slow progress getting on to the pitch but
                                 *»'!             .    -       -
                 we certainly did not get stuck.                      On the pitch we saw five to

                 six   boards    being        used      as    stretchers       with   bodies     thereon

                being carried by fans.                     We drove past them^while they were

                screaming       at      us   to       stop.         The   St.John's     ambulance      was

                leaving   the        pitch    as       we    came    through    the     entrance.       it

                waited until we were out of the way before going off the

                pitch.     We were the only ambulance on the pitch by this

                stage.    We drove up to the 18 yard box in front of the west

                stand.    There were people everywhere.                       My driver was looking

                for an officer but we could not find one anywhere.                                   There

                were fans bashing on the ambulance wanting us to stop and

                help their friends.               We were approached by a woman and she

                shouted      through          the       window        and     said    that     she    had

                resuscitated a casualty.                     I got out of the vehicle with a

                bag, mask and airways, and went to a body which was lying in

                front of the goal in the 18 yard area.                          Someone was giving

                mouth to mouth resuscitation.                       I noticed the colour of the

                patient and was doubtful whether the patient had                               in    fact

                been revived.           All the time there were people shouting at me

                for oxygen and all I could remember shouting was "one at a

                time."     I    knelt        down      over    a     male    casualty    and   someone

                deliberately kicked me in the back and said "what about my

w l 4. ,j       daughter."      I continued co look after the boy on the floor.
'I."V! kf'i'^
      J         1 decided that we needed to move him.                           I told the people

                around me to pick him up and I shouted to someone to bring a

                girl that I had also briefly seen.                          I would say it was now
 about 1540 hours.             I looked for my driver and he had driven

 over to the other side of the goal towards the corner flag.

 We carried the bodies over to the ambulance and I was being

 followed by people carrying other bodies.                        When I got to the

 ambulance I saw that someone had alxeady opened the back

 doors.        I asked a police officer to stay with me to look

after me after I was kicked.                       We put the young boy on the

left   hand      side    and    the girl       on     the   right    hand    side    and

someone else put another body on the floor down the middle.

Then someone tried to get another person into the ambulance.

I shouted to the policeman to take the person off and he did
so.



When   I turned         round    again       the    ambulance     was   packed      with

people and so I asked the police to clear the ambulance.

The doors were closed but I could hear people kicking the

back doors and wanting attention.                      in the ambulance there

were     now    three     bodies,        a    nurse,        two   policemen,        two

spectators,      my driver and me.                  One of the spectators was

trying    to     revive     the    young       boy.         The   nurse     was   from

Nottingham.       She had been a spectator who had volunteered to

help during the chaos on the pitch.                    She was using a bag and

mask correctly.          The other spectator was holding the head of

the girl.       I told                   ]to get going.                   |put on the

lights and horns and drove off the pitch.                           I have no idea

what time it was by now.            I assume that the man on the floor

was dead.       I tended to the girl and showed how to do mouth
 to    mouth    resuscitation   while   the    spectator     did    cardiac

 compressions.       I was very upset by this stage.               I cannot
 remember anything about getting out of the ground and I do

 not   know what    time   it was.      I remember /nothing of          the
 journey up to the Northern General Hospital.



 We took the three bodies into casualty and I assisted the

 doctor for a few minutes.        We then loaded trolleys back on

 to the ambulance.      I asked the spectator nurse to come back

 with us and she agreed.        I cannot remember any instructions

 as to what we were to do next.         We drove back down to the

ground and I could hear conversations on the radio to do

with Hillsborough but I was not really taking them in.



There were no problems in the approach to the ground, with

police   cars    everywhere.     This   time   we    went   through    the

second entrance.      There were a couple of ambulances ahead of

us.    I also saw a West Yorkshire ambulance.           I said to Alan

Vevers that I would report to an officer to see what wanted

to be done.       I went to an ambulance officer in the yard

although I do not know his name.         He said that

was to stay with his vehicle and that I was to help as much

as I could.       I went back to the ambulance to tell                 to

stay with his vehicle but discovered that he had gone.                  I

went to the next ambulance and helped myself to a first aid

box.   Just then a casualty on a trolley was brought up.               He

appeared asthmatic and semi-conscious.              I put him on the
             second     ambulance.      Then   the    attendant   on   the   second

             ambulance, Stuart Carr, arrived with another casualty.             Once

             they were loaded,       that ambulance set off to the hospital.

                                                       /
    11.      I then met another officer whom I did not know.            He told me

             to help some of the casualties out and pointed towards the                j

             gym.   I did not realise before this that the casualties were
                                                                                       i
             in the gym.     I went into the gym and met Station Officer               j
                                                                                       I
             Higgins.     He said that I was to assist priorities.            I then   j

             helped with trolleys and directed arriving ambulance men to
*            priority casualties.       Each time I loaded a priority onto a

             trolley I went back to the senior officer in the yard to

             tell him what I had done and asked for more instructions.

             He would then tell me to go looking for priorities again.



    12   .   At one stage I offered to be a runner because there appeared

             to be no communication system between the officers at the

             ground as the radios were not working.         Within a short space

             of time we did not need trolleys and were onto the walking

             wounded.     By this time I felt exhausted and explained to

             Station Officer Higgins that I had been kicked.           He told me

             that I had to go to casualty.           I did not want to.      He said

             that there was a vehicle going to Hallamshire Hospital and

             said that I should go with it.



    13.      I was at the Hallamshire for about 20 minutes.

             then arrived with some doctors who were needed at casualty.
      it was quite by accident that we met up at the Hallamshire.



14.   The control officer on the radio told us to have a drink at

      the Hallamshire.              We did so and we took £wo transfers to

      King Edward Hospital.            We finished ajb King Edwards at about

      1900 and then control told us that we were finished.                      We

      went back to the station, cleaned the ambulance and went off

      shift.


15.   I was not aware that there was any Hillsborough plan or of

      the role that the gym was the play in it.              I did not realise

      that     the   gym      was    the   casualty   clearing   centre   or   the

      temporary mortuary until I was told by one of the officers.

      I was aware of the major incident plan prior to this.

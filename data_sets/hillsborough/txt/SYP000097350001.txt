    or not I mas able to n I u m to the Steffiald City Council, as licensing

    Police Operational Order for tita ill fated seal-final at Hillsborough,
    together with a breakdown of poliea resources deployed both inside and
    oulaid* the football ground. At the Mating I informed you that £ would
    need to eonault the legal officers for the Public Inquiry in respect of
    the evidential status of that information.

    X have now been advised by the Treasury Solicitor that it would be
    inappropriate to release that inforaation prior to it being introduced
    into the public doaain during the course of the Public Inquiry. I regret
    therefore that I aa unable to assist.

Dear Mr Wright

re:     QUESTIONS RAISED AT THE SPECIAL SOOTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY
       MEETING ON FRIDAY 21 APRIL 1989

I write, at the request of Councillor Betts, to follow up two issues
which he apparently raised with you during the course of the meeting;
one relates to a copy of the Police Operational Plan for the semi-final
on Saturday 17 April and the other to the break-down of the numbers
of police officers deployed on that day.

It is my understanding that you indicated to Councillor Betts that you
could personally see no objection to him receiving, first of all, a
copy of the Plan and secondly the above-mentioned break-down of police
numbers, subject only to Lord Justice Taylor being asked as to whether
he deemed it appropriate for you so to do at this stage.

I would, therefore, be grateful if you could let me know whether you
are yet in a position to let me have the requested documentation or,
alternatively, whether you have yet obtained Lord Justice Taylor's advice
on the matter.

Yours sincerely



                                                                      k,

            H I L L S B O R O U G H : C O S T O F INVESTI G AT IO N BY W E S T M I D L A N D S PO LICE

 s'     J   T h a n k you for y o u r l et te r of 9 August. The Police A u t h o r i t y co ns i de re d the
 v.         m a t t e r again at its m e e t i n g held on Friday, 18 August, and wish me to reiterate
            the vi e w that the costs incurred by the C h i e f C o n s t a b l e of West Mi d la nd s Police
            at the service o f the Inquiry by Lord Just ic e T a y l o r are pr op e rl y c hargeable to
            the Home Office. This v i e w is e mp h as is e d by the rema r ks of Lord Just ic e Taylor
            in paragraph 5 of his interim report.

            However, y o u r c la ri f i c a t i o n of the w o r k undert ak e n by West Midl an ds Police, and
            w hi ch is subject to the special payment, has prove d helpful - by w a y of
            cl ar if i ca ti o n it is ass um ed this w o r k includes the r e c e nt ly a n no unced criminal
            investigation.

            In these circumstances, the A u t h or i ty is now pr ep a r e d to agree that as a matter
            of practical expediency, it will re i mb ur s e West M i d l a n d s Police A u t h o r i t y the
            total costs of the Inquiry by their C h i e f Constable, subject to confirmation
            from the Home Of fice that the g rant a rr a ngements set out in Lord Ferrers letter
            o f 27 June will a pply to all such e x pe nd i tu re including any interest charged by
            that Au th o r i t y and any interest incurred by South Y o r k s hi r e Police A ut hority
            a rising from any de l ay between the re n dering of ac counts by it and receipt of
            p a ym e nt from the Home Office.

            C l e ar l y the amounts involved will be large, t h e r e fo re it seems to me to be
            a pp ropriate that we agree a m e c h a n i s m for e ns ur i n g p rompt r e i m b u r s e m e n t of
            m o ni e s to the A uthority. When r eplying perhaps y ou will let me have y o u r views
            on this also.
            Yaurs sincerely

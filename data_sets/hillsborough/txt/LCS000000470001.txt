       Dear Mr.Mason,

       I enclose a copy of the plan for the meeting on November 21st,
       along with directions for how to get to Shire Hall.

       We hope that we will learn from this meeting the outline of how
       each response was organised; what difficulties have been
       encountered; and what has been learned from it that should be
       included in a general set of recommendations.

       We would also like to be able to inform people about the working
       party, and find out what you think the working party most needs
       to do.

       I look forward to meeting you.

       Yours sincerely,




       Research Assistant

October 6 1989

Dear Mr. Mason,

As discussed in our conversation, I would like to invite a
representative from the Hillsborough response team to attend a
meeting of the Coordinators of Disaster Responses on Nov.21 in
Reading. The location of th^ meeting is Shire Hall, Shinfield
Park, Reading.  The meeting will be chaired by Mr. Tony Allen,
the Chief Executive of Berkshire County Council and the Chairman
of the Disasters Working Party. The likely time of the meeting
will be 10-4, although this will be confirmed at a later date.

The meeting will take the form of a workshop to discuss three
areas:   what   issues   you  faced   as  a   Coordinator;   what
recommendations you have to make, in light of your experience;
what would be the most useful products from the disasters working
party, in light of what others may have asked you for because of
your experience.

We expect to have people involved as coordinators in the
following disasters: the Bradford City Fire, Zeebrugge, Piper
Alpha, Lockerbie, Clapham, Enniskillen, Kegworth, Hillsborough,
the Thames Riverboat, Hungerford, and Kings Cross.

I will be in touch again in November with more specific details
of the meeting.    Please could you let me know who will be
attending from Hillsborough, so that I can get in touch with them
directly.                                        . ■

Yours sincerely,




Research Assistant

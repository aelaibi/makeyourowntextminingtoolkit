         For



         Hillsborough
         FSA Petition
        The Petition was handed t o » B W a t the FA on Friday 10 April
        1987.          had a conversation with               at Wembley
        about it. There was no reference to this conversation in the FA
        files. Mr ’BffCP is now dead and!           has left Wembley. The
        FA do not know whether Wembley took any action. Certainly none
        was communicated to the FA.

              _______wrote on the note f r o m o f 10 April 1987
        that^AC had noted the contents of the dossier. |              is
- X     sure that the matter did not go to the Matches & Grounds Committee
        nor did it go to the Executive Committee.

        It therefore seems likely that the FA took no action in relation
        to the Petition that anyone can recall.

       It may be worth trying to contact             The only point the FA
       would make about this is that           and 'KEEP may have noted the
       points«tttfo -fhey were certainly the people who were closely
       involved with Wembley matches at that stage.

       Soccer Stars Scheme

       I attach copies of documents we have received from the FA this
       morning.




  A list o f p a r tn e r s ’ n a m e s is availab le at the a b o v e ad dres s
               Df the FA Superskills Awards Scheme had no
correspondence with the Club in 1989.

You will note the memo from                       of 24 May 1989 which is
self-explanatory.
You will also note the extract from the programme and£ Ste
memo of 24 May 1989 in relation to why the matter was left in the
blue booklet.

Finally you should note                         memo of 28 December 1988
as a result of which I presume                     wrote his letter to the
BBC of 9 January 1989.

I will ask     Pto chase      with regard to what happened at the
meeting on 18 January 1989.                             ^   A ,f,i    Q amo**.

             letter of 13 April 1988               .        net- Ae    a*   6*9

           J o t the                        fcannot recall the
letter from 1       _____ind none of the three members of that
Department can either. He says that as there is no suggestion of
crowd misconduct in the letter he doubts whether it would have
been referred to his department. He would have remembered the
reference to the "snapped umbrella1',.
            can find no reference to the letter in his files.

                can find no reference to the letter in his files.

           can find no trace of the letter in any of the other
files.
Again the answer may lie with Mr Croker and we will try and make
arrangements to contact him. f f t ’t i '                  ,

Regards.

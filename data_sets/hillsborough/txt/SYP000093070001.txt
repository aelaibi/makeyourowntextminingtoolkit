I would         estimate               that        I had        been a s s i s t i n g              people         out      of     the    pen       for

another         lad       up the            terracing            towards              me.         The       lads     had      been       shouting

out    for      people            to m a k e        room        for        them       to    pass        through.             Apart        from       the

t wo   lads w h o            were       dragging              the      person          back         up the         terraces,             there

was another               lad      trying           to       pick      the       person           up    by his          feet.           I presumed

t he   three         lads         to    be    friends            of        the     person           t ha t    they were             dragging.

Gradually            the      crowd          in f r o n t        of me m a d e              sufficient               space         for    the

was    the      intention               of    the        lads         to    p i ck     the        person          b a ck           again and             try

             HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - INTERIM REPORT II

             I have pleasure in forwarding for your information and that of Sir Peter,
             a revised version of the interim report we prepared in June.

             You will see, apart from the provision of more detail and improved
             identifications of the deceased, nothing new has emerged.

             I have sent copies of this report to the Director of Public Prosecutions,
             the Police Complaints Authority and the Coroner at Sheffield on a strictly
             private and confidential basis, given that it cannot yet be considered
             the definitive statement.

             Please pass on my regards to Sir Peter and best wishes to you both as
             you proceed with your difficult and sensitive task.

I am w riting ju st to say th a t I have not forgotten my commitment to
produce for Lord Justice Taylor a note on th e mechanics of the
non-dom estic ra tin g system in Scotland as it applies to sp o rts gro u n d s.
I have asked our Local Government Finance Division to produce such a
note, b u t th e ir advice is th a t th is would best be delayed b y a week or
two in o rd e r to take account of rec e n t talk s in England which are
designed to t r y to harmonise th e ra tin g of non-dom estic subjects in
Scotland and England, as p a rt of the Government's overall revision of the
ra tin g system . As you may already be aware, th e re is at p re se n t a wide
difference betw een ra tin g costs n o rth and south of the b o rd e r, with
Scottish costs being much h ig h er th an in England.          This has for a
considerable time been a sore point for the football clubs in p a rticu la r
and I recall from a previous incarnation in Local Government Finance th a t
it was th en an extrem ely difficult problem to resolve. I u n d e rsta n d th a t
the problem has not lessened over th e y ears!
I will t r y to get you a note on our ra tin g system b y th e end of the month
and I will contact you if th is seems unlikely to be possible.

 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM



 Thank you for your letter o f 21 August covering four VHS videotapes, with notes and a plan.
 I confirm receipt o f this material.

 I do not anticipate that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will wish to see the original copies o f the
 four tapes (which we have not yet viewed). But I have noted your helpful offer to let him do
 so and I will be in touch with you again if he does wish to see them.

 The videotapes will be returned to you once Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has completed his
 scrutiny o f evidence relating to the Hillsborough football stadium disaster. You may wish to
 see his terms o f reference, o f which I enclose a copy.

 Secretary to the Scrutiny

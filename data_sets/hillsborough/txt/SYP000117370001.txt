            POLICE CONSTABLE             1368



            At 8.00 a.m.          on S a t u r d a y    15 April        1989,      I commenced duty              in uniform

            at B a r n s l e y Police       Station.



            I was    briefed       by Po l i c e S e r g e a n t 237 9 Swift who was                    the Sergeant            in

            charge     of my Serial           No.      16.      We were       informed       that    our    duties w o u l d ,

            consist      of   public      order        patrols at          the M i d l a n d R a i l w a y Station,

           Sheffield.           All    officers         of Serial          16 then went          by transit        van to

           West B a r P o 3.i c e S t a t i o n , S h e f f i e 1 d , f or         b r i e f i n g at 9 .00 a ,m «



           We were       brie f e d    by Chief         Inspector          King    in West Bar Gym at 9„00 a.m.



           Afterwards         we were       issued       radios,        one    between two          officers.            I was

            paired up w i t h Po l i c e Con s t a b l e 218 5 Cooper who                        took    charge         of the

            radio.      We    left West          Bar about 9.40 a.m.                 Our Serial          arrived         on foot

           at M i d l a n d S t a t i o n at      bout 9.50 a.m.               There we joined             two   or three

           other Seri a l s who           were also           d e p l o y e d on   public order          duty.          The

           inst ructions         given      to    us at briefing were                 to the      effect      that all
                                                                                                                      PAC5E
                                                                                                                      R98

Li verpool       and Notts            Forest         s u pporters           w o u l d be d i r ected        from the

trains      to   separate            ends    of the station,                  where      they w o u l d      board

special       buses       which would           transport              them to Hillsb o r o u g h .            Officers

would accompany                them     on the        buses       to    the ground and             return on the

empty bus        to    repeat         the    journey.



Our    serial,        however,          did not get            involved             in this    particular        duty as

we were       instr u c t e d        to take         control       of the station exits a nd try to

establish which                football        club suppo r t e r s             were     from their          respective

clubs.       The      senior         officer         giving       this       instru c t i o n was Chief

Insp ector King who                  a t t e n d e d at     the    station           personally.



It was a p p a r e n t         that     not many suppo r t e r s                were     trav e l l i n g    by rail,

e ither     from Li v e r p o o l         or Nottingham.



Those     that      did       pass    thro u g h      the    ticket          barriers were          good humoured

and    co - o p e r a t e d    fairly well            with Police              instructions         and guidance          to

the    relevant        buses.           There were           some,          however,      that a v o i d e d stating

that    they were             in S h e f f i e l d    for    the semi-final               match.



I did not w i t n e s s           any     public       order       incidents at             the    railway station,

I did not         see any o n e         in a drun k e n           state        or    in posse s s i o n      of any

offensive        weapons,            p r ohibited a r t icles                or alcohol.



I did not         conduct any             personal          searches           of    people at      that      location.



At S .40 p.m.          myself         and Serial            16 O f f i c e r s       boarded a S h e f f i e l d      city

double decker             bus,       together w ith other                    serial      officers.           We were    then

in structed to            leave       the    railway s t a t i o n and at t e n d at                  the

Hillsborough           football           ground,         again        to    be given further               instruction.
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               R98



As we t r a v e l l e d    from the         railway stat i o n thro u g h the C ity and out

onto    the mai n      roads,         towards H i l l s b o r o u g h ,     traffic was m o d e r a t e at

that    time a n d an odd football                  sup p o r t e r    could be seen mak ing              his way

on foot      towards       the     ground.



I o b s e r v e d a few supp o r t e r s         in p o s s e s s i o n    of   cans of beer/lager.

The y a p p e a r e d good humoured.



As we got         closer       to the ground,           say a r o u n d     the M i d d l e w o o d Road area,

near    to H a m m e r t o n    Road Police Station,                  I saw     large     groups    of

supporters,         some       of whom w e r e o b v i o u s l y drunk            going    towards       the

g round on f o o t .



They were walk i n g            on both sides           of M i d d l e w o o d Road,       some wandering

into the       roadway.          At    this    point     there was          quite    a heavy       traffic

build up.         We m o v e d     slowly towards            the      ground and turned            right       into

L e p p ings Lane.         As we did so            I could see a large g a t h e r i n g             of

suppo r t e r s   head i n g     for     the   ground.



There was a         lot of shouting              and singing.              It was at this          point       that

the    big m a t c h a t m o s p h e r e    became      obvious.           As we drove       towards       the

gr o u n d the    driver        of the      bus had to take               great    care as    people       filled

the    roadway.



As we neared          the L e p p i n g s Lane        end    of the        ground,      I could see Police

Officers       on foot an d two m o u n t e d officers                     near   to the     large       blue gate

by the L e p p i n g s     Lane       turnstiles.           T here a p p e a r e d to be hundreds               of

supp o r t e r s at    that      location,        all    o b v i o u s l y waiting        to get    inside       the

ground.        There      was a lot of shouting,                   all     supporters       seemed       to be
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          R98

making       their way       towards       that   small        area    outside       the    ground,



I remember       commenting          to a colleague             that    they w ould         never   get    that

lot in the ground.



As we    passed L e p p i n g s      Lane we were             continually        confr o n t e d by

suppo r t e r s ma k i n g    their way towards                the Leppings          Lane   turnstiles.

These must       have       numbered        thousands         by this       point and a g a i n the driver

of our       bus had to       take     great      care    to a void an y p edestrians               being

knoc k e d    down.     Some    of the        fans    punched         the    sides     of   the   bus,    some

shou ted abuse,         others       just     chanted and sang.



I remember        that while          on    public   order          duty at     the R a i l w a y Station,

all    radio    transmissions              apeared    c o n t r o l l e d and    calm.      A n o ticeable

change       in radio       transmissions          became a p p a r e n t       from about S . 45        p.m.

onwards.



A   lot of the        transmissions           were    c o nnected with the              s i t u a t i o n outside

the L e p p i n g s Lane      end of the ground                as    calls    for further         a ssistance

were    made.



I do not       recall       exac t l y what was          said at that           time    or by w hich

o fficer(s).



As we got to          the    small     roundabout         at    the    j u n ction w ith Pen i s t o n e

Road,    I could still          see hundreds             of    s upporters making           their way to

t he L e p p i n g s La n e e n cl.



Th e n we     turned    right     into P e n i s t o n e       R oad and      right a g a i n     into   the

ground       by the N o r t h Stand.
                                                                                                               PAGE    5
                                                                                                               R98




T here we all          entered         the gym to await             further      deployment.



After    only a        couple       of minutes         or    so    I remember        hearing      a radio

transmission           reque s t i n g     any a v a i l a b l e   Ser g e a n t s   to   report     immediately

to a Senior         O f f i c e r at      the   gym.



I then saw Po l i c e            S e r g e a n t Swift      a p p r o a c h a Senior      officer       and almost-

i mmedi a t e l y    I heard        the    officer       say s o mething         like all      you      lads     to

the West Stand.


                                                                     /
We then w a l k e d        out    of    the gym and all             our    serial     w a l k e d onto     the

track     in front         of the N o r t h Stand.                I could see that          the     ground was

packed w ith         supporters.            The kop was            full,    as were       both N o r t h and

S o u t h Stands.



In front        of me      I could see the West Stand.                         I saw Police O f f icers

lining the          perimeter          track.      I could not            say how many        but    I was able

to see onto          the    pitch.         At   that     time      the    two teams were          on the       pitch

but    the m a t c h    had not         started.         This w o u l d     be about 2.55           p.m.



As    I passed      the N o r t h Stand and turned                   left to walk          towards       the West

Stand,     I could see a small                  number       of officers         stood away         from the

perimeter        fence w h i c h        e n c losed the       standing area bene a t h the West-

Stand.



My s e l f and other m e m b e r s          of my serial           wal k e d   up towards         the    goal rnouth

area    on the track.              As     I walked       in front         of the     fence,    I could see

that    the     suppo r t e r s     behind      it were       s q u a s h e d and    packed    in like

sardi n e s .
                                                                                                              PAGE

The    e v a c u a t i o n gates        from this area were all                closed at this           time,



1 stopped          be h i n d    the goal      and faced       the     fans.       With me at         that    time

was Police S e r g e a n t 2 3 7 9 Swift,              Po l i c e Con s t a b l e 42 Hooson,            Police

C o n s t a b l e 3 1 9 8 Akred.          There were       other       o f f i c e r s , but   I cannot       recall

their     names.



I recall        saying          to Police S e r g e a n t S wift we've got               to get       these gates

open and let the supporters out.

in s t r uction was             given    to open these         gates,       but    it was      obv i o u s l y the

correct        course       of action,         therefore       w ith    the above        four     named

officers we           opened       the gate at CN4.



As    I a r r i v e d at        that    location      (CN4)    I could hear           loud cries        to    "get

us o u t ' .       1 have        never    seen as many         people       crammed      into an area such

as    that.



I recall        seeing          a lad of about 8-10 years                 of age at       the    very front          of

the fence          near    the wall        bottom.       His    face was          s q u ashed up against          the

fence.        He    could not move             or speak.        A supporter          stood      d i r ectly

behind     him,       spoke       to me    in a calm but         ter r i f i e d manner,         "Get      this

little      lad out".             I a p p ease d h irn briefly and together,                    a f t e r t a 1k i n g

to the      lad and        this        supporter,     we got     the      boy away       from the       fence

onto    the floor w here we m a n a g e d to wedge                      himm      1-f betw e e n this man's

legs    by sitting              on the    floor    under      the metal        framework        s u pporting      the

fence.         I believed          he was at the         safest        possible      place      for    the time

being.        X then       star t e d     to   pull   supporters          from the       crowd through the
narrow gate at CNA.



The    crowd were          packed       so tight       that we        could only get          them out one at

a time-       Some m a n a g e d        to climb on top of              their mates          and    roll     over

the    crowd and fall             out    head or feet          first-         All    the time       the    crowd

were    shouting,          get    us out,       tear     down the       fence and also             abuse     towards

the Po l i c e Officers.



I also     remember         some       s u pporters      s h o uting    'stop the       game*       repeatedly.

It was     only at         that       time    that    I r e a l i s e d the game       had    started.



As    I looked       into       the    same    crowd     1 could see          people w e d g e d between

others who          looked a p p a r e n t l y       dead.



After- a f ew mi nutes                of worki ng to get           peop 1 e out       I re ca 11 the f i rst

m an we got         out who a p p e a r e d      dead.       We    laid him on the gr o u n d behind

the goal.           He was a white man a p p r o x i m a t e l y 25 years,                    5 ’9"--5 * 10” ,

heavy build,           tee-shirt,            jeans    (short      hair).       I assisted          two other

officers       (names/ n u m b e r s         unknown)      in an effort         to    revive       him but he

looked dead.              First       Aid officers        then took        over.,      I r e t ur ned to Gate

CN4.      Again      I a s s i s t e d officers          Akred,       Swift    and others.           Another

y outh was      passed t h r o u g h the             gate.     I took      this y o u t h onto         the    pitch

w i t h anot h e r     officer.          As we       laid him down         I saw the         grou nd      covered

with bodies.              All    apparently          dead.



Pe o p l e were      walk i n g       around    crying,      screaming,         panicking,          hysterical.



T    remember       notic i n g       that    this    y o u t h had been sick.           I laid        him down

and assisted another                   officer       with m o u t h    to m outh and heart massage.

We     mana g e d    to    pump more          vomit    out   of his      stomach.        We were a s s i s t e d
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          R9S

a short     time     later       by a       civilian who         stated     he was a doctor.             I could

not feel any         pulse       on this youth.               I remember       the    doctor     had

s u s t a i n e d a cut    to his       head as        blood was        running      down his face.



The doctor        a s s i s t e d my s e l f and anot h e r          man who a p p e a r e d    on the

scene.      Apparently           this       second     civilian was also a doctor.



A fter a few m i n u t e s           I felt a weak          pulse apparent           in the youth.         Heart

mass a g e and m o u t h        to m o u t h were        c o n tinued and e v e n t u a l l y    two fire

officers       a p p e a r e d with     oxygen equipment.



Other    supporters            came    to out aid and            it was     decided     that     this y outh

could    possibly         be    saved.           We then    placed      him on one      of the        billboards,

ripped away        from        the    side       of the ground        by the suppo r t e r s      and others,

to be used as a stretcher.



The y o u t h was      laid on the               board a n d we      carried him towards              ambulances

w h i c h were    stationed           in the       passa g e w a y   betw e e n the N o r t h S tand and

S p i o n Kop.



The y outh was        there          left    in the      care    of the     doctors     and a m bulance

staff.      I can d e s cribe           this y outh as about               18---EG years,       white male,.

5*6",    slim,     fair        hair,    light       trousers,        T/Shirt.        I then     returned to

the West S t a n d and a gain a s s i s t e d               colleagues        to evacuate        supporters.



By the time        I returned           I w o u l d say about          a quarter       of the     pitch was

o c c u p i e d by dead        bodies       or    pesons    seriously       injured.



I have    no     idea of any           times       during     this    event    taut whe n      I returned    I

noticed Po l i c e        officers          at   the   back     of the supp o r t e r s        that    remained
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                              R98

inside      the s t a n d i n g a rea      of the West         Stand.       Gaps       began     to appear          and

some     suppo r t e r s    were able          to leave as      they entered            back     through the

tunnel      from L e p p i n g s     Lane.



I recall        shout i n g     to the     supporters,         go back,         look    behind you,           you

can get       out.      But a lot took            no notice         at all.      They        simply     panicked

an d kept       pushing        forward.



One su p p o r t e r was w e d g e d       between      the    floor     inside        the    standing area

and the       track.        His      legs were     trapped      under     the volume           of bodies and

his     torso was        half     out    of the gateway.            'Evenually we got                him out.

All     efforts were           h a m p e r e d due to the      fact    that      the gates were              too

small     in both size and               number.       I saw    some     s upporters          and Police

O f f icers     literally         tearing and kicking at a part                    of this           fence    in

order     to get a female               fan out.      The     fence wire         eventually           became

d e t ached from         its m o u n t i n g    frame and      numerous         fans    clarnmered to get

out.



I never       saw     the   little       lad m e n t i o n e d at    the early          part of this

summary again.              I don't       know whet h e r he         got out or not.                 I was

aproached        by an      officer       later and       informed that           the y o u t h we       took       to

the a m b u l a n c e    had    corns a r o u n d and was       conscious.



1   recall      seeing      a cordon of Police              O f f i c e r s later spread             across    the?

c:e n t,r e o f t h e p i t c h .



Whe n    the area at           the West S t a n d     had e v e n t u a l l y    been    cleared        I noticed

all     kinds    of     personal        property     lying ar o u n d     on the        floor,        shoes,

coats,      scarves,        jumpers       etc.     I remember         being a p p r o a c h e d       by two

s u pporters while             sat   on a wall       near     the West Stand.                T hey    personally
                                                                                                              PAGE   10
                                                                                                              R9S

     bore     no blame      on the      police.



     I recall       other     incidents         involving      hysterical        s u pporters     s c reaming at

     the    other    officers       on the       pitch.        I did not witness          any a s s a u l t s   on

    Police.         I suffered        no    physical       injuries.



     As    I stated     earlier       I do not        recall     particular       times     in relation to

     specific:      events     after       entering      the   ground.



     I recall       returning        wit h Police S e r g e a n t      S w i f t / Police C o n s t a b l e

     Akr'ed    „ Po l i c e C o n s t a b l e   Ho o s o n and Po l i c e Co n s t a b l e Co o p e r   to the

     gym area where we were                 s u p plied w i t h a drink.          From    there we all went

     by transit        van to C l a y w h e e l s     Lane,      I believe we were           then

     transported         to B a r n s l e y D i visional       Headquarters         where    I retired from

     duty at 6.30          p.m.

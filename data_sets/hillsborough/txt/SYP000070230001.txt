                I have         been a Liverpool                    supporter          all        of m y      life       and          I h av e       been    going

                A week         before           the m a t c h ,       I organised            two       seats       with my mate

                We were a l r ea dy         late    because we had t j^ fn          dela y ed by heavy traffic on

                the motorway.

                A P o 1 i cewoman        came    on the      coach wit h he r colleague and a sked me and

                         if we had got           tickets.         I said that I h a d n ’t but that we were

                hoping       to buy two         outside      the    ground.      She    said that that was             okay.

                They were more             concerned about           checking     everyone       for alcohol.

                Ev e r y o n e    except   us on the         coach had tickets.

                We a r r i v e d at S h e f f i el d at       quarter     to 3pm an d were           parked      (1445)      at

                the    top of the hill w it h other                  coaches     off the A61.           The    police w ould

                not    let the driver           drop us off          by the ground and so we had to

                run down          to the ground.

                I shou t e d up if anyone              had a sMfre        ticket and w it h in a couple                of

                minu te s        I had bought       one     o f y a lad who had bought a Notts Fo re st

                ticket      to be w ith his            mates.

                It was a L e ppings Ln terrace ticket                          and 1' paid face value           for    it.

                At this          time tprffre were        still     coaches     full    people arriving.              It was       It

                to 3 pm      (145^).

                There wasr just a mass                 of    people    outside the       entrance 'to the L ep pp in g

                Ln entvof          the ground.         It was chaos,           the road was      just about clear             for

                the    cars       to drive      past   but       there were     thousands       of   people     just w a it in g

                to g e t in stacked up along                  the footpath.            There was       no o r g a n i s a t i o n at

                all    and we just         started mak in g          our way towards           the turnstiles.              I saw

The    crush just         got    greater and greater as                I was       pushed forwards.                 I

was    having       d i f fi c ul t y breathing and         I just         lost my footing            and my        legs

gave w ay and         I went      down to the ground.

The    people       behind me were            pushed forwards          into the gap            1 had     left and

they just        trod on me?           they    c o u l d n ’t help    it,    they were just             being

pushed forwards            from behind.

I couldn't          get   up but       luckily a cfiart grab be d my wrist and just                        pulled

me across       towards         the side       fence   betw ee n      pens 3 and 4 and just                   helped

me up.

I recall       that the         guy that       helped me up off the                floor s aved my          life.

He was a middle a ged whit e m an wit h a m ou s ta c he                           and    a L.F.C tattoo             on

the    left hand side            of his       left arm.     He had a Liverpool                 shirt     on,

short     sleeved and a           pair of jeans and t ra iners                    on.     I h a v e ’nt got a

clue who       he    is but      I would       like A '6 have        the    chance       to thank      him.

He    helped me along            the    fenC'e back to the entrance                     to the tunnel          and

people        lifted me up into the West Stand.

Once    up there I could see the                   full    horror      of    it    and     I just     s t ar t ed

helping       to pull      people       up    into the West Stand.

One    guy    called up to me            to help to        get his         sister       up out of the         pen.

She was        lifted up and           I pulled her        up. She was            totally       limp and

unconscious,          I d o n ’t know         if she was     okay or not            because      she     just

lay on the floor            of the       West Stand        not moving.            She was a b lond haired

girl,    w hi c h was      down to       her    shoulders, she was

about 20 years            old,    and a big        lass,    it took 3 of us to                 lift     her    up she

had a red sweat            shirt       on.

S o me o ne   else    carried her a wa y because               I was        helping       to   pull     kids    up

out    of the       pens as fast as            I could.      I d o n ’t know            if she survived.

                I could see          people      in the       pens who were             o b vi ou sl y dead.     Up against

                the   front       Pence     it was          like a bulldozer             had scooped up the           bodies

               and    piled them up a g ai ns t               the front       fence.

                I saw a lad          lying    on the         pile of bodies w it h his eyes open and                         blood

                running       out of his mouth.                He was    dead.

                All   of the        bodies were         up a ga in st    the front           fence.    I remember          seeing

               P o l i c e Officers         having      to walk       over    the       pile of dead and pos sibly

                dying       bodies    to get        people     out of the          pen.

                I saw one girl            amon gs t     the dead bodies witti her arm held up in the air

               and    crying.         A P o l i c e m a n was     trying      t^f pull       her out.

c j j   -       I remember          seeing 3 lads            trying    tj/" tear open the fence before the game

               was    stop pe d and          a P o l i c e m a n jpd lied them off.               It took about           a minute

                before       the P o l i c e ma n     realised what was a c t u a l l y going on and helped

               the    lads to try and                        the fence       down.

                I was up in the West                  S t an d and at one stage              I just    started feeling

               sick,        I was    crying and         I had just       had enough.              I c o u l d n ’t face anymore

               an d   I made my way down to the                      c ou rtyard at about 4 .30            <1630).

               For    three      quarters        of an hour          I seac he d for my friend                                      ana

               find     him.

                I remember          being    in the         co ur ty ar d and seeing          that    there were          half a

               dozen        officers across            the    end of the tunnel              to the    terraces.           We

               w a n t e d to go through to see                 if                was    there    or on the      pitch       but

               they w ou l dn 't        let us.         T hey were      not very pleasant about                  it   .

               A mid dl e a ge d man          came      running       up and he was           crying.     He said that             he

               had been told that                his    16 year       old son was          dying onthe         pitch a n d he

               w a n t e d to go through              the    tunnel.     They were           quiet abrupt w it h him,               not

               at all        considerate         or    feeling and       pushed him back and w ar n ed him.                         A

               senior        officer      came      up an d told him he was                 not   going   t h ro ug h and

             obviously         intent   on seeing    his son.    He was   going   to try and       push

             t h r o u g h but a man      came   up a nd took him a r o u nd another way.

             We    left     the ground at a q uarter        past 5pm   (1715)   and we   e ve nt u al l y   left

                                                          to the E3emi F i na I he 1 d at                 the Hi 1 1 $ bo r ough

              Football        Ground,       Sheffield.

              We a r r i v e d at      the Leppings        Lane      e nt rance           to the ground a r o u nd         ten

              to three,        (1450)      and found       it m i ll in g with               fans    packed       like

              sardines «

             Whe n we were          in the       crush wit h everyone                trying         to get    into the

              ground,     people were            still    coming        down L ep pi n gs Lane            in their

              thousands.

             M ou n te d Po li ce O ff ic er s          then     came       from the         right and       put a line

             across      the entrance            gates.        I was        g r ad ua ll y    being    pushed over         to

              the     right    towards       the      river.

             Peo pl e were        getting        swayed about           and tread            on and then          I saw one      of
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   G1449A

               the m o un t e d        bobby     lean acr oss       on his    horse      point   to s om eb od y and

               then slap pe d him across                   his    head.

               This     upset         the    crowd and      I thought       this w ou ld    cause trouble an d the

               fans might             pull    him off his         horse.     In the end there was          just a lot

               of shouting and abuse                   d ir ec te d at him.

               There was         then a surge and                I got    pushed   into the      ground by the

               right      hand gats           by the    river.

               I have       been shown a video               recording Ex.         No.           timed   in the

               right      hand top           corner    11-42,      I there    ident if ie d the m o un t e d   officer

               who    clouted the supporter.

Dear Sir

mJISBOSaCOGH INVESEEGKHCK

 I refer to your letter of 24 August 1989 concerning the barriers from
Hillsborough. In view of the upending criminal investigation, I have been
 instructed to retain the broken barrier in its present condition. Samples
 cannot, therefore, be made available to the parties involved in civil action
 and I have been asked to refer all such requests to Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant
thief Constable, West Midlands Police. I will forward a copy of your letter to
Mr Jones.

Barrier 125 and parts of barrier 129 were removed an 7 July 1989 by HSE staff
for possible use in further tests. Hcwever, I have been advised by
Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry, that other parties should not be given
access to test results, nor would it be appropriate for them to witness tests
at this Laboratory.

I suggest that you submit any further requests to Mr Jones or Mr Whalley.

Yours faithfully




P F HEXES

            bad a n d           gradually            I was     m o v e d a(b o ut          and    o v er     towards         the       fence

    betweef\Pens                4 & 5.         When      I got       to    the       fence        I climbed          up a n d          someone

    h e l p e d me                P e n 5.           I then walked              down        out    of      the    gate a nd            o nt o       the

    pitch.




                 went       to    the       feisce at        the     front          of P e n 4 a n d          helped         people          w ho

♦there w e r e       people all           o v er     the    pl a ce .       I s aw a         policewoman              giving

mouth-to-mouth                 to a f a n      j us t at     the       b ac k    of    the       goal.        After      a while?

she    stopped and              put a b l a n k e t        over    him.           I knew          then    that        people     had

d ie d .     I w as       walking       around         in a d a z e .           I was       trying       to    s ee     if    I could

•find a n y       of m y m a t e s .          I s aw    some      of    them      on the          terraces         between       the

West       Stand and           the N o r t h S t a n d .       I wandered around                    for a bit            and    then

at about          4pm     <1600),       after        an announcement                  saying       to    keep your

tickets,          I left        the     ground       and walked           back        to    the J 3 t a t i o n    by m y s e l f .

I met       all    my mates           b a ck at      the S t a t                      ha d m i n o r     bruising            to my

c he s t,    but     I did        not    go    to    the    doct




Whilst       in the        ground        I d id      not    see    anything            1 consider             to   be a

c r im i n a 1 o f f e n c e .




While       I wa s      on t he       fence     helping        people           out    of P e n 4,        I was         told    by

t he P o l i c e     to    get     d o w n ar                                    it,       but    there       was a      lot    of

police       officers           just     star                                   g nothing.




There       seemed        to    be a     lot    of     police      officers            about       outside         the       ground

early       o n , but      when       I saw     pictures          on the         television about                  the       crush

outside,          I could         not    see m a n y P o l i c e        about         then.




I think       t h at L i v e r p o o 1 s h o u l d         have    been         given       the H o p e n d        of    the

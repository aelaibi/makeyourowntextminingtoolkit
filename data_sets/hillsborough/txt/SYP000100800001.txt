               From       around            1-30       pm    radio          communications                  had       been    very         bad,      the

               sound         becoming             wobbly          and       distorted.                However,          I cannot            remember

               any      radio          message           being         passed        from        the     Control         Room        from       around

               3-08 p m .

               Liverpool               supporters              began          to    run     down        towards         us     and       break       up

                advertising                 hoardings.                 I began         to      assist         them       in    this.         I then

                helped          to     carry        an       advertising             hoarding            up      to    the     Leppzngs           L ane      end

                and      was       helped          by    a Liverpool                supporter            to      bring        it    over        towards

                the      Control             Room.

                Three         or      four        Liverpool            f ans       loaded        up     a b ody         onto       the     hoarding

                saying,            "TAKE          HIM    OUT      OF     HERE,        HE'S        DEA D " .        Myself          and     maybe          4 or       5

                Liverpool               f ans      ran       with       the    hoarding               towards          the    exit        between          the

                North         Stand          and       the     Kop.         The     exit         was    very       crowded          with        support*?!;

                 and     hoardings                and       injured         and     dead         people.           I    lost       tny g r i p       01    tna

                hoarding               as    it    disappeared                towards            the    gymnasium.                 I was        knocked

                 one      side         and    eventually                returned            to    gate      2 and        the       South        blanti.

                 in     the      South        Stand.              Many      Nottingham                Forest       supporters              were       stl'I

                 the      Forest            end    of       the    ground,           obviously              upset       and     trying          to    pick

                 fights.               Many       of     these      Liverpool               fans       were       drun k .          I could          s se.i

                 and       things           were        becoming            organised-                The     ground          started        to      empty

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


We spoke about the submission from the Football Association and
Football League to Lord Justice Taylor and in particular on their
plea for adjustment to the pool betting tax so that it generates
more money for football.  I attach extracts from the submission
from the FA and FL (paragraphs 5.21 to 5.26). It would be very
helpful, as you suggest, to have a discussion with you and Mr
Honour about this before the FA and FL come in to see Lord
Justice Taylor on 21 November.   It may be that, having heard what
they have to say, he would like a discussion with you himself
about it thereafter. Certainly, if he feels that the football
authorities have a case, I know that he will want to ask the
Treasury for their views direct.   I am copying this note, and the
accompanying papers, to Neil Kinghan in the Sport and Recreation
Division of the DOE (who is briefing us on points as Lord Justice
Taylor considers them) with the invitation to him either to
comment- or to join us if we have a discussion here, on the basis
of which I can brief Lord Justice Taylor.

    5. 20. This nucleus of all-seater stadia would also provide a
    pool from which The FA could draw the venues for FA Cup
I   Semi-Finals.

    Finance

     5. 21. The Football Association has already made a direct
     investment in the installation of seating and the general
     improvement of facilities at Wembley Stadium.  It has made a
    ^diregt payme.at—QJEEX.1Q0,000. The Football Association and The
     Football League have made further contributions to the increase
     in the proportion of seating at the stadium by foregoing
     revenue from the new seating in respect of matches under the
     control of both bodies played at the stadium.  The provision of
    a nucleus of all-seater stadia; the requirement by law for all
    grounds to have a minimum percentage of seats; the need to
    encourage clubs to build new grounds (see paragraph 9. 6. ,
    below), all will require a massive further injection of cash.
    We understand that it will be expected of us that we make every
    attempt to find this revenue from our own resources.
I
    Sponsorship

    5. 22. Sponsorship is one obvious area in which we can seek
    extra revenue.  The game as a whole depends for its survival on
    the £17,500,000 per year it currently receives from sponsors.
    The FA's aim will be to supplement this with an acceptable
    sponsorship of its most valuable commodity, the FA Cup
    competition. The Football Association has already set in
    motion a search for a sponsor, with a proposal that offers the
    prospective company a unique opportunity to be identified not
    only with a competition of world standing, but also with an
    initiative that can result in the World Cup's coming to England
    in the not-too-distant future.  The sponsor will be invited to
    pay an annual sum as is usual in such agreements.  He will also
    be asked to provide a lump-sum figure of substantial
    proportions in the form of an interest-free loan.  This sum
    would form the basis of a fund to assist clubs with the
    installation of seating and the improvement of facilities.

    The Football Trust and The Football Grounds Improvement Trust

    5. 23. The Football Trust is funded by a donation by the three
    major pools companies (Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters) from




                                 -17-
the Spotting-The-Ball Competition, at the rate of 21% of
turnover, i.e. over £9,000, 000 a year.  The Trustees are
empowered to use their funds to promote measures for the
control or suppression of hooliganism; to assist clubs to meet
obligations under the 1975 Act; to improve ground facilities;
and for any other purpose beneficial to football.   The Football
Trust allocates just over half its income to The Football
Grounds Improvement Trust for the purpose of assisting
expenditure by Football League clubs on ground safety and
improvements.   An explanation of the role of these bodies is
appended.   (Annex H)

5. 24. As we have indicated above, (paragraph 5. 14. ), there are
benefits to be gained by the clubs if the recommended levels of
seating are made mandatory by making them a condition of the
issue of a Safety Certificate.  Under its Trust Deed, The
Football Grounds Improvement Trust is able to make grants of up
to 75% of the total cost available to clubs carrying out work
as a necessary condition of their being given a Safety
Certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

Reduction in Pool Betting Tax

5. 25. Given our willingness to seek from our own and other
existing resources a substantial part of the finances necessary
to implement the changes and improvements we have identified,
we believe that there is a strong case for the Government to
make a contribution by reducing the tax on football pool
betting from its current level of 42.5%. At present, the tax
yields around £280,000,000 per year.     There is an agreement
between the Pool Promoters Association and The Football League
by which 2/5ths of any money saved by them as a result of a
reduction in the pool betting tax would go to The Football
League for ground improvements.    Another 2/5ths would go to
help other sports and the remaining l/5th would be devoted to
the campaign to bring the 1996 Olympic Games to Britain.      The
Government would assist football greatly by making a relatively
small proportion of the the tax levied on pool betting
available to the game to assist in effecting the improvements
we have discussed.    A reduction to 40%. would, for example,
yield some £16, 000, 000. This could Tae passed on to football in
one of two ways.   The Government could continue to tax pool
betting at the current level, but make a donation to football
equivalent to 2. 5% of taxable turnover, or it could reduce the




                                -18-
tax rate to 40% on the strict understanding that the agreement
referred to above were amended to allow football to derive the
entire benefit from the money thus saved by the pools
companies.

 At present, football derives no benefit whatsoever from the
 £280, 000,000 or so each year that the Government takes in pool
 betting tax.   The contrast with horse racing is stark.
 Football pools are taxed at 42. 5%. There is no tax on
 on-course horse race betting. The tax on off-course gambling
 is 8%.   There is, however, by statutory instrument, a levy on
 off-cpurse betting separate from the tax. The Home Secretary
 laid down the present Horserace Betting Levy Scheme on the 1st
 April, 1989.   Under the scheme, the levy is set at 0. 86% of
 turnover,   At today's betting levels, this levy will yield
'approximately £34, 500. 000 per year. . The football industry is,
 therefore, at a disadvantage to horse racing on two counts.
 First, the tax on football pool betting is so high that the
 pool promoters are limited in the amount they can realistically
 make available to football in the form of the payment of
 royalties for the use of football fixtures.      The royalty paid
 at the moment is around 2.35% of after-tax revenue, which
 yields about £5, 000, 000 per year. A lower level of tax would
 undoubtedly enable football and the pools to agree upon a
 higher royalty percentage.      Second, a levy is made on horse
 race betting, over and above the tax, specifically for the
purpose of promoting the industry that creates the public
 interest that, in turn, produces the betting tax revenue for
'tne government.   Football receives nothing, despite the fact
 that it fulfils pre'cis~ely~~€Iie same function.

The Chester Report of 1968 recommended the establishment j>f a
Football Levy at the rate of 1% of the pools' comparueiT'taxable
           A minority report recommended 2%^     The Rothschild
Commission on gambling recommended in 1977 a reduction in the
pool betting tax frolrrtilie tnen level of 40% to 37%, also for
the purpose of establishing a Levy Board.     We, however, are not
proposing the creation of a Football Levy Board.     We believe
that The Football Trust/Football Grounds Improvement Trust
already act as a suitable vehicle with proven track record and
would be the ideal recipient of any money given to the game
from a reduction in the pool betting tax or from any other
source prepared to provide grants or interest-free loans.

Capital Allowances

5. 26.  Much criticism is levelled at footba^rfor what is seen
by many as wasteful spending on transfer fees.   This criticism
ignores the basic fact that transfer fees are a "circulating
fund" that enables smaller clubs to derive much needed income
by investing in young players and realising the investment by
selling on the asset to one of the bigger clubs.   For example,
in the summer of 1988 Tottenham Hotspur bought Paul Stewart
from Manchester City for £1,700,000.   Manchester City then
purchased Brian Gayle from Wimbledon for £325, 000, Andy Dibble
from Luton Town for £250,000 and David Oldfield from the same
club for £650, 000.  Luton and Wimbledon then went on to buy
other players for smaller sums, and so on. All of the transfer
fees added together might make ten times the original figure of
£1. 7 million.

The success of a club on the field of play is the major
consideration for most supporters.      A team that is winning
attracts more spectators than when it is not performing so
well.     The attendance figures quoted above for Glasgow Rangers
matches (paragraph 5.5.) indicate what can be achieved when a
      "I-8 PlaYi*»g well and at the same time gives its public good
facilities.     Glasgow Rangers have invested as heavily as any
club in the transfer market in recent times.      Clubs must,
therefore, look to their playing strength as well as to the
comfort and safety of their grounds.      No club shies away from
expenditure on essential safety work.      Each club does, however,
have to decide for itself the appropriate balance between its
spending on players and on the improvement of facilities.      The
present system gives strong fiscal inducements to clubs to
spend on players rather than on improvements.      Capital
allowances are usually unavailable to clubs for ground
improvements.      The case of Brown (Inspector of Taxes) v Burnley
FC (1980) STC. 424 (Annex I) established that expenditure on a
new stand to replace an old one did not qualify as a repair.
n5£__did it qualify"Ter‘plant and- machinery- allowances.   Safety
W01* J-f3 only allowable l T i t is~carried out as~a condition of
th^.Assue of a Safety Certificate.      Transfer fees, on the other
hand, are treated as revenue expenditure.      The Government would
automatically stimulat&grea€^"expehditure on improved
facilities if it were to give capital allowances for all such
projects.

        The essential history, character and purposes of the horserace betting levy and
        the Levy Board were sumnarised in the 1978 report of the Rothschild Royal
        Lanmission on Gambling. A copy of the relevant extract, paras 9.12-9.21 (vP
        also 9.7 to 9.11), is attached at A.

(v) The bookmakers have been at pains to argue that the levy should not in
practice beccme indistinguishable frcm an hypothecated tax. They have
stressed, therefore, both the principle of agreement betwsen the Board and
themselves as to any levy scheme, and that the target for any scheme should be
a cash sum calculated to achieve specific purposes (and value for money), not a
fixed percentage of turnover. The Hone Secretary endorsed both of these points
in his determination of the 28th scheme.

 (vi) The statutory purposes of the Levy Board are to assess and collect the
levy and to distribute it for: (a) the improvement of breeds of horses; (b) the
advancement or encouragement of veterinary science and education; and (c) the
improvement of horseracing. The Hone Secretary does not attempt to influence
the Board in its decisions on policy matters which fall within its cmti remit.
It is important to understand that in determining the distribution of the levy
th^Soard acts as a whole, ie. including the Chairman of the Bookmakers'
cdHLttee. In recent years, expenditure and investment have increasingly been
explicitly geared to producing racing attractive to the off-course punter, in
the commercial interests of both the bookmakers and, via the levy, of racing.
This includes the programming of racing, which is .controlled by the Jockey
Club - which is represented on the Levy Board.

 (vii) The Levy Board's sources of incane and heads of expenditure for the last
financial year and since the Board was established in 1961 are shewn in
Appendix 4 to the Board's latest annual report. A copy of the appendix is
attached at B. This helps to illustrate hew the levy relates to the
racecourse, horserace training and breeding industries (particulary because of
prize money - nearly £14 million in 1988/89, sane 39% of expenditure in that
year) and also to the administration and integrity of raring.

                     sport o f horscracing” and if so, how the m oney should be raised. The Committee

  of m o n e y
                     more money for racing today. It said that breeders could not afford to compete

 kcrs h av e            9.14 The support o f the bookmakers for the levy requires a little more
        b e in g     explanation. There were two main reasons. The first was that many bookmakers,
•i ;h c m t o        as a matter o f self-interest, considered that they should make a contribution to
;: a moral           racing. In 1958 they had set up a Racecourse Amenities Fund C om m itice which
 li<; c o n s e -    had in 1959 raised £60,000 by w ay o f voluntary contributions from ofT-course
                 o   bookmakers and distributed the money to racecourses. But m an^ bookmakers
                     did not p;iy. The majority thought that all bookmakers should have to pay their
                     fair shares and this could be achieved only by a com pulsory levy. The second
 iliail*
        *.■ ;
                     reason was perhaps more compelling. T he background to the deliberations o f
  ■hhIsJ1.k          the Peppiait Comm ittee was the passage through Parliament o f the Betting and
  f foreign          Gam ing Hill to legalise betting offices. T he Government were promoting the Bill
;mi; d u ty ,        on social grou n d s: to rid the streets o f illegal betting. The bookm akers wanted to
 ru.iiire to         be legalised. The racing industry believed that the establishment o f betting offices
                     would reduce attendances at race meetings. It was prepared'to support the Bill
                     on condition that racing got a share o f the proceeds o f olT-course betting. There

           changes in the structure o f the bookm aking industry: in particular, the rise o f
           the large bookm aking com panies and the establishment o f the Betting Office
           Licensees’ Association (BO L A ) to represent their interests. A s a result o f these

          ! 9.17 The levy is collected in accordance with the provisions o f annual
         / schemes made by the Levy Board. Each scheme takes effect for a year starting on                                               nui
            1 April. Bookmakers are required to be divided into categories and the amount
           which they pay is determined according to the category into which they fall. The                                                        J
         j general cITcct is that small bookmakers pay at a lower rate than big ones. The
'v J I     procedure is that the Bookmakers’ Committee recommends a scheme to the Levy
           Board. If the scheme is acceptable to the Board, or the Board and Comm ittee can
                                                                                                                                          'H.l

           and Committee arc unable to agree, the matter has to be referred to arbitration.                                               ■f.‘
           Under the original Act, the three independent members o f the Board acted as
           arbitrators but in 1969 this function was transferred to the H om e Secretary.
           There have been 17 schemes since the Levy Board w as created. N in e have been
           agreed, five imposed by the independent members and three determined by the
           H om e Secretary.

             9.18       The Peppiatt Comm ittee recommended that the basis o f assessment
          should be the net profits o f the bookmakers. The Betting Levy A ct 1961 there­
          fore required that the independent members, if required to arbitrate on the
          amount o f the levy to be raised by a scheme, should consider and com pare the
          extent o f the need for m oney and the capacity o f the bookm akers to pay. In the
          first six schemes the basis o f assessment was the number o f licensed betting offices
          which the bookm aker owned, or his net profits, or both. In 1968, however, turn­
          over (ic the amount o f m oney staked) was introduced as a criterion o f assessment
          supplementary to net profits and since 1974 it has been the sole basis o f assess­
          ment. The result has been a radical transformation in the nature o f the levy.
          Instead o f being a payment by the bookmakers out o f their profits, it is now
          normally a payment by the punters1 charged upon stakes and collected by the

INTRODUCTION

The speakers    so far today have established beyond doubt, if anybody had
doubt, that exposure to traumatic events can, and often does, have
significant affect on people.     Anybody can be involved in or witness a
traumatic event in their lifetime but those people who are employed in the
emergency services are, by the very nature of their jobs, much more likely to
experience a    major trauma or, at the very least, fairly frequent minor
traumas.      As employers, managers, and supervisors of people in the
emergency services all of us attending this conference have a responsibility
to both recognise the reality of the impact of trauma on the people in our
charge and to ensure adequate arrangements are made for their support.      We
have already    learned much today about the support that has been made
available following large scale events and also, in some cases, to individuals
who have suffered from repeated exposure to relatively small scale incidents
- for the person affected the size of the event is irrelevant - what is
important is the available support.

Equally the susceptibility to suffer from the negative affects of exposure
to trauma can often depend upon the psychological and physical preparedness
of a person. To some extent the state of preparedness can be influenced by
the climate of the environment in which he/she works.        An organization
which provides support, communicates trust, undertakes appropriate training,
and encourages open discussion of personal trauma problems establishes an
environment in which the individual will be better prepared to cope with the
incident and the following reactions.


BACKGROUND

Some eight years ago the Association of Chief Police Officers were
approached by the Police Staff Associations with a request that the subject
of stress within the Police Service be examined with a view to identifying
its causes and effects, and, where appropriate, to decide on remedial action.

This request was the culmination of growing concern felt during recent years
by the representative bodies within the Service over the whole question of
occupational stress and its possible link with the health and effective
performance of serving officers.

In response A.C.P.O. formed a Joint Working Group,chaired by a Chief Constable
(now Mr Brian Johnson, the Chief Constable of Lancashire), with other Chief
Officers, representatives of the Staff Associations, and other persons who
could make a valuable contribution.

The first action of this Working group was to organize research across the
country involving a range of eminent experts; for example: Harold Bridger,
Tavistock Institute; Professor Cary Cooper, Manchester University; Dr.
Northage de V. Mather, Consultant Psychiatrist.  Guided by these and other
experts a wide range of police officers of all ranks and functions
participated in a series of informal workshops where ideas and experiences
could be freely exchanged.

to Issues of Stress and Trauma.


The resulting wealth of information was analysed, organized and documented
into thirty-three specific recommendations for action by the police service
I will discuss a number of these recommendations and outline the steps taken
to meet them.

Before I look at     thespecific recommendations Ithink it is important to
quote two brief paragraphs from the final report of this initial research;
paragraphs which,     atthe time of their publication in 1983, came as
something of a shock to the police service.

The first paragraph was a shock because it states clearly that stress is not
a simple problem    with a simple solution, as was generally  believed in the
early eighties:

      "The e f f e c t s o f s t r e s s may be m a n ife s te d In a va r i e t y o f di f f e r e n t ways
      and th e n a tu r e o f th e p r o c e s s is su ch th a t s t r e s s f u l p ro b le m s may be
      c o n s id e r e d from a num ber o f d i f f e r e n t p r a c tic a l p o i n t s o f view.

The second paragraph was a shock to the police service because it dismissed
a common belief that stress was a problem for medical practitioners to solve
and raised the uncomfortable spectre that both the causes and solutions lay
much closer to home.

      " S tr e s s I s n o t s im p ly a m e d ic a l problem .    S t r e s s f u l p ro b lem s may a r is e
      from th e I n te r a c tio n o f f a c t o r s I n te r n a l and e x te r n a l to b o th th e
      In d iv id u a l and th e o r g a n iz a tio n ."


TIE FINDINGS

The issues identified by the various workshops which may give rise to the
impairment of the efficiency of the organization and its individuals were
grouped into four categories:

                               MANAGEMENT STYLE
                               MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
                               MANAGEMENT SUPPORT (INFRA STRUCTURE)
                               TRAUMATIC INCIDENTS

These categories are not mutually exclusive and there                                   is   some   overlap
because of the inter-dependence of the factors involved.

1. MANAGEMENT STYLE

" T here I s m ore s t r e s s I n s id e th e n ic k than o u t s i d e on th e s t r e e t s "

Management style is the manner in which managers and supervisors control
others and is influenced by attitudes, behaviour, personality and the climate
of the organization.

to Issues of Stress and Trauma.


Poor management styles were identified as producing more widespread and
long-term stresses in police officers than did thalr operational tasks.   Thsi
pressures of police work together with inadequate training and fear of
making mistakes foster a negative and fault-finding management style.    Even
the most senior ranks fear criticism and often seek a scapegoat.    Excessive
attention to minutia may suffocate innovative ability and make people
reluctant to exercise discretion in a rapidly changing society.

The aspects of poor management highlighted by the workshops as specifically
affecting the performance and health of officers were:

            Unjust criticism/scapegoating
            Lack of counselling skills
            Unrealistic expectations
            Attitude to 'PC' rank
            Lack of concern for the individual
            Lack of communication
            Excessive autocracy/lack of consultation

A total of nine specific recommendations were made to address the issues of
management style.     I will deal briefly with three of them and give some
indication of what has been achieved.

There are no National rules regarding selection for specialist posts and
promotion,  beyond  certain minimum   technical qualifications,   so  these
recommendations were addressed to Chief Constables for consideration within
their own forces.

Matching people to posts and ranks is a problem common to all employers.
There are no simple solutions and foolproof methods.    Nonetheless it is
important to get the selection process as accurate as possible or we will
have too many square pegs in round holes - which is neither good for the
organization or the square peg.

No radical changes have been made in general selection methods; some forces
are flirting with psychometric testing (personality and ability tests) and
some with assessment centres;     but basically the traditional criteria of
appropriate/sufficient experience dominates.     In a few very specialised
areas such as selection to become an authorised firearms officer much more
care is taken.

A related recommendation states:

    B e fo r e p ro m otion to each ra n k th e r e s h o u ld be tr a in in g in management
    s k i l l s , which s h o u ld be r e la t e d to th e s o c ia l s k i l l s tr a in in g c u r r e n tly
    b e in g d e v e lo p e d f o r c o n s ta b le s .

This recommendation has not been implemented.   Most promoted officers will
receive some formal training in the first year of their new rank but ure
essentially expected   to learn supervisory    and management     skills by
experience - thrown in at the deep end.  Therefore it is inevitable that the
prevailing management style will be perpetuated because newly promoted
officers have little alternative but to copy the styles of their more
experienced peers.

The perpetuation of poor management styles is, of course, not just a problem
within the organization; as one American study of the police concluded:
    "The sam e a u to c r a tic , im p e rso n a l le a d e r b e h a v io u r s which a re d is p la y e d
    w ith in       th e   o r g a n iz a tio n may s e r v e  a s m o d els       fo r p o lic e -c ltl^ e n
    e n c o u n te r s ."
Thus police       management        styles      might      have     an    effect      on    police-public
relations.

I don't think the police service can take much credit for the contradiction
that we do not permit an officer to take charge of a police vehicle until he
has undergone extensive training and reached a high standard but we do
permit an officer to take charge of other people with no training at all.
Its     not  surprising   therefore that  the new  supervisor and his/her
subordinates are, from time to time, strained,

A fairly simple organizational change to include training and assessment
together for promotion candidates seems the obvious solution; perhaps this
will come in the future.

Within the same group of issues about Management Style is the persisting
problem of the 'status of the uniformed constable within the organization'.
The evidence is that constables are, on the one hand, held with rhetorical
esteem to be the backbone of the police force, on the other, constables
themselves feel under valued by their bosses.

As one observer put it:
    "O u tsid e th e o r g a n iz a tio n h e I s c o n s ta n tly m aking on th e s p o t d e c is io n s ,
    c a r r ie s a weapon and I s c a p a b le o f pow er o v e r l i f e and d eath;                  w ith in

    who I s n o t e ven p e r m itte d to d e c id e on h i s own u n ifo rm to w ear when th e
    w e a th e r c h a n g e s.”

The working groups recommended:

      More w ays s h o u ld be s o u g h t to r e c o g n is e and re w a rd th e work o f p o lic e
    cons ta b le s .

To some extent the national regulations and conditions of service prevent
the imaginative use of organizational rewards which would distinguish the
•good’ constable from the •bad’. Notions such as a rank of ’Senior Constable’
have been considered but rejected.    However current consideration is being
given to a new discipline offence of ’inefficiency* in an attempt to break
the security of tenure now provided by the regulations.

This option reverses the the recommendation to find ways to recognise and
reward the good work of constables to one of identifying and sanctioning the
bad workers.   This can only encourage a management style which sustains a
negative view of the value of constables.

2. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

In many ways the issues grouped under this heading are similar to those
under the heading of Management Style.     Management systems are defined as
the framework of processes and procedures which should enable the police
force to provide an effective service to the public in a changing society.

The overall problem identified in the research was that: Pressures stem from
a system that injects unrealistic expectations into the officers and
perpetuates those expectations through a series of appraisals and select Lon
boards In a way that lacks openness and an honesty of purpose.

Eleven recommendations were made under                         this heading, I will br iefly dl^c-U.^s
only three.

    A d v e r tis e m e n ts fo r r e c r u i t s s h o u ld d e s c r ib e th e r e a l Job and n o t In clu d e
    u n r e a l i s t i c g e n e r a l p ro m ise s.

Tills recommendation has received attention by the Home office depar tment
which funds recruiting advertisements.   There has been a clear shift away
from portraying an image of policework as glamourous and exciting, and
providing relatively easy specialisation and promotion opportunities.    The
new image is more realistic and points to the sometimes difficult, sometimes
tedious nature of police work.

Obviously there is a limit on how honest recruitment advertisements can                                       be
is we still wish to attract people.

Once recruited it is recommended that the form and style of training should
better prepare officers for the realities of police work rather than
emphasise legal knowledge.    Much attention has been given to probationary
training and a whole new approach has been adopted for 1989.

Under a sub-heading on Career Development the working group noted:

    The a p p r a is a l s y s te m d o e s n o t appear c r e d ib le to many o f f i c e r s , and many
    a s p e c ts w ere c r it ic i s e d .

The main recommendation on this issue is a long one but worthy of quoting
in full:

    The a p p r a is a l and p ro m o tio n board s y s te m s h o u ld be r e v ie w e d and
    s ta n d a r d is e d th ro u g h o u t th e S e r v ic e , p a y in g p a r ti c u la r a t t e n t i o n to

A number of Forces have made some Improvements to their- appraisal and
promotion board procedures but, interestingly, little has been done to train
appraising officers and the inclusion of an outside expert has been ignored
by all but one force.

3. MANAGEMENT SUPPORT (INFRA STRUCTURE)

The function of a constable requires a diversity of roles which will often
conflict when attempting to reconcile responsibilities and relationships with
the law, society and domestic life.      While the practical functions have
largely remained the same over the years since 1829 (the formation of the
Metropolitan Police for London), the nature and complexity of the roles have
changed considerably.

Management support is the support offered to the individual and organization
in the following areas:

           Health
           Welfare
           Education
           Counselling
           Role Conflicts
           Service demands on individual officer and family.

The level of Management Support provided will determine the organizational
climate in which the individual police officer can truly feel involved and be
a committed member of the force.     The force must be seen to be equally
committed to the officer's well-being in its policies and by a system of
genuine consultation.

Management Support should produce the kind of climate which will take into
account the operational, personal and professional aspects of the police
service.

Three of the recommendations made are relevant to today's discussion:

There has been considerable growth in welfare provision within many forces.
Probably Merseyside and the Metropolitan Police are setting the lead with
full time divisional welfare     officers  in addition to the standard
headquarters welfare department.   Occupational health is centre stage this
year with Guidelines on Occupational Health Units being circulated to all
Chief Constables.

These issues continue to cause concern in many forces;        there are many
variations in policies relating to transfers involving house moves, work
systems and how forces respond to certain domestic circumstances.

Guidelines on the arrangements for confidential counselling were published by
the Joint Working Group to all Chief Officers in 1987 and most forces now
have facilities for this service.

Overall management support has improved markedly in the last few years and
progress continues to be made.   It should be said that the main motivating
force behind the new facilities being introduced is the escalating rate of
sickness absence and ill-health retirement.        Nonetheless forces are
increasingly able to claim a genuine concern for the health and welfare of
their officers.

4. TRAUMATIC INCIDENTS

Exposure to traumatic incidents was identified by this research as a major
source of acute stress.     Such incidents are, by definition unpleasant and
disturbing, and challenge the individual’s adjustive capacities posing a
significant threat to their psychological and physical well-being.

Three major types of traumatic incident were identified;   criminal violence
and abuse, involving both the officer and others;   accident and mutilation,
for example, road traffic accident or suicide casualties;   and public order
situations, for example riots.

There are several points of concern. First, there is the question of the new
recruits’ inevitable first encounter with traumatic incidents, their reactions,
and the cost of those reactions.     Second, with repeated encounters officers
learn to cope with such incidents, and to defend themselves against their
impact.    That learning may have a hidden cost , (e.g. insensitivity), and the
person's coping strategies may not be totally effective.


                                                      -7-
The Police Organizational Response                                                   Supt. Barry Sanderson
to Issues of Stress and Trauma.

For some officers, and on some occasions there will be a significant and
detectable effect of traumatic incidents.        The immediate emotional and
behavioural response to the situation may impair the officer's performance.
In conflict situations this may aggravate the problem.     However, affects on
officers may only become obvious later when they are unprotected by the
distraction of other tasks, and more vulnerable through fatigue.    Effects of
traumatic Incidents may become obvious during 'winding down' periods;     they
may be exposed In many different ways.      The duration of these effects may
vary considerably from Individual to individual, and it is not easy to predict
how long they will last.

Several processes appear to contribute to these problems.      First, officers
may identify with those involved in the incident, or be directly involved
themselves, and thus be vulnerable.     Second, they may become involved with
the victim of the trauma, and feel for them, and be frustrated by the

then feel 'helpless', and this may partly reflect unrealistic expectations of
their powers of intervention.        Finally, officers may not be properly
prepared for and supported In these stressful duties.

Five specific recommendations were made and it is worth discussing each.

Little has been done to refine selection methods with a view to identifying
the ability to cope with stressful situations - this is because we know of
no way of assessing this potential.   Whilst we could place candidates under
stress and observe their reactions this would probably be unethical and be
unacceptable to recruits, the public and the police.      Until methods are
developed which directly or indirectly test an individuals potential ability
to cope with stressful situations we will have to rely on the subjective
judgement of those who assess candidates.

Selection of authorised firearms officers has been refined considerably in
recent years and much care is taken at selection, training and operational
Incidents to screen out individuals who show signs of low tolerance to
stress.     Even so we still rely mainly on the judgement of experienced
officers to make these observations.

As I outlined earlier the training of recruits has been revised and this
point is covered In both the classroom and on the streets.

to Issues of Stress and Trauma.

Courses on the management of stress (for self and others) are now available
in many forces and in some special provision for extra training has been
made.     For example; in Lancashire following a policy decision that the
officer dealing with a fatal R.T.A. should provide continuing support for the
bereaved family, a number of officers reported they were experiencing some
difficulty with this responsibility - both in their own ability to avoid too
close an involvement and in the technical skills required to 'say the right
things’.    The Force Welfare Officer, skilled and experienced in bereavement
counselling, arranged a series of short courses for officers to provide some
help with their coping strategies.    It was particularly encouraging that the
officers felt able to openly discuss this issue with management - only a few
years ago such a need for help would have remained hidden.

Arrangements are automatically made now for officers when the incidents are
of a very large scale - Bradford Fire, Manchester Aircraft Fire, Lockerbie.
But, whilst we can confidently say that many more supervisors are aware of
and are prepared to accept the reality of post trauma reactions in officers,
more progress needs to be made in this area.         An apparently everyday
event can cause considerable distress to a single officer but because it is
relatively small scale and, perhaps, one of a number of events that day, it
is easily missed and the officer concerned may be left to recover without
appropriate support.    (The catalogue of examples reported by counsellors is
evidence of the fact that we often fail to identify officers reactions.)

This recommendation identified the point made above and whilst we have
begun to action this recommendation it is recognised that a continuous
effort is required to ensure the issues are in the forefront of the minds of
supervisors.


CONCLUSION

The central message of this paper is that there is no 'quick fix' to the
issues of stress and trauma.          Specific actions immediately following
Involvement in a traumatic incident can do much to ameliorate the negative
consequences that can and do accrue.     However, the police service, following
a number of years consideration of the wider implications, have concluded
that a supportive and caring working environment is essential to preparing
officers for the times when they will, by the very nature of their work, be
exposed stress and trauma in all its forms,       A healthy organization which
cares for its main resource - people - can do much to create a physically
healthy and psychologically strong workforce;      basic conditions for coping
with the extraordinary demands made on police officers.          The employing
organization has significant responsibilities to fulfil.

The Police Organizational Response                     Supt. Barry Sanderson
to Issues of Stress and Trauma.


Overall the police service response to the recommendations made in 1983 is
like the curates egg; good       parts.   Considerable efforts have been made
within most Forces to establish adequate arrangements for counselling and
welfare support.    These arrangements are aimed at dealing with the negative
consequences of internally and externally generated stress and trauma.
Most officers now have a variety of avenues open to them to seek help and
we are convinced       (although it very difficult to measure) that the
psychological welfare of police officers is catered for better than ever
before.    Nonetheless we cannot be complacent.       Some of the fundamental
causes of stress identified by the early research have not received
significant attention.    These causes are mainly internal to the organization
of policing and centre around policy decisions which effect the personal
lives of officers: managerial styles, work systems and attitudes towards the
uniformed constable.

What as been achieved was commonly accepted as necessary and relatively
easily accommodated without significant change in traditional organizational
practices.  What remains to be done has less common agreement and actually
confronts tradition, so will take considerable time and effort to overcome.

However, much has been achieved in recent years since the issues of stress
and trauma came out of the closet.       Progress will continue, understanding
will develop, difficulties will be overcome, because the issues are important.

            3.    Hillsborough Disaster

                  Trade union reoresentatives met with Neil Kay and John Pilling
                  to discuss the Department's involvement in the Hillsborough
                  Disaster.   Several issues were covered:
                  a)   Neil Kay made it clear that he was extremely impressed
                       by the response of Departmental staff to the disaster;
                  b)   The meeting agreed that some of the Press coverage of
                       the disaster was appalling; it is hoped that a joint trade
                       union/management submission may be made about this to the
                       Press Council;
                  c)   Neil Kay explained the Department's plans to make counselling
                       available to Departmental staff involved in the disaster;
                       Newsheet 236 explains how staff can avail themselves of this
                       assistance;
                  d)   Various practical arrangements were confirmed; Departmental
                       staff have authorisation to claim car allowances for journeys
                       to attend funerals; any requests for financial assistance for
                       work with Departmental clients involved in the disaster should
                       be directed to the Disaster Task Team; staff involved in the
                       disaster have authorisation to take time off work, both in
                       respect of the hours they worked, and in order to recover from
                       their experiences etc;
                 e)    Neil Kay acknowledged that some normal work of the Department
                       will not have been done as a conseauence of the disaster; this
                       will be discussed further with trade union representatives this
                       week;
                 f)    Neil Kay indicated that he will personally conduct a review of
                       the Department's involvement in the disaster.   He welcomed the
                       trade unions' offer of assistance with this review, and agreed
                       to discuss the manner in which it will be undertaken with trade
                       union representatives later this week.
                  I will keep NALGO members informed of progress with these issues.
                  Should anyone have any particular concern arising from the Hillsoorougn
                  Disaster which you wish to be communicated to senior management, please
                  contact me.
                 You may also wish to know that the NALGO Branch has agreed to make a
                 £1,000 donation to the Disaster Appeal.

 sexual interest

 FAMILY AND SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS
New friendships and group bonds m a y com e into being. O n the o th e r hand,
strains in relationships m ay a p p ear. T h e good feelings in giving and receiving
m ay be replaced by conflict. You m ay feel that too little o r the wrong thin gs are
o ffeied . or that you cannot give as m uch as is expected. Accidents a re m ore
frequent alter severe stresses. Alcohol and drug intake m ay increase d u e to the
extra tensions.

THE FOLLOWING MAKE THE EVENTS AND THE FEELINGS

                        d ream , som ething that h as not really h appened. P e o p le

                        from the help you n e e d for yourself.
REALITY            —    Confronting the reality, e.g. attending funerals, inspecting

 COPING WITH A MAJOR PERSONAL CRISIS

Somebody yo u k n o w may have died or been injured on the 11 May. You may
have been at the m a tc h or   heard it on the radio, or seen it on
television.

T hough what yo u have e x p e r i e nc e d is a unique and personal e v e n t , this
pamphlet will help you to kn ow ho w others have reacted in similar
situations. It will also           show ho w you can help normal healing tooccur
and how to avoid some pitfalls.

NORMAL F E EL I N G S A N D E M O T I O N S AL WA Y S E X P E R I E N C E D

FEAR            of damage to oneself and those we love,
               of being left alone, of h a vi n g to leave loved ones,
               of " b r e a k i ng down" or " l osing control",
               of a similar event h a p p e n i ng again.
HELPLESSNESS - crises show up h u ma n powerlessness, as well as strength,
SADNESS        for deaths, injuries and losses of every kind,
LONGING        for all that has gone.
GUILT          for b e in g better off than others, i e , being alive, not
               injured, having things,
               regrets for things not done.
SHAME          for ha vi n g been e x posed as helpless, "emotional" and
               need i n g others.
               for not ha vi n g reacted as one w o ul d have wished,
ANGER          at what has happened, at w h oe v e r caused it or allowed it
               to happen.
               at the injustice and s e nselessness of it all.
               at the shame and indignities.
               at the lack of proper u n de r s t a n d i n g by others, the
               inefficiencies.
               W H Y ME?
MEMORIES       of feelings, of loss or of love for other            people in your
               life who have been injured or died,
LET D O W N    disa p p o in t m e nt s w h i c h a l ternate with,
HOPE           for the future, for better times.

Everyone has these feelings.          The expe r i e nc e of other disasters has
shown that they m ay be p a rt i c u la r l y intense if

- many people died
- their deaths we re sudden, violent or o c c u r r e d in horrifying
   circumstances
- no body was r e covered
- t h e r e was great d e pendance on the pers o n who died
- the r e la tionship w ith the person was    at a difficult stage
- this stress came on top of others.

Nature heals through a l lo w i n g these feelings to come out. This will not
lead to loss of control of the mind, but stopping these feelings may
lead to nervous and physical problems. Crying gives relief.

P H Y S I C A L AN D M E N T A L SENSA T I ON S

Y o u ma y feel bo di l y s e nsations w i t h or without the f e elings described.
S o me t i m es they are due to the crisis, even if they d e velop m a n y months
after the event.

Some c o mm o n s e nsations are tiredness, sleeplessness, bad dreams,
fu zziness of the m ind i n cluding loss of memory and c o ncentration,
dizziness, p a lpitations, shakes, d ifficulty in b r eathing, c h oking in the
throat and chest, nausea, diarrhoea, muscular t e nsion which m a y lead to
pain, eg, headaches, ne ck and backaches, d r agging in the womb, m e nstrual
disorders, change in sexual interest.

F A M I L Y A N D S O CI A L R E LA T I O N S H I P S

New f r i e n d s h i p s and group bonds m ay come into being. On the other hand,
strains in r e la t i o ns h i p s ma y appear. Th e good f e elings in giving and
r e c e i v i ng may be r e placed by conflict. You ma y feel that too little or
the w r o n g things are offered, or that you cannot give as m u c h as is
ex pected. A c c i d e n ts are mo re frequent after severe stresses. Alcohol
and drug intake m ay increase due to the extra tensions.

TH E F O L L O W I N G M A K E TH E E V E N T S A N D T HE FE EL I N G S A B OU T T H E M E A S I E R T O B E AR

N U M B N E S S - Your m i n d ma y allow the m i sf o r t un e to be felt only slowly.
                  At first you m a y feel numb. Th e event m a y seem unreal, "ike
                  a dream, so me t h i ng that has not really "happened".        People
                  o ften see this w r on g l y either as "being strong" or
                  "uncaring".

A C T I V I T Y - T o be active. To help and give to others m a y give some
                  relief. However, o v er - a c ti v i t y is d e t r i m e nt a l and diverts
                  a t t e n t i o n f r om the help yo u need for yourself.

REALITY        - C o n f r o n t i n g the reality, eg, a t tending funerals, i nspecting
                 losses, r e turning to the scene will all h e l p you to cone to
                 terms w i t h the event.
GOING OVER THE EVENT

    As yo u a l l o w the di sa s t e r m o r e into y o u r mind, there is a n e e d to think
    about it, to talk about it, and at n i gh t to d r e a m about it over and over
    o ver again. C h il d r e n p lay and d r a w about the event.



SUPPORT

    It is a relief to receive o ther p e o p l e ’s physical and e m otional support.
    Do not reject it.  Sharing w i t h others wh o ha ve ha d similar experiences
    feels good. Barriers can b reak down and closer relationships develop.


PRIVACY

    In order to deal w i t h feelings, you w i ll find it n e c e s c a r y at times to be
    alone, or just w i t h family and close friends.

A c ti v i t y and n u mbness   (blocking of feelings) ma y be over u s e d and m a y delay
your healing.


H E ALING

R e me m b e r that the pain of the w o u n d leads to healing.                 Yo u m a y even come out
w i s e r and stronger.


SOME D O ’S A N D D O N ’TS

D O N ’T bottle up feelings.             DO express y o u r emotions and let your children
share in the grief.

D O N ’T avoid talking about w h a t happened.               DO take svery o p p o r t u ni t y to

be part of a group of pe op l e w h o care.

D O N ’T let yo ur e m ba r r a ss m e n t stop y ou giving others thee chance to talk.

D O N ’T expect the me mo r i e s to go away             -    the feelings will stay w i t h yo u for
a long time to come.

D O N ’T forget     that      your   c h il d r e n    will     e xperience     similar      feelings     to
yourself.

DO take time out to sleep,               rest,        think and be w i t h your close family and
friends.

themselves in games and drawings.

activities.
DO DRIVE MORE CAREFULLY                   DO BE MORE CAREFUL AROUND THE HOME

TUESDAY,       10th OCTOBER,     1989   at 7 . 0 0   p.m.

IN E S K D A L E   COMMUNITY   CENTRE


Present

           Councillor Helen Jackson              (Chair)
           Councillor G. Burrows
           Councillor G. Matthews
           David Blunkett, M.P.
           90 residents (approx)
           Chief Superintendent John Nesbitt (South Yorkshire Police)
           Superintendent D. Sleath (South Yorkshire Police)
           Graham Mackrell (Secretary, Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)
           Frances Woodhead (Solicitor, Sheffield City Council)

In attendance:

            Constable Morledge (Community Constable)
            Constable Tune       (Community Constable)
           |            Team Leader, Hillsborough Task Team
           |               |, social worker, Hillsborough Task Team
           I                 |, social worker, Hillsborough Task Team
            Representative of Football Supporters Association

Apologies:            • None


Councillor Jackson opened the meeting by w e lcoming those in attendance.
She expressly thanked the people of Sheffield and those of the Hillsborough
area for the way they had responded on the 15th of April.

1.1        Councillor Jackson then introduced the Platform group and asked for
            updates on the start of the football season from the Police,
            Sheffield Wednesday F.C. and the Local Authority.

1.2        Superintendent Sleath explained that letters have gone to all local
            residents from the Police. These letters thank people for their
            assistance and explained the plans that have been put into effect
            by them following the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's
            Interim Report. The Police are still determining strategies for
            dealing with large numbers of fans without tickets. They have
            also separated home and away fans for the first few matches and so
            home fans have been diverted away from Leppings Lane. Superintendent
            Sleath reported to the meeting that notices had gone out to all
            Police officers, instructing them not to park in streets near to the
            ground. Alternative parking was made available on South Yorkshire
            Passenger Transport land nearby. Stewards had also been offered
            this facility.

 1.3       Mr Mackrell then thanked the residents for their support during
            what was an especially difficult time for the club. He told the
            meeting that the Sheffield Wednesday F . C . was very conscious of
            their part in the c om mu n i t y . In relation to parking, Sheffield
            Wednesday F.C. w e r e making available space at M iddlewood Road for
            use by stewards. The terraces at Leppings Lane are unlikely to be
2



         re-opened this season and this matter is being actively discussed
         wi th the Police and other interested parties.

1.4     David Blunkett, M.P., and Frances W o odhead then commented that they
         were mainly in attendance to listen to local people's views and
         comments.

Discussion- then centred around Agenda items.

2.1     Barriers/Access

        A variety of points were raised from the floor. The feeling of the
        meeting was that the barriers were want e d by residents and that they
        should be put in place earlier than at present. In response to
        this, Superintendent Sleath stated that the barriers would be in
        place from midday onwards. They would be policed by Special
        Constables from 12 until the regular police came on duty. The
        barriers would continue to be policed w hile the match was on and
        until the end of the game.

2.2     Portable Toilets

        There were a number of comments fpom the floor on the extent and
        nature of the problem which has led them to request more toilet
        facilities for spectators. Mr Mackrell stated that he would take
        this matter up with the Local Authority. It w a s agreed that the
        siting of such temporary porta-loos or permanent brick toilets
        would be a ma tt e r for further discussion and needed to be taken
        up with Health and Consumer Services. Councillor George Matthews
        suggested that the cost of these facilities should be met by the
        Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

2.3     Street Access

        Residents highlighted various difficulties and problems experienced
        by them when g a ining access to their homes once the barriers were
        in place. Various suggestions to remedy the matter were put
        forward, such as residents parking and/or stickers. The Police
        response was that these solutions may be inappropriate as
        enforcement of such measures could be a problem. It was agreed
        that Police and residents would monitor the situation further now
        that the barriers were to be in place earlier. Superintendent
        Sleath stated that any residents who had particular problems about
        access to their street or felt they had been dealt wi th in an
        unsympathetic way by Police officers, should take the officer's
        number and contact him at Hammerton Road Police Station. He would
        then ensure that the matt e r was investigated and dealt with.

2.4     Litter

        The feeling of the meeting was that litter was a great problem and
        that it should be the responsibility of Sheffield Wednesday F.C.
        and the Local Authority to deal wi th this natter. Mr Mackrell
        made the point that other local businesses, as well as the Sheffield
        Wednesday F.C. b enefittedfrom the influx of supporters and that
        litter was o f t e n generated f rom items purchased in these shoos or
        f rom t ake-aways. The suggestion was then out forward that the Local
3


                Traders Association, Sheffield Wednesday F.C. and the Local
                Authority combine to provide more litter bins ana street
                c l eaning services.

2.5             Arrangements for the Match on. 29th November

                Mr Mackrell acknowledged this would be an emotional m atch for
                everyone concerned. 4,000 tickets have been allocated to the
                Liverpool fans.There will be publicity encouraging people to be
                there as early as possible and explaining to them the plans for
                that day. This publicity would be done in conjunction with
                Liverpool F.C. , the Police and Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

3.             Any O ther Business

3.1            Noise

                A resident from Vere Road complained about the level of noise of
                records and music coming from the gynmasium. Mr Mackrell agreed
                to have this matter investigated and will discuss this with his
                sports nail Manager. He was aware that there we re also technical
                problems with the P.A. system. »

3.2            C o u n c i l l o r s 1 Surgery

                C o uncillor George Matthews offered to re-start his councillor's
                surgery at Eskdale Community Centre as an ongoing way of
                a ddre s s in g some of the community's concerns.

3.3            Future Meetings

                 It was unanimously agreed that the meeting had been of great value
                 and that similar meetings should be held in the future. Mr Mackrell
                 offered the residents the use of the Riverside Suite at Sheffield
                 Wednesday F.C. as the venue for their next meeting early in the
                 N e w Year. Mr Mackrell, Councillor Jackson, and Superintendent
                 Sleath all agreed to attend. Superintendent Sleath reported that
                 he w ould like residents to contact him at any time if they have
                 complaints about policing in the area.

Councillor Jackson closed the meeting at 9.00 p.m., thanked all those
present for attending and the Hillsborough Task Team for a s sisting residents
to arrange this meeting.

     HILLSBOROUGH - THE LONGER TERM PERSPECTIVE.
                     THURSDAY, 11th JANUARY, 1990.

 A Conference for people involved in work with bereaved families,
 seriously injured people and survivors of the match.


                                at

      BURTON MANOR COLLEGE, BURTON, SOUTH WIRRAL, CHESHIRE.


 *   This is a follow-up day for workers from all over the
     country who are involved in continuing work with people
     affected by the Hillsborough Disaster.

 *    The Conference is aimed at sharing experiences and skills
     and looking at ways of coping with disaster work in the
     longer-term.
     We are particularly keen to offer a chance for workers
     who are some distance from Merseyside to meet up with
     people here who understand the issues about being
     involved^with this work. For those of you who attended
     the Conference in August, it will be a chance to renew
     the links you made then.

 *    The Conference again is being organised by Jane Harper,
     the Staffline Co-ordinator on Merseyside.   This is an
     independent Staff Consultation and Counselling Service,
     organised by BASW.   Jane sees sharing ideas and problems
     as a key means of supporting staff involved in this
     work.

*    The cost of the day, which includes tea, coffee and lunch,
     is being met by BASW from a fund collected after
     Hillsborough to support social workers.

     Unfortunately, we cannot pay for overnight accomodation,
     but Burton Manor has a limited number of rooms available
     on the previous evening, 10th January, at a cost of
     £10 per person per night for bed and breakfast.   These
     rooms would clearly need to be reserved for those
     travelling some distance.

*    The emphasis of the Conference will be informal with
     plenty of opportunity to talk to other people and attend
     Workshops which won't necessarily have a formal input
     but will offer the chance to share ideas.

•B. It is only possible this time to offer places to people who
    are now still involved directly in work with people affected
    by Hillsborough.  If you are in any doubt about whether you
    would be eligible to attend, please contact Jane Harper.
    If you want a place, please return the tear-off slip as
    soon as possible.

Dear Angela Rowland,

       re: Research Project on the Hillsborough disaster

I e n c l o s e a c o p y of the draft report "The Hillsborough
Disaster: inter-professional relationships between clergy and
social workers: theclergy viewpoint".            I would very much
appreciate your comments on the report at this draft stage.
Since writing the draft I have received copies of the
Department’s emergency plans and Neil Kay’s report "Proposals
re Social Services Department initial response to a major,
disaster involving multiple deaths and injuries"; and I will be
substantially revising the last section of the report (Planning
implications) in the light of this information.

I plan to complete the final draft of the report by the end of
July, so please could I have your comments by the end of June.
As I no longer work for the Department please could you send
comments to my home address above.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
THE HIIISBGRDOGH DISASTER


mterprofessional relationships between clergy and social workers;
the clergy viewpoint


Introduction

1.01   Hie Hillsborough disaster was a major tragedy at Hillsborough
       football stadium on the afternoon of 15th April 1989, 95 people
       died, and over 400 received hospital treatment.

1.02   This study concerns primarily the support and help offered to the
       bereaved and distressed people on the afternoon and night of 15th
       April 1989, and includes in seme cases the support offered in the
       ensuing week. Many people offered help, seme called out through
       pre-existing networks, some responding to an appeal for helpers
       broadcast on local radio, and seme ^e^Q^ding spontaneously to
       the news. This report deals ifjLth tthe relationship between two
       professional groups, social ^jorkerq and clergy, wh^ responded in
       large nua$ers. It aims to cover the context in which these
       people found themselves# how they worked and the problems that
       arose. It concludes with recommendations for future planning.

The Purpose of the Study

2 .®   Otoe project was designed as $ case-sfaidy of inter-professional
        relationships. Ihe disaster at the Hillsborough football ground
        was chosen because it was an occasion where social workers and
        clergy were present on an equal footing; it was neutfal territory
        unlike most other situations; where work with members of these two
        professional disciplines takes place. It was also topical, as
        the project was conceived in June 1389f and a secondary purpose
        was to make use of people's recent experience to facilitate
        future disaster planning.

2.02   In its original conception the project airae^ to interview about
        six from each professional group using the same interviewing
        schedule. However there have been difficulties in gaining access
        to social workers and it has not been possible to interview them
       within the time available. Therefore the project has had to be
       modified to take account only of the interviews with clergy.

2.03   Hie p&fpse of |he modified project can thus be formally stated
        ass to use the experience of some clergy who were present during
        the aftermath to the Hillsborough disaster to examine the
       positive and negative aspects of inter-professional
        re^tionships, and to make recommendations for planning fof
        futttre emergencies.

The Context - What Happened?

4.01    The match at Hillsborough on 15th April 1989, was a semi-final of
        the FA Cup between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Hie play was
        stopped after 6 minutes when it was clear that spectators at the
        Leppings Lane end of the stadium, where the Liverpool supporters
        were, were being crushed. Hie preceding events are minutely
        detailed in the interim report of the inquiry by the Rt Hon lard
        Justice Taylor (Cm 765). Chapter 5 of the interim report is
        entitled "Hie Aftermath" and deals with the immediate rescue
        attempts by police, fire and ambulance services.

4.02    Some idea of the horror of the event is given in paragraph 81 of

        superseded by a decision to use the Boy's Club on Infirmary Road
        for this purpose. Hiis was a large building, able to accommodate
        a few hundred people.
4.06   At a later stage in the evening possibly about 9 or 10 pm the
        police requested helpers to come back to the Hillsborough ground
        to assist at the process of identifying the bodies. This took
        place at the gymnasium. Each group of people (family or friends
        of the missing person) was taken first to a room where there were
        photographs of all the dead displayed on boards. They had to
        look at these and if they recognised one to indicate to the
        police officer who made a note of the number. They then had to
        wait while the body was brought to a small viewing area to be
        positively identified. After this they moved on to another area
        where the necessary forms were completed.

4.07   The majority of the dead were identified on the Saturday night
       and early hours of Sunday morning. Hie bodies were then moved to
       the Medico-Legal Centre, the coroner's mortuary in normal
       circumstances. In the daytime hours of Sunday 16 April many
       people came to the Medico-Legal Centre to view the bodies,
       particularly where the identification had been made by a friend
       and the relatives wanted to come and view the body. Hie
       remainder of the formal identifications had to be made.

4.08   The support centre was moved from the Boy's Club to a Church Hall
        in Forbes Road, Hillsborough. Work started at the Hillsborough
        ground debriefing and counselling staff who had been present and

        and Fire Service personnel. One of the other participants went
        independently to the ground met the Industrial Chaplain who he
        already knew and joined forces,with him.

5.03   The other four went to the hospitals, two of them at the request
        of the hospital chaplain who they had contacted. They had all
         5
         made sane attempt at contacting colleagues and trying to initiate
         some sort of organisation.

5.04     Hie senior Anglican clergyman           had tried to cd^iact the Bishop but
         could not, and had then tried           to find out if there was a disaster
         plan which should be put into           operation, but drew a blank. He
         said he felt "very much on my           own."

5.05     For some of the participants, doubts about the legitimacy of
         their presence was a source of anxiety. Some saw this in
         contrast to social workers who they saw as having been called up
         as part of a disaster plan. The Methodist Minister said "I felt
         may be I should have stayed at home until called and yet I felt
         that nobody really knew what was going on. Well there was a
         a disaster plan for the statutory services but there didn't seem
         to be anything for church bodies, not that took account of the
         diversity."

2       At the Hospitals

5.06     The accounts of the circumstances at both Northern General and
         Royal Hallamshire Hospitals suggest that organisation was
         minimal. Hie Salvation Army Officer described it: "There were
         lots of people milling about, there was lots of misinformation -
         the bodies were coming and then they weren't coming and then
       t there were 40 dead and then there weren't 40 dead. All 40 bodies
         were there and then they weren't there, there was quite a lot of
         chaos and confusion".

5.07      There was some organisation being seen to-be done by social
          workers at the Hallamshire. They had set up an office and were
          taking names and addresses of people willing to offer transport
    g,       .a^^aamodation, and trying to link them up with those needing
       ■ "’thiggsort of help.j",                    .

3        At the Boy's Club                   V     ,             ' T

5.10    Those people who were involved in setting up the centre at the
         Boy's Club - the Industrial Chaplain and the senior Anglican
         priest - had a reasonably clear view of what organisation there
       was. In contrast, the Methodist minister, who was at the Boy's
       Club for a short period during the evening saw it as a place with
       barely more organisation of support services than at the
       hospital.

5.11   The Industrial Chaplain had gone from the Hillsborough ground to
       Hammerton Road Police Station. It was clear that the police
       station was inadequate for the purpose required. A few other
       clergy had congregated at the police station including the local
       vicar who offered to open up the Boy's Club because he had the
       keys. Some social workers were also present at Hammerton Road,
       so the setting up of the centre at the Boy's Club was a joint
       operation between police, social workers and clergy.

5.12   Early on, the senior Anglican priest developed links with a
        senior social worker to develop a "management structure". This
       was his term and differed somewhat to the Industrial Chaplain's
        reference to: ".... an ad hoc group that assumed an organising
        role." This indicates a difference in perception of what sort of
       organisation was happening, related to their experience of
       organisation in their normal work. The senior Anglican had a
       managerial role in the hierarchical structure, albeit without
        strict rules of accountability, while the Industrial Chaplain was
       a member of a non-hierarchical team responsible to an independent
       Council.

5.13   At some point during the evening a senior manager from Family and
       Community Services Department arrived and assumed management
       responsibility for the social workers that were present. There
       is no indication that there was any opposition to this, and all
       the clergy observed social workers assuming the roles in relation
       to the giving and receiving of authority that they occupied^iji
       their normal jobs. In these expectional circumstances, they
       related to their colleagues in the normal work roles.

5.14   The situation was confused by the arriyal of a retired member^ of
       the Department who had when in post, been senior to the manager
       present. She tried to assert her authority over him, but was not
       successful. Thus it was current working relationships that were
       the dominant pattern.                         ■ eJ'r   ,v.f

5.15   From an early stage the plan developed that a"social worker and
       member of the clergy should both attach themselves to each group
       of people searching for someone. This plan was communicated by
       word of mouth to helpers |ts they arrived. There were a„yery
        large number of helpers (social workers, clergy, other
       professionals and volunteeysX^estimates varying but possibly up
        to 200. They came in respqrtseto appeals for help on local news
        and television, but this irrlfcself was part of the cause of the
       difficulty in organising help. The Methodist minister described
       his arrival at the Boy's Club as "... it was like a wall of
       people. I sensed it was a wall of helpers."
         7
5.16     Hie senior Anglican priest described the disadvantages of the
         Boy's Club as follows;

         "We also faced massive problems of the Boy's Club being a)
         unsuitable to do any work; b) being overwhelmed by too many
         people coming, both clergy and social workers, and c) not being
         able adequately to distinguish who was what and what they were
         doing and so on. ... Lack of identification of people who'd got
         skills, people who were hangers on, a reporter or two, people who
         were voyeurs, people who were eccentrics; and who had the ability
         to say "Out"? That was a major management problem in my view."

5.17     Later on in the interview however he conceded the advantages of
         the place.

         "Hiere was a lot to be gained from the informality and the sense
         of being together as well as the need for separate space but the
         shortage of telephone lines ws quite extraordinary."

5.18    There was a suggestion from social workers that the centre be
        moved to the Divisional Offices in Hillsborough. None of the
        participants was clear whether or not the offices had in fact
         been opened; but the centre remained at the Boy's Club.

5.19    The Salvation Army and the WKVS organised a very effective
         refreshment service at the Boy's Club.

4       At the Gymnasium

5.20     Hie police requested help for people during the idenficiation
          process. They made this request to the organising group at the
          Boy's Club and these people organised a group of clergy and
          social workers to go there. Independently, other social workers,
          clergy and others arrived at the ground with the groups of people
          coming to the mortiiary. Some came from the Boy's Club, some
          straight from the hospitals. Hie senior Anglican priest said of
       ' 'this manoeuvre; "It w£s clear that (the manager from F & C S)
          and I had authority that had been delegated by the police."

5.21    At first people had to queue up outside in the cold. They were
         advised to stay on their buses but they did not as one person
         said   "What became really difficult was that people were wanting
         to do something.* Hie time was about 11 pm or so and it was
         cold. Hie Salvation Army provided refreshments and blankets but
        people appeared to reject the blankts even though most were
         dressed in clothes suitable for a sdnny April afternoon.

5.22    On the initiative of another clergyman present and through the
        negotiations of the senior Anglican and the F & G S manager with
         the police, other areas of the building were opened up. Hiese
         included a lounge and a refreshments area. People could then
        wait in warmer and more hospitable circumstances, and it made it
        possible for a relationship to be built up between helpers and
       8

       helped, prior to identification.


5.23   Hie plan, as in the Boy's CLub, was for both a social worker and
       member of the clergy, to attach themselves to each group. This
       plan was evidently clearer to the minds of the planners than the
       rest. Hie Anglican priest said:

       "But the organisation of social workers and clergy was very, very
       loose indeed. If they were short of social workers or clergy
       they would let out a yell and whoever was free would go there."

5      In the following days

5.24   Once the immediate crisis was passed, the chaos receded, and a
       greater degree of organisation emerged.

5.25   At the Medico-Legal Centre the issue of Authority was still
       current, but here authority had passed from the police to the
       Coroner's staff at the centre. Hiere were difficulties in
       providing an effective support service to the bereaved but these
       were caused mainly by the deficiencies of the building. It was
       not designed to cater for large numbers of bereaved and multiple
       viewing of bodies. Hie news media were felt to be more
       importunate than at the ground as there had been no access for       +>&,
       the press to the Hillsborough stadium at all*          nU ‘         s?
5.26   Organisation of support at the Hillsborough ground was undertaken
       jointly by clergy, social workers and youth and ccnmunity
       workers. Hiis joint working did not take place without some
       friction on all sides but structures developed to enable these to
       be resolved.

6       The Counselling Task at the Disaster

6.01     The counselling task at the disaster can be divided into four
         areas: The provision of practical help (refreshments,
         telephones), dealing with material issues (money, transport),
         meeting emotional needs; meeting specifically religious needs.
         It is only the third of these that might normally be described as
         counselling but I use the term to describe all of the activities
         that helpers undertook because that was how they used it. The
         work they did, did not have strict boundaries, it evolved to meet
         the needs of people as they saw them and they did these tasks
         either singly or in combinations.

6.02     Initially for people it was not clear what was needed and one
         person said "I didn't know what I was doing. I was just being
         with people".

         Many of the helpers were floundering.and needed assistance in
         identifying tasks.

         Practical Tasks

6.03    At all the sites people mentioned helping people get cups of tea
        and other refreshments. This was an important source of help and
        also a way ofgapping to other forms of help if appropriate.

6.04    In the early stages many people needed telephones, usually to
        phone back to Liverpool. Uiere was a chronic shortage of
         telephones throughout the night. Local clergy were able to take
        people back to their homes which the Senior Anglican Priest said
    'V; ".. which enabled the clergy to do something immediate which at
        least enabled them to develop some kind of relationship".

6.05     Later that night one of the participants offered overnight
         accommodation to a family.

         Material Issues

6.06     None of the clergy saw it as part of their task to deal with
         material issues arising out of the bereavement. They saw it as
         quite appropriate that social workers should deal with questions
         arising about DHSS money, getting the bodies back to Liverpool,
         the inquest etc. There was a clear demarcation of roles in their
         perceptions of these tasks. It was not their province and they
         left it to others.

6.07     Neither were clergy involved in the social workers' efforts to
         make list of offers of accommodation and transport, that was
         being done both at the hospitals and the Boy's Club. It was seen
         as a sensible and helpful thing to be doing, but they did not
         participate themselves.
10
6.08   One of the tasks clergy saw the social workers doing was taking
       details of names and addresses so that they could make a referral
       to the appropriate Social Services Department. Some, but not all
       clergy, had been briefed to do this also in order to refer to the
       person's parish priest. One of the clergy who had been asked to
       do this said.

       "In the interview room we had been told by [the senior Anglican
       Priest] if at all possible to get their name and address and get
       in touch with their clergy at a later date. I found this
       slightly difficult because I didn't feel I could ask again for an
       address when they'd already given it to the police. Usually I
       could hear it. I did also get the name of the parish priest in
       ail three cases and I wrote to them." -

       Meeting Emotional Needs

6.09                       Chairperson of Cruse in Sheffield has argued
       strongly in favour of proactive counselling, in an article in
       'Bereavement Care'. By proactive in the circumstances he meant
       not accepting a group or individual's initial rejection of an
       offer of help. He wrote:

       "As the evening went on at Hillsborough Stadium, a clear policy
       was stated that each family group was to be escorted by- at least
       one'counsellor or clergyman and one Social Worker. This policy
       was to prove invaluable. It became clear that however capable
       people believed themselves to be (especially the men), many were
       so shocked by the experience of identifying the bodies of
       relatives or friends that they just did not hear the simplest of
       instructions or requests from the police or mortuary attendants.
       To have somebody with them, able to make sure that they were able
       to go through the formalities to support them, in states of near
       collapse, shaking and shocked, and to fend off irrelevancies from
       any outside source, was vital."
        (Bereavement Care Vol 8 (3))

6.10   Giving support through the identification process was the roo s ts
       demanding task of the night. At the other venues the task was
       somewhat different. The Methodist Minister described his role at
       the hospital:

       "I went to the canteen area and sat beside people while they were
       in agony. Nothing much to do except than to talk about how they
       were feeling about the person they were looking for, get them to
       be hopeful and to communicate ... I expected to be just offering
       cups of tea to people, just skivvying around. I didn't expect to
       be doing what I was going later in the evening which was talking
       about the meaning of life and death to just one or two
       individuals. The role evolved during the evening."
11
6.11   Hie same distinction between the roles early on in the evening
       and later at the ground was made by the senior Anglican Priest.
       Early on he described the skills needed as basic human relating
       skills, the ability to befriend and support.

       "As things got down to the ground and the body identification
       process, then there was a far greater skills demarcation
       requirement by both clergy and social workers which made them
       more secure in their roles and enabled them to function better."

6.12   All the participants were asked about the differences in
       attitudes to people who were black or white, young or old or men
       or women. All participants said race was not an issue at all.
       Hie Salvation Army Officer made an interesting observation with
       regard to age:

       "Hiere was a difference in the way you treated people depending
       on the age of the person they had lost. Hie younger the person,
       the more difficult it was to come to terms with. Hie main
       concern people had was whether or not their loved one had
       suffered. How long it took Fred to die. It is more difficult
       the younger the person. Were they frightened?"

6.13   On the.question of gender differences the woman deacon observed
       that on two occasions where she was with a couple, she stayed
       with the woman while her male counselling partner went through
       the identification process with the man. She also stressed the
       importance of physical support and felt it was easier for her to
       offer this than for men. She said:

        "When we eventually got into the room with the photos she just
        faced away from the photos and clung to me and said "He's not
r      there, is he?" And it was an awful long time till they found him
;      and then she just buried herself in me. And I actually found
        that was one of the most useful things being a woman minister."
       And later: "Hiere were a couple of men who were quite happy to
        just bury themselves in you in the same way in that situation."

       Religious Needs

6.14   Hie people who died were Liverpool supporters and so it was not
       surprising that there were practising Roman Catholic among the
       bereaved. Hiis gave the religious element a more prominent role
       than in sane of the other recent disasters.

6.15   Hiere had been a Roman Catholic Priest at the match who had
       prayed over all of the bodies separately. Some families wanted
       the last rites; and some, but not all of the clergy, made a point
       of asking families if they wanted this. Some families also
       specifically asked for a Roman Catholic Priest on the night of
       the disaster, and some coming in the following days brought their
       local Roman Catholic Priest with them.
6.16   Some   of the participants anticipated looking for opportunities to
       pray   but found that it was not appropriate or called for. The
       only   exception was this, and it clearly caused the participant^
       sane   anxiety.
       "There was a coach sat outside Hammerton Road Police Station and
       they were six people missing. They were just waiting and waiting
       for hours. Someone suggested that I go and talk to them. You
       could have heard a pin drop on this coach. I though that this
       was one of those occasions when one ought to pray quietly with
       them, using the loudspeaker on the coach. I'm not sure if it was
       right but I did it. It may have helped sane people."

6.17   All the participants felt that it was part of their role to deal
       with anger against God and the Church? and that this was a role
       that was familiar to all of them. TWO of them had occasions when
       the anger was so great that they had to withdraw.

6.18   The Methodist Minister said:

       "With some people you realised that their feelings were not
       exactly warm towards the Church or to a God who could allow these
       things to happen. I just let them come out*" And later: "I
       remember on the Sunday afternoon there was one young man who was
       really angry .... I think what that man actually needed and what
       he came to understand was that he needed to be angry with someone
       and I was glad I was there and that he could be angry with me."

7      r~|Ai-qy perceptions of the Role of the Department and the Social
       Workers

7.01   Three of the participants said that they thought the social
       workers had been drafted in as part of a disaster plan and had
        been "officially organised in sane way more than we had." This
        appears to be partly an expression of their own insecurity in
        their role and seeing others as having greater security and -
        legitimacy than they had themselves.                          1-:

7.02   Five of the participants saw social workers as doing practical _
        tasks and said that this was the role they thought they should be
        playing. Hie Anglican Priest said:

       ■     when we were actually on the job we were both sitting
       there and the social worker had a practical function to fulfil,
       I assumed they had. I assumed they knew what they were doing
       professionally and I didn't want to interfere. I don't think I
       was very clear what this function was — getting names and
       addresses, transport and accommodation."

7.03   He also said of the formal procedures of form filling after the
        viewing of the bodies:
13

       "I regarded myself as an amateur at that game and her (the social
       worker) as a professional."

7.04   Perceptions of social workers' work under normal circumstances
       and the training they had undergone varied. One participant
       said:

       "A social worker is trained to deal with family problems, whether
       they have a bed to sleep on, a clean house, whether there is a
       social problem over a child."

7.05   In contrast another view was expressed:

       "It never occurred to me that the social worker was just there
       for practical help. I saw her as an official because she was up
       there at the policeman's end of the table with the family, and
       she clearly did already have the facts, names and everything. I
       took it for granted that in her training she would have done
       something about all kinds of stress.”

7.06   Another view was expressed about the bereavement training of
       social workers, constrasting it with the experience most clergy
       accumulate in their work:

       "Ithink the bereavement training that social workers have
       received is more to do with long term - dealing with dysfunction
       that arises out of bereavement often months or years afterwards
       rather than the immediate dealing with sudden death and the first
       processes that arise out of sudden death which clergy are often ...
       dealing with on a week by week basis."                         _

7.07   The participants felt that almost all the people they helped made
       no distinctions between the professional disciplines of helpers.
       Obey only exceptions were where they had a specific religious
       need and the two occasions when the help from a member of the
       clergy was rejected. The majority of experiences were
       represented by this comment:

       "Hie people I spoke to were happy, I think, to have somebody to
       talk to with them, I didn't think it mattered. Had I been a
       social worker and in a collar and tie I think much the same
       things would have happened."

8      Social Workers' reactions to and perceptions of clergy (as the
       clergy saw them)

8.01                  in the article referred to above says:

       "It is an unfortunate fact, but one which has to be accepted,
       that competition creeps in between agencies". (op cit) And the
       circumstances at Hillsborough were no exception. There was
       undoubtedly some competition and rivalry between agencies. This,
14
       though, appears to have dwindled as the night wore on. Hiere
       became a greater recognition of the scale of the task and that no
       one agency was able to cope. Hiere was a growing sense of
       interdependence.

       At an organising level the managers were clearly able to work
       together effectively from an early stage, and that they both had
       a commitment to the principle of joint working by the helpers.

8.02   Hie feelings of competing were present early on and there were
       strong feeling expressed that they thought social workers tried
       to oust out all the other helpers. The attempt to move the
       support centre from the Boy's Club to the Divisional Offices was
       interpreted as a corpetitive move to give Family and Community
       Services more control.

8.03   Four of the partipants expressed sane resentful feelings about
       the initial attitudes of social workers. One put it like this:

       "Sane of the problems we all had in the early stages were that
       when the social workers came along they looked on the clergy as a
       bunch of amateurs."

8.04   This was also true of work at the Hillsborough ground in.the week
       following the disaster. Clergy there felt that the same social
       workers wanted to have complete control and did not acknowledge
       the role the clergy had to play.

8.05   A further development of this theme were the feelings expressed
       that sane social workers did not recognise that clergy usually
       have had considerable experience in dealing with the bereaved in
       the early stages of their grief. The Anglican Priest said:

       "I have been taking funerals for the better part of 35 years, and
       sane of them have been funerals of children, babies. Funerals
       after accidents. It's a professional job to do." And another^:.:
       participant acknowledged the jealousy he felt:

       "One felt there was a certain professional jealousy. And without:;
       being unkind you take the average clergy and how many social
       workers conduct a funeral."

8.06   One participant was still annoyed at a social worker's rejection
       of his role:

       "Some social workers assumed that clergymen had a very defensive
       attitude about what the world's like and that they don't know
       what conflicts like and also that they'd never actually listened
       to anyone rejecting God, the Church, and actually it's a very
       normal part of grieving people go through.... and I became
       annoyed with the feeling that you mustn't hear these things
       because you might be shocked. It was this feeling coming across
       from social workers."
8.07   Members of the Salvation Army were the only members of the cle^y
       present who had had experience of previous disasters. Both the
       officers who participated in the study had had that experience,
       and other colleagues of theirs in the Salvation Army as well.
       They felt that although this experience was acknowledged by the
       police, with whom they have a good relationship, and are often
       called to help in emergencies, it was not acknowledged by most
       social workers.

       Issues of Communication

9.01   Use of language was identified at the design stage of this
       project as an area which may have caused problems at
       Hillsborough. The interim report on the project in Kent written
       by Elizabeth Clark entitled "The Church and its role in relation
       to other agencies" found that professional jargon on the part of
       clergy and workers in the statutory services caused
       misunderstandings and posed barriers to communication.

9.02   Language was not experieced as a problem at Hillsborough. There
       were no occasions when anyone felt professional jargon was being
       used; neither were there occasions when people felt they were not
       understanding or not being understood* There were however, a
       number of other communication issues; of labelling and
       identification^; visual recognition; physical characteristics
       that assisted communication; use of telephones; use of
       walkie-talkies, and making referrals.

9.03   All the clergy participants in the study had made a special   ;
       effort to make sure they were identifiable. The Salvation Army
       were in uniform and the other clergy all specially put on their
       dog collars. They expressed frustration that the other helpers
       were not as clearly identified. At the Northern General Hospital
       the social workers and medical social workers had labels on
       identifying them as such; but at the Boy's Club people used
       sticky labels just saying 'Helper*. ®ie senior Anglican Priest
       said: .

       "Social workers had bits of paper with the word 'Helper' on it
       which I found a bit odd. I would have liked it if they had
       identified themselves a little more sharply. I think that
       reflected sane of the confusion."

9.04   All the participants confirmed the important of visual
       recognition of others to enable organisation to take place. They
       congregated with people they already knew, asked them and gave
       information, and linked into networks that emerged through
       pre-existing links. One of the important factors in the initial
        stages of organisers support was the recognition by club
        officials and the Assistant Chief Fire Officer of the Industrial
        Chaplain.

9.05    Large stature and loud voices were both mentioned as
        pharar^rigfcics which were valuable in assisting communications.
        Large people were easy to recognise and identify and assisted
        them in being focal points. One participant said he was given
        the job of shouting out announcements in the hospital because he
        had the loudest voice available.

9.06    Scarcity of telephones has already been mentioned as a problem.
        At the Boy’s Club there was one telephone but that broke down.
        At the gymnasium there were two but one rapidly became full of
        coins and could not be used. NO one could empty it and this was
        an add<^ source of frustration and distress.

9.07    The police who had helped set up the Boy's Club had their
        walkie-talkies, but these did not assist very much:

        "The police walkie-talkies were very ineffective partly because
        of the volume of usage, partly because the control lacked
        information themselves ..... A lot of communication was by
        walking up the road to the Police Station and asking them for
        information. Biey often didn't have it. The link between the
        Boy's Club and the ground and hospitals was very poor."

10      The Relationship with the Police

10.01       most important aspect of the relationship between police and
        helpers was the delegation of authority by police. The police
        were seal by everyone to have overall authority in the
        circumstances. The specific instances of delegation were: to
        the Industrial Chaplain to set up the support centre? to the
        Salvation Army to attend to help with counselling; and to the
        organising group at the Boy's Club to provide counsellors at the
        gymnasium.
10.02 The police control of events was most evident at the gymnasium
      where they had the identification process tightly organised. The
      further away from the ground the more diffuse the organisation? :
      and the greater the struggle by other agencies to provide some
      sort of organisation, in the fac€ of little information and poor
      communications networks.

10.03 At the gymnasium itself there was negotiations between the
      helpers and the police throughout the night over the service
      offered by the helpers. The senior Anglican Priest said of the
      relationship:
                 the relationship with the police had to be worked at all
         evening, by the end of the evening it was working well and there
         was mutual confidence both ways."
17

10.04 The first occasion of ne|g£itation was over the point at which the
      helpers would start making contact with the families. The eamo
      participant said:

       "The original idea of the police was the the police would see
       people though/ the whole identification process but at the end
       when the^rwere walking through to make a statement, they didn't
       mind a clergyman and social worker attaching themselves to the
       group. [The F & C S Manager] and I realised that this would not
       work because a relationship had to be built up if it was going to
       be any use, before identification took place."

10.05 The decision to open up other parts of the building and allow
      people to wait inside had to be negotiated with the police. The
      Senior Anglican Priest said he had "a bit of a hoo-ha" with them
      over it but they did agree and this made it possible.

10.06 Negotiations took place over the speed of the identifications.
      At first the police were asking people to identify the personal,
      belongings of the dead after having seen the bodies, and the
      whole process was taking half an hour or more. Bie helpers
      requested that the property be dealt with separately, which the
      police agreed to, and this speeded the process up considerably.
      This was a great improvement for the bereaved who had already
      spent many hours waiting at different places.

10.07 The good relationship between police and helpers was exemplified-
      by an incident where both clergy and social workers had noticed
      that the police officer in charge of the room with photographs
      was under stress. They mentioned this to their oganisers who
      informed the police inspector. The officer was relieved by
      another and as one person said:

      "Normally the police don't take kindly to being told that one of
      their officers is under stress."

10.08 The police were flexible about their procedures to be sensitive
      to the needs of the bereaved. One participant was with the
      brother of one of the deceased and he was waiting for his
      brother's wife to come from Liverpool before identifying the body
      because immediately after identification the bodies were being
      removed to the Coroner's mortuary. The clergyman was able to
      negotiate a different arrangement so that the brother could do
      the formal identification, but the body could remain, so that the
      other members of the family could view it when they arrived.

10.09 The sensitivity of the police was also commended by clergy
      present at the Hillsborough ground in the weeks following the
      disaster. By this time it was the West Midlands police who were
      in charge. They cordoned off the Leppings Lane end of the
      stadium but then on occasions personally accompanied some of the
      visiting fans into the cordoned-off area.
11      Planning Implications

11.01 The only church to have a well-formulated plan for this sort of
      emergency was the Salvation Amy. It was reflected in the
      organisation of their call up of officers; their pre-existing
      relationship with the police; and the clarity of expectations on
      all sides of what their role would be, including the provision of
      refreshments and blankets.

11.02 The social services were little better organised than most
      churches. The Director of Social Services was quoted in an
      article in 'Community Care' 27.4.89 as saying: "There are no
      blueprints. You have to move on your feet. Every disaster is
      unique." There is certainly justice in the assertion of
      uniqueness. In recent years there have been many disasters
      including the Herald of Free Enterprise at Zeebrugge; at Kings
      Cross; aircraft disasters at Lockerbie and Kegworth; train
      disasters at Clapham and elsewhere, and the fire at Bradford
      Football ground, to name-a few. Hillsborough was characterised
      from the point of view of support services by the vast numbers of
      people affected. The numbers of people searching for their
      missing friends ran into thousands. It was also unusual in the
      speed with which the identifications took place. There was not a
      drawn out period while the bodes were found, and all were
      identified bythe following Monday morning.

11.03   Even if there can be no blueprints there can be planning
        frameworks. The Assistant Director of Social Services who was
        present at Hillsborough is quoted in the same 'Community Care'
        article as saying: "I thought 'Where do you start?'" This
        echoes the senior Anglican Priest's feeling of being "very much
        on my own". A planning framework would at least cut out some of
        this initial questioning and give people directions and contacts
        to follow. It would speed up that initial fumbling for
        organisation.

        Organisational Structures                                     _

11.04 One of the lessons to be learned is the importance of visual
      recognition in facilitating the development of organisational
      structures. The implication for this is that the planning
      process should not be just a paper exercise but should involve at
      least periodic meetings where faces can be put to names and some
      knowledge however superficial of different people's
      responsibilities and skills.

11.05 Allied to this point is the importance of pre-existing networks.
      If inter-agency links exist they can be utilised and this speeds
      up the process. This refers not just to links between the
      emergency services and statutory bodies, but also among the
      voluntary agencies that might be called upon.
11.06 The planning process requires a recognition that in a major
      disaster all available resources will be needed, one agency alone
      cannot cope. Having a multitude of agencies present leads to
      great complexity of organisation, and it has to be recognised
      that inter-agency rivalry will never be eliminated. This can
      however be greatly ameliorated, as it was at Hillsborough by a
      clear commitment to joint working from the organisers, and clear
      instructions that people from different disciplines will work
      together.

11.07 Agencies need pre-planned call up procedures. There can be no
      doubt that the Salvation Army was at a great advantage in this
      respect. It assisted their speed of response and also the
      security which the officers felt in their role. The people who
      had come without being in some sense summoned expressed greater
      anxiety in their roles and took longer to find their feet.

11.08   Part of the planning process should be to identify and articulate
        the skills that that agency can offer. For example if
        counselling at a mortuary can be offered this should be stated.
        Most clergy appeared to think that organising logistical support
        was not their role and it would assist planning if they
        articulated this, or reconsidered whether or not this was
        appropriate for them. It is important that agencies expectations
        of themselves should be made known to other agencies and that
        some clear method of identifying what skills people have be
        devised.                                                     :"

11.09   The statutory services have a particularly important role in
        contingency planning for the use of buildings and for
        establishing communications networks. The layout of both the
        Boy's Club and the ground determined what help could be given and
        how easy it was for helpers to make a ^relationship with the
        bereaved.

        Staff Support   .

11.10 Working on the night of the Hillsborough disaster is not an   •
      experience that anyone is likely to forget. It was outside, the
      normal experience of most people present. Michael Stewart,
      Director of the Centre for Crisis Psychology, has written:

        "Helpers need to be well prepared and supported if they are to be
        effective. But first it must be acknowledged that anyone who
        gets involved in the work of supporting survivors during a period
        of unthinkable loss and powerful psychic pain is bound to
        experience distressing reactions of his or her own." (Community
        Care)

11.11 Those participants with a management role saw the care of staff
      as part of it; and the roost practical form it took was sending
      people home. The senior Anglican Priest said of the end of the
      night:
        "I'd sent people home. I think that was also part of the role
        [the F & C S manager] and I tried to play, making sure that
        people who'd had enough went."

11.12 The Salvation Army also sent people home, not just when people
      had had enough, but also in order that there were some people who
      would be fresh enough to work in the morning. This was a more
      organised deployment of staff than among the other churches.

11.13   The reactions of participants was usually more complicated that
        simply taking on the burden of other peoples grief. There was
        also, for some, a desire to be part of it, a desire to be doing
        something. Afterwards people varied in their desire to recount
        their experiences. Some did not want to as there was
        occasionally a feeling of competitiveness about who had done
        what. Some people were distressed because they had not done
        more. The senior Salvation Army Officer said:

        "One officer went somewhere where she was hardly needed and she
        got herself in a state feeling she'd been useless. I said look
        you went where you were asked to go. She had talked to a few
        people but she couldn't tell the stories about being with the
        bodies."

11.14   Some people who were not there also suffered guilt and
        self-doubt. One participant said:

        "There were some people who wonder if they could have coped and
        now they don't know. They feel let down in a sense. Because
        they1re members of the clergy they feel they must be able to
        cope."

11.15 People who had experience of other disasters were at an advantage
       in knowing something of what to expect, and what to expect of
       themselves. However, it was not an unmitigated advantage as they
„    . reported sensations of flashback to previous disasters. !flae
       Salvation A m y Officer had attended the aircraft fire at
       Manchester Airport. He said that at Hillsborough he smelt
       burning although there was no fire because he recalled the
       previous disaster.

11.16 Preparation of staff who may be involved in a disaster is clearly
      a planning issue that needs to be addressed, as well as afercare
      for staff who have been involved. On the Tuesday after
      Hillsborough there was an occasion for debriefing and unburdening
      for staff from voluntary agencies, churches and emergency
      services, which was much appreciated by the participants. Family
      and Community Services were invited to attend but did not.

 11.17 The senior Anglican clergyman expressed the view that clergy are
       better equipped than other professionals to deal with experience
— -    such as this:
        "Die medical profession see it as failure - death. The social
        work profession do not have immediate hands-on experience of
        death, the clergy are the only people who are with people within
        two or three days, sometimes even shorter, of death, who are
        bound to see bodies. Die police deal with the immediate crisis
        but then withdraw."

12      Conclusions and Recommendations

12.01 The organisation of counselling and support for the bereaved and
      distressed emerged from extreme chaos and confusion. It took a
      considerable length of time to set up the centre at the Boy's
      Club and the end result was oily a qualified success in terms of
      the support that could be offered under the circumstances. The
      support at the gymnasium was better organised and more effective
      although this again took time to establish.

12.02 Rivalry was present between clergy and social workers, as well as
      between those groups and otherspresent. This is an endemic
      feature of disaster situations. It improved as time wore on as
      people had more experience of working together and recognised
      their interdependence. This was facilitated by the commitment to
      joint working from the organisers.

12.03   The counselling task was diffuse and undefined early on and
        people had to negotiate a role for themselves. At the gymnasium
        the role was better defined and more demanding.

12.04 The major recommendation to emerge from this study is that a
      thorough planning process be established. This should include:

           (i)   Meetings between key personnel.

          (ii)   Developing inter-agency communications networks.

         (iii) : Training and preparation of staff to recognise the
                 importance of joint working, and to prepare than for the
                 emotional demands and possible reactions in themselves.

          (iv)   Development of call up procedures.

           (v)   Identification of skills that can be offered; sharing
                 this information; and developing a system of labelling
                 staff.

          (vi)   For the statutory services to address issues related to
                 access to appropriate buildings, and communications
                 during emergencies.

         (vii)   Aftercare for staff involved.

                     POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)


Relatively new concept - developed in the past decade or so as a result of
the increasing awareness of the psychological impact of disasters, including
accidents, physical events such as earthquakes and floods, and the
experiences of war.    Most research has been done with Vietnam veterans,
victims of assault, rape and transport disasters.

Distinguishing Features

PTSD is a psychological reaction occurring in a substantial minority of
those exposed to a severely stressful or traumatic event or circumstance.
This reaction has three distinguishing features (DSM III Diagnostic
Criteria):

1.   Re-experiencing the event - this may take the form of:

     (a)   recurrent and intrusive memories of what happened

     (b)   recurrent dreams about it, or

     (c)   triggered by events or thoughts reminiscent of the event,
           suddenly acting or feeling as if the event were happening
           again.

2.   Numbing and constriction - this may comprise:

     (a)   severe loss of interest in important activities

     (b)   feeling detached or estranged from people, or

     (c)   greatly reduced emotional responsiveness.

3.   Additional, miscellaneous symptoms such as:

     * Junpiness

     * difficulty sleeping

     * guilty feelings about having survived or what the person did
       in order to survive

     * impairment of memory or ability to concentrate

     * avoiding activities that remind the person of the event

     * symptoms get worse when circumstances remind person of the
       event

                                                                    Cont'd...

NB   Despite PTSD becoming a recognised diagnostic category, we still know
     very little. Further research and clinical experience is needed to
     provide clearer information about:

     -   symptom profiles
     -   time scales of development and recovery
     -   the effectiveness of different types of help
     -   Why some people are severely affected and others not.


Classification of Victims of Disaster

Disasters have an impact on a very wide range of people.

Classification of victims of disaster (Taylor & Frazer 1981)

- Primary victims: Those in the front line who have      experiencedmaximum
  exposure to the catastrophic event.

- Secondary victims:     Grieving relatives and friends of the primary
  victims.

- Third-level victims: Rescue and recovery personnel who might need help
  to maintain their functional efficiency during any operation and to cope
  with traumatic psychological effects afterwards.

- Fourth-level victims: The community involved in the disaster, including
  those who converge, who altruistically offer help,   who sharethegrief
  and loss, or who are in some way responsible.

- Fifth-level victims: People whose emotional equilibrium is such that,
  even though not directly involved in the disaster, they may be
  precipitated into states of distress or disturbance.

- Sixth-level victims: Those who, but for chance, would have been primary
  victims themselves, who persuaded others to the course that made them
  victims, or who are in some way indirectly or vicariously involved.

Phases in the Aftermath of a Disaster

1.   Immediate Post-impact Phase     ( 5 - 7 days)

     Although the degree of distress experienced will vary, most supervisors
     and helpers go though similar patterns of acute response.

     Intense feelings such as shock, fear, grief, anger, guilt,
     helplessness, sadness are to be expected in almost everyone, together
     with bad dreams, tiredness, sleeplessness, headaches and anxiety
     reactions. These reactions are entirely normal and do not constitute
     PTSD.                                                  ---

2.   Intermediate Phase    ( 6 - 8 weeks)

     For the majority, psychological reactions will have begun to settle by
     4 - 8 weeks following. An estimated 5% will show evidence of more
     entrenched reactions. In addition others will develop phobias, panic
     disorders, depression, psychosomatic disorders and PTSD, or a mixture.

3.   Long Term Reactions

     Some individuals who show distress in the intermediate phase will
     require long term care and support. Others will only begin to show
     signs of disturbance several months after the event, or on the
     anniversary of the event.

     These reactions may be prolonged (up to 3 years after the event).
     They may be intensified by legal battles for compensation and the
     desire to apportion blame and seek revenge. Some people are more
     vulnerable than others to these reactions, eg parents who have lost
     children or young adults in the disaster.


Appropriate Interventions

1.   Immediately after the Disaster

     Many victims will benefit from individual supportive listening/
     counselling - the immediate opportunity to talk over what has happened.

     Infonnal debriefing can take place in small groups, bringing together
     people who were similarly involved, to talk over their experiences.
     This may involve a review of events leading to the disaster and what
     people experienced and felt.

     Expressing feelings and experiences at this stage can prevent more
     severe reactions developing at a later stage.

                                                                  Cont'd...
                                     - 4 -

     Organised debrief ing - deliberately bringing together groups of victims
     with a skilled facilitator, within the first week or so after the
     event, to review their experiences. Debriefing emphasises the
     normality of people's emotional reactions through sharing and
     structuring feelings and mobilising resources and social supports.
     Instead of opening up areas of personal sensitivity, as in counselling,
     it encourages simple acknowledgement of the existence of personal
     issues and helps people to use existing coping resources to move on.
     For workers and helpers this also involves disengagement from the
     disaster role.


2.   Intermediate Phase

     (ideally, screening would take place during the immediate phase to
      identify individuals vulnerable to longer term distress).

     Individuals who have not recovered within a few weeks require
     assessment to determine the most appropriate type of intervention.
     Need to define precipitating factors and perpetuating factors
     separately, plus context.


Interventions that have been used with Victims:

1.   Follow-up debriefing group sessions to help review progress and air
     ongoing difficulties.

2.   Bereavement counselling - appropriate for grieving relatives, and
     others suffering grief reactions - often related to unfinished mourning
     for a loss which has been triggered by the event.

3.   Behavioural treatments, eg desensitisation, anxiety management.

4.   Cognitive approaches to dealing with excessive irritability,
     inappropriate attributions (eg self blame) and inability to accept that
     the past cannot be changed.

5.   Dynamic psychotherapy where the disaster has triggered or stirred
     unresolved conflicts and issues that have little surface connection
     with the events.

Treatment Issues and Unanswered Questions

1.   Difficulties in establishing a therapeutic alliance and high rate of
     non-compliance have been reported:

     - individuals suffering from PTSD are often ambivalent about receiving
       help and reluctant to receive help from someone perceived to be
       distanced from their traumatic experience

                                                                  Cont'd..
                                     - 5 -

 2.   We don't know what specific therapeutic approaches work best.

 3.   Drug treatment can be a helpful adjunct to psychotherapy in severe
      cases of PTSD:

      - makes it easier for the person to focus on and think through issues
        that would otherwise be far too arousing and distressing.

 4.   Family and group therapy may be important because of changes in
      patterns of relationships.

 5.   Differences in the amount of re-exposure to the scene of the trauma
      may influence how badly people are affected (eg withdrawal from war
      zone vs continuing to live at the site of the disaster).

 6.   Possibility of receiving financial compensation influences resolution
      of distress. Harder to come to terms when there are issues of
      liability than when disaster seen as an "act of God".

 7.   Age influences outcome, eg adolescents may become prematurely aware of
      dangers of life and may have difficulties taking necessary risks in the
      development of a career or relationships. Older people may be
      supported by the predictability of their social roles and
      relationships.

 8.   Therapists may have difficulties empathising with trauma beyond the
      bounds of normal experience.

 9.   Insufficient knowledge exists about the natural history of reactions -
      why do some people appear to get through the acute phase of distress
      successfully, then develop chronic PTSD later?


10.   Important to consider possible negative effects of treatment - for some
      people the horror is too great and therapy becomes a re-living rather
      than a dispelling of nightmares.

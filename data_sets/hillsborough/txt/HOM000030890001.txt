DATED: 080290



           On Saturday the 15th of April 1989 (150489), I was on duty in

        ^ n n e c t i o n with the FA Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough Football Ground

           between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs.

           My pre-match duties involved escorting supporters to the football

           ground frcm the Midland Station.

           Having arrived at the ground at about 2.55pn (1455), myself and PC

           ASHMORE went to the gym to re-join our serial.

           As a result of a' request, I, together with the rest of my serial, made

           my way to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

           On arrival I could see that people were being crushed against the

           fence.   I began to give assistance to fans on the pitch.

           Sate time later I assisted to carry at least two persons who appeared

           dead, on hoardings, to the gym.

           On Thursday the 8th of February 1990 (080290), I saw PC BROWN of the

            West Midlands Police at Force HQ, Snig Hill, Sheffield.     I was shown

            video and photographs taken at Hillsborough on the 15th of April 1989

            (150489).
            On video referenced MAP/7 at time reference 1533.16.21 to 1533.35.24

       I can identify myself in the top right of the picture placing a body

       onto a hoarding.   I do not know the identity of this person, but I

       havs been told by PC BROWN that it is Anthony Peter KELLY (54).       On

       photographs referenced PR7/9, PR7/10 and PR7/11 I can see myself at

       the rear right of the same stretcher party, carrying KELLY across the

       pitch.

       On photographs referenced PR5/32, PR5/33 and PR5/34 I can identify

       mysalf at the front of a stretcher party, carrying a youth whose

       identity I did not know, but I have been told that it was a Kevin

       Daniel WILLIAMS (51) by PC BROWN.        I cannot ranember where I picked

        this youth up from.    G HAYES PC 437

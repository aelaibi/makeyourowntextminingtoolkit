                                   before the n e w season 19.08.89).

*    3      Cou ntin g spectators into self-c ont ain ed pens. Who is going to do it?
            P ol ice or Stewards?  H o w is it to be achieved?  Tickets, E nume rat or etc.



*    4      W r i t t e n agreement b e t w e e n club and police setting out their res pec t i v e
            r e s pons ibi liti es for c rowd safety and c o ntro l and, in particular, for the
            filling of self c ont aine d pens or terraced area and the m o n i t o r i n g of
            s pectators therein.

            Thoughts:              i)    P e rh aps ask clubs for early drafts - take best policies
                                         of each and neg otia te amendm ents to drafts. (Clubs should
                                          be encour aged to adopt grea ter re spon sibilities).

                                   ii) Does it need legal authority?

                                         crowd safety for first few games?

                                  iii)    If the police took on the task there is a danger
                                          of an officer being fixed w i t h other demands - e.g.
                                          a n e c e s s a r y arrest or p r even tin g pitch i nvas i o n etc.

                                  iii)    Phot os are p r o ba bly best m e d i u m as it mi ght be
                                          d if ficult to train e very police officer by w a y of
                                          physi cal demonstration.

         to prevent overcrowding.

         To be identi fied before game and his/her duty k n o w n to all other police
         of ficers and stewards.

         He should be in radio cont act w i t h m a t c h control.

         Thoughts:           i)   This c o u l d be the same officer r eferred
                                   to in 5 above.

         use it, e.g. police, fire brig ade or stewards.

         Thoughts:           i)   Recomm end s not police - a ddit ion al training, and
                                   re spo n s i b i l i t i e s for m a i n t a i n i n g and che cki ng equipment.

                             ii) P a r t i c u l a r l y relevant to SWFC in respect of forthcoming

         im port anc e of o verc r o w d i n g and a ppr opri ate steps for dealing w i t h it.

         Thoughts:           i)   E arliest n o t i f i c a t i o n to grou nd c o nt rol appears to        be
         paramount.



*   28   O p e r a t i o n a l orders to i nco rp o r a t e c o n t i n g e n c y plans for deali ng w i t h any

         be on hand to enable rapid deploym ent to any point inside or outsid e the
         ground.



*   29   O p t i o n to postpone k ick-off remains w i t h officer in comma nd at ground.
         C ro wd safety should be paramount c o n s i d e r a t i o n in decid ing w h e ther to
         e x e r cis e it.
     Thoughts:    i)  Suggest Ground C omm an d e r s m e e t i n g debate the option.          It
     does not lend itself to w r i t t e n instruction.



30. Police contr ol r o o m to have all CCT V m oni t o r i n g av ail abl e to it and record
    of any elect ron ic or m e c h a n i c a l tur nstile counts.

                     facility.



31   Suffi cie nt ope rators in police cont rol r o o m to enable all t r a n s m i s s i o n to be
     dealt with.

     C o m m u n i c a t i o n s ys tem should give prior ity to control.

     Ad d i t i o n a l channels should be available, w h e r e necessary,      to prevent
     ov erc r o w i n d of a i r w a v e s .

     C o n side r s ound -pr oof ing cont rol room.

     Thoughts:         i) N e w 'sub-divisional type'       of s ystem should f acilitate
                           pr iority of control.

                      ii) Dis cussions already in hand about the inab ilit y of a

                            to progress.

                      ii)   Semaphore ought to have some rat iona l basis.             ACPO?
Em e r gen cy services to maintain, through senior nominated

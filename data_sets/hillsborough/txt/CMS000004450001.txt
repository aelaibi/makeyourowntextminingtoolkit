NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

You asked    for Hansard extracts quoting senior Ministers'
endorsement of the national membership scheme as a means of
dealing with hooliganism. I attach extracts quoting: the present
Secretary of State and his predecessor; the Prime Minister; and
the previous Home Secretary. You will notice that Mr Hurd
committed himself fully to the national membership scheme in his
statement on the Hillsborough disaster on 17 April 1989 (col.
2 0 ).
I am copying this to PS/Secretary of State and PS/Mr Moynihan in
case they receive calls from other private offices.

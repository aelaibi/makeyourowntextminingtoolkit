 QS4

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 WHY DID NO ONE TRY TO EMPTY THE TERRACING FROM BACK AS WHEN I CARRIED THE

 INJURED MAN OUT WE HAD FREE PASSAGE. LACK OF PHYSICAL SIGNS SHOW DIRECTIONS,

               S T B M K D S *NC POLICE GIVING 0 IRE< ™ .

LACK OF CROWD ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND               (NOT Q U E U I N G ) .

 APPARENT LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE INSIDE AND THE                        OUTSIDE

 OF GROUND TO CONTROL THE CROWD.

WHY GAME WAS NOT DELAYED.

 IN FUTURE CAN TEAMS WITH LARGER AVERAGE GATES              BE GIVEN THE           MAJORITY

 OF TICKETS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR CROWDS.

 ONCE GAME WAS STOPPED, THE AREA I WAS IN WAS CHAOTIC WITH PEOPLE PANICKING AND

 INDIVIDUAL ACTS, BUT NO OVERALL ORGANISATION.

         is THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 DUE TO LAY-OUT OF       W STAND,     ACCESS     FOR LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WAS TOTALLY

 INADEQUATE.    PEOPLE WERE FUNNELLED INTO TURNSTILES           (ALSO TOO F E W ) .

 NO INDICATION ON TICKET OF SPECIFIC VIEWING POINT.             SIGNS IN GROUND WERE NOT

 OUTSTANDING ONLY    ’G E N T S ’ SIGN.   NO GROUND STEWARDS SEEN THROUGHOUT.

 POLICING OF FANS IN LEPPINGS L_N          AND    GATES WAS   INADEQUATE.    HORSES PRESENT

 WERE SERVING NO PURPOSE IN CROWD CONTROL AND IN FACT CAUSED INJURIES TO

 SUPPORTERS.

 THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PRESS CRITICISM OF FANS TRAVELLING TO AWAY MATCHES

 WITHOUT TICKETS.
        *


 MY OPINION IS THAT WHILE THE FOOTBALL GOVERNING BODIES ALLOW LARGE AMOUNTS OF

 TICKETS TO BE OBTAINED BY TOUTS,       SOME SUPPORTERS WILL TRAVEL KNOWING THAT IF

 THEY ARE PREPARED TO PAY OVER THE ODDS THEY WILL GET A TICKET.

 ALLOCATION OF TICKETS MUST GO TO THE TWO SIDES INVOLVED AND NOT OUTSIDE CLUBS

 ETC.

 THERE IS NO GROUND IN THE COUNTRY AT PRESENT LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD A MAJOR

 SPORTING EVENT.

 LARGER STADIUMS SHOULD BE MADE A PRIORITY.

 AFTER THE GAME WAS STOPPED EVERYBODY SEEMED SLOW TO REACT,       IF THE POLICE

 MANPOWER HAD BEEN USED TO ASSIST TRAPPED FANS AS OPPOSED TO FORMING A CORD*

 SAVED.

 WAS PUT INTO PLACING ROAD BLOCKS AND DIVERSIONS,     THEN   I THINK ITWOULDN'T'

 HAVE BEEN SO MANY WAITING TO GET IN.

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 3)     IF THERE WAS SOME SORT OF LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE CROWD STILL

 WAITING OUTSIDE THEN PERHAPS THEY WOULD HAVE RELAX AND NOT BEEN TOO

 ANXIOUS TO GAIN ENTRY TO THE GROUND.

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF POLICING AND STEWARDS IN THE TUNNEL AREA OF THE

WEST STAND.       THE FENCING ITSELF WAS NOT TO BLAME MORE THE FACT THAT THE

GATES IN THERE WERE FAR      TOO SMALL.

I COULD SEE NO POINT IN      HAVING SIDE RAILINGS IN THE PEN AREAS.

THE PRESS WERE FIRST TO      NOTICE THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG IN THE PENS.,   BUT

    TEAD OF RAISING THE ALARM ALL THEY DID WAS TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE
n ~
POOR PEOPLE AT THE FRONT.

 LIVERPOOL STEWARDS WERE NOT USED. SHEFFIELD STEWARDS WERE.                 THE LIVERPOOL

 STEWARDS WOULD HAVE DIFFERENTIATED BETWEEN DANGER AND TROUBLE SITUATIONS,

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL. OFFENCE?

NO.

053

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

1. DEPLOYMENT OF POLICE FORCES - POLICE WERE ENGAGED MORE SO ON CROWD CONTROL

RATHER THAN HELPING THE INJURED. THE REALISATION OF THE POLICE OF THE DANGER

WAS VERY L A T E . I DID SEE A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL POLICE DOING ALL THEY COULD TO

HELP THE INJURED.     IT WAS JUST UNCO-ORDINATED.

2. THE LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT WAS TO CLEAR THE PITCH WHICH SEEMED TOTALLY

INAPPROPRIATE.

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

PERIMETER FENDCING ARE A NECESSARY EVIL, BUT THE FENCING SEPARATING PENS ON

TERRACES TOTALLY UNNECESSARY.     THE PERIMETER FENCING SHOULD BE MANNED BOTH

INSIDE AND OUTSIDE BY EITHER POLICE OR ST E W A R D S , SO THAT GATES CAN BE OPENED

STRAIGHTAWAY.

THE QUALITY OF THE TICKETS WAS POOR. THE TICKETS ISSUED WERE TOO EASY TO

FORGE. SHOULD BE OF BANK NOTE QUALITY WITH WATERMARK OR HOLOGRAM.

^ C K S    MUST BE MADE ON TICKET HOLDERS BEFORE THEY GET TO THE GROUND    (FOR BIG

MATCHES).

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I C O U L D N ’T CRITICISE THE POLICE AT THAT POINT.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THE SIGNIFICANT THING IS WHY IT WAS TAKING SO LONG FOR PEOPLE TO GE

 THROUGH THE TURNSTILES, AND THE OPENING OF THE GATES WAS DONE IN GOOD FAITH

 BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTGANCES OUTSIDE THE G R O U N D .   I'VE HEARD THAT PEOPLE

 C^ING THROUGH THE TURNSTILES WERE SEARCHED TWICE WHICH IS A BIT IRONIC,          AND

 COULD HAVE CAUSED THE DELAY.

DO YOU HAVE ANY VI EWS OR O B S E R V A T I O N S ON THE WAY THE               INCjtfENT WAS HANDLED,

Ev er yt h i n g was wrong.          Not   enou gh of the   police ij/re assisting.             They were

gear ed towards stopping violence and not a s si st ing                     in the     injured.    The Forest

fans        became aware of the si tu ati on 5-1 0 mj/m> after              the game stopped & there           in

my opinio n was         no   pos sibility of violence,        but still        the    police    continued with

a cordon across           the   pitch,     wh ich was serving    no function.           The    police were   not

 IS THERE AN Y T H I N G THAT YOU WISH TO AD D W HI CH YOU FEEL                      IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUD IC IA L    INQUIRY?

 I d o n ’t believe       that the drink & the            lack of people witho ut           tickets was

 responsible for the disaster & that                    is being blown out of propor tio n by the

 press.        Ma ny fans always       have a few drinks               before atte nd in g any m a t c h and

 people always          go to these games withou t             tickets.

 Just    prior    to kick off there were a number                      of people    in our stand who    did not

 have tickets          for a seat,     but terrace ones.               One of these fans stood near            to us

 ^^.d the gates were opened outside & they just                             come   in.

 The ticket a ll oc a ti on was wrong.               Liverpool          should have had a higher

 p rop ort ion of tickets as they have a higher average attendance.

 I believe       the    'kick off*     should have       been delayed to a ll ow          people to enter

 the ground.

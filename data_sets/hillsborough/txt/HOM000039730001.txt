PERSONAL RECORD CF EVENTS AT HILLSBOROUGH FDOCBALL GROM) CN I^TH APRIL, 1989

I am a Senior Registrar in Diagnostic Radiology in Sheffield. Cn the 15th April, 1989,
I attended the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough. I was at the edge
of the Kop, in the Nottingham Forest end.

'/tei the natch was stopped and spectators frcm the Leppings Lane end carre onto the
pitch, all I saw initially were people who were limping. At this time I did not see
anybody lying cn the ground. However, after what must have been probably 10 minutes,
I realised that the situation was obviously more serious and made rry way down onto
the pitch.

At approximately 3.15 p.m. I went to the Leppings Lane end of the pitch. There were
many bodies round the goal with a large nurtoer of spectators and police. Cnly a small
number of these bodies were being administered to at this time. Having already contacted
a senior police office cn the pitch I set about examining as many of the bodies that
I could. I was then accompanied by a female psychiatric nurse from Liverpool, whose
name I do not knew.

I examined probably up to 20 people. In rry opinion the majority of these were already
dead. Together with the nurse and several other spectators I administered and organised
basic resuscative measures to approximately 6 or 7 people. This comprised of mouth
to mouth resuscitation and external cardiac massage. There was no available oxygen
equipment, airways or any means of suction. Several of the people whom I saw had vomit
within their mouths and throats and would clearly have benefited from suction.

On only one patient did I feel that external cardiac massage and other resuscitative
techniques had been successful. This patient was subsequently transferred to an ambulance
and taken to the hospital. The other people whom I dealt with could not be resuscitated.
There were a great many people standing around, seme of whan were extremely qgitated.
This somewhat hampered the ability to assess any patients who would have benefited
frcm irrmediate resuscitation. The overall situation was obviously very confused at
this point. The only physician that I was aware of at this time was Dr. Purcell, the
Sheffield Wednesday Club doctor. After approximately 20-30 minutes when it had become
apparent that the remaining people at the Leppings Lane and were already dead and
those which had been resuscitated had been sent to hospital, I went dewn to the other
and of the football pitch (the Kop end). I was accompanied by Dr. Purcell and two
nurses frcm Liverpool. Between the four of us we then attempted resuscitation cn 4
more people on the pitch. None of these attempts were successful. By this time a
great many people were being carried on advertising hoardings off the pitch. Several
patients to my knowledge had been transferred by ambulance to the local hospitals.
There was still no oxygen available or any other aids for resuscitation, as far as
I was aware.

Whan it becane apparent that there were no further people for resuscitation at the
Kop end, a police officer then requested that we go into the Sheffield Wednesday g/mnasium
which had been converted into a temporary mortuary.

In the mortuary there were lines of people lying cn the floor. Together with a local
G.P., Dr. Redgrave, I then examined as many of these people as I could. All the people
that I examined within the gymnasium were in my opinion already dead. I examined
approximately 20 people within the g/mnasium. No resuscitative attsnpts were made
within the gymnasium. In each case I certified the person to be dead and notified
the attending policeman that in nr/ opinion the patient was dead and gave the policeman
rry name.

When we were satisfied that we had examined all the people cn the floor I waited for
further instructions frcm the police. No further duties were required of me and at
approximatley 5.45 p.m. I left the Sheffield Wednesday Football ground.

 The points which I feel are important are as follows:

 1. There were no calls via the public address system for medical and nursing staff
 to help. It was only after 10 minutes that I realised frcm the other and of the ground
 that the situation was so grave.

 2. As far as I was aware, there were no aids for resuscitation, such as oxygen, airways,
 or suction device to clear vcmit frcm the mouth.

 3. Assessment of patients cn the field, seme of whom may have been able to be resuscitated
 was hampered by a large number of people, many of them very qgitated.

 I hope this is of some value.   If further information is required I shall of course
 be willing to provide it.

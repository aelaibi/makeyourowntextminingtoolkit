PC. DAVID CHARLES HUBBARD. R 104.
PC. 877

This officer made 2 statements, one dated 28th April 1989 and the other dated 14th June 1989.

DELETED from his statem ent of 28th April 1989:-

"With reference to the enquiry headed by Chief Superintendent Wain, I can answer his questions
as follows:” (p.41)

His statement of 14.6.89 (pp 47-49) detailing his experience in 1988 is not referred to in his
amended report (pp 50-55). That statement describes the organisation in 1988 and how tickets
were checked at the bridge near to Leppings Lane. Supporters were then searched directly in
front of the turnstiles. This implies that a queuing system prevailed. South Yorkshire police
presented a contrary view at the Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest

obviously been                in the         crush.        Many        people were            being        r e s u s c i t a t e d by

ambulance            originally           on the       pitch and then after 20 minutes another

came.          I was a m a z e d        that 2 0 or 3 0 had not b e e n d i r e c t e d onto the

Directly          in f r o n t     of the       turnstiles             I s a w s ev e r a l       Police       Officers

was    still       outside         the     ground and            near      to the        turnstiles,           there was           no

into the         gr ou nd.

Shortly after              the     kick      off    I went          into    the      ground,       I saw no

overcrowding              in the       open area          b e h i n d the        stand and         no a p p a r e n t

RAWMARSH POLICE STATION




1   .          I    reported          for        duty     at    Rawmarsh            Police       Station          at    8.00am

(0800)     on S a t u r d a y ,     15 A p r i l ,        1989       (150^89)         at    this       time       I was       in

full    police      uniform.             I was          to    be    conveyed          directly          to H i l l s b o r o u g h

Football       Ground      by      force          coach       to b e      briefed          for    the    day's          duties.

2   .           I was      part         of       serial       56    under       the    leadership            of PS           2140

Taylor     from      C2.      We     were         under       the       direct      responsibility                 of       Inspector

Newey.

3   .          Following            the      briefing           in      the    North       Stand       at    the       football

ground,       I was    deployed           with         the     rest      of    my    serial       to    Rawson          Spring

Road,    an    industrial            estate            near    to       the    bottom       of H e r r i e s       Road.           At

11.15am       (1115)       that      date,         I    took       up    my    position          to    direct          the

Nottingham          Forest        c o n t i n g e n t , to         suitable          parking          places       allocated

within     this       industrial             estate.

The     football       fans       that       I    saw    were        conducting            themselves             in    a good

natured       and     lighthearted                manner.           The       majority       had       parked          up    and

entered       the     ground       at     an      early        stage.          On    the    apprach          of    3*00pm

.(1500),      the     roads'around                Penistone             Road,       Herries       Road       and       Rawson

Spring     Road,       were       almost          deserted.              There       were     the      odd    latecomers                to

The    next    stage         of     our d u t i e s w a s        to a t t e n d C l a y w h e e l s L a n e T r a f f i c

outside       the     ground         on the P e n i s t o n e R a a d            end.

At a b o u t 3 . 0 5 p m      (1505)         th at     date,      I was        s t o o d w i t h t he        rest    of my

Charlie Brown             shop.           We w e r e      approached           by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t ,      w h o had

just    emerged        from         the    football         gro u n d ,     he    immediately             o r d e r e d us    into

the ground.

At this       t ime    I had         no    idea w h a t       was       happening,          I entered          the g r o u n d

w i t h the    rest       of m y        seri al      together w i t h PS Taylor                     and      Inspector

N e w e y who w e r e        both       in p o s s e s s i o n     of    police       r ad ios.         As    I approached

the    pl a y i n g a r e a       f r o m the     entrance          between          the N o r t h      s t a n d a n d the

S p i o n Kop,      I saw         the     pla ye rs       leaving        the     p i t c h an d a       lar ge      c r ow d of

spectators          on the          pitch around            th e L e p p i n g s      Lane       end    of the        ground.

My    immediate        r e a c t i o n wa s       that      there        had been a pitch                 invasion         by the

Liverpool        fans.            I then       ran a c r o s s      the     p i t c h to      offer       my a s s i s t a n c e ,

t h e re w ere      s o me     police        officers         present          but    not many.

As    I approached             the L e p p i n g s L a n e         terraces          it b e c a m e     obvious        to me

that     the s i t u a t i o n       w a 5 not       of    public        order       but    of    public       safety.            I

ran t o w a r d s     th e     f e n c e d a r e a n e ar        to G a t e 4.          The      g a t e was       o pe n and

se ve ra l    officers            were      pulling        people        from     the      gates with          grea t

difficulty,           due      to    the     fact      that      peo pl e      were     wedged         together across

the    small     e x it      gate.          I realised           that      the     s i t u a t i o n w as     very     se r i o u s

and    I co u l d     not      get .into the g a t e w a y               to help.           I’ l o o k e d    towards        the

fence and        I saw that               people were            crushed against                 the    perimeter

fence.        I was       faced with a situation where                               I could        not      get    to a n y o n e

c r u s h was       present          along        the    length          of t he        terrace        and       some     15 to 2 0

repeatedly              to the       p eo p l e    at the         back      to     ’M o v e    back,       walk        out of the

Whilst        on the w o o d e n            ledge y o u t h s         were        repeatedly           climbing           onto the

onto      the      playing          area and appearing                     to     collapse          they     sought assistance

I do n't         think       the     p e o p l e at the           b a ck     realised          the     seriousness              of the

in c i d e n t at        the      front..         I was        in a h e l p l e s s        situation             so    I then

s t a r t e d to        speak       to     the    pe o p l e    crushed           into     the      fence.            I saw m a n y of

th em     still         conscious with               their        heads         p u s h e d to      one    side a n d their

ears      crushed agai nst                  the    fence.            I encouraged              them       to k e e p their          eyes

op en a n d to           t ry a n d m o v e        their        l i mb s    a n d as       the      crush became               easier

During        the       incident           the w o o d e n      hoarding           broke and myself                    a n d other

The   cr owd at        t he       back       did    ease at         one    stage and            I noticed 2

policewomen ap pea ring                      from    the t u n n e l       at    the     back.         I shouted           to them

to e n c o u r a g e    people          to    l eave     the       terracing          and     for     t h e m to m a k e     their

safety.          After       great       difficulty               I noticed          t ha t   the     two     policewomen

ha d m o v e d    through          the       crowd and were               now       into the        c r u s h e d area.        They

a p p e a r e d to be        receiving             the   same       response          from several                of the     fans.

It a p p e a r e d     to me       t h at     the      fans       d i d not     want      to m o v e       in case t h ey

lost t h e ir         view    of the          proceedings             or the         possibility             of the m a t c h

b e i ng    played.          I also          noticed        one      Police Sergeant                moving         t h r o u g h the

crowd and down               to    the       front,       he a p p e a r e d to be            caught         up    in the     crush

at    one    stage      and       from       my     position         at    the t o p      of the       fence           I directed

hi m to      pull      back       and    try and          pull       o t h e r s b ac k w i t h       him.         Another

I could see            quite       well       t ha t     they      could       go    back,      but PC D a v i e s

I m o v e d b ack          onto      the      pitch and          tried       to a s s i s t       any    p e r s o n s who had

obviously been                in the          crush.        Many     people were               being         r e s u s c i t a t e d by

Police         officers         and am bulance              c rews a n d a l s o            fa ns.       Many        fans were

shouting         and       swearing           on the       pitch blaming              the P o l i c e          for    the     crush

but    I just         couldn't             comment        because       from      entering             the     p i t c h a r e a to

leaving         it    I did          not    receive        any    information               via     radio       or w o r d of

m o u t h as to the             caus e        of    the     crush.

I m u st       have       s p e nt    so me    15 to        20 minutes walking                      around          the    crowd

preventing            fans      from        fighting        amongst          themselves,               firing        i ns ult s

towards         othe r       officers,             myself     and    persons           in g e n e r a l        who    were

pr e s e n t    on the         pitch.

I saw m a n y         fans      and        officers         carrying          bodiesaway            on a d v e r t i s e m e n t

ambulance            originally             on the        pitch and          then after             20 min ute s another

came.          I was       amazed          that     20    or 3 0 h a d not           been      directed             onto     the

anyone asked                  for m ore.

Many     fans        on       the p i t c h w e r e a s k e d      to    leave a n d          get       out     of the way.               I

Several         were       obviously           distressed and                I spen t        t i me     speaking           to t hem

reason with many                     of the        fans and       I am sure'that                  they       di d    not k n o w the

I later      joined a number                of    officers who          ha d f o r m e d     a line a c r o s s       the

ground and assist                re the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t       supporters,           who     left the

ground without           any      incident.

I was      j o i n e d by the         ot h e r   members      of the      serial       and    I again assisted

in the R a w s o n S p r i n g         Road area.            After    the     crowds       had      cleared     I went

spirits there was                no    serious       crowd disorder             or   any     crushing        near the

                At 9.00 am on Saturday,            15th April     1989,       I paraded for duty at

                other members of D Group            we were transported by bus to the ground

       the duties of Serial 17, and details of the parade time location.

       The serial was identified in the order as being under Sub Sector 8,

       and I was      responsible to Inspectors Purdy and Sykes, whom I reported

       to on arrival at‘ ttie ground.*

       At 10*00 am a briefing was conducted in the North St4iid by Chief

       Superintendent D u c k enfield, Supt. Murray and Insp. Beal-        At the

       conclusion of this, arrangerrients were made with 'Inspectors Sykes and

       Purdy for a briefing of the serials, at the Leppings Lane end, at
Vfe-
       11 am    -at the rear of the West Stand.

       The serial was then provided with a snack meal and a drink and I
PiM
       collected a personal radio and earpiece. ' The radio was       checked and

       was in working order.

       At 11,00 am all the serial went to the rear of the West Stand where

       Insp. Sykes briefed the serials as to their specific duties and the

       security of persons entering the ground.         I advised officers as to

       care with searching, and seizure of articles, also action in respect

       of d r u n k s .

       Following this briefing the majority of the serial        remained at the

       rear of the West Stand as no turnstiles appeared to be open for the

       North Stand,       However a short while   later I would say approximately

       11.20— 25 one turnstile opened so 2 officers were deployed to that

       one.     There being quite a number of officers outside the ground at

       this time and very few fans.

       Around 11.45 am ail the turnstiles for the North Stand opened so the

       whole serial was deployed outside on the turnstiles.         2 Officers to

       each and the remaining 2 and myself        initially stood in the triangular

       area formed by the turnstiles wall*        the adjacent shop, and the

       perimeter fence,      the gates of which were opened and pinned feack.          ;

       At this time there were only a few supporters arriving at a,time, and

       officers wree sometimes/under employed with searching.         As is normal '
                                                                        '     PAGE    ■

2 or 3 officers were dfployed together with the coach reception teams

oh Leppings Lane itself.           I believe 3 were actually used, PC 2913,

PC 809 and 8 8 0 . "                                      ?','   -

During this early period I          made arrangements   for black dustbin      bags

to be brought to collect items seized or disposed of by fans entering

the ground.     Normally quite a number of fans are in possession of

cans of soft     drinks b n entering the ground,        these are not permitted

in the ground.         They are given the opportunity to drink or dispose of

the cans.     Also where fans have cans of alcohol the same applies               <

except they are informed to dispose not drink them.

A short while after we had          obtained the bags and labels for property

a number of large plastic           dustbins arrived these were sited in

between 4 turnstiles for the same use as the bags.

Initially as I have stated there were very few fans arrived from

Liverpool and the officers were able to make searches of virtually

every person arriving at the turnstiles without causing any delays on

entering.     Orderly queues were formed but they amounted to perhaps 6

or 8 at one or two turnstiles, all the entrances were not used by the

fans at this time.                                                         ,

During this early period there Were no great problems with the fans

or their behaviour.        The majority consisted of middle aged and family

groups,   there were      light hearted exchanges with them.

From this early st^ge a problem started to arise which later on grew

quite considerably.        The North Stand was     reserved for Liverpool

Supporters with brown ticket® and the turnstiles although numbered

were also lettered A also adja cent to the turnstiles wre plaques

brown in colour about        IS" x 12" at about head height.         From this

period onwards numerous ticket holders came up to me confused as to *

where they should enter the grouhd.           T h e y :did not appear to

understand the significance of the colour coding.                A further c^use of
                                                                       ■ PAGE    4

confusion was the layout of the actual      ticket-     Numerous people asked

for entrance X,Y, M etc,these being the gangway not the entrance,              but

the layout of' thf ticket is such that the gangway,        entrance and row

etc were all in the sanie size print.      Further    confusion was also

caused by ticket holders not knowing which colour related to which

entrance,    i.e. Brown North Stand, Red West Stand, Blue Leppings Lane

terracing.    As a result an increasing number entered the-are# In

front of stiles for the North Stand who wanted other areas of the

ground.                                                         .

As time progressed the number of persons arriving at the ground

steadily increased.       They were arriving on foot,    by coach and service

bus.   Initially they were searched and seen by the officers on coach

reception a n d then came towards us,    quite a number started to arrive

as time   progressed in possession of and smelling of alcohol,         as a,

result the dustbins at the side turnstiles started to fill with empty

or full   cans of beer.     I instructed about 4 or 5 personally to place

part full    cans in the bin.    I did however see other officers engaged

on both North and West Stand turnstiles      instruct fans to put cans and

bottles into the bins.       As the numbers steadily increased the

officers made more selective searches of persons entering.            Orderly

queues were formed and there were no great problems in respect of

maintaining them apart from the confusion over tickets.

However on about 3 or 4 occasions I requested a mounted officer to

sweep the area    in front of the turnstiles   in respect of numerous

groups of youths who arrived without tickets and those who had arrived

and did not want to go in, or were waiting for friends with their

tickets.■

On occasions there were about, 50 or 60 persons milling about and on

one occasion upwards of 100.       The youths without tickets weri

generally 18-24 age group and the ones I spoke with were genfr^aily
                                                                       PAGE

in groups of 4 or 6 in number.     Haunted officers then entered this

area and cleared these groups out of the area and away from the

turnstiles.                                                        •

This   tontinued from approximately 12 noon ttf | woul^ flstiwt# 1330 to

1343 wit hi a Steady fi'ow of fans gradually increasing.           ;

At 1,330' hours PC Wilson and PC Palfrey made 2 seperate arrests       in

respesft of possession of cafinabis,   the officers who had been engaged

on coach reception were brought back and continued with searching.

The procedure carried on for some considerable time after the arrests

the num-bers gradually increasing but we did not appear to be -having

any great difficulties apart from those already mentioned with which

I thought we were coping.     Once the turnstiles were fully m a n n e d and

officers were engaged in searched and queue control.       I adopted a

position about    10-15 feet in front of them checking tickets and

monitoring those not making their way into the ground and non ticket

holders e t c .

I cannot say exactly at what time it was but X could estimate between

2.20 and 2.30 pm the area^ i                          ^uddenly^be came

deluged in a large number of fans the whole environment seemed to

change abruptly from having organised queues and turnstile entry to

being overwhelmed.    The whole mood seemed to change and the make up

of the crowd changing from mixed ages and sexes to a predominantly

male and younger ones.     The proportion of people under the influence

of alcohol also   changed and increased, at a conservative estimate I

would say 30% had had a considerable amount to drink.          The numbers

who were con-fused and agitated of the tickets were considerable.            I

was virtually inundated with enquiries at which entrance they

wanted.   This was adding to the congestion as those who were at the

wrong turnstiles were trying to get back out into Leppings Lane.             As

the numbers increased I was gradually forced further aWay from the’

turnstiles towards the ,perimeter gates and felt completely isolated

form other oflicer#, the only Officers I: could see were mounted on

Leppings Lane    itseif., At one stage          I saw officers engaged on West

Stand turnstiles attempting to close one of the perimeter gates to

ease t h # crush dri those turnstiles,          they managed it, once but had t#

open it again.

The numbers of fans seemed unending and it was virtually a river of                             .

fans flowing towards the turnstiles.               At this point I saw a number of

yriuths had climbed onto the metal            partition between West Stand                      t

turnstiles and the Leppings Lane terracing they were making their way

along the top of it and over the wall              into the ground.          I would say

about ten or twenty climbed over as I could see at this time.                          I

radioed control at this time and received a reply that they would see

what they could do.          A short while later I s a ^ I n s g j y ^ ^ ^

stood on top of the wall assisting more fans over

As the numbers    increased the presence inside the a r e a between the

perimeter fence and the turnstiles became immense.                    In fact at one

stage together with some other supporters               I feared we would foe

crushed behind the perimter, gate if it gave way, this being because

it was locked open with a pin on the floor and a bar across the top.

The pressure was such that this top bar was flexing and bending at

times and we feared if it gave way we would be crushed between the

gate on the fence.          The numbers of fans continued to rise and there

appeared no end to them .           As I was talking to a fan regarding

tickets    I felt a spray of what I thought was water and a push from w y

left.     The man at my side, then said "You were lucky that can just

missed your h e a d ”     I saw that h e } a man dressed in a white trench

coat was covered,In a liquid.             He then said something about t h e y ’re

throwing cans fronS the back, meaning Leppings Lane.

I can recall during this period also seeing:a surge of* supporters
"tftrough the perimeter gat e about 6 or 8 people away and they cut

through the crowd like a knife forcing a how wave of pressure to the

side.    I would estimate there Were about 20 or 30 in the group and

they were chanting and waving their arms         in the air.   I could see

that a fair proportion had cans in their hands.           These w«re not the

only ones with beer cans I saw during this period*, but due to the

crush and sheer weight of numbers there was little I could do apart

from try and calm the ones near me down.

Although I knew there should be quite a number of officers around I

did during this period feel very isolated and at this time could see

no one apart from Insp. Be nett on the wall,        some mounted officers in

the crowd on Leppings Lane, Supt. Marshall on the bridge          parapet and

another officer on the roof of a police vehicle In Leppings Lane near

to the s h o p .

My radio at this time seemed to be working,         but as often not and I

could hear shouts to open gates but due to the noise and officers at

one stage trying to close the perimeter gate it is hard to say if it

was them or the radio.        Shortly after that my earpiece became

detached during the crush and I cannot recollect any other

transmissions.

The situation was then as I have described and appeared to be getting

worse with confusion over tickets,         fans pushing and shouting etc and

I was literally at tiroes fearful        of my life if I had fallen over.       I

was unable to make any headway through the crowd to check to see if

the officers on         the turnstiles were alright as    I could not see orget

to them from where       I was.   The   next thing that   happened was that Gate

A opened, which         is situated to the left of the    North Stand

turnstiles.        It   was then atf if someone had let   the plug out,   the

pushing and crushing in the area in front of these turnstiles
                         iU
virtually abated with large numbers surging through that open gate and
into the North Stand area*

It was ft,this    point that PC 2933 Wadsworth joined me.and said that

they had had tt> climb through the turnstiles for their safety.                 The

crowd then eased off completely a n d t h e       queues at the turnstiles

returned with an elderly       gent who had     been stood with me for safety

near the fence joining a       queue of about 20 at the right hand

turnstile and by this time Gate A had           closed again.      I would say it

only remained open for 4       or 5 minutes at the most.

Shortly after the gate had closed and the queues reformed a number of

officers   ran from Leppings Lane aind in through the turnstiles.                I

could hear nothing on my radio but heard one of them shout that there

had been a pitch invasion and all ava U a b l e a 3 s ^ t ^ c ^ ^ w j g q u i £ e d _

inside.    Together with PC Wadsworth and other officers I entered the

ground by climbing over the tUrnstiels,           turned right and ran across

the back of the West Stand towards the corner with the South stand.

As we ran past the tunnel entrance to the terracing and in the area

at the back of the stand I can say that there appeared to be nothing

untoward and there was       really quite a marked absence of people           in

this area.

As we went to the pitch via the rear of the Police C o n t r o 1 I gathered

as many of my serial together as I could and it included I think

PC's 2933, 3027, 346, 8S0 43, 809 and some o t h e r ,of f i c e r s .

We entered the playing area from the South Stand and I am virtually

certain that the game had stopped at this time but I cannot be sure.

I looked across the Leppings Lane end and could see officers stood on

the fencing gesticulating to the crowd to move over to the left and

to move back.     The terracing arei itself appeared full.              I went to

the central    pen areal behind the goals pens 3 and 4 and saw Insp.

Purdy stood on the perimeter fence tyring to get the fans to move

across.    At this time I did not appreciate what was happening.                He
                                                                                  '• '• ■■■    PAGE •' 's

               shouted to take a serial     into pen 2 so I collected a group of

               approximately 10 officers together and went to gate 2 which was

               open.   As we went to enter the jat e I saw a young girl being                 carried

               over the head of the fans and towards the gate, some then shouted that

               she was? injured.    It was at this point that I realised dr started to

               realise that something drastic was wrong.         When the girl had cleared I

               entered Pen 2 via gate 2 and we formed a cordon to push the fans back

               away from the gate and made our way towards the railing fence

               separating Pen 2 from 3.      As I reached the fencing and looked over

               into Pen 3 I he c rowd seem to part and move back away from the front,

               I could then see what I can only described as a huge pile of bodies

               stacked 4 or 5 deep in palces,        laid on thefloor at the rear of the

               perimeter wall.     They were as deep as the 2nd step up on the

               terracing about half way along I could see a y o u t t ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ o u t £nom the

               bodies who appeared to be trapped by his legs with the bodies up as

               far as his waist,    he was shouting frantically for help.

               I remained in Pen 2 and PC 609 and 2913 Climbed over into the                   central

               pen 3 to render assistance as were other officers who had entered the

               central pen.    Those officers and some of the fans t h e n ;passed the

               injured and dead to myself and other officers and fans and we passed

               them out onto the field where further first aid could be given.                    I

               cannot say how many were dead or injured but I can recollect passing

               only 2 or 3 who were conscious over and well over 8--1Q who were

               either unconscious or dead.       As well as by this route 1 saw people

               being .carried towards the rear ofthe terracing        and out onto the

     fWSr'H    pitch via gate 3,

of    t‘o0^    When I first   looked into Pen 3 the only place I saw bodies             or injured

               persons was behind the perimeter wall and in front of the broken crowd

               barrier on the terracihg.      I did not see any injured on the floor or

     <         otherwise   in Pen 2 apart from the      young girl being carried        overhead.
The persons; who I assisted to carry out varied in age from teenagers

bf both sexes to I belifev© one man I would say was in his 30*s with

a ’white shirt and jeans on.                                       ,

After we had removed all the injured and dead from the pen I r e t u r n s ^

to the. p i t c h Area.   At this time   I   saw that there were numerous

person# being treated and carried away on stretchers by both Police

and fans.     I then saw fnas ripping down the advertising hordings from

the West Stant,     again initially the reason for it was not apparent,

but it soon became evident they were being used as makeshift

stretchers.      I then went   into Pen 3 with other o f f i c e r s and helped

pass these onto the pitch.        At this time it was apparent that numbers

of the fans still did not realise what was happening as some must

have thought we were going to arrest those taking the hordings down,              s

they had to be told forcibly by other fans what was happening.

We then remained in the pen and kept the fans away from the clothing

and be 1ongi ns which were piled at the front of the terracing.             At some

stage a Scenes of Crime Officer entered the pen in plain clothes and

started to photogrpah the scene.         The crowd went literally W ild and

surged forwards to get hold of him,           from what was shouted I believe

they thought he was press.        We had to fight our way out of the pen

with the officer and withdrew for safety.

After leaving the pen I returned onto the pitch area where there wre

numerous police officers a lot of whom were obviously distressed I

gathered what officers       I could of my serial together and as there

appeared nothing else we could do on the pitch and in the absence of

any instructions we returned to the rear of the West Stand where we

were deployed as per the original        orders on supervising exit of

supporters when they w e r r relessed,                         '             ’

Obviously large numbers were distressed at what had happened *«ts they

left but there were considerable numbers who sti IT appeared w&rse for

         We remained on this duty until all the crowd had dispersed and the

         removal of, bodies from a temporary mortuary in th» lane outside

     •   Leppings Lane had taken place.               \                ‘       -

         submitting my debriefing sheet and radio the serial                                 returned to

         eiaywheelfc Lan© for standby and awaiting transport at 6pm,                                     The* serial

         finally went off duty at 7 pm at 'Eccltfsfield Police Station^.

         I can say tht I have worked duties at Hillsborough football ground

         over the past six years and the majo rity of those duties have been

         performed at the Leppings Lane find of the ground.                                 Whilst at D

         Division X was engaged on escort of fans from the City Centre and

         subsequently in the terracing.           Whilst at F Division since July 1988

         I have worked a number of matches and have invariably worked on the

         turnstiles for the North Stand.              I have never experienced such a

         sudden mass influx of spectators as happened on this occasion.

      Ian,

      As requested by Alan Walker I attach draft declaration. 1 believe this is agreed but have not yet had
      confirmation. I also attach transcript o f exchange between Court and Counsel on 24 March. I believe
      that it may be sensible for the Police Authority to see this, particularly the comments o f Laws LJ at
      pp 3 and 5 and Cresswell J at p 6.

                   LORD JUSTICE LAWS: Ms Ba^cendale,         I am sorry but before you
• c
                        start there is a preliminary matter I want to raise.                          We

                        had a fax from Mr Jones which I have temporarily lost

                        saying that,     this is right Mr Jones, you m a y be required

                        to be in their Lordships House this afternoon and so you
      D
                        would wished to be released after lunch today and be

                        heard tomorrow morning.         In the ordinary way the court

                        would at. once accede to that but I have a deeper

                        problem.     At the moment I do not understand what your
      E
                        client's legitimate        -- and I emphasis that adjective                  --

                        interest in these proceedings i s .

                   M R JONES: M y Lord, would you like me to deal with that?

      F                          If I deal w it h the matter of history in the

                         instant matter.        W h e n leave was granted in this case by

                        Latham J.      We - - I a m talking from recollection                     leave

                        was granted on Friday 12th February.                     We had serr.     ■ n

                         wished to be heard in opposition to the a p p l i c a t i o n              or

                         at least asserting an interest-                 Now,         Latham J gave

                         leave and in his order he directed that Miss Adlington

                         be joined as the second respondent.

                                  That having happened,         and no objection being taken
    B
                         to her status as interested p a r t y in any affidavit or

                         skeleton arguments that I have seen from any of the four

                         parties involved in this case - - I have not come here

                         prepared wit h a detailed argument to justify my
•   c
                         presence.

                 LORD JUSTICE LAWS*           I tell you bluntly why I think there is a

                          difficulty wh ic h has led me to raise the matter before

                          hearing any other a r g u m e n t .    5fou are representing a
    D
                         prosecutor here.         If M r Duckenfield and Mr Murray's

                          challenge made yesterday fails the prosecution will

                          continue.      I should have thought that for a prosecutor

    E                     to seek to undermine the funding- of his defendant                                is

                          contrary to the proper role of any prosecutor,                                private

                          or public.

                 MR JONES: Well, my Lord,            I am prepared to meet that argument

     F                    Spontaneously if your Lordship thinks that I should.

                  LORD JUSTICE LAWS:          It has to be dealt with at some time.

                  MR JONES: My Lord,          I would prefer since it is,                           if I m ay say

                          so, an unexpected point and not a point that has beer-

    G                     taken against me by any of applicants in this case,

    A
                          to develop that argument in the course of my submissions

                          as second respondent.        My Lord,      it is something which,

                          on the face of it, raises questions of principle that

                          I would like to look at rather than deal with the matter
    B
                           in an entirely spontaneously.

                  LORD JUSTICE LAWS: That,            I understand, Mr Jones,                   and I will

                           certainly afford you a proper opportunity to deal with

                           the point if you feel that it is not satisfactory to
•   c
                           deal with it spontaneously.         But you use the expression

                           "in the course of your s ub m is s io n s”, you should not

                           assume at this moment that the court will permit any

                           submissions to be made by you upon this matter.                              I am
    D
                           not excluding it.

                  M R JONES:       Yes.    My Lord,   I have made my position clear.                           My

                           Lord, having been joined as a respondent,                        in my

                           respectful submission,       the normal consequences that
    E
                           would follow from that is that we would be able to make

                           submissions about the matters unless the reasons or

                           issues become narrower by that point.

    F              LORD JUSTICE L A W S : A n d appeal if the side you are on loses?

                   MR, JONES: My Lord, yes.           It would follow.

                                    I can, m y Lord, make some preliminary observations

                           about the matter if it would assist.

                     however,     did not have in mind that your clients wou l d be

                     putting forward any arguments which were the arguments

                     of the Police Authority.       You would simply be there to

                      client and no one else.      That would be the normal                 course

                     that one would expect of Lhe second respondent.                       So

                      respondent because that was afforded to enable you to

                      discrete point that your clients felt you ought to

                      raise.

                 MR JONES: My Lords I a m grateful for the indication and

                      I will put that argument tomorrow morning,

                      pointed out,     the court has your skeleton and I would

                      encourage you to reflect on the position and the role of

                      a prosecutor and the importance of the position taken by

     F                a prosecutor.       It.would be most extraordinary in my

                      experience if any prosecutor attacked the funding of the

                      defence.

                     the court for the indulgence shown for M r Shaw and

                     myself yesterday afternoon.

                     which hangs over from yesterday?                 My Lord,           you may have

                    Lordships by the two primary parties.

                LORD JUSTICE LAWS; At present you are here seeking leave or

                    you have leave?

                MR HARRISON:      We do not have leave yet, my Lord.                       We are at
    B
                        that stage*    We felt that we had to apply to become

                    parties in the case because one of the points taken by

                    Mr Jones was that the Chief Constable had no l o c u s -

                    A lthough we wondered about that as a point we felt that
•   c
                        there was a danger that if that point succeeded these

                     proceedings would fail for that reason.                         We undoubtedly

                        do have locus because we are keenly affected b y the

                        decision of the Police Authority.
    D
                LORD JUSTICE LAWS:        If the locus point is bad then what, would

                        your position be?

                M R HARRISON: At the moment we feel that we are here,                              we do

    E                   have an interest and we may have supplementary arguments

                        n o w on the way in which we have both between us prepared

                        our submissions.      Though there is not a complete

                        identity of approach.      Our preference is that now we

    F                   have made the application we stand by it and invite you

                        to give us leave.

                LORD JUSTICE LAWS:        I follow that but it is prima facie

                        undesirable to have multiple applicants in a judicial

                       right way of dealing- with it in the special

                       circumstances of this case would be to give yon Isave.

                       But clearly if the challenge succeeds Ms Baxendale would

                       perhaps we ought to address this question of locus

                       immediately while M r Jones is here?

                  MR HARRISON:      M y L o r d , before you move onto that m a y I say

                       that what M r Jones has said this morning about arguing
    p
                       the justification for his presence here is obviously

                       going over to tomorrow morning and we do have a very

                       keen interest, in listening to what he has to say about

    E                  that.     We will have to be here tomorrow morning for that

                       reason alone.

                  LORD JUSTICE LAWS: Yes, but the question of locus

                       immediately affects the imminent course of these

    F                  proceedings since on it hangs or may hang the question

                       whether you should have leave at all.

                                Mr Jones,       are you content,       does the Chief

                       Constable lack, the standing to bring that application?

    G             MR JONES: My Lord,        clearly this is not a matter I have

                       looked at since the affidavit was drafted.

    A
                 LORD JUSTICE LAWS:         It is in your skeleton argument,                       is it

                      not?

                 MR J o n e s ; Our skeleton argument says that the matt er is

                      academic because these applicants were coming before the
    B
                      court.    M y Lord,         nobody has told me this morning or

                      yesterday that it was going to be argued that this '

                      matter should               dealt with as a preliminary matter,
        I
                      I thought it had all gone because my learned friends
•   c
                      have made application in their own right and were coming

                      before the court as applicants-                     That being the case,             in

                      m y submission,       the point is academic.

                 LORD JUSTICE LAWS:          It is not academic in this sense.                       If the
    D
                      Chief Constable does not have locus standi and since

                      M r Murray and Mx’ Duckenfield plainly do that would be a

                      reason for giving leave to the individual officers.

    E                 Obviously there is an arguable point here.                            Whereas if

                      Mr Baker does have locus there might be a question

                      whether it is necessary for M r Harrison to bring the

                      proceedings at all.

    F                          However,      subject to my Lords and what other

                      counsel have to say,               I am inclined so that we can get on

                      w ith the case to grant leave to Mr Harrison and any

                      consequences of dual applicants can be dealt with by way

    G                 of costs or otherwise appropriately later.

                               Does anyone one want to say anything about that?

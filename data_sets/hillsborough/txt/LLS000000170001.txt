28th March 1990


Dear Liz,



Thank you very much for your letter about the Courts and Legal Services
Bill.   Like you, I feel very strongly that Clause 8 should be amended
in order to update the levels of bereavement damage.  As  you  know,  I
have made direct representations to the Lord Chancellor and to the Home
Secretary and I will be happy to pursue this further in the House.

At Second Reading it is customary for only the spokesman of my Party to
be called in the debate, in this case it will probably be Alex Carlile
QC.   When the Bill returns for its Report Stage there would be no
impediment to my being called if the matter remained unresolved.

I have taken the precaution of writing to Alex informing him of your
concerns and I will also try and have a word with him before the Debate.
Thank you for setting out the arguments so cogently.

With kind regards,

Yours sincerely,




DAVID ALTON MP

  2.SOW      representations he has received about the present levels of

            compensation payable under the Administration of Justice Act

            1982; and if he will make a statem ent.

MEMBER'S CONSTITUENCY:              LIVERPOOL, MOSSLEY HILL             (S<5cLD)


ANSWER      THE ATTORNEY GENERAL: The Solicitor General and I, as

            well as the Lord Chancellor, have received a number of le tte rs

            from members of the public expressing their concern about the

            present level of breavem ent damages which may be awarded

            under the Administration of Justice Act 1982. The Solicitor

            General announced in May 1989 during the C om m ittee stage of

            the C itizens’ Compensation Bill (Official Report, Standing

            C om m ittee C, 3 May 1989, col. 21) th a t the Lord Chancellor

            would be reviewing the sum specified in the 1982 A ct. Since

            then, the Lord Chancellor has been studying the question

            whether it would be appropriate to raise the sum and, if so, to

            what new level, and he will be issuing a consultation paper

            shortly.

Mr Forth
I have been asked to reply:


The Chief Trading Standards Officer for the City of Liverpool
asked     the Director General of Fair Trading                               to    look     into the

Director General hopes to be able to respond in the near future.

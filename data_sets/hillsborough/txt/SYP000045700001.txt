HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

The Inquiry office will close formally on Friday 9 February.
Jonathan Sweet and I will be here until then. After that time, I
shall be on leave, but my secretary,                 will be here
for a short while to deal with any residual correspondence.

It would be of help, therefore, if we could clear 6p any
outstanding business over the next week.

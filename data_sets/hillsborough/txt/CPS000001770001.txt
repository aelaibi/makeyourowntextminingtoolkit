I've consulted with Chris and we are in agreement on one small suggested amendment, which is to the last line
on page 2. We consider that the phrasing of the example would appear more meaningful if it was changed to
"...or where, although the offence may be serious, the defendant is terminally ill)."

Other than that small point we agree with the rest of the draft letter and also counsel's suggestion that it should
come from you.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY INTERIM REPORT:   A DVANCE COPIES



As you know, Ministers agreed yesterday that publication of
Lord Justice Taylor's interim report would go ahead at 11 am on
4 August and that CFRs would be released in advance at 9.30 am that
day.  The arrangements we have made on a provisional basis for
Chief Superintendent Cornmftll of H M Inspectorate of Constabluary at
Sheffield to issue advance copies at Sheffield at the same time as
they are being issued in London can therefore be confirmed.

HMSO have confirmed today that 30 copies of the Interim Report will
be ready for collection by the Chief Superintendent at 9 am on
4 August from W Harteley Seed, 154-160 West Street, Sheffield.
You have told me that Mr Cornmill will then set up his base in
Committee R oom 4 at the Old Town Hall in Surrey Street, Sheffield
for the purpose of issuing advance and courtesy copies to parties to
the inquiry and to certain other individuals and organisations as
set out in the attached schedule.

I am grateful to you and to Mr Cornmill for your help in all this.

      THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

      Thank you for copying me your letter of 5 June to the Attorney General setting out
      your proposals for an independent examination into the alleged new evidence
      concerning the Hillsborough disaster.

      Such an examination would seem to be a sensible way of addressing continuing
      public concern. I have no objections either to your proposed terms of reference or
      to your preference for a judge to lead the examination,

>     Copies of this letter go to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, th e Lord
      Chancellor, the President of the Council, the Minister Without Portfolio, the
      Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and Sir Robin Butler.




                                                                        THE RT HON CHRIS SMITH MP

          Dear

          Thank you for recent letter to the Prime Minister which has been
          passed to this department in view of our responsibilities for the
          Safety of Sports Grounds Act. I apologise for the delay in
          replying to you.

          As you are probably aware Lord Justice Taylor, in his Final Report
          on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster, recommended that spectators
          should only be admitted to seated accommodation at matches played
          at sports grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
          1975. He stated that this should apply to teams in the Third and
          Fourth Division of the Football League, such as Scarborough FC,
          from August 1999. Whether or not the club chose to implement this
          recommendation prior to this date is a matter for them to decide.
          However, it would appear to be a logical step, bearing in my mind
          they will have to provide seated accommodation only by 1999, for
          the newly built stadium to be all seater.

                                             Yours sincerely




                                             MR S BILBE

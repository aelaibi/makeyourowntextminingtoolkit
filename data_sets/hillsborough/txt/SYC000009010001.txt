Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990_.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the death
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified m
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the C o r oners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners* Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.     I am at present engaged m considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses w h o m you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in considering whether you w i s h to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

 I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
 names fo r consideration is n o t h i n g more than that, and that the decision as
 to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

 I w o u l d be grateful if you c o u l d respond as soon as possible. If I have not
 heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
 submit.

 V n iiis s   faithfully

tear           Sire,

Re: Brio Hankin (deceased). No.29*
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not-to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M«Coroner.

                    Dear Sirs,



                    ERIC HANKIN DECEASED
                    DOB; 26»10;55
                    Date-of Death; 15.4.89

                    We have been consulted by the family of the above named who died at the
                    F A Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on the above date.         Would you please
                    note our interest in connection with the adjourned inquest and advise us
                    in due course as to when the hearing is to be re-opened as we will be representing
                    the family at that time.     If you can give us any assistance at this stage
                    as to general indications as to procedure that is to be followed in connection
                    with these inquests it would be most welcome.

                    Would we, for example, be right in assuming that they will not be re-opened
                    until there has been a judicial enquiry, or are the inquests to be dealt
                    with independently of that enquiry?



                     Yours faithfully,

          Hankin       through the post mortem report.      I have noted the conditions set

Dear Mr. Sinms,

Res S U C   hanktn   (deceased).

I have had a letter from the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton=
(B.C. Alexander) informing me that you have agreed to take
Mrs, n»nirtn through the post mortem report, if this is
forwarded to you.

I would he grateful if you would please confirm that this
is correct.

I should also sake it clear that it is not ray normal practice
to release post mortem reports prior to their presentation
at the Inguest. However, I have decided in the esse of the
Hillsborough Disaster that subject to the post mortem report
■being treated as provisional, and therefore subject to amendment
and alteration until such time as it is given or produced in
evidence at the Inauest, and subject also to it only being
used for the purpose of bereavement counselling and legitimate
     proper legal proceedings, and subject to it being otherwise
kept confidential until it eomes into the public domain, I
am prepared to release these*

 If you can confirm that you would be prepared to accept
 the post mortem report on the conditions mentioned above,
 I will arrange for a copy to be sent to you.

 Tours sincerely,



 S.L.Popper,
 ELM.Coroner

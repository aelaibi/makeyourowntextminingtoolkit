Dear Mr Pyne

Hillsborough Scrutiny - Amended Statements

I refer to your facsimile letter of 5 May 1998 enquiring about three statements made by
three police officers. This reply has been prepared in some haste as you ask that a
response be forwarded before the debate in the House of Commons on Friday 8 May.

Police Sergeant John Morgan’s details were entered onto the HOLMES computer system
twice, an operator error, this resulted in him being allocated two nominal numbers N13 and
N 4 3 4 . The statements he provided were also registered twice, also resulting in them being
allocated two document numbers, R30 and R267. Both these numbers refer to the same
report, a copy of which should already have been placed in the House of Commons.

I will forward by post the statements of Superintendent Graham McKay and Inspector
Hand-Davis. At 20 pages in total they are too lengthy to send by fax. They were not
supplied earlier due to an oversight. In our vast amount of Hillsborough Disaster related
material, some items are occasionally mis-filed for short time.

If I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to telephone me.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines

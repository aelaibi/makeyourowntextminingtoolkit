In preparing your final submission you may find the-following papers
helpful.

1.    The 'observations' that were provided at part 5-18 of
      the original submission on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police
      (big blue ring binder).  Whilst such observations preceded the
      oral evidence they continue to be r e l e v a n t .

       The 'observations' have been separated from the file, copied and
       are attached.



2.    Our responses to the Treasury Solicitor's 'salmon' letter dated
      9 May 1989 which, again, anticipated the oral evidence.

       Copy attached.


3.    In reviewing the transcripts of the Inquiry's examination of South
      Yorkshire Police Officers a number of 'criticisms' have been
       identified.  These criticisms were drawn up into a schedule with
       the internal recommendations that may follow as a result.

       The same points have now been addressed retrospectively and a
       series of papers offering explanation/justification/mitigation for
       24 of the 33 'criticisms' are attached.




As a postscript the Chief Constable, Mr Wright, is able to see you in the
early part of next week (Monday 3 July - Wednesday 5 July) to discuss the
written submission at a time convenient to you.

        5.I8       Observations

        5.18.1     It is not felt appropriate   in this submission to draw

                   any definitive conclusions   or to attempt to identify    the

                   cause of the tragedy from the (necessarily) limited

                   amount of information available to the Force.       Rather,

                   the Chief Constable is content to make a number of

                   observations which he feels may be pertinent to the

                   Committee of Enquiry



        5   18 2          Every conceivable care and effort was taken

                          at the pre-planning stage to provide a

                          sufficiency of police resources to deal

                          with the normal (or anticipated) oper­

                          ational problems associated with a major

                          sporting event.



         ej jg ^    (b)   Such arrangements have been implemented

                          on many previous occasions and have been

    f                     found to be entirely satisfactory.   Indeed,

    ^                     the 1988 semi-final involved the same

                           teams "and the event passed without inci­

                          dent, as evidenced by the statement of

                          Inspector R. Walker, who was present at                  STATEMENT
                                                                                   68
                           that location.



         5.18.4     (c)   The manner in which sections of the stadium

                           were segregated between visiting suppor­

                           ters was based not only on historical
      «




                     precedence, but primarily in order to pro­

                     tect law abiding spectators and local

                     residents (in accordance with the recommen­

                     dations of the Popplewell Enquiry) in this

                     highly urbanised and environmentally con­

                     gested area by minimising the opportunity

                     for conflict and violence between the

                     minority of opposing spectators who regard

                     such actions as being normal and acceptable.




£   5 .18.5    (d)   Saturday 15 April 1989 was a warm and

                     sunny Spring day, which should have pro­

                     vided the perfect atmosphere for a major

                      sporting attraction.   Instead, however,

                      it would appear that many visiting spec­

                      tators used this as an opportunity to

                      find local public houses and off licences

                      where they could purchase and consume

                      alcohol, to the extent that in so doing

                      their arrival at the stadium was seriously

                      delayed.



               (e)    The situation was exacerbated by the
    5 - 18.6
                      obvious influx of a large number of Liver­

                      pool supporters who did not have a ticket

                      to gain admission, and whose presence

                      seriously aggravated the worsening situa­

                      tion at the Leppings Lane turnstiles as
i: '
K'
                            the time approached for the game to

                            commence.



         5 .I8 . 7   (f)    Despite substantial police resources which

                            had been allocated for the event, senior

                            officers found themselves suddenly and

                            unexpectedly overwhelmed by several

                            thousand spectators who had converged on

                            the Leppings Lane entrance within a few
 iT -
                            minutes of the designated time for kick-

     £                      off, many of whom being the worse for

                            drink embarked upon a determined course

                            of action, the aim of which was to enter

                            Hillsborough Football Stadium at all cost;

                            irrespective of any danger to property or,

                            more importantly, the lives and safety of

                             others.



          5.18.8      (g)   Faced with the immediate danger which had

                             arisen, senior police commanders had to

                             make an instant operational decision to

                             protect those involved from death or

                             serious injury.
The senior officers in command did not

shed their responsibility; but rather

embarked on a (course of action which

they knew presented certain risks.       Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield took account

of all the information which was then

available     and decided that ~

       (i)     if the gates were not opened

             then casualties WOULD occur;

      (ii)    if the gates were opened

              casualties MAY occur.

 Based on    this reasoning, the decision was

 taken to    open the gates, and in so doing,

 the immediate danger to the life and

 safety of those at risk was relieved.

 Many police officers have indicated in

 their statements their total support for

 the initial decision by senior police

 commanders to open the gates.     Typically,

 PS 1757 Burns,    a serial supervisor, states

 in his concluding paragraph that     being

 on duty in the inside of Leppings Lane,

  seeing and hearing the mass of the crowd

  outside, I agree in full with the actions

  taken by Superintendent Marshall.      I saw

  the state and pleading of spectators

  entering the ground.    I am certain if

  these gates had not been opened, many
    *
                would have died outside the turnstiles.

                I myself became very apprehensive for my

                safety shortly after 2.^5pm.   Despite the

                fact that additional resources were

                deployed to try to contain that situation,

                the best efforts of those officers were

                not successful.



5.18.10   (i)   Police officers were later suddenly faced

                with a situation, the true nature of

f               which did not become fully apparent until

                tragically the bodies of the deceased

                were recovered from the West Stand

                 terrace.   Accounts provided by officers

                 nearest to the scene indicate that the

                 crush may have occurred as a consequence

                 of lines of spectators swaying backwards

                 and forwards.    It is a fact that by 3-05pm

                 the spectator 'pens* on the West Stand

                 terraces were apparently filled to capacity

                 However, a number of officers at the scene

                 refer to the fact that on their arrival,

                 despite the crushing at the front of the

                 'pens', spectators only a few yards away

                 towards the rear were totally unaware of

                 what was taking place, and were engrossed

                 in the spectacle on the field, whilst the

                 tragedy unfolded within a few yards from
 6
                  where they were stood.   One officer (PC

                  Pearson) considers that the first body                        STATEMENT
                                                                                38
                  which was recovered had been dead for

                  some considerable time, whilst another

                  officer (PC Smith), who was nearer the                        STATEMENT
                                                                                49
                  scene of the tragedy than any other

                  officer, can draw no association between           "   ,, ,

                  the crush at the front and any "great

                  influx" of spectators into the 'pens'.       , ,



                  Once it became evidence that serious

                  injuries had occurred, police officers

                  acted totally selflessly in their efforts

                  to help and rescusitate victims, in

                  conditions of congestion, threats, abuse,

                  and in some cases, physical violence.




5.18.12     (k)   The help and assistance provided by many

                  spectators is worthy of the highest praise

                  and should be a matter of public record.

                  Once the full extent of the tragedy be­

                  came clear, a sense of grief descended

                  upon the stadium and spectators rapidly

                  provided improvised stretchers for those

                  who were dead and injured.




5 - 18.13   (1)   Regretably, however, it must also be a

                  matter of public record that within the
                                                    ,-t

V
v
                          crowd during that fateful afternoon was

                          an unruly element of individuals, whose

                          actions were clearly influenced by alco­

                          hol.    Such was the degree of intimidation

                          that there was evidence that certain

                          stewards discarded their identification

                          at the crucial time, thus negating their

                          presence in any official role, and any

                          capacity to steward or direct the large

i .                       number of spectators.

    #
        5.18.14     (m)   The decision not to inform the crowd of

                          the true nature of the occurrence was

                          taken by the Commander in charge of the

                          stadium, in order to ensure that the

                          immediate area outside the stadium re­

                          mained relatively free from congestion

                          to allow those who were injured to be

                          transported as quickly as possible to

      t                   hospital.



                    (n)   Despite the scale of the tragedy, resources
          5.18.15
                          were quickly organised, temporary mortuary

                          facilities and a Casualty Bureau were set

                          up     and, in a little over an hour all the

                          casualties had been transported from the

                           scene.
The South Yorkshire Police has been deeply involved with

the tragic events which occurred on Saturday 15 April

1989.   Police officers and civilian personnel involved

in the operation have been deeply grieved by the death

and suffering which they witnessed on an occasion which

should have been an enjoyable sporting event.   Many have

had to seek professional counselling.



This has been further exacerbated by many reports in the

media which have wrongly communicated the role played by

the South Yorkshire Police.   It is hoped, therefore,

that this submission may rectify this imbalance.



For those most directly involved, memories and a deep

sense of sorrow will remain with them for the rest of

their lives, particularly those officers who tried so

desperately to save the lives of men, women and

children.



The Force extends it sincere condolences to the rela­

 tives and loved ones of those who died.

1.           SIGNS AND DIRECTIONS

Following the lessons learned at the Semi Final match in 1988, the South Yorkshire
Police advised the club to use bolder colours for tickets in the hope that the
tickets could be more easily compared with signs outside the relevant turnstiles.

Although the question of signs and tickets was put, by Treasury Counsel, to Chief
Superintendent Mole, such matters are, quite obviously, the responsibility of the
club.  Paragraph 57 of the 'Green Guide' requires the club to provide a
comprehensive system of signing throughout the ground.  The club might, however,
have been better advised regarding direction signs by the Safety at Sports Ground
Committee than they in fact were.

Officers were continually distracted from their duties outside the turnstiles in
having to direct fans towards their intended entry point.
2.           SPECTATOR ACCOMMODATION

In ensuring that segregation is maintained in accordance with the Popplewell
recommendations, there is no ideal allocation of supporter accommodation at
Hillsborough.  The only alternative arrangement would have been a West and
South/East and North divide which would have left the club occupying the West and
South Stands with 1000 fewer tickets than Liverpool were allotted for the match on
15 April 1989.

Accepting the priority of segregation and the suitability of a West and North/East
and South division of the ground, then it is a matter for the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club to determine whether or not they are able to stage the event.  In
such determination they must primarily ensure that there are adequate access
facilities for all supporters to each part of the ground.

The responsibility for considering turnstile allocation and through-put of
spectators must ultimately lay with the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in
accordance with paragraph 44 of the 'Green Guide'.

The club intended 10,000 supporters to be accommodated via just 7 turnstiles -
(1442 supporters each) - displaying little thought for their comfort and safety.
3.           FANS WITHOUT TICKETS AND TICKET TOUTS

The police are powerless to prevent ticket touts and non ticket holders from
travelling to the scene of a football match.  It might be conceded, however, that
the police can deal with obstructive ticket touts and non ticket holders, at_ the
scene.

There was no intelligence passed to the Match Commanders, whether or not such
intelligence was available, upon the basis of which any contingency plans could
have been initiated.

The 'conspiracy theory' report would now indicate that a large number of Liverpool
supporters may have attended the ground and attempted entry by every means.

The South Yorkshire Police appealed to the fans through a variety of media to stay
away if they had no tickets.  Civil libertarians are quick to chide any action the
police may take to deal with non-ticket holders (e.g. Middlesborough game
following Hillsborough disaster - letters from M.P.'s at proposal to turn away non
ticket holders at motorway junctions).

The Operational Order advises officers how to deal with non-ticket holders, and
deploys serials, away from the ground, to check for same.  However, suggestions
that the police further 'bend' the law to cater for this phenomenon are
unacceptable.
4.           ALCOHOL

The majority of Liverpool supporters who have given evidence to the Inquiry appear
to have visited a public house, or purchased 'a couple of cans', before reaching
the ground.  There seems to be some correlation between attending football matches
and alcohol consumption.

Recent legislation restricting the sale of alcohol in sports grounds might have
created a situation whereby supporters are encouraged to drink alcohol away from
the ground, thus delaying their arrival and creating a difficult crowd control
problem for the police.

We did advise local licensed premises to close.  We did encourage supporters to go
in the ground rather than stand around drinking.  Our advice and encouragement was
too often unheeded - there is no further sanction available to the police.
5.           DELAYING KICK OFF

The decision to delay kick off is not one for the Police Commander in isolation.
There are many considerations which might involve discussions with representatives
of the F.A. and the host club, team management, match officials, and the
organisers of public transport who may have arranged trains etc to coincide with
the timings of the event.

Furthermore, to regularly delay kick-off would set a new norm and fans may abuse
this 'concession'.

One must also be sensitive to the attitude of the existing crowd within the
Stadium.  Doctor Nicholson of the Health and Safety Executive (Research Division),
in his report of 13 June 1989, estimates that it would have taken until about 3.40
pm to admit the full quota of Liverpool supporters onto the Leppings Lane terraces
via the turnstiles 'A' - 'G'.  This raises the question of what one is to do with
50,000 restive football supporters for 40 minutes.

At 2.40 pm on the day in question, Mr. Kirton, a representative of the Football
Association, was in conversation with Mr. Mackrell, Secretary of Sheffield
Wednesday Football club, (see Kirton's statement, page 2) regarding the
possibility of delaying the kick off.  Mr. Mackrell appears to have taken a
unilateral decision not to postpone kick off, he had not discussed this
possibility with any senior police officer at the ground.
6.           POLICING QUEUES

The task of the police on the occasion of a football match is to assist and
marshal.  This task can be overtaken if fans reject that assistance or arrive in
unexpectedly large numbers.

In such an event the 'Green Guide' recommends (paragraph 46) that the club have
contingency plans to deal with unduly large crowds gathering outside the ground.
It would seem that Sheffield Wednesday Football Club had no contingency plans for
dealing with such a problem.

(These comments are also relevant to item number 7 on schedule   'Police Tactics').

Leppings Lane unsuitably designed for queue formation.

Stewards have a responsibility for controlling and directing people entering the
ground,  (paragraph 195 'Green Guide').

'Conspiracy Theory' report may support view that significant numbers of Liverpool
fans attempted to bypass the 'controls' for entry.
9.   TICKETS

The advice contained on the match day tickets suggesting ticket
holders take up their place no later than 15 minutes before­
hand, was detrimental to the operational plans of the police.
It might be argued that, in complying with the information
contained on the tickets, the fans arrived in unmanageable
numbers 15 minutes before kick off, contrary to the police
requests, circulated by Liverpool and Nottingham local radio
stations and through match programmes at previous Liverpool and
Nottingham home games.
10.        MOUNTED OFFICERS

In relation to the deployment of mounted officers in the restricted area
before the turnstile, some witnesses have commented upon the usefulness of
such deployment.  Inspector Hand-Davis, a very experienced mounted officer,
was quite satisfied with the tactic and would use it again.  A civilian
onlooker, John Bartholomew, states that:

           "I could see a mounted policeman ... moving into the crowd from the
           right hand side of the turnstiles.  He moved very slowly and
           carefully because the crowd was so tightly packed.  The police
           officer, without thought to his own safety, slowly moved into and
           pushed ... the fans away from the turnstiles in an effort to
           alleviate the pressure on those supporters being crushed at the
           front."

Mounted officers have policed this location for many years, including other
semi-finals, without difficulty or criticism.  The major difference that faced
them this year was the late and joint arrival of hundreds of fans who were
anxious to get in the ground and disregarded the best efforts of mounted
officers to marshal the crowd.
14.   LOUD HAILERS

Loud hailers were available to the police on the day of the
event.  They were used to good advantage when the disaster had
occurred.

Inspector Beresford delivered a loud hailer to the Commander on
the ground, Superintendent Greenwood.  Superintendent Greenwood
used it to request the crowd to move back from the point of
greatest crushing at the front of the pens.  Superintendent
Greenwood later used the loud hailer in order to inform various
sections of the crowd of the nature of the incident at the
Leppings Lane t e r r a c e s .

Over the years liaison with club officials has been maintained
through good will and in an effort to achieve our common goal -
the.-accommodation of the public a.t the Stadium in safety. There
has, however, been no reduction in the defined areas of
responsibility of either party.

Furthermore, the club have been regularly reminded of the duties
of stewards and it has been pointed out, from time to time, that
these duties were not being performed to the full.

In 1981, for example, then Chief Superintendent Herold instructed
Inspector Calvert to remind the stewards of their
responsibilities for 'packing' the crowd.  Inspector Calvert
complied with that instruction at a subsequent stewards meeting
held at Hillsborough.
In 1986 Inspector Calvert, who continued to have the responsibility for
liaison with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, submitted a report to his
Chief Superintendent, Mr. Mole, regarding the deficiencies in the stewarding
arrangements at the club. . As a result Mr. Mole requested a meeting with club
management when these perceived deficiencies were discussed.

The most recent communication to club employees was at two meetings on 15 and
23 August 1988, when stewards and gatemen were reminded, by police officers
and the clubs Chief Safety/Security Officer, of their duties.  The club
employees were each given a copy of documents 'Instructions to Stewards' or
'Instructions to Match Day Staff'.

It may be that the police have carried out some duties rather than leave
anything to chance but this, in no way, enables the club to abrogate its
responsibilies.

The club has failed, generally, to attract the most enterprising and committed
stewards.
16.   FILLING OF PENS

This is the legal responsibility of club management (see
arguments at item 15).  The only presence of police officers in
pens, or on terraces, has been to deal with an incident of
public disorder or potential disorder such as might arise with
a mix of supporters on the same terrace for example.

It might well be that, in recent years, stewards have been
reluctant to perform duty on terraces because of an increase in
violent and hooligan behaviour amongst football supporters.    If
this is the case then perhaps an alteration to the ground
design might have avoided the need for anyone to 'pack' the
pens.   In 1985 Inspector Calvert recommended to the Safety at
Sports Ground Working Group (albeit on the grounds of effective
segregation) that a new turnstile arrangement would 'ensure that
a precise number of supporters would be admitted to each of the
pens at the Leppings Lane end.   This proposal was considered
and rejected, on the basis of cost, at a meeting of the Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club on 22 May 1985 (see Sheffield Wednesday
 Football Club bundle).
18.       SUPERVISION OF RADIAL GATES

The radial fences on the Leppings Lane terraces were installed,
at the request of the Safety At Sports Grounds Working Group, in
1981.

Gates at the rear of each fence were proposed to give access for
maintenance and policing, if necessary, during a game.         The
gates have the facility to be fastened open to allow adjacent
pens to be occupied by supporters of the same team and, for this
purpose, the police were provided with keys for the gates so
that they could 'c o n t r o l ' that segregation as required.

The gates were never envisaged as evacuation gates (see
statement of Assistant Fire Officer Seaman, page 30, second
paragraph).      When the pens were used for one set of supporters,
the., only 'c o n t r o l ' that was therefore necessary was that of
locking the gates open.

There is a series of correspondence which states that any
'control' of the radial fence gates is to be undertaken by
stewards as follows:

2.5.85          Letter from South Yorkshire County Council to
                 Eastwood and Partners regarding 'new' gates in
                 radial fences at Leppings Lane terraces

                 regarding stewarding of gates
19.        OPERATIONAL ORDER RE. SAFETY

Historically the behaviour of the hooligan element of football supporters (and
Government reaction) has tended to direct the attention of everyone, including
the police, to public order.  This is reflected in the Operational Order.

The office of constable has, historically, a primary responsibility for the
protection of life.  This duty overrides all other considerations.

It is implied that the operational order constrained the actions of perimeter
track officers.  Any operational order is, however, subordinate to the Force
Standing Orders which direct and guide officers in their duties.  These Orders
are prefaced with the following advice:

           "There is a danger that by endeavouring to anticipate all likely
           contingencies a proliferation of orders results which serve to
           restrict the use of initiative and common sense and ... to inhibit
           decision making on subjects not specifically mentioned in Orders.

           In dealing with events and incidents there is still considerable
           scope for the display of intelligence and initiative by police
           officers and their actions will be judged not so much by the way in
           which instructions were carried out but rather whether the
           incidents were dealt with in a competent and sensible manner having
           regard to the prevailing circumstances."

Having said that police officers are expected, at the onset of any
difficulties, to use their own initiative and respond in the initial stages as
circumstances dictate.  Support and direction is then given to the officers as
the situation develops.

Evidence has been heard from a number of officers that they did so respond.
20.    PROVISION OF POLICE OPERATIONAL ORDER TO INTERESTED
       PARTIES


Match Operational Orders have always been provided to Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club.

Prior to the 1989 Semi Final, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
enquired as to the usefulness of this practice and decided not
to provide the club with a copy on this occasion.

The question is posed 'what would the club have done with the
Operational Order and information contained therein if it had
been supplied to them?'
21.        SUNDAY MATCHES

Following the Hillsborough Disaster the Semi Final replay took place at Old
Trafford, on a Sunday with a lunchtime kick off; there were no problems.

Chief Superintendent Mole considered the question of the game being played on
a Sunday as this was an all ticket game and therefore the day on which it was
staged would have no effect on the crowd capacity.  Additionally, if the kick
off time were to remain the same, licensed premises would be open up to the
time the game commenced on both days.

However, the Football Association have always expressed a wish for both Semi
Finals to be played on the same day with the caveat that they would consider
changing to a Sunday if live television converage was offered.   No such offer
was m a d e .

The Sunday Observance Act 1780 creates an offence in respect of "any house,
room or other place which shall be opened or used for publick entertainment or
amusement ...upon any part of the Lord's Day, called Sunday and to which
persons shall be admitted by the payment of money or by tickets sold for money
      ft




This piece of legislation has not been repealed, indeed, the penalties imposed
have been updated as recent as 1982 viz Criminal Justice Act 1982 ss 38 and
46.

In practice this aspect of the law is not enforced in respect of sporting
eve nt s.
22.        PROMOTION/TRANSFERS

The numbers of South Yorkshire Police personnel dictate that there will
inevitably be postings at. relatively short notice due to retirements, illness
and transfers.

All officers having command roles are trained in all aspects of policing, both
operational and administrative.  Local knowledge and experience is beneficial
but not essential and should not detract from an officers' capabilities and
performance.

When the transfer of senior personnel is necessary then continuity is
generally afforded by an existing deputy commander.  In this particular case
Superintendents Marshall, Murray and Chapman all remained in post and had key
responsibilities at the semi-final event.
23 *   DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION BETWEEN FORCES AND
       INTELLIGENCE GATHERING


In giving evidence, Chief Superintendent Mole informed the
Inquiry that a consistent factor with Liverpool supporters was
the attendance of pick-pockets and 'the usual forged tickets'.
Intelligence to that effect was available.

The intelligence available to the match commander on the day did
not go beyond this and did not indicate that there would be
problems in respect of either Liverpool or Nottingham
su p porters.

If asked if this could be improved upon then the answer is yes
and consideration is being given to this matter at a very senior
level within the police service.
24 *   SUPERVISION OF TURNSTILE SERIALS

It is accepted that a physical barrier exists between certain
Serials outside the ground and the Ground Commander within but
this is necessary for practical reasons.

During Phase I officers are indeed on the outside of the Stadium
but at Phase II some take up duties on the inside.   The
practical difficulties of changing the overall command ofthose
officers m id stream is self evident when one bears in mind that
at Phase III many will again return to outside duties.

The point       to be made that the Sergeant and Inspector
remain with their Serials throughout the Operation thus
preserving the immediate command structure.

The deployment of these officers must remain flexible to cater
for any eventuality and the command structure coupled with the
disciplined nature of the police service is such that these
Serials will respond to the instructions of any senior
commander.
25.        DEPLETION OF OFFICERS THROUGH ARRESTS

It must be emphasised that certain procedures must be followed and the taking
of a person's liberty is not to be taken lightly.  This is embodied in the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Codes of Practice.

The procedures, contained in the Operational Orders, have been streamlined
whilst still remaining within the legislative parameters.  The time taken to
process an arrested person cannot be quantified and will depend on a number of
factors including the prisoner's demeanour, the seriousness of the offence for
which he has been arrested and the number of persons to be processed by the
Custody Officer.

The object is for the arresting officers to return to match duties as soon as
possible but the reality is that process can take thirty minutes.

Reserve Serials are included in the Operational Order and the facility exists
to deploy some or all of these officers to counter the depletion of manpower
brought about by high arrest rates.

Police Officers are permitted to use and, indeed, do use discretion as to
whether to arrest or eject offenders, with the depletion of resources in mind.
The exercise of this discretion is evident in many of the statements submitted
to the Inquiry where officers resorted to ejection as opposed to arrest and
detention in order to minimise a reduction of resources.

The recent introduction of video cameras at football stadiums has enabled
retrospective arrests to be made in an attempt to raise the standards of
behaviour of supporters.
26.    TURNSTILE FIGURES

South Yorkshire Police has complied with ACPO guidelines and has
made provision for access to turnstile figures via an officer
who is deployed to liaise with the club.  He remains in the club
control room, has access to a club radio, a police radio and has
a telephone link with a view to providing intelligence to the
Police Control.

We were conscious of the need to have this information and the
existence of this link is evidence of that realisation.
29.        COMMUNICATIONS

That there were difficulties with police communications must be accepted.

The radio equipment at Hillsborough Stadium has been examined by a member of
the Home Office Telephone Directorate staff, Mr. Cutler (statement provided),
it was in good working o r d e r .

'Talk through' mode was selected, as it is at most football match operations.
In an emergency situation 'talk through' enables people involved in the
operation to act upon messages being sent through the controller, thereby
avoiding the need for re-transmission.  An example of this is that Chief
Inspector Edmundson, in Force Operations Room, heard a message on 'talk
through' regarding injuries and immediately put the ambulance service on
standby.

Perhaps the most severe problems were the noise levels and distractions
created at a major football match which make it difficult to pass messages and
sometimes impossible to hear messages.  This was exacerbated by a heavy and
continuous demand being made upon the system immediately prior to, during and
after the disaster.

There may be no technology available to overcome these very fundamental
difficulties.
30.   CONTROL ROOM

The facilities of the existing police control room is less than
adequate.  The Safety At Sports Ground Act 1975 states at
paragraph 14(1) 'A Police Central Control Room shall be provided
with such ancillary equipment as the Chief Constable may require'.
One piece of equipment already available and used in the Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club's own separate control room namely a
visual display of the computerized turnstile counting facility was
not in the Police Control Room and whilst evidence has already
been given by Constable Guest that he worked within the Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club control room acting as liaison between the
two, this clearly proved unsatisfactory. If the police had had
direct access to the current ground capacities, this may have
proved a valuable ,if not essential,piece of information in
anticipating the late arrival of Liverpool supporters.

The e x i s t i n g control room was originally the room occupied by a
'disc jockey' at the ground.         Obviously, the room is inadequate
for occupation by five or more police officers.         We are, however,
constrained by what the club provide for police use.
31.       ACCESS FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES

Emergency vehicle access is a matter for the holder of the Safety Certificate
- i.e. the club.  Paragraph 18(2) of that certificate clearly identifies such
a responsibility.

In the event of an emergency situation, however, the police would expect to
assume, and did in fact assume, responsibility for directing ingress and
egress of emergency vehicles.  (See statements of Inspector Scarfe and Police
Constable Twigg).

It is worthy of note, also, that in evidence Fire Service personnel were aware
of inaccessibility to the rear of the South Stand but were unconcerned.
Similarly, Mr. Hopkins of the Ambulance Service has been aware, since 1981,
that ambulances could not gain access to the rear of the West Stand, but had
not sought to have the access gates redesigned.

This is something which proper inspections of the ground by members of Safety
at Sports Ground Committee should have identified.
33.        DESIGN OF PERIMETER FENCES AND DIFFICULTIES IN INITIAL
           IDENTIFICATION OF INCIDENT AND SUBSEQUENT RESCUE

The Health & Safety Executive report has identified faults in the design
(para. 2.6).

The design and construction of the perimeter fences and gates etc. are the
responsibility of the Safety at Sports Ground Working Group.   As the gates
were not regarded as emergency evacuation points, no thought appears to have
been given to their suitability for such use by the 'experts'.

It may be that some police officers did not immediately recognise thatthere
was a problem with the crowd in the two enclosures, nor did many other
witnesses, including South Yorkshire Ambulance officers, St. John's Ambulance
personnel, and, apparently, John Motson, the BBC commentator, who was viewing
the scenes via a 'close up' camera.

The construction of the gates was such - i.e. narrow and opening only to   90° -
that they hampered the subsequent rescue operation.

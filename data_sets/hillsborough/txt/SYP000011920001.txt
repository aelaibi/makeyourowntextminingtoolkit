Dear Chairman,                               24th April,   1989


                   FOOTBALL SAFETY CONTROL


As a former Glasgow police officer,   with wide experience of
football crowd control, and who has   made a detailed study of
the issues, I feel I can offer your   club valuable advice on
a positive solution to the problems   the sport has suffered in
recent years.

I have compiled a report already read by Mr Wallace Mercer,
Chairman of Scottish Premier League club Heart of Midlothian;
two senior Scottish police officers;    Chief Superintendant
Hugh Muir jf Pitt Street head quarters in Strathclyde, Former
Deputy to Hlfll of Scottish Police Forces, St Andrew's House,
Edinburgh;                       a prominent Glasgow businessman,
well respected ror m s common sense views on football matters.
Mr Hugh Ferris of Scottish Television, along with a cross
section of football fans - all of w ho m thought my plans very
feasible.

I am offering a copy of my 10-page plan to your club to study
- and all other 91 lekgue clubs - for a nominal nrinp of     .
In the Â©vent that your club wishes to make use of my proposals,
an appropriate fee would then be registered.   I believe these
proposals will SAVE your club money and - more importantly -
SAVE lives.

This plan, already seen by and approved by the Football
Association, is immediately available should you enclose a
9" x 12" First Class stamped addressed envelope to the above
address.

Mrs Thatcher's decision to. enforce: the .ID card system is the
main reason w hy my plan, as yet has not been implemented.

Please note that a copy was sent to her and that I received a
reply intimating that she had passed it on to her minister
of sport, Mr Michael Moynahan.

My plan is so simple it could be put into operation for the
beginning of next season.

Because of the immediacy of the controversial subject of
football crowd safety control, I would urgently stress the
need for an early reply to this letter.

Yours in spot.t.

           went to the Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest held at

           Hillsborougn Football Ground at Sheffield-



           We got to the Leppings Lane end of the ground at around SnSO pm (14S0)

           the crowd at this time was building up and starting to get very busy*

           There didn*t appear to be any orderly queues,,                   Together with my son

                      we went through the turnstiles and made our way to our seats

           in the West Stand which were slightly to the right of the goal about

           three quarters of the way up the stand.



           I immediately noticed that the two centre pens in the Leppings Lane

terraces were very overcrowded and it was totally apparent that no

stewarding was taking   place*   The situation gradually deteriated

towards kick off time and X had a strong feeling of unease*



The teams came out for the kick about    prior to starting the match and

it was around this time that 1 saw people    climbing the perimeter

fence at the front of the terraces trying to get out of the crush,        I

saw at least two policemen pushing and knocking the fans hands off the

fence to force them back into the pens.



One of these was just to the right of the goals from where    I was

1ooking =



Things progressively got worse with more fans trying to get out of the

crush and what really struck me was the lack of assistance to anybody

trying to get out-



I did not see any senior officer organising the    Police officers to    try

and help the fans there being only six or seven    officers on the

perimeter track at the time.



1 was amazed at the lack of action at the time which was approaching

kick off time and the situation was totally chaotic with only the

supporters making efforts to assist other fans.



When the disaster was unfolding and people were    being pulled out of

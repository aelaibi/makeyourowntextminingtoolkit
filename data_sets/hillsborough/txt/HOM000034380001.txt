LINES TO TAKE FOR MEETING WITH PETER KILFOYLE MP:
TREVOR          HICKS,     PHIL     HAMMOND          &    ANN     ADLINGTON         OF     THE
HILLSBOROUGH SUPPORT GROUP




• Aware that you are meeting Mrs McDougall this afternoon to enable you and the
  Hillsborough Family Support Group to set out any other concerns not covered in the
  Granada programme which you would wish the Home Secretary to consider before
  reaching a decision on whether to re-open the inquiry.


• Wanted to make clear that this is very much a private fact finding meeting, the contents of
  which should not be reported to the media. I am sure you understand that since the
  meeting is with Home Office officials (rather than politicians) it would be inappropriate to
  make any public comment about anything Mrs McDougall may say.


• The purpose of the meeting is an opportunity for you to put to the Home Office any
      outstanding concerns or points which may not have been previously raised. We do not see
  the meeting as an opportunity for you to ask questions of officials.


• Following the interview, officials will consider your comments in the light of
      representations and the report from the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire before putting
      the whole case to the Home Secretary.

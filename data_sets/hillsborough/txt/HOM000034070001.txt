ADJOURNMENT DEBATE:        HILLSBOROUGH - DRAFT SPEAKING NOTE FOR MR
MACLEAN


I would like to join with the Hon Member for Liverpool Walton in
expressing my deepest sympathy for the families of those who were
involved in the tragic events at Hillsborough.                   I know I speak
for the whole House in saying that our thoughts will remain with
them this Christmas, which I know they must find a particularly
difficult time of the year.


Anybody who saw the news reports that dreadful Saturday - 15th
Xif April 1989 - will have been overwhelmed by those terrible and
distressing pictures. I know that for the families who suffered
such appalling tragedy their loss was made all the worse by the
fact that they arose out of an event which should have been a
normal family outing.


The   Hon   Member   for   Liverpool       Walton     has    however    drawn     the
attention of the House not so much to the events themselves but
to a programme - a so called factual drama - which was                          shown
recently on Channel          The makers of the programme Hillsborough
have emphasised that they were acting on behalf of the families.
But   I must    admit   that   I    have   a   deep    sense    of   unease     when
programme makers choose to make their points through a dramatic
format,     which plays upon       the emotions       of viewers       rather   than
through a documentary which can allow points to be discussed or
challenged.


So the programme makers made a two hour "drama documentary" in
which they claim they raised a number of fresh points.                     In fact
many of these points had already been considered by Lord Taylor's
inquiry. In particular, I understand the programme makers claimed
that evidence had come to light about a so called missing video
tape and that the Coroner had been wrong                    in considering that
those who died were dead by 3.15.
  If the programme makers had used a normal documentary format and
  invited     South    Yorkshire    Police    to    comment   on    the     charges,    I
  understand that South Yorkshire Police could have told them that
  the   video       which     is   supposed    to    have     shown       evidence     of
  overcrowding on the terraces is available;                  it is not missing,
  either     because    the    camera   was   not   working    or     for    any    other
  reason. It never has been missing or unavailable. The film is in
  the possession of South Yorkshire Police and was given both to
  the Taylor inquiry and to the inquest.


  It is true that a video from a fixed camera, directed not at the
   inclosures where the tragedy took place but at the turnstiles,
  did indeed disappear on the night of the disaster. I understand
  that this particular video was never in the possession of the
  police.    The loss of the video was reported as a crime but the
  culprit was not detected. This video has never been found but it
   is not the video that the programme makers appear to be claiming
  might have come to light. Mr Holdsworth, the technician, whom the
  programme presented as being in possession of new evidence, made                          Ju K '
   a statement after the disaster and that was available to the
  Taylor inquiry.
                                                                                             ^        ■
;^-rff the programme makers had used a normal documentary style they
  Swould have been forced to show that the matter of the timing of
  the deaths and whether the Coroner had made a mistake in taking
     3.15 cut off point had already been considered by a judicial
    eview.    The      producers     chose    not    to     give    audiences        that
   information.       Instead they called for another public inquiry.                   I
  pill discuss that call in a moment.

               supervised by the PCA


               finally, there was the judicial review of the inquest.



helpful if I were to say just a little about of each of these
inquiries and their outcome.


Lord Taylor's enquiry
Jb’irst,     the   formal    inquiry     by   Lord    Justice    Taylor.       This   was
commissioned by the then Home Secretary on the second day after
the disaster.        Its terms of reference were not only to inquire
into the events but also to make recommendations about the --- ‘,~
of crowd control and safety at sports events.


Over 31 days between the 15th of May and the 29th of June, Lord
Taylor heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public hearing
in    Sheffield.       He    also   received         evidence    in    the     form    of
submissions and letters. The inquiry considered video film from
three separate sources which provided in all some 71 hours of
further evidence.
                                                                      (ft ^
Lord Taylor published an interim report in AugustJ^which set out
the causes for the disaster and made immediate recommendations,
he found that there were a number of causes why the disaster took
p l ac e :


               the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding was the
               failure to cut off access to the central pens which
               were already overfull.


               they were      already overfull         because    no    safe    maximum
               capacities had been laid down, no attempt was made to
               control      entry   to   individual      pens    numerically,         and




                                              4
          there       was    no    effective      visual      monitoring         of    crowd
          density.


     •   he found that when the influx from gate C                         entered pen
          3,    the     layout     of    the    barriers      there      afforded       less
          protection than they should have done and a barrier
          collapsed.


     •   he     found       that   the need     to         open   gate    C was due       to
          dangerous           congestion        atthe        turnstiles.                That
          congestion occurred because, as both the club and the
          police should have realised, the turnstile area could
          not    easily       cope with        the   large numbers         unless       they
          arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The police had
          failed to draw up plans as to how they would control
          large numbers should they arrive in a short period.
          Unfortunately that event, which Lord Taylor considered
          was foreseeable, took place.


     •   Finally        he    found      that   the        presence      of an        unruly
          minority          who    had    drunk      too     much     aggravated         the
          problem.       So did the clubs's             confused and inadequate
          signs and ticketing.


So we have it: a number of reasons for the disaster;                         no single
person or organisation to blame. But Lord Taylor clearly put a
significant portion of the blame for the disaster at the door of
the police.


Indeed he was particularly critical                   of    the attitude of South
Yorkshire Police to the disaster.               I quote from the report:


     "It is a matter of regret that at the hearing and in their
     submissions,       the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared
     to concede that they were in any respect at fault in what
     occurred.     Mr        Duckenfield,         under      pressure       of        cross-
     examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for


                                           5
          causing the deaths. But that apart, the police case was to
      blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the
          club for failing to monitor the pens.                       It was argued that
          the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate
      C but     was    due       to barrier         124a being        defective.      Such    an
      unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether
          lessons have been learnt.                 It would have been more seemly
          and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been
          faced."



 if needed


[He also considered the reports that had been published in the
press about the behaviour of Liverpool fans. Again I quote from
his report:
          "Before this Inquiry began there were stories reported in
      the press, and said to have emanated from police officers
      present at the match,                 of "mass drunkenness".                It was said
      that     drunken       fans      urinated        on    police    whilst      they    were
      pulling       the    dead       and   injured     out,    that    others      had    even
      urinated        on    the       bodies    of     the    dead     and    stolen      their
      belongings.          Not    a    single       witness    was    called      before     the
      inquiry to support any of those allegations, although every
      opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties
      to have any witness called whom they wished. As soon as the
      allegations I have mentioned were^rf^made in the press, Mr
      Peter Wright,          Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,                         made a
      dignified statement dissociating himself                           from such grave
      and emotive calumnies.                Those who made them and those who
      disseminated          them      would     have    done    better       to   hold    their
      pea ce ."




suggests that Lord Taylor in any way had the wool pulled over his
ey e s.


                                                6
But I must stress that since the report the police have accepted
responsibility        for the part they played in the disasterT^Most
recently, the present chief constable of South Yorkshire, Richard
Wells,     said on the Today programme                  that the police    saw their
responsibility in three particular areas. He admitted that -
      •      once      the   gates    were       open    the   police    should     have
             foreseen where the fans would go


             he accepted that they might have reduced some of the
             pressure by changing the kick off time.


      •      he also accepted that officers did not recognise soon
             enough the distinction between disorder and disjtx®£

                                                                           u cco    t—   a    f   c-t/.
So, the South Yorkshire Poldjcs^fiave accepted that they were at
fault in those respects/^ The South Yorkshire Police Authority ^— I
have paid compensation to the families of those who died. This
is apart from money paid out by the Hillsborough disaster appeal.                                 ^


The inquest
The second investigation into events was the inquest conducted
by   Her   Majesty's     Coroner      for    the    Western     District    of     South
Yorkshire. This was a difficult task partly because of the number
of deaths and partly because the Taylor inquiry was itself in
progress. The Coroner conducted an inquiry into the deaths of
each of the 9 ^ individuals and sat for a total of 96 days.

              ------
I think it is important that I remind the House of the purpose
of   an    inquest;     it   is   a   fact       finding    inquiry     conducted        to
establish reliable answers to four important but limited factual
questions. They are:


             the identity of the deceased


             the place of death


             the time, if known, and date of death; and finally


                                             7
                                                  , k yS
                                               Kj>f
            •      how the deceased came by hisjdeath.


    That is all an inquest can consider.                         Rule 36 of the Coroners'
    Rules       1984   requires       that    the       proceedings      and     evidence     are
    directed solely at finding the answers to these questions and it
    forbids any expression of opinion on other matters.


    As    members      of    this    House    are       aware,    the   jury    examining     the
    evidence found that the cause of death was accidental death. But
    the findings of an inquest do not bind any person affected by


#   them. The inquest conclusion must not be framed in such a way as
    to determine any question of criminal responsibility on the part
    of a named person or any question of civil liability. A finding
    of accidental death does not prevent further proceedings.



    Investigation by West Midland Police


    The third investigation into the disaster was conducted by West
    Midland Police supervised by they Police Complaints Authority with
    a view to establishing whether the tragedy resulted from, or was
    made worse by, criminal activity on the part of any individual.
    It    also    considered        whether    any       officer    should     be   subject   to
    disciplinary proceedings. The investigation involved the taking
    of 5,341      statements as well as a scrutiny of all the material
    which had previously been examined. The evidence was sent to the
    Director of Public Prosecutions who concluded that the result did
    not indicate that any one should be made the subject of criminal
    proceedings.            This    meant    that       neither     Chief      Superintendent
    Duckenfield, nor Superintendent Murray, who were both criticised
    by the Taylor Inquiry, nor for that matter any other person has
    been charged with any crime.


    For any other person apart from a police officer that would have
    been    the    end of      the proceedings.            For    a police      officer    there
    remained the question of whether they had failed in their duty.
    The     Police      Complaints          Authority       decided      that       both   Chief


                                                    8
    Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray should face
    disciplinary charges.            Police disciplinary hearings are held in
    private; they are concerned only with whether an officer may have
    failed to conform to police discipline. A disciplinary hearing
    does not ^— sider wider issues.


    But, a further point about police disciplinary hearings which is
    often forgotten is that whilst there are a number of punishments
    which    can    be    imposed     for    bad   discipline,    the    most   serious
    punishment      a     disciplinary       tribunal     can   impose    is    that   of
    dismissal or of a requirement to resign.

#
    This is the heaviest punishment which it is possible to award an
    officer for the very worst offence which he could have committed.
    It means that his conduct must have been so bad that it would be
    inappropriate for him to remain an officer.


    In the event Mr Duckenfield retired because of his ill health in
    advance of a disciplinary tribunal's ruling on whether or not he
    was guilty. But by doing so he took on himself what the worst
    disciplinary         judgement    could have      imposed upon him to do.          He
    stopped being a police officer. The disciplinary hearing could
    not continue because such hearings can only be held on police
    officers.


    On   13 January       the Police Complaints Authority            announced     that
    disciplinary proceedings against Superintendent Murray would be
    withdrawn. When explaining their decision the Authority stated
    that    the    retirement    of    the    Chief     Superintendent    on    medical
    grounds meant that what,            in effect,      was a joint allegation of
    neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the
    more senior officer. But, some time later, Superintendent Murray
    also decided         that he too did not wish to remain as a police
    officer.         [

    So that       is   three   separate     examinations          of   events    surrounding
    Hillsborough;         each    one    with     a    separate     purpose.       The   fourth
    examination was the judicial review of the Coroner's proceedings.


    Review of the inquest


    Again it might be helpful if I remind the house that neither the
    Home Secretary nor the Attorney General has the power to order
    a fresh inquest. That can only be done by the courts, either if
    an application is made, with the consent of my rt hon Friend,


#   under
    Review.
                section   13 of    the    1988 Act,         or by means     of     a Judicial



    Moreover, under the statutory procedure, it is a requirement that
    in order to justify directing a fresh inquest there should not
    only    be     specific      grounds,       such    a   fresh      evidence,     but   also
    circumstances that make a fresh inquest necessary or desirable
    in the interests of justice.

    Mr          i'qr, whose      son,    Kevin,       was   so   tragically      killed,    put
    forward an application under section 13 of the Act                             ; the main
    points were:

            responsible      agencies          to    provide     the    deceased          with
            adequate medical         attention after            they had sustained
            their original injuries.


It was also asserted in relation to Kevin Williams that there was
                                                                                                  \ \r
evidence to justify the coroner in concluding that he was alive
beyond the 3.15 pm cut off time that the Coroner had adopted, and
that pressure had been put on two witnesses                          to retract          their
evidence about the signs of life they described in Kevin Williams
after 3.15.                                                                              o^h *v


My. Hon   friend Jthe     Attorney       General          carefully    considered          the
evidence aad"concluded that none of the matters raised afforded
a r e a ^ s ^ i c likelihood of a successful application to the High
CQurt.


Nevertheless, relatives of a number of the victims separately and
successfully sought a judicial review. The conduct of the South
Yorkshire coroner's inquest was subject to a close and detailed
examination.     In giving the judgement of the Divisional Court,
Lord   Justice     McCowan       ruled    very      clearly     that        none    of    the
procedural or technical points raised justified the intervention
of the Divisional Court. In particular, it found that the cut off
point of 3.15 was a reasonable and sustainable point,                              and that
the coroner's directions to the iurv were impeccable.


As a Minister it         is clearly not possible               for me       to know       the
truth of what happened on that terrible Saturday. Wonff of inn
caa-. But .-we .can—      satisfied that those dreadful events nearly
seven years ago have been fully investigated and examined. It is
impossible to guarantee that a tragedy will never occur again but
measures have been taken to ensure that British football stadia
are among the safest in the world.
  ^YCTO
The hon Member         for Liverpool      Walton          now calls     for a       further
public inquiry into these events. I fully sympathise with those


                                          11
   families who feel that in some way they have not learnt the truth
   about their loved one's deaths. Certainly in an appalling tragedy
   such     as Hillsborough         it is perhaps       inevitable,      though    deeply
   distressing for the families, that there will be confusion about
   some details#

   /It now.


   Wha^t    wouJhi       bex ^£hev^purpb-se- of"— a 'N£urther v inquiry?       I    fully
   understand that some families still                  feel bitter about the way
   that events were handled that terrible day; things were done, or
   not done, things were said to the press that should not have been
   said, but the fact that we know about them                          ;'"there has been
   no cover up. Lord Taylor criticised the police; South Yorkshire
   have     accepted        that   they    were    partly     responsible     for    the
   consequences and the police authority have paid compensation.


   I believe that positive lessons have been learnt.                      Lord Taylor
  made far reaching recommendations which have been implemented:


                    All clubs of the Premier League and First Division
                   have     converted   their     stadia    to all   seated   grounds.
                   Second and Third Division clubs should have all seater
                   stadia by August 1999.


                   The     Government     has   made    £139m   available      to    the
                   Football Trust to fund Taylor related work at football
                   grounds for projects totalling £437m.


  British stadia are now recognised as being amongst the safest in
  the      word.     This    was   commented      on   by   overseas    visitors     and
officials during EURO 96.      Thankfully there have been no major
incidents since Hillsborough. So, we should not forget the very
positive things which have been achieved.

What if there is fresh evidence? J 2 3 w ^ d r a m a documentary is not
in itself evidence. I don't often agree with the hon Member for
Blackburn but he too recognised that it was important to examine
the evidence,

                                 what then? The Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire has already made clear that if there is fresh
evidence he would wish to have it examined*"'! understand that
there were fresh evidence he would not wish it to be examined by
police from the South Yorkshire force, who might be considered
to have a vested interest in the outcome,       but by officers of a
different force. Furthermore,     he would wish this investigation
to be supervised by the independent Police Complaints Authority.
The Police Complaints Authority have themselves indicated their
willingness to undertake this supervision.        If evidence of any
wrongdoing were uncovered those papers would be passed to the
Director of Public Prosecutions in order to determine whether
charges should be brought against anybody                       ^
                                          Interventions



How is that police officers have been awarded substantial sums
in compensation and the families have not?


The judgement on the management of the claims for police officers
was a matter for the Police Authority. I understand that on the
basis of legal advice the police authority settled 14 cases out
of court. There are a further 25 cases outstanding. Five cases
have been    taken       to court;   of    these,   four were       successful   in
achieving compensation: one was not. The Police Authority have
said that they will appeal against the four successful claims.


The question of compensation for members of the public is one for
the   courts.        I    understand      that   the   courts       have   awarded
compensation only in those cases where there is a close familial
tie. I understand that over £12m has been awarded in damages and
costs to members of the public.                                 ,


If further pressed
This is entirely a matter for the courts.




Background

The fact that police officers have received substantial sums in
compensation when many friends and relatives appear not to have
done is a matter of continuing controversy. South Yorkshire
Police Authority received 1,567 claims in respect of the tragedy;
33 are still outstanding. Many claimants have been found not to
be eligible.

Damages and costs to members of the public have totalled £12m;
South Yorkshire Police say that they cannot immediately provide
details of how many claimants have been successful. The figures
involved suggest that the sums going to relatives will in some
cases have been smaller than those going to police officers.
Whilst this appears unjust the courts reach their decisions on
the basis of loss of expected earnings rather than the grief
suffered by family members.
   Isn't the fact that some officers changed their story proof that
   there has been a cover up?


   In any large inquiry some witnesses tend to wish to modify their
   original statements as their memory of events becomes clearer.
   It could only be       argued       if    the original       statements     were    not
   available     for examination.           I understand       that where      witnesses
   changed their minds about detail the original                    statements were
   available to the Taylor inquiry and witnesses could be, and were,
  cross examined about them.


^ | w h o is to judge whether or not there is fresh evidence?


  The hon Member will have             to trust the integrity of the Chief
  Constable of South Yorkshire, who was not himself involved in the
  South Yorkshire force at the time of the disaster.


  Do you believe the inquest should be reopened?


  This is a matter for the Attorney General. An application can be
  made to him for consent to apply to the High Court to reopen an
   inquest.


  Several      applications     have    been    considered      since    the   inquest.
  However, I understand that no applications have put forward any
  significant grounds over and above that already considered by the
  Divisional      Court   when    it    originally       rejected    a   request       for
   judicial review.


  The   programme      itself    is not an      application;        if   relatives     or
  others were to make an application based upon further evidence,
  that would no doubt be considered carefully in the usual way.
  He has made clear that he is always prepared to examine whether
  there are grounds to re-open an inquest. But for him to recommend
  to the High Court that an inquest should be reopened there would
  not   only    need   to be    new evidence       but    he    would also      need   to
  believe that it was in the interest of justice for the inquest
  to be re-opened.
Why was an officer from the former West Midlands Serious Crime
Squad chosen to undertake investigations into the tragedy?


I    understand    West       Midlands      was   chosen      to   undertake            the
investigation      of   the    Hillsborough       tragedy     because       it    was     a
neighbouring      force.   This was a choice approved by                   the Police
Complaints   Authority.        The   head    of   the    investigation       was        the
Assistant Chief Constable Mervin Jones now Chief Constable of
Cheshire; he was reporting to Geoffrey Dear now an HM Inspector.


Background
A story was published in this weekend's Sunday Times complaining
that one of the detectives involved in the inquiry was Detective
Superintendent Stan Beechy former head of the controversial West
Midlands Serious Crime Squad which was disbanded in August 1989
after a PCA investigation. He was said by the report to be the
second most senior policeman.

Mrs Williams is claiming Mr Beechy was in charge of evidence
concerning her son Kevin and should have presented the jury with
the evidence to suggest that an ambulance did not stop which
could have saved her son. Mrs Williams also claims that she has
a witness who says that Kevin was alive after 3.15. The Attorney
General s office explain that the medical evidence has been
examined and they are convinced that the 3.15 cut off point for
time of death was correct. This was also the conclusion of the
Judicial Review.

MEASURES ADOPTED TO COMBAT HOOLIGANISM AT ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL
MATCHES IN ENGLAND AND WALES


The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act- 1985 prohibits
the    possession of            alcohol       on    the     way       to matches       on    football
special coaches and trains and makes it an offence to be drunk
on them.          It also makes it an offence to try to enter a ground
when drunk or in possession of alcohol and to possess or consume
alcohol within view of the pitch during the period of the match,
or to be drunk during the period of the match.


The    Act      also     gives       the    police        the    power       to     search   someone
reasonably suspected of committing an offence under the Act, and
to arrest such a person:                    this may include searching coaches or
trains carrying passengers to or from matches or on arrival as
well as searching               fans waiting to enter a ground or inside a
ground.


The Public Order Act 1986 created the new offence of disorderly
conduct         - behaviour which stops                  short of actual              violence    but
which      is    likely    to distress,            harass        or    alarm.        The Act     also
provides         the    courts       with    the power          to make        exclusion      orders
against          convicted           football       hooligans,               prohibiting        their
attendance at league matches in England and W a l e s .


2!he Football           Spectators          Act    1989    empowered          courts    to    impose
restriction            orders    on        those    convicted           of        football-related
offences to prevent them from attending key matches abroad. Those
subject to restriction orders are required to report to a police
station (of their choice) roughly when the match is taking place.
It    is   an     offence       to    fail    to    do     so.         The    Act    also    enables
magistrates        in England and Wales to make orders against those
convicted         of    corresponding             offences        in    Scotland,       Italy    and
Sweden.         Bilateral agreements are necessary to achieve this.


The Football (Offences) Act 1991 creates three new offences all
of which were recommended by Lord Justice Taylor following his
 enquiry    into      the        Hillsborough       Stadium       Disaster1.          it    was
considered that the behaviour set out below can and does lead to
disorderly behaviour.


      (a)     throwing           any    object     at    or     towards      the    pitch    or
             spectator areas without lawful authority or reasonable
             excuse;


      (b)    taking part in indecent or racist chanting; and


      (c)    going on to the               pitch    without         lawful    authority      or
             lawful excuse.


      (These      offences         attract   a     fine,      and     the    exclusion      and
     restriction orders, referred to above, may also apply.)


     The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994                                introduced
     legislation (on grounds of public order and public safety),
     which       makes      it    a    criminal    offence       for    an    unauthorised
     person to sell a ticket for a designated football match in
     a public place or a place to which the public has access or
     otherwise by way of a trade or business.                             This implements
     another recommendation by Lord Justice Taylor (as referred
     to above).


     This measure addresses two evils brought about by ticket
     touts.       First, as they did not discriminate as to whom they
     sold        tickets,         their     activities          acted        to    undermine
     segregation arrangements.                   Secondly,       the very presence of
     ticket touts outside,                or in the vicinity of a ground can
     act    as    a   focus       for    disorder       since    it    encourages      those
     without tickets to travel to the ground hoping to obtain
     them.




      Lord Justice Taylor was appointed by the then Home
Secretary to carry out an Inquiry into the events at Sheffield
Wednesday Football Ground (Hillsborough Stadium) on 1 5 April 1989
during which 95 spectators died.
Closed        Circuit        Television            (CCTV)        plays     an
important role in policing football: for general
crowd surveillance,              for safety purposes, and for
evidence/intelligence                  in     relation         to     crime.
Analysis        of    video       tape      by    intelligence         after
matches         has     revealed             associations            between
hooligan        groups          and     criminal          offences        not
recognised at the time.                  Video evidence has also
been crucial in securing convictions. CCTV is in
operation at all designated football grounds in
England and Wales.


Stadia    in    the    Premier         and    First      Division        have
required        to    be    all       seated since         August 1994.
There    is     no    solution         which will         achieve total
safety    and    cure      all    problems         of    behaviour        and
crowd    control.          But    it is considered               that    all
seater stadia does more to achieve this than any
other single measure.


Spectators are no longer subjected to jostling or
being moved as a result of swaying or surging.
The seated spectator is not subject to pressure
of numbers behind or around him during the match.



Over    the    last    few      years       the    number      of    police
officers deployed inside grounds has fallen,                              in
many    cases    substantially.                  This    has   been made
possible because the clubs themselves have taken
far    greater       responsibility              for    training      their
stewards to a good standard.


Football clubs and local authorities are involved
in an initiative sponsored by the Commission for
Racial    Equality         in    trying      to    eliminate         racism
from    football.          This       involves         the CRE      working
with the football authorities to implement a good
                   practice guide for clubs.          Clubs actively support
                   the campaign by running special messages in match
                   programmes      stating       their   opposition     to     the
                   chanting of indecent or racist abuse.             Visits are
                   also made to schools and youth organisations in
                   the vicinity of football grounds, during which it
                   is      stressed       that      racist     behaviour        is
                   unacceptable.



Police   Liaison    with    the   clubs    and   football    authorities,      and
between forces is well developed.                Each force has appointed a
liaison officer and often an intelligence officer in respect of
each   club.   These       officers      exchange   information     with     their
counterparts   in       other   forces    in   preparation    for   forthcoming
fixtures.


There is also a continuing exchange of intelligence in relation
to major inter-club and international matches.               This includes the
use of "spotters" travelling with fans from the visiting country
to identify trouble makers to police forces in the home country.
                    INQUIRIES

Ad hoc inquiries


Many inquiries set up by the Home Secretary are done so on an ad
hoc     basis.   Recent   examples   include    the Learmont   and Woodcock
inquiries. The inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster itself was
an ad hoc inquiry. The chief disadvantage of such inquiries is
that witnesses do not give evidence under oath. This means that
they cannot be prosecuted for perjury.


Judicial Inquiries set up by the Home Secretary


Inquiries by a senior member of the Bar, Judge or retired Judge -
often referred to as judicial            inquiries — may be set up on a
number of ba s e s :-




(i )    Under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921


The Home Office has not used this procedure since 1959.                It is
generally agreed to be too cumbersome and expensive to be useful.
The Act essentially sets up a High Court at which evidence can
be heard and witnesses give evidence on oath.


(ii) Under section 49 of the Police Act 1996 (formerly s.32 of
the Police Act 1964).


Only three such inquiries have been held.           The first, soon after
the Act was passed in 1964, was into the activities of Sergeant
Challenor (who had been able to continue on duty while mentally
ill for reasons which the report explored).


Subsequently,      successive Home Secretaries have taken the view
that the decision to set up an inquiry under section 32,                like
that under the 1921 Act, is a major step not to be taken lightly.
While    no   absolute    rules   have   been   laid   down,   the   general
principles set out in the Answer attached are those which have
been generally referred to in correspondence and Parliament.
The other two section 32 inquiries took place -


      in 1974,    into the disturbances in Red Lion Square, and
      in 1981,    into the Brixton disorders.


Section 32 inquiries were refused, for example, in relation to -


           violent clashes at the Notting Hill Carnival in 1976,
           the    major   corruption       enquiry      in   the   Metropolitan
           Police in 1978,
           the death of Blair Peach in 1979,
           the    shooting     of Mr    Stephen   Waldorf     by Metropolitan
           Officers in 1983
      •    the Stalker affair.



The Police Complaints Authority (PCA)


Full inquiries have become increasingly rare since the setting
up of the PCA on 29 April 1985.


Its predecessor, the Police Complaints Board had power to examine
the   reports    of   police   investigations      of     complaints,   decide
whether disciplinary charges should be brought and who should
adjudicate on them.     The PCA, additionally, supervises complaints
investigations and ensures that all relevant matters are properly
followed up.


It is frequently asked to supervise the investigation of large
events where police actions have attracted criticism.                It did so
in the case of the Bradford disturbances earlier in the year.


Other Inquiries


(i)   HMCIC occasionally asks a senior police officer to conduct
a particular inquiry on his behalf,             in addition to the normal
programme of inspections,        to ensure that the efficiency of an
individual force or officer.           He did so,       for instance,   in the
case of the Yorkshire Ripper,           where doubt was       felt as to the
force's performance in the investigation.               This type of inquiry
is only   relevant    to current       issues   where    the outcome    of   the
enquiry   may   be   an   immediate   change   in   either   procedures   or
personnel.


(ii)   In Metropolitan cases,     the Home Secretary can call        for a
report from the Commissioner.           The only case of which we are
aware where this was done in recent years was in relation to what
was popularly known as the 'Poll Tax Riot' on 31 March 1990.
  ADJOURNMENT DEBATE:          HILLSBOROUGH - DRAFT SPEAKING NOTE FOR MR
  MACLEAN


   I would like to join with the Hon Member for Liverpool Walton in
   expressing my deepest sympathy for the families of those who were
   involved in the tragic events at Hillsborough.                     I know I speak
   for the whole House in saying that our thoughts will remain with
   them this Christmas, which I know they must find a particularly
   difficult time of the year.


   Anybody who saw the news reports that dreadful Saturday - 15th
^ P o f April 1989 - will have been overwhelmed by those terrible and
   distressing pictures. I know that for the families who suffered
   such appalling tragedy their loss was made all the worse by the
   fact that they arose out of an event which should have been a
   normal family outing.


   I have watched the programme Hillsborough and found it deeply
   moving. Particularly poignant was the portrayal of the pre match
   excitement when viewers knew that the day would end in such a
   terrible tragedy. However I must admit that I am a little uneasy
   about    the    use   of   a drama   documentary     to make       what   are    very
   serious    points     because   it does    not    allow    those    points      to be
   properly debated or challenged.


   If the programme makers had used a normal documentary format and
   invited    South Yorkshire       Police    to    comment   on   the   charges,      I
   understand that South Yorkshire Police could have told them that
   the     video    which     is   supposed   to     have     shown     evidence      of
   overcrowding on the terraces was available to the Taylor enquiry,
   and so far as they are concerned has never been missing.


   And, if the programme makers had used a normal documentary style
   I feel they would have shown that the matter of the timing of the
   deaths and whether the Coroner had made a mistake in taking a
   3.15 cut off point had already been considered by a judicial
   review. These points were not made clear and the focus of the
   programme was on the need            for another public         inquiry.     I will
   discuss that call in a moment.
But,     first    as    the     hon   Member       knows    there    have     been    four
independent       investigations            or    reviews    of     the   Hillsborough
tragedy:


       •       there    was Lord Taylor's inquiry


       •       there    was the inquest into each of the deaths


       •       there     was    the   investigation         into    police    behaviour
               supervised by the PCA


       •       finally, there was the judicial review of the inquest.


Each of these served a different purpose;                     I think it might be
helpful if I were to say just a little about of each of these
inquiries and their outcome.


Lord Taylor's enquiry
First,     the   formal        inquiry   by      Lord   Justice     Taylor.    This   was
commissioned by the then Home Secretary on the second day after
the disaster.          Its terms of reference were not only to inquire
into the events but also to make recommendations about the needs
of crowd control and safety at sports events.


Over 31 days between the 15th of May and the 29th of June 1989,
Lord Taylor heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public
hearing in Sheffield. He also received evidence in the form of
submissions and letters. The inquiry considered video film from
three separate sources which provided in all some 71 hours of
further evidence.


Lord Taylor published an interim report in August 1989 which set
out      the     causes        for    the        disaster    and     made     immediate
recommendations. He found that there were a number of causes why
the disaster took place:


       •       the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding was the
               failure to cut off access to the central pens which
               were already overfull.
     •   they     were       already     overfull       because       no    safe      maximum
          capacities had been laid down, no attempt was made to
          control          entry   to    individual          pens     numerically,           and
          there       was    no    effective      visual       monitoring          of    crowd
          density.


     •   he found that when the influx from gate C entered pen
          3,    the     layout     of    the     barriers       there      afforded         less
          protection than they should have done and a barrier
          collapsed.


     •   he     found       that   the    need    to    open    gate       C was      due    to
          dangerous           congestion          at     the        turnstiles.           That
          congestion occurred because, as both the club and the
          police should have realised, the turnstile area could
          not    easily cope with              the     large numbers            unless    they
          arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The police had
          failed to draw up plans                 as to how they would control
          large       numbers      should they arrive               in a    short period.
          Unfortunately that event, which Lord Taylor considered
          was foreseeable,            took place.


     •   Finally        he    found      that     the    presence          of    an     unruly
          minority          who    had    drunk        too     much     aggravated           the
          problem.          So did the clubs 1s confused and inadequate
          signs and ticketing.


So we have it: a number of reasons for the disaster;                              no single
person or organisation to blame. But Lord Taylor clearly put a
significant portion of the blame for the disaster at the door of
the police.


Indeed he was particularly               critical       of the attitude of               South
Yorkshire Police to the disaster.                I quote from the report:


     "It is a matter of regret that at the hearing and in their
     submissions,       the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared
     to concede       that they were in           any respect at fault in what
     occurred.        Mr     Duckenfield, under              pressure       of          cross­
     examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for
     causing the deaths. But that apart, the police case was to
     blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the
     club for failing to monitor the pens.                         It was argued that
     the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate
     C but was     due        to barrier       124a       being    defective.      Such    an
     unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether
     lessons have been learnt.                It would have been more seemly
     and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been
     faced."



 if needed


[He also considered the reports that had been published in the
press about the behaviour of Liverpool fans. Again I quote from
his report:
     "Before this Inquiry began there were stories reported in
     the press,    and said to have emanated from police officers
     present at the match,                of "mass drunkenness".               It was said
     that     drunken    fans       urinated        on    police     whilst     they    were
     pulling    the dead           and    injured    out,     that    others     had    even
     urinated     on     the       bodies    of     the    dead     and    stolen      their
     belongings.        Not    a    single    witness       was    called      before     the
     inquiry to support any of those allegations, although every
     opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties
     to have any witness called whom they wished. As soon as the
     allegations        I have mentioned were made                   in the press,         Mr
     Peter Wright,        Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,                         made a
     dignified statement dissociating himself                         from such grave
     and emotive calumnies.                Those who made them and those who
     disseminated        them      would     have    done    better       to   hold    their
     peac e."



This is strong criticism.                I think these quotations demonstrate
that many of the points made by the programme were considered by
Lord Taylor at the time.
But I must stress that since the report the police have accepted
responsibility         for the part         they plaved        in the disaster.        The
present Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,                       Richard Wells,       has
on several occasions publicly expressed his deep sorrow at the
deaths. Most recently,              on the Today programme he said that the
police saw their responsibility                   in three particular areas.            He
admitted that -
       •      once     the    gates       were    open   the     police    should     have
              foreseen where the fans would go


       •      he accepted        that they might have reduced some of                  the
              pressure by changing the kick off time.


       •      he also accepted that officers did not recognise soon
              enough the distinction between disorder and distress.


So, the South Yorkshire Police have accepted that they were at
fault in those respects.                 The South Yorkshire Police Authority
have paid compensation to the families of those who died. This
is apart from money paid out by the Hillsborough disaster appeal.


The inquest
The second investigation into events was the inquest conducted
by    Her   Majesty's        Coroner      for    the   Western    District    of    South
Yorkshire. This was a difficult task partly because of the number
of    deaths         and      partly because the Taylor inquiry was itself in
progress. The Coroner            conducted an inquiry into               the deaths    and
sat    for a total of 96 days.


I think it is important that I remind the House of the purpose
of    an    inquest;    it     is    a    fact    finding      inquiry    conducted     to
establish reliable answers to four important but limited factual
questions. They are:


       •      the identity of the deceased


       •      the place of death


               the time,      if known, and date of death; and finally
                 how the deceased came by his or her death.


   That is all an inquest can consider.                     Rule 36 of the Coroners'
   Rules    1984    requires        that     the   proceedings        and    evidence     are
   directed solely at finding the answers to these questions and it
   forbids any expression of opinion on other matters.


   As    members    of    this    House      are   aware,    the    jury     examining    the
   evidence found that the cause of death was accidental death. But
   the findings of an inquest do not bind any person affected by
^ ^ t h e m . The inquest conclusion must not be framed in such a way as
   to determine any question of criminal responsibility on the part
   of a named person or any question of civil liability. A finding
   of accidental death does not prevent further proceedings.



   Investigation by West Midland Police


   The third investigation into the disaster was conducted by West
   Midland Police supervised by the independent Police Complaints
   Authority       with    a     view   to    establishing         whether    the     tragedy
   resulted from,         or was made worse by,             criminal activity on the
   part of any individual.              It also considered whether any officer
   should be subject to disciplinary proceedings. The investigation
   involved the taking of 5,341 statements as well as a scrutiny of
   all the material which had previously been examined. The evidence
   was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions who concluded
   that the result did not indicate that any one should be made the
   subject of criminal proceedings.                 This meant that neither Chief
   Superintendent Duckenfield, nor Superintendent Murray, who were
   both criticised by the Taylor Inquiry,                    nor for that matter any
   other person has been charged with any crime.


   For any other person apart from a police officer that would have
   been    the   end of        the proceedings.       For    a police        officer    there
   remained the question of whether they had failed in their duty.
   The     Police    Complaints         Authority       decided       that     both     Chief
   Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray should face
   disciplinary charges.            Police disciplinary hearings are held in
private; they are concerned only with whether an officer may have
failed to conform to police discipline. A disciplinary hearing
does not consider wider issues.


But, a further point about police disciplinary hearings which is
often forgotten is that whilst there are a number of punishments
which   can        be    imposed       for   bad     discipline,       the    most    serious
punishment         a     disciplinary          tribunal    can       impose    is    that     of
dismissal or of a requirement to resign.


This is the heaviest punishment which it is possible to award an
officer for the very worst offence which he could have committed.
It means that his conduct must have been so bad that it would be
inappropriate for him to remain an officer.


In the event Mr Duckenfield retired because of his ill health in
advance of a disciplinary tribunal's ruling on whether or not he
was guilty.         But by doing so he took on himself what the worst
disciplinary            judgement      could have       imposed upon him            to do.    He
stopped being a police officer.                      The disciplinary hearing could
not continue because such hearings can only be held on police
officers.


On   13 January          the    Police Complaints          Authority         announced      that
disciplinary proceedings against Superintendent Murray would be
withdrawn.         When explaining their decision the Authority stated
that    the    retirement          of    the    Chief     Superintendent        on    medical
grounds meant that what,                 in effect,       was a joint allegation of
neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the
more senior officer. But, some time later, Superintendent Murray
also decided that he                too did not wish to remain as a police
officer. I think we must not forget in our deep sympathy for the
families      that       this    was    also     a   personal    tragedy       for    both    Mr
Duckenfield and Mr Murray.


So that       is    three      separate      examinations       of    events    surrounding
Hillsborough;            each   one     with     a   separate    purpose.       The    fourth
examination was the judicial review of the Coroner's proceedings.
Review of the inquest


Again it might be helpful if I remind the house that neither the
Home Secretary nor the Attorney General has the power to order
a fresh inquest. That can only be done by the courts, either if
an application is made,              with the consent of my rt hon Friend,
under       section    13 of   the    1988 Act,         or by means       of a Judicial
Revi ew.


Moreover, under the statutory procedure, it is a requirement that
in order to justify directing a fresh inquest there should not
only    be     specific      grounds,    such       a   fresh     evidence,     but     also
circumstances that make a fresh inquest necessary or desirable
in     theinterests of justice.


Mr     Williams, whose       son,    Kevin,    was       so    tragically killed, put
forward an application under section                       13 of the Act;           the main
points were:



        •      that the coroner wrongly failed to direct the jury as
               to the verdict of lack of care                 or accidental death due
               to or    "aggravated by lack              of     care"    relating     to the
               negligence of the police which caused the tragedy.


        •       that the coroner wrongly excluded evidence of lack of
                care in the emergency services and police reaction to
                the deceased initial injuries, wrongly insisted on a
                cut off point of 3.15 pm for the evidence heard at the
               main inquest.
and
                wrongly failed to direct the jury on the availability
                of a verdict of accidental death by lack of care or
                lack    of   care    based     on    the      failure    of   the    various
                responsible         agencies    to      provide    the    deceased      with
                adequate medical         attention after they had sustained
                their original injuries.


It was also asserted in relation to Kevin Williams that there was
evidence to justify the coroner in concluding that he was alive
beyond the 3.15 pm cut off time that the Coroner had adopted, and
that pressure had been put on two witnesses                  to retract          their
evidence about the signs of life they described in Kevin Williams
after 3.15.


After close examination of the evidence                 at that point by             the
Attorney General it was concluded that none of the matters raised
afforded a realistic likelihood of a successful application to
the High Court.


Nevertheless, relatives of a number of the victims separately and
successfully sought a judicial review. The conduct of the South
Yorkshire coroner's inquest was subject to a close and detailed
examination.      In giving the judgement of the Divisional Court,
Lord    Justice    McCowan    ruled    very     clearly     that    none       of    the
procedural or technical points raised justified the intervention
of the Divisional Court. In particular, it found that the cut off
point of 3.15 was a reasonable and sustainable point,                        and that
the coroner's directions to the jury were impeccable.


As a Minister       it   is clearly not possible           for me    to know         the
truth   of what     happened on      that   terrible      Saturday.      But    it    is
important that we are satisfied that those dreadful events nearly
seven years ago have been fully investigated and examined. It is
impossible to guarantee that a tragedy will never occur again but
measures have now been            taken to ensure       that British         football
stadia are among the safest in the world.


The    hon Member    for Liverpool      Walton    now     calls    for   a     further
public inquiry into these events. I fully sympathise with those
families who feel that in some way they have not learnt the truth
about their loved one's deaths. Certainly in an appalling tragedy
such as Hillsborough         it    is perhaps    inevitable,       though deeply
distressing for the families, that there will be confusion about
some details.


After all the investigations and examinations that have taken
place, could we ever achieve greater certainty than we have now
about the events?        I believe that Lord Taylor did an excellent
job at the time and one for which sports fans have reason to be
grateful.


I fully understand that some families still feel bitter about the
way that events were handled that terrible day; things were done,
or not done, things were said to the press that should not have
been said, but the fact that we know about them suggests there
has been no cover up. Lord Taylor criticised the police;                           South
Yorkshire have accepted that they were partly responsible for the
consequences and the police authority have paid compensation.


I believe that positive lessons have been learnt.                      Lord Taylor
made far reaching recommendations which have been implemented:


               All clubs of the Premier League and First Division
              have    converted    their   stadia      to all   seated    grounds.
              Second and Third Division clubs should have all seater
              stadia by August 1999.


              The    Government     has    made    £139m    available         to     the
              Football Trust to fund Taylor related work at football
              grounds for projects totalling £437m.


British stadia are now recognised as being amongst the safest in
the   word.    This    was   commented      on    by   overseas    visitors          and
officials during EURO 96. Thankfully there have been no major
incidents since Hillsborough. So, we should not forget the very
positive things which have been achieved.


What if there is fresh evidence? A drama documentary is not in
itself evidence.        I don't often agree with the hon Member                      for
Blackburn but he too recognised that it was important to examine
the evidence, not just the programme.


But what if in making the drama, the researchers have discovered
new   information,       what     then?    The    Chief    Constable     of        South
Yorkshire has already made clear that if there is fresh evidence
he would wish        to have    it examined       and so has      my   rt hon        and
learned friend the Home Secretary.


I   understand    that   if   there     were    fresh   evidence   the   Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire has emphasised that he would not
wish it to be examined by police from the South Yorkshire force,
who might be considered to have a vested interest in the outcome,
but by officers of a different force. Furthermore, he would wish
this    investigation to be supervised by the independent Police
Complaints     Authority.     The     Police    Complaints   Authority    have
themselves     indicated      their     willingness     to   undertake    this
supervision.     If evidence of any wrongdoing were uncovered those
papers would be passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions in
order    to determine whether         charges   should be brought    against
anybody and I support this approach.

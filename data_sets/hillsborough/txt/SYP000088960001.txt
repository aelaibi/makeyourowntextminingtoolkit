We    t r a velled via Snake Pass anti just                 pulled         into the sioe of         the      t oau.

during    the    night for a sleep.               We started          off again about 6am             (0600)

on S a t u r d a y morning and arri v e d           in S h e f f i e l d at about        7am    (0700)=

After    going      to a cafe we         parked the van near                to a Gateways

Sup>e rmar ke t «     1 he Police        directed us there , this was at about                        * eL noon.

A p o l i c ewoman told us where             there was an open^ p u b and we went                     there.

I think    it was      called i^fhe Fox".              We staye/r there             for about 2 hours

a n d only had a a           Qe    of    oints     each.      |j?fere was a lot of other

Liverpool       supporters        in the     pub,     but   it was all            good humoured w ith no

trouble.        1 didn't      see a n y b o d y    leaving     the        pub with    cans,    because        the

Police were stopping              it.     When we walked from t h e y p u b to the ground we

never    got any Police           escort,     but there were               plenty of Police         near      the

ground?    and we a r r i v e d there at about 2. I G p m ^ l V I O ) .                  Everyone was           in

a good mood and          it was g e n erally a good ^tafos phere,                     a l t h o u g h near    to

there was a lot of            people      just mi M / n g      around.            There were a few

p o l iceme n outside       the turnstiles and              I think         there were 2 standing at

each    turnstile entrance.               Once     in the ground            I remember      seeing     other

policemen,       but not any stewards.                 It was        easy enough to find fity way

into    the ground,        but    then    I've been there             before and know the             layout

I think the entrance was also                     shown on the            ticket.     The turnstile

            inside        the ground theMatm o s p h e r e was              good and everyone was                  ord                    I

            didn't        see any drinking,               but    I was aware at that            time      in Per G        there

            was a lr e a d y a lot of               people.       Also    it waiy^the same             in t n ^ ifi i next          x,o

            quite       sure of the           time as      I loo!-:       ip at    the    c i ostf!.     1 never        saw a

            barrier        break         in the     pen when the         crushing    rejrily started,              but    I feel

            sure      I heard           it break.        That was at about i fpfft (1500)                   I can

            remember         seeing the game              in pragress ,\ j f n e crushing at this                   time was

            really bad,            and     I knew there was a problem,                   it w a s n ’t like        normal

            matches.           It was        bearable at first,            then all       of a sudden           it became

            unbearable.                 This must      have     been at about 2 . 5 5 p m       (1555).           Because       of

            all     the    crushing,          the     ladsyChat       I had been with had jfn 1 become                    split

            People were            panicking and screaming as the                    cr                  worse and worse

            it and        I can remember              seeing all       the faces     pushed up against                  the

            fence,        not talking            or shouting.          I don't     know    if they were alive                  or

            old     chap squashed up against                     the fence       between Pens 2 & 3.                He was          in

                to get him out.              He was     near    to the front at Pen 3 and was wearing a

                tweed jacket.          He had short            grey hair and was aged about                     late 6 0 ' s.

                He   looked quite a well              m an ic u r e d   chap.        He was    clean shaven without

                spectacles.



                When    I had been         put    in f e n   2 by the         policeman       I saw                             run

                onto    the    pitch to ti\ie/playe rs and               I went       back onto the       pitch through

                the open escape            gate.      There was         lots of people           climbing out j f f        Pen 3

                I think       one of the main          problems         that            ed all    the deaths and

                                  Hillsborough Family Support Group


         26th July 1997

          Councillor Frank Prendergast
          Leader
          Liverpool City Council.

          Dear Councillor Prendergast,

                                       You will recall that I wrote to you on 6th February 1997 (copy
          enclosed) requesting the secondment o f Ann Adlington and Colin Moneypenny to assist
          Hillsborough families in their quest for justice. Despite your refusal at that time, the Group
          managed to stage the magnificent Justice Concert at Anfield on May 10th, people across the
          country are still talking about the success of the “gig with a mission’ . [It was bad enough we
          had to turn to a southerner to ensure the concert went ahead but it is nothing short of
          disgraceful that Liverpool City Council did not openly support the event.]

          In addition to the concert you will no doubt be aware that on 30th June 1997 the Home
          Secretary, Jack Straw, ordered an independent scrutiny into the fresh evidence which has
          recently emerged. He has ordered this scrutiny on the grounds that it is in the public interest.
          Furthermore the strength o f feeling and support in the city is such that people of their own
          volition want to organise a march for “Justice for the 96", sadly despite the Special City
          Council Meeting o f 19th December 1996 support from the Council is notably absent. You may^
          have read in the media that Lord Justice Stuart Smith has asked for written submissions by 3 1st
           August. Further, he intends to visit Liverpool in early September to interview families. As you
           will appreciate there is a tremendous amount of work to be done in the next few weeks. In this
           context the Hillsborough family Support Group again requests the release of at least Ann
           Adlington who’s knowledge and expertise is crucial to the success of our campaign she has
           worked far too long in her own time. The Hillsborough Family Support Group are due to
           open their own office ( without any financial assistance from the council) within the next few
f         days. The whole country knows that this is our last chance. Therefore, I hereby inform you
           that unless the Council accedes to this request by 5pm Wednesday 29th July, the group has no
'         alternative but to publish this letter as an open letter in the local and national media.

I sincerely hope that you do not take this letter as a form of threat but it seems that once again
the City Council is hopelessly out o f touch with the wishes of the people o f this City. All we
want is justice, the truth and the chance to lay our loved ones to rest in peace.

Yours sincerely

              I am a m ar ri ed man and             I live at the above address wit h my wife.                                 On

              Saturday       the      15th of April       1989    (150489),            I was work in g as a turnstile

              operator at the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s da y football                  ground     in Hillsborough,,

              Forest.        I started work          at   12 noon and             I was    posted to t u rn st il e

              numbsr              situated at      the P en istone Roa d end of the ground.                          My job

              was     to take      the tickets       from the s u pp or te rs             keep the     smaller       part      of

              the ticket and give             the    longer      part of the ticket              back     to the

              suppo rte r »

              The m a t ch was        tickets      only and m oney did not                 have to     change      hands.

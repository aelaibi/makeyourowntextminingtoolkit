                walk    to L e p p i ng s    Lane.

                I had been to the ground                       the year            before so          I knew        where           I was going.

                I a r r i v e d at the ground at about                            twenty     to three and               could see there

              I cannot        say that          I s^fw either Po l i c e             giving         d i rections   or stewards.

              I did not         feel      that     the    t urnstiles were               very well        s i g n p o s t e d and   this

              was     not    helped      by the      sheer     numbers          of     people        trying    to get     in.

              Wh i l st     I was    in the are a          betw e e n the blue              gates and the           t u rnstiles

              the re was an a lm i g h t y           crush.        11 was R e a l l y           bad at      this    point and        I

         ,   moved     out     to get       out     of the cr u    ^n .


Gr*t>b>      A short        time    later a         blue              was    opened.            I    did not see       who opened

              it, a n d      I wa l k e d    in thjrough it.

              I saw numerous              people     climb over           the walls            of/the     turnstiles        and enter

             ^ t he gro u n d      t h^fc^way.                 O/SJ/YV 'TT+ • ^

              I did not         Hand my ticket             in as      I went         t hr o u g h    the gate and

              unfortunately              I have     since      lost    it.

              Once     t hr o u g h the      gate    there were           no signs           to tell me where            to go at

              all,     although          I had been there             before         I can u n d e r s t a n d how       people      got

              c o n fuse d    or    lost     trying       to find their              viewing         position.        I understood

              that     the    only way onto              the terraces           was      thro u g h the       tunnel.       There

                were no Police or S t e w ar ds to7 assist peopie/wi.th any problems.

                I went thro u g h the tunnel at about two minu t e s to three.   It was

              nor     did    I see       people     drinking       alcohol           in the ground.

              Fro m    the moment           I got    into Pen 3 I could f e e / t h a t                     it was a tight

              crush.         I had trouble           breathing and have                    never      e x p e r i e n c e d anything

              like     it before.           This     intense       crushing y'ent on from three                        o ’clock

get    nearer         the    open gate

There     was a mi d d l e ac^rti man                   in front           of me who           I believe     had died.

He    had blond hair and was                       standing           sideways           on to the        crowd.         I cannot

recall         anything       of his       clothing.                 His       eyes were        closed and his            head

was    s lu m p e d    to one       side.          His    face was              blue and he a p p e a r e d        to be

t o ta l l y    lifeless.

I cannot         recall       a n y t hi ng    else       that may              identify this man.              I

e v e n t u a l l y got      onto    the      pitch and              I beLi^ve           I got thro u g h the gate

onto     the     pitch.         It was at           this paint                 that    I passed      out and was           helped

After      I came       round on the               pitch         I saw the            cordon of Police          officers

across         the    pitch and       could not u n d e r s t a n d what                       they were     doing.

They sh o u l d have           been d e p l oy ed           better and joined                    in the     rescue        going

on at     the other           end of       the      pitch.            T h a t j m .s a waste         of time and was

the wrong            thing    to do.          All       that ma n / o w e r           was w a s t e d .

With     regard        to the tunnel,               if thajjte two               pens were        full     up early on in

2      C OMMENTS

2.1    Resolution

       That the Chief Constable be requested to consider and report on the
       suggestion that all relevant information on the policing of football
       matches should be provided to both the relevant local authorities and the
       football clubs in the interest of increasing the effectiveness of liaison
       with other than just the other emergency services.

               As reported previously, the Chief Co nstab le has d i r ecte d that a full
               police operational order for every football m a t c h shall be available
               to each local au thorit y and eac h football club.           Wher e relevant
               i n for mation comes to notice after the operatio nal order has bee n
               supplied, then that inf orm a t i o n w i l l also be m a d e available, and
               forwarded on a separate, upda ted i n f ormati on sheet.

2.2     Resolution

        operation of the Force since the Hillsborough disaster in light of the
        commments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry, particularly those
        contained in Chapter 18.

        i       The video tape film 'Faces in a Crowd' prepared by the South Yo rkshir e
                Police to hig hlight the pr oblems of crowd density', crowd distress and
                crowd dynamics, w h i c h is being used as a training aid for police
                officers and those stewards w h o m o n i t o r football crowds in South
                Yorkshire, has been r ecogni sed by other Police Forces in this cou ntry
                as a mo st v a l u able training medium.    To date, thirty-six other Forces
                have requested, and been supplied with, copies of this video.

        ii      Those c o m p rehen sive packages detail ing the mea sures w h i c h have already
                be en taken, or are r e co mmend ed for the future at each football ground
                in .South Yorkshire, prepared by the police I m p l e ment ation T e a m in an
                effort to ensure crowd safety, have each been received by the
                r esp ective local authorities, and have bee n given detailed attention
                by the A dvis o r y Groups set up by those authorities.      W o r k is now being
                done to finalise those r e c o m men dation s outlined in the packages
                referred to.
     Lord Justice Taylors Final Report published on 29 January 1990

     In order to keep the Aut hority appraised, the following comments
     h ighlight the changes and a djustments that result from the final
     report.         The number of recommen datio ns increases from 43 to 76 and the
     m a j o r i t y of those repeated are the same in content and wording.    It is
     intended in this paper to give a summarised v i e w of the new
     provisions, a m o r e detailed account, together w i t h the action to be
     taken will be giv en once there has b e e n a full opportu nity to evaluate
     the reco mmendations and their implications.          It is important to note,
     however, Lord Justice Taylor's comment at page 42, p a r a gra ph 243 where
     he recognises that 'The S outh Y o r k s h i r e Police had a good record, that
     day apart, for handling difficult crowd problems successfully'.

The R ecomme ndatio ns begin by placing r e s p o nsibl ity on clubs to move to an
all-se ating stadium.     Time schedules are applicable to all designated
sports grounds by August 1999.      A n A d v i s o r y D esig n Council should be formed
together w i t h a Nati onal Inspectorate and R e v i e w Body w h i c h w i l l look at
certif ying and licensing functions in r e l a tion to all sports grounds and
sports entertainment.

The new provisions address m a x i m u m densi ty and notional rates of turnstyle
throughput, and the a me ndatio n of W R I T T E N A GREE M E N T to a combined STATEMENT
OF INTENT w h i c h is e s senti ally what we have now.

There are recommen dation s in re latio n to pen density monitoring, gangways,
fences and gates together w i t h the annual inspections of crash barriers,
the grounds and their environs.

One important change to note is at Rec om m e n d a t i o n 31 where the Ad visory
Group should consult repre sentat ives of the clubs and their recognised
supporters associations on a regular basis.         Pre viousl y the club and the
supporters were included as part of the A d v i s o r y Group.

There are important amendments to turnstyle and fan access but a new
rec omm e n d a t i o n clearly states that on all ticket occasions the club should
not sell tickets on the day of the match.           The rec ruitment of stewards and
their training is w e l l defined.

The major r e c o m me ndati on in this part of the report at 43 is that a Club
should provide a Police Control Room.         This deals not only w i t h its
po sition but also its equipment, and recomme nds that there is a duty to
provide such to the sati sfact ion of the Chief Officer.

At R e c o m m e n d a t i o n 53 there is pr ovisio n for Police Authori ties to r e view
their charges and on 1 February 1990 the Chief Constable wrote to the Clerk
to the Police A u t h o r i t y w i t h a v i e w to this taking place.

The remaining recom mendations refer to the general issues of
communications, c o - o rd inati on of emerg e n c y services, general facilities and
offences.   A number of points should be noted, the p r o v isi on presuma bly by
the Amb ulance Service or Club of a major e mergency vehicle to deal w i t h
over 50 casualties w h e r e crowds in excess of 5,000 are expected.
Additionally, offences of selling tickets with out authority, throwing
missiles, chanting obscene or racialist abuse and pitch invasion without
reasonable excuse are recom mended together w i t h giving additional powers to
the Court regarding a ttendance centres and electronic monitoring.

Finally, as a m a tter of urgency the Home Office is requested to revise the
G ree n Guide in accordance w i t h the report. Whilst the Football Spectators
Act 1989 a l r eady addresses some of these issues, there w i l l be a requirement
for the S ecretary of State to make regulations to bring a number of the
recomme ndatio ns into effect.

The recom mendat ions genera lly may require some revisi on to current policies
and practices in rela t i o n to the Police, Local Authority, Football Clubs
and other e m e r genc y services, in a d d i tion to those already achieved through
the Interim Report recommendations.           Thes e issues w i l l be addressed
imm ediately and the Chief Const able w i l l continue to report to the Police
A u t h o r i t y on this subject.

A copy of the Final Report was, of course, supplied to Police Authority
Members by the Clerk and Financial Officer by letter dated 30 January 1990.

                   I event u a l l y opened my t u r n stileN^t                  about     12 noon.             I was    on my own

                   and my position faced Harries                      Road.

                   During     the    course       of my duties         I did not see any alcohol                        being    brought

                   into    the ground or drunk                in the ground.              I was       not sub m i t t e d to any

                   threats     or any violence,              however        as   is usual       I received and heard

                   In my opinion           I d i d n ’t think        that    the suppo r t e r s        were      coming     into    the

                   g round that quickly.                 They were hang i ng ar o u n d outside and                       i n Hs r ri es

                   Road.

                   This    in my opinion            is unusual        at both Le a g u e and Cup Semi                    Final

                   meetings.         G e ne ra ll y and      in this        case   the s upporters              who a r r i v e d at,

                   between     1445 and          1500 hours were            drunk.        As   is usual          they were

                   ifnpat ie nt to e n t e r t he g r o u n d a nd were              in a r u s h .        T h is    led to      pu s h in q

                   At    1500 hours a police              officer      told me       to    close.          This     I did.

                   I then went           to the S o u t h S t a n d where          I clocked up.                I then    left and

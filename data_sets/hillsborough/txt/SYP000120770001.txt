              On Saturday,                15 A p r i l ,      1989    <150489)            I was        on    duty       in    company with

              other       officers           involved          in d u t i e s       at    the F A C u p S e m i              Final     Football

              N o t t s . Forest           FC.       I wa s     detailed            in S e r ial        No.       34,    a Serial           which

              contained 8 Police                    Constables             including             myself,          PS 2 E 4 8 S h e r r a t t        and

              Inspector            "fownend        in    command.

             At     10 00      hours       we     all    attended          a briefing             in the          grounds       North        stand.

              At    1100 hours             Serial        34 and       35 were            briefed        by    Inspector           Townend.

             At     1 11 5     hours       our     two S e r i a l s       t oo k    up       positions;          on Cl a y w h e e l s ’ L a n e

             and     there         PS Sherratt               instructed my Serial                      in t h e i r      duties        w hich were

              to    instruct             each     individual          supporters                coach which arrived                    to    d ri v e

              to    the      far    end      of    t h at    lane     and       return          and    park       for   an     easy     exit

              facing         out    of     Claywheels           L a n e.        Each      bus     was       then     parked       in    convoy

             along        the      nearside         k e rb .        My Serial            then met           the    supporters           on     each

              co ac h ,      welcomed           them     to S h e f f i e l d ,      informed           them       t h at     they     were     to

              l ea v e    any      prohibited            articles          on    the      bus,        informing         them      that       they

             would        be      searched         on    entering          the      ground        and       requesting          them        to m a k e

              their       way      to     the     ground       as    s o o n as      possible.               I myself          carried        out a

              number         of    these        warnings,           they were            done     in a f r i e n d l y m a n n e r           and

              responded            to w a r m l y       by   supporters.                 Th e    buses       which arrived

eventually           filled           the     whole           of C l a y w h e e l s        Lane.            In m y      view        this

section       of     supporters,                   although            it w a s       apparent           that       s o me      had    been

drinking,          were         well         behaved          and      in g o o d          spirits.           However,           some       of

these      fans      had        obviously               arrived without                     tickets          for    the       m a t c h as

they were          going            round      fans          leaving            the   buses        asking          if    there        were

'a n y   spares’.

At    1343 hours           Claywheels                   Lane     was        completely             full       of    supporters*

buses      a n d PC       3234        Cobb         i n f o r m e d me           she   had        recorded          a total           of 5 2

buses      and 2 mini                buses         at    this         location.

At    14 23   hours        we w e r e          further            deployed             to    the     junction            of C l a y w h e e l s

Lane     with Penistone                      Road North/Halifax                        R o ad.

We    positioned           ourselves                outside            the       Public          House       situated           on t h a t

corner        namely        ’T h e      Gate'           public         house.              Our    duties        were       d e f i n e d as

supervising              t he       arriving            f an s    who       were       walking          down H alifax                Road

towards        us.

PS Sherratt              instructed                my Serial               to    form       a filter          lane       of     officers

along      this      pavement                and    the       pavement            on t he         opposite          side        of    the

carriageway              and        requested            us      to    inform any                supporters             passing        this

position        that       alcoholic                drinks            should          be    left     there         and     taken       no

f urthe r .

As    I a r r i v e d at            t h is    location and                  took       up    this       point       I could           see     a

good      distance          up H a l i f a x            Road      a n d as        far as          the    eye       could        see    I saw

that      there      was        a    continuous               flow         of L i v e r p o o l      supporters               in g r o u p s

approximately               10 a b r e a s t            on    both         sides       of    the     carriageway                coming

towards        us.

The      majority         of        these      supporters                  were       males       in the        lower         ag e    b ra ck e t,

it w a s      very       apparent             to me          t h at    a    large          amount       of    alcohol           had    b e en

consumed        by       the        v as t    majority            of       these       men.

A    la rge    number           of     them were              s t il l      drinking             on t h e i r      way     towards          the

ground and           a    large          number          of      them       were       halted        and asked             to    leav e

their       intoxicants                 at    t h is        location.              Some         of    them    left       their     d ri n k s ,

others          insisted           on    consuming                t h e m at       this         location.            These       drinks

consisted             of a v a r i e t y           of       canned          beers      and       lagers-           The     whole       of     the

wall      outside            The       Gate       public          house         became          heavily       littered           with       these

obj e c t s .

Generally             these        supporters                were       all      of    good          behaviour,          they were

drunk       but       not.    incapable                or    unduly          disorderly.                 It w a s     apparent          to me

from      the        time     1 commenced                   my    p o s i t i o n at        this       location          how     late       these

thousands             of     drunken          Liverpool                supporters               had    left     it    to    go    to    the

ground          in s u c h a m a s s              hoping          to    get       into      the       ground       before        the

commencement                 of    the       game.

I knew          t h at     there        was       little          likelihood               of    them       being     there       for       the

kick-off.                 I felt        it    hard          to    understand               why       these    persons          should

travel          so    far     to a l l e g e d l y           support            their       team and          then       (a)     leav e       it

far     too      l at e      to    get       to    the       ground          and      (b)       be    in s u c h a d r u n k e n

condition             so as        not       to    be a b l e          to     fully appreciate                  the m a t c h      from        the

obtained             admission.

This      heavy           mass     of    persons             continued             without            any    significant           gaps

appearing             u n t il     about          -1510 h o u r s .

At     1 45 3    hours        I went          with          other       officers            to T h e G a t e p u b l i c          house        as

a    result          of a     report          of       fighting             in s i d e .

These      premises               were       locked and                e n t r y was        g a i n e d w i t h s om e

difficulty.                 Upon        entering             the       lounge         1. saw         that    it w a s      full    of

football             supporters              supporting                red a n d       white          colours.           The     atmosphere

w as    hostile            and     a    lot       of    them were              heavily           dr un k .     The       Landlord           wa s

approached                by P S       Sherratt             and    the       persons            present       were       requested           to

leave      the        premises           and       the L a n d l o r d           was       requested          to     close       the    bar.

I ascertained                 t ha t     there          had       been       a fight            inside       these       premises           where

stools          had       been     thrown.              The       fight        was     between          different           supporters

groups.              No    injuries           were          apparent           and     no       complaints           were      received.

A    number         of L i v e r p o o l      supporters              had    to       be   escorted            from      th e    a r e a as

they    were         wanting          to     return       inside        the       public          house        and    perhaps          cause

further         disorder.

Our    Serial          then       returned          to    its     static          point          and    continued           to

m a r s h a l 1 the         supporters.               The      passage           of    f an s     had    now       thinned        but

there       was       still       a number          of L i v e r p o o l         fans       s t il l    making        their       way       to

the    ground.

About       1 5 13     hours       the       street       was     relatively                quiet       a n d we      liaised with

our    commander               Inspector           Townend.

Suddenly            I noticed           a    sudden       surge        in    the P o l i c e           activity          around        the

ground         and     could       hear       constant           radio       traffic             f r o m P S S h e r r a t t 's

ra di o ,      but     at      this     time       I couldn't           quite          make       out w h a t        was

happening.                We     then       proceeded along                 Penistone             Road       to    the     ground

entering            via     the    l a rg e    gates        adjacent-            to    turnstiles              77 a n d     88.        It

was    there          that       I saw       two    ambulances              parked          in the       corner          close        to    the

corner         of     the      B p i o n K.op.        There       were       tw o      persons          being        deposited

beside         these        ambulances,             both       covered           and       appeared          dead.

We    were      then        directed          to    the     pathway          into          the    Spion        Kop    and       it was

there       t ha t      I was      approached             by a n u m b e r            of N o t t s .     Forest          supporters

who    offered            their       services.             At    this       time          I wa s      still       not     quite       sure

exactly what                was    happening             other        than       seeing          the    tw o      dead     persons          and

informed            that       others        were     injured.

With members                of    our       Serial       I then        went       with       t h es e    volunteers              to    the

passageway             between          the    North        stand and             the S p i o n Kop,               and     it was

there       that       I saw       to t a l    chaos,          a number           of       bodies       were       being        carried

up    t h at    passageway              towards          the     gymnasium             area       by a n a s s o r t m e n t          of

supporters             and       emergency          personnel.

At    this P S S h e r r a t t              instructed           us    to    follow          h i m to        the     playing          area

where       I was         confronted           by     the      sight        of    th e      whole       of     the    playing          area

literally             covered         with     th e      bodies        of    the       dead and          injured.               There

were      l a r ge     numbers             of     persons           also        present         on the          pitch          who    w e re

assisting             in a t t e m p t i n g          to    revive           these        persons.              Police           officers

were      fully        involved              in t hi s          and       in m y     v i e w all         of     them       did       t h e ir

duty.        We a s s i s t e d            carrying             a    large        obese      young        Liverpool                 supporter

With PS Sherratt                      we     tried         in v a i n        to     revive        this        man.         The       area

a r o u n d me w a s          totally             carnage,               littered         with      the       bodies           of    dead and

dying.          T h e re w e r e           many       non       in jured          supporters             cluttering                 the    area

and making             it     difficult               for       th e      emergency          services            to       operate.              I

then      returned            to      the       pitch with PS S h erratt                          a n d as       we       passed another

corner       of       the     North          stand         it       rained        human      spit        on     us.        Looking          up       1

saw      hundreds           of     hostile            young          men     shouting           abuse         and        spitting          in our

direction.               I don't             know       how m a ny           bodies        we     carried            past        this

location,             but     1 would             re c a l l        that     th e    spitting            wa s    present             throughout

The      area     beneath             th e      North       stand adjacent                   to     the       gymnasium              soon

became       full        of      bodies           and      injured           persons.             This        area        wa s      still

heavily         congested              with          grieving             relatives          searching               for       their       friends

and      family.            The       whole          situation was                  not     progressing,                  difficulty                was

being      experienced                 in m o v i n g           injured           from     t h is    1o cat ion            to       parked

ambulances             nearby.

Inspector             Barker          look        charge            of    the     situation.              1 was           delegated             on a

cordon       line        across            th e      natural             gateway         into     the a r e a            underneath             the

With      difficulty               the       area       wa s        semi     cleared         of     unnecessary                  persons.

The      sterile         a r e a we          hoped         to       create        wa s    under      constant              pressure             by

persons         approaching                  our      c o rd on ,         the m a j o r i t y       of    them           I sense          were

truly      grieving              and       upset        and         confused,            looking         for     their           friends         and

family.           A    lot       of    them were                not       helped         in th e i r      grief           by     them      being

drunk.          Th e     officers               on    this          line    were         placed      under           a    tremendous

strain       for       a number              of      hours,          having         to    cope w i t h          the       physical          arid

mental        abuse          aimed       at     them      by       these       relatives.

We     understood             their        grief.             We    understood                 their       need         to    know        if    their

loved       ones        or    friends           were      i ns i d e ,        we     understood                their         frustration,

 it d i d n ’t h e l p.              They       expected            t h at     we     would          have       a    list       of    the       dead

and     expected             us    to a l l o w       everyone            of       them        to    freely          wander          past       our

cordon        to    search           for      their       loved          o n es .         We    explained               to    them        the

position           that       to a l l o w         anyone          past       the     c o r d o n at           t h is     time       who       w as

n ot    there       for       the      purpose           of    saving          l i v es        could       prevent            such        lives

be i ng     saved.

This       gained        a mixed           reaction,               some       persons           accepted             our      sound advice,

but     others          physically              fought         to       get    through              the    lines          and      had     to       be

repelled.

Throughout              my    period          on     this      line        constant             comings             and      goings        took

place       involving              the     injured.                Their       exit        wa s      severely             hampered             by     the

selfish attitudes                     of a         number          of    these        Liverpool                supporters.

The     constant             barrage          from       grieving             relatives              continued,               arrangements

were       made     for       them       to     be    transported                  vi a    bus       to H a m m e r t o n R o a d              Police

Station        and       this       seemed           to a s s i s t       the       situation.                 Relatives             were       at

l ea s t   able         to    find       someone         who        could          possibly           assist            them.

However,           it    should          be     noted         that       prior        to       this       an    Inspector             had       set

up a t a b l e          outside          our       line a n d           this       had a s s i s t e d          us      because           we    had

been able           to       direct        all       such enquiries                   to       him.        This         did     defuse          the

s i t u at i on     to a          certai n e x t e n t .

We     remained          in s i t u        at    this         cordon          until        being          relieved            at     1615

hours.         We       then       r e g r o u p e d at C l a y w h e e 1s P o l i c e                    Garage          a n d we        were

transported              back       to D o n c a s t e r       and        then       Mexborough.

My     whole      Serial           1 could           feel     wa s       in a d e e p           state          of    shock,          no    one

spoke      very         much       during        the     journey and                 on        reaching             Mexbo rough Police

S l a t ion    I could             see    everyone            was       sickened               by   the        enormous            tragedy

which      had      befallen             us     t h at   day.

                        If you wanted to fly to Rome, you’d hardly board a plane that only flew

                     as far as Munich, 500 miles short of your destination.

                        Yet travellers to Brisbane seem content with flying to Sydney, leaving

                     themselves with the same distance to cover.

                        Which is foolish enough in itself. And more foolish still, when you consider

                     that Qantas fly direct from Heathrow and Manchester to both destinations.

                        Not to mention Melbourne, Adelaide, Townsville, Perth, Cairns, Darwin and

                     Hobart. In fact, not only do we fly to more Australian cities thanany other

                     airline; we fly the shortest routes there, with fewer     stops along the way.

                        And no matter what the advertisements say, when you’re flying long

                    haul, it’s better to arrive than it is to travel.

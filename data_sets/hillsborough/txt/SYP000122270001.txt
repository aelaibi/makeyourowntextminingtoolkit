However,       when comparing the EIL. with SYPMIMA several                               discrepancies are

f ound.



Section 4 of the MIM dictates                        that the        code word      ’c at as tr o p he ’ snould

be used between emergency services,                           this     clearly was not done by South

Y o r k s h i re Police and             perhaps the unacceptable delay in notifying the

Fire Brigade          in particular,              would have been avoided                if this section of

MIM had beers irnp 1ernent e d »



Section 7 of MIM,              paragraph b,            placed the onus up on the r ores

Operations Room to alert emergency services and other authorities and

departments whose facilities and e x p e r t i s e may be needed.                                   witn this

in mind,       section 19 of MIM,                 paragraph 3,         suggests      thal     three

organisations           be alerted           ’Be con',      ’R e a c t ’ and   ’K a y n e t , ’ to assist        in

     It is true to say that an extended Incident Log of Command and Control

     was    commenced and the Sub Division at Hammsrton Road was

     notified in compliance with MIM..



     Paragraph 9 requires the Major                    Incident Box to be transported to the

4^   scene which was           in fact done as           indicated on page            15 of the EIL at

     1530 hours,        in fact more than one Major                   Incident Box was used that day



     The Se ni o r 0 f f i ce r ca 11 out         che ck list was adhe r ed t o i n as mu ch as

     most of those officers               listed were already              in attendance and the

     remainder were          contacted very soon after the extent of the                             incident

     was known.         Hospital       Liaison and Casualty Party were both set up

     page    1 of the section 10 MIM,                states the first duty is to assume

     overall      control.        This was       cause for discussion at the Hearing,                           but    it

     is quite        clear that who ever was deemed the S i t e Commander did not

     identify himself           by wearing the provided tabbard.                        1 am not         in a

Whilst at the gr o u n d            I did not see alcohol                     being     drunk     inside     the

ground.       At my       posting        there was two             police       officers       one     being a

      lady.       I saw that they were                confiscating           cans    of soft      drinks.

      During my tirne on the                  t u rnstile       1 did not see any ticket              touts        no

      in exchange          for entry.           Or^iThe first          occasion      I was a p p r o a c h e d fay a

      y o u t h of about 20 y ears who                offe r e d me £10.            I did not see the money.

      I did not        note wh.i'ch club he favoured.                      He a p p e a r e d sober.         On the

      second o c c a s i o n a y o u t h of 2 0 years and                    girl    in his      company offered

      me £20.        I/did not see the money.                      I did not note          the    club of his

      favour/        I e x p la i n e d     I could not do           it and he       left.

      I did not a l l o w access               to any     person       in excha n g e    for     cash.

      At about       1520 hours a             p o l i c e w o m a n told me of an       incident, on the            pitch,

        I left my turnstile and went                      to a position betw e e n the S p i o n Hop and

      the S o u t h Stands.           I looked towards               the West S t a n d and saw that                the

      players      had    left     the field.           I saw about          100 or more         people       including

      the Police         on the      pitch      in front         of the West Stand.              I saw several

      people      lying     on the        pitch.      I saw a line           of p o l i c e m e n e x t e n d e d along

      the w i d t h of the         pitch.        R ou g h l y    p o sitioned    by the      half way         line.       In

      addition       I saw a y o u t h we aring             a red and white           scarf.       He was
cat
      s tanding      in the      penalty area at                the S p i o n Kop end.         He was       facing      the

      N o t t i n g h a m Suppo r t e r s      w i t h his arms        raised and fists           clenched above

      his head.          He a p p e a r e d    to be taunting           them,

      T hey were       responding           fay jeering         and booing at       him.       I then saw four

      pol i c e m e n walking       topwa r d s         him. 1 do not know if they caught                        him.      At

      about      15.30 hours        I looked to my t u rnstile and                    locked up my turnstile

      a n d went     to the      receipts         office        u n d e r n e a t h the S o u t h Stand.

      I handed       in my tickets             and     left the stand walk i n g           towards         the L e p p i n g s

      L.n .

      As      I walked    past Gate C of the West S t a n d                   1 saw about 24          people        sat

      w it h their       backs to the           brick wall.           I b e l i e v e d they were        injured.          I

                                                                                                                       S2902

             saw one man          lying     face     down on a blanket.                His   head was      placed to one

             side.        He did not seem            to move      someone was          kneeling at his side.                I

             cannot       describe      this man other           than to say he was              white man        in his

             twenties.          I cannot       remember      or describe who was at his side.                          There

             were a number           of first        aid    people a t t e n d i n g    those    there.       I also       saw a

             fire     engine and        police       officers.          Unfortunatley         I cannot      give a

             creditable         number     of those        services       I saw   present at that            scene.         Ihe

             gate     referred to as C was               open.      The    scene was         reminiscent      of a

             battlefield.

             1 did not stop to help or to gloat.                           I c o n tinued      into L e p p i n g s    Ln home

             in the       di r e c t i o n of M i d d l e w o o d Rd.

             To    clarify an error            on   page 2 of my sta t e m e n t         I w i s h to add       that       the

             o p erator s     of turnstiles!                   share      one   position,       that    is to say we

             are     p h y sically back        to back      in the same         room and not separate                 ai

             previ o u s l y described.

 STATES: I WAS WAITING TO GET IN AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END. I WAS PUSHED UP
 AGAINST THE WALL OF THE SWEET SHOP (VERE RD SIDE). AT ABOUT 1455 HRS IT GOT
 REALLY BAD. FANS WERE BANGING ON THE GATE TO BE LET IN. A STEWARD LOOKED OUT
 OF A WINDOW, SAID A GATE WOULD BE OPENED. WE ALL WENT IN TO THE NORTH STAND
 THROUGH THIS GATE. THERE WERE 40 ODD POLICE THERE. SOME SIGNS FOR THE NORTH
 STAND.

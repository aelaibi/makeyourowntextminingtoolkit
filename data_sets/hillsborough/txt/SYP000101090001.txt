the        ground and               onto          the       playing            field        I made         my way         over       to    the

Leppings                Lane       end.           At    this          t im e    the      players           were      just       leaving          the

fi e l d .          I could             see       several             supporters             were      climbing            over       the       crowd

On arrival                   at    Leppings             Lane          end      saw     that      the       supporters             were      squashed

up a g a i n s t             the f e n c e     and           th at t h e y w e r e        obviously                 being         crushed         by

the            s h e e r n u m b e r of       fans           b e h i n d them .                I assisted other                   officers            in

removing                fans       from       a small              g at e      situated          to    the      righthand             side       of     the

a id.          I took             serial          fans       from        the      g at e     and      into      the       open       space       of     the

playing             field,          all       seemed             to    recover           quickly           o nc e    out    of       the    crush.

It w a s         obvious            that          the       sm a l l     gate        w as    not      releasing            the       pressure           on

be       people          collapsing                due       to       the      pressure         of     the      rest-of           the      crowd.            I

shouted             to    the       people             at    the       ba~ck of          the    crowd         to m o v e        back       but    this

was       met       by a b u s e ,        th e         pushing           did      not       stop although                 there       seemed          to

I could             see       t ha t     there          wa s      one       man      behind        the      fence         who     appeared            to

me       to    be       obviously             dead,          he w a s         yellow        and       he    had      fallen        dow n,        his

roam.           Th e      only way                to    get       to     this        man was          to    rip d o w n         the       perimeter

was       passed          out       through             the       fence        and      with       others           I carried             him    onto

ambulance arrived behind the goal posts and this man's body was placed in

the rear of the vehicle and left with one of the vehicle's crew.                           I could

see   that   several       other      fans still needed pulling out of the crowd,                 in

company with Police Constable Burrows and other officers, I assisted with

the rescue of fans.

In    company     with    DC    Burrows     and PC   1513 Reeves    and    some    supporters,     I

carried one of the dead bodies from the playing area into the gym.                              The

body was carried on an advertising board which had been ripped from the

ground.      PC Reeves stayed with the body once it was placed in the gym.

I returned        to the       playing     field,   there were many distressed and angry

supporters.        In company with PC Burrows and other officers I was ordered

to form a cordon across               the centre line of the field.               Remained     there

until    later     told    to    supervise     Notts.    Forest   fans    leaving    the   ground.

After the fans had left the ground I returned to the North stand and re­

grouped with my serial and Inspector Bateman.

I then went to Claywheels Lane and with other members of my serial we

travelled to Barnsley Hospital for reception of 28 bodies.                          On arrival at

the hospital informed that these bodies had been re-directed to another

location     so    I   re'turned      to    Claywheels   Lane,    from    there   transport      was

arranged to convey me and other officers back to Rawmarsh.

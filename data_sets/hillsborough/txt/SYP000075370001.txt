          I am a single man and I reside alone at the above address.

          I am a supporter of Li ve r pool/rootbal 1                           Club and have iri the past 12

          months become a season ticket holder.                                I visit the majority ofhome

          and away games when it is possible due to my work.

          On Saturday 15th A p r il 1989,                 I was at that time still            in residence at

          a flat in Liverpool and was                   in the process of changing my address to

          live in Wolverhampton,               however I had a chance to go to Hi 11sborough to

          watch the Semi Final Cup Match between Liverpool and Notts Forest.

          Being a season ticket holder I had obtained my ticket from the club in

          Anfield.

          At about     10.QQ am on Saturday 15th April                         I left my home address and

              our other friend Paul Bratiy. /At              house   I stopped for a cup of

             //tea before moving on to pick Paul up who resides at|

                  , Crosby, Liverpool.     Then the three of us drove on to Sheffield
      (/
              on the motorway,   we were delayed in arriving         in Sheffield due to

              traffic   congestion on the Motorway and through Manc hes ter .           Upon

              reaching Sheffield we stopped at a public house           called thei / r o g a n d
  I iU m *    Parrott which we had arranged together earlier to h a W ^ ^ d r i n k .

              At the Public house,           nad I believe     1 pint, Paul maybe 2 and

              myself had a pint of Shandy.         Whilst in the
                                                             pub we met up with I think
                                                                  irk
              4 other lads,   one of which was Pauls brother           the others I

              d o n ’t know except for one Joe McCartfty^jfiha was at the time from

J l           Sheffield University, but his parents live in London anyway I gave him

              a lift to the match.

              We left the public house at about 2.15 pm to go on the Football ground

              and arrived at the ground at ab<yj^^2.3Q pm.           I parked the car in some

              back street as close as I could to the ground and together with P a u l ,

                    , and Joe we walked the short distance of approximately half a

              mile to the Leppings Lane end of the gr o u n d .       Whilst walking to the

              ground we stopped at a local Newsagents and purchased a pie each

              except for Joe because    I'm not sure whether he had anything or not.

              On arrival at the ground whilst wa 1king ^rTong Leppings Lane,             there

              d i d n ’t appear to be too many peopled/but as we arrived at the ground

              and you could see down to the tui^nstiles that there was a mass of

              people outside the turnstiles ydfnd no queue was apparent.             I remember

              that as I turned the cornaryto walk down towards the turnstiles                  I had

              to walk around an officer who was on horseback near to the entrance

              gates to the ground itself.          I wasn't unduly concerned by what I saw

              and there appeared to be nothing out of the ordinary.              This   point is

              very vague to me as I remember         pushing through the crowd, well       not

              pushing but making my way towards the turnstile,           but 1 cannot remember
                                                                         PAGE     3

going through the turnstile or even showing my ticket to the man on

the turnstile,    in fact my ticket was still     in my possession after      I

had got in intact and I don't know how.        I can say that the crowd must

have been moving fast as to get from the queue outside to inside the

ground through those    people    in ten minutes took some doing.

The rie;<t thing 1 remember was exiting the tunne 1 onto the terraces to

the    right hand side to go to the place where     I wanted to go.      I can

say that even though I was in a crowd could control where           I wanted to

go at this stage even though it was fairly crowded.          I   managed to

walk    onto the terraces and stand in the     spot where   Iwanted to which

was directly behind the    right hand goal     post and about a third of the

way down the terraces.     I remember that     at this time _______was with me

and to my right hand side,       but I jfion't remember seeing Paul and Joe

infact the last I remember of Lnem is thajtrs I was aware that they were

behind us as we exited the tu/ne 1.The/next thing I remember was seeing

a few people going out through tX\jrgate in the fence at the front of

the terraces onto the pitch, tw which I thought to myself something

must be happening.     I don't remember seeing any players on the pitch

or anything out there as I was too pre-occupied with what was going on

as to why people were going through the gate onto the pitch.

The    rest is totally vague as I remember being       in the open on the pitch

and getting fresh air.     1 don't    remember being    in any crush or being

in an uncomfortable    situation in the terraces.       The next thing    I

            Further to my previous statement dated the 10th of May 1989 (100589).

            On Tuesday the 12th of September            1989 (120989)    I was seen at rny home

            address by Inspector LAYTON and F'C BROWN of the West Midlands Police.

            I was shown photographs and video footage taken at Hillsborough

            Football Ground on Satittjday tj*'e 15th of April           1989 (150489).

            On a video      recording   rdifeTsmced MAP/1      between time references

            1456.31.04 and 1456.34.     I identified myself on screen aV
                              •                                            r^ilao
                  |behi nd me and I am fairly sure that I can see Paul BRADY A n

            fro n\Lrf/<nte .

            On photographs      referenced FjRVl/16 I can see myself        in th^ bq/tTtom left

            of the photograph which would be to the left of gate 3 as you look

            from the pitch.

            I was also shown a photograph referenced PR1/9A and I am quite happy
         that the person identified by a yellow spot with the number 84 in it

         is not Paul   (BRADY).

         While   I am quite sure that the person I identified on video it has

         been some time since the incident.      _____________

and     others      on       noti cefaoards           which       ha d    been          converted.

Initially          the       scene       was    one    of     great       confusion with                      people        bringing

in    bodies       wh o      were      obviously           dead     and wanting                 to     l e ave       them and            get

ba ck    as    quickly          as     possible        to     help       those          who     were      still           in the         crowd

and     i n j ure d.

It was        quickly         realised          that       it w o u l d       be    necessary             to     prove

continuity          in       relation          to    the    foodies a n d           to       t h is    en d    I went           to     each

group      wh o    brought           in a      body and          instructed                  t h a t at l e a s t         one    officer

must     remain with               the    body.        It    struck           me    as       odd      at the     time           that

there      were     not       a great          number       of    relatives              or     friends          with       the        bodies

th a t w ere       b e i n g b r o ug ht        in.

The     relatives            that     were      with       the    bodies           were       obviously              deeply

distressed          and       wherever          possible          were        given          every assistance                    by     the

police        officers          present.             They    were        initially              allowed          to       remain with

the     deceased.             I do       however       r ec a l l    two       instances              where          people          became

so    upset       that     they were            shouting          and     becoming              a danger             to    the       people

there.         There       was       no a l t e r n a t i v e     but     to       forcibly            remove         them       from        the

area     until      they        calmed         down.        In b o t h        ca ses         the      people         calmed          down

apologised          for       their       understandable                 reactions              and     thanked            us    for

u n d e r s t a nd i n g .

As    1 was       going       to     each      body    t hat      arrived           I        soon became             aware           t h a t at

the     rate      the     bodies         were       arriving        it w o u l d             s o o n be i m p o s s i b l e       to

accommodate             any     more..         I expressed, m y               fears          to D e t . S u p e r inte ride nt

!ie.Kay a n d we          decided         that       the    faodies       s h o u 1 d be a r r a n g e d              in    rows        of     12

There      were     a number             of    doctors       who     seemed             to    arrive          with        the

casualties          and       they were             quickly       establishing                  whether          a    casualty            was

dead     or    otherwise.                There       were    eventually                 I believe             five        doctors,

some     of w h o m       had      attended          the    match        as    spectators               and after               th e    first

check      for     obvious           signs      of    life       they     went          through         all      th e      bodies         in

the m o r t u a r y       and      formally          certified           life       extinct.

As soon as             possible        a supply            of Gen       18 , S u d d e n D e a t h R e p o r t s , was

ob t a i n e d and these were                    handed to the officers                      who were a c c o m p a n y i n g

the    bodies with              i n s t r uctions          that    they       s ho u 1 d be     com pi elect as            fully

as    possible.

At    first       as     bodies       arrived         t h e re    was    naturally           some      considerable

noise     as      people        were       asking       di r e c t i o n s » e x p r e s s i n g      anger       and     other

emotions.              The     scene       was    one      of    confusion        with       police         officers         openly

c r y i n g s some        younger          officers         so    stunned        by    what     they        saw     they     could

not    even       e xpr e s s      their     emotion,             D e t . S u p e r intertdent             McKay      quickly

took     command          of    the    situation            and    directed           members         of    the     CID,     many

d res s e d    in      casuaI       clot hing         to    cat ry      out    tasks        wh i ch    q u i c k 1y     brought

sort'ie f o r m     of    or'der      to    the    s i tuat io n .

At a very early stage                       it was         realised       that        the    scene         inside       the gym,

in particular                the a rea where               the dead were              being     dealt with,               was   one

that     only       those who m            it was       necessary         to expose            to should            see    it and

a control           was      put on the           door.          With    the    ex c e p t i o n      of the        relatively

few    relatives             who    ini t i a l l y     came      in the       only other             persons         allowed       in

that area were m e m b e r s                 of the         emergency          services,           many      of the        police

officers as              1 have       d e s c r i b e d were       c a s u a l l y dressed,            as the y had been

for other           duties         earlier        in the day.,

An o t h e r   operation            that     had to be carried, out                     in r e l ation to               the dead

was    to search             the    bodies and             list and secure              any     property            that may        be

in their' possession.                       This      task was          undertaken           in most         cases        by the

CI D officers.                 It sho u l d       be said that m a n y                officers who were

accompanying              the bodies were                  suffering,          some openly,                some     inwardly and

for this          reason the CID o f f i c e r s were                     used.

The    bodies as             I have        said were            laid    in rows of twelve                   w ith     s ufficient

space and           room a r o u n d        them for the               tasks     to be       carried out with o u t

any    liklihood of                post m o r t e m        injury       being     caused.             In the        first

instance          bodies were              covered w i t h white               paper        tablecloths             an d a

little     later a number              of body bags were             suppl i e d by the a m b u l a n c e

service.        There were a limited                   number     of these and           they were            later-

reused as they            became a v a i l a b l e after          some      bodies were           rem oved         to the

Medic o Legal           Centre.        Where     body     bags    could not         be s u p p l i e d    then

blankets were            used    to    cover the* bodies.

Det.    Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Addis     a r r i v e d at    the    scene     later       that

a f t e r n o o n and    took    command of the            q u e s t i o n of     identification              of the

bodies.        It s h o u l d    be said        that    soon after          the    bodies     had a r r i v e d

there was       obviously            friends     and    parents      a r r i v i n g at the        gym.        They

were    directed         to    the    rear of the N o r t h Stand and                 I understand             from

there    taken by coach to H a m m e r t o n R o a d Police Station.

By what       1 w o u l d estimate           to be a r o u n d    tea time         of that        day all          the

bodies     had been s e a r c h e d etc.           and we were             left wit h the          task       of

identification.                Mr.    Addis    briefed all         the officers             who were          to be

involved       in the task,            in the m ain        still     the CID officers.                   He    briefed

them fully and            clearly expla i n i n g          that    the      process w h i c h       had       been

agreed, between himself and Mr.                        P o p p e r , the Coroner,           was    that       Polaroid

photographs w o u l d           be    taken of the hea d and shoulders                       of the

deceased.        These        would     be d i s p l a y e d   on screens          in a p a s s a g e w a y w h i c h

ran alo n g s i d e      the gym corning out              in the gym at            the other        end of the

building.         S c r e e n s were     sent     for and a viewing are a was                      constructed

w h i c h allo w e d     relatives       the     privacy       r e q uired for        the    identification

and kept       f rom them the           scene     i n the rno r t u a r y .

Once    the    i d e n t i f i c a t i o n had been       carr i e d out         then the     officer

accompanying            the    body,    together w i t h a CID officer                   from other

d i vis ions and s u p p o r t i v e w o r k e r s       suc h as       social w o r k e r s       and

churchmen,        took        down what       details wer e        required.

The    gym became         sectioned          into three.          One      end holding        the    dead,          the

middle     s e c t i o n holding        the officers who             had brought            in the       bodies and

the other end h o l d i n g            the    relatives        after       the    i d entificati on.

            I    have       twenty        one years             service       in       the    police          force a n d           have        had    to

            the     problems             that we as an o r g a n i s a t i o n were                        p r esented             with.        We     had

            people          dead     with       f riends and            relatives             a l r e a d y there             wanting           to know

            what      had happened, and                    if their w orst               fears          had been          realised.                  In the

            months          that     have       passed          since    that          date     I have           thought           on man y

            occasions            of what was               done and how                it was       done.           In    the       cold        light       of

            day and           with       the    advantage             of hindsight,               I can think                 of    perhaps           one

            or two          things        that       could have been                   i m p roved       in r e l a t i o n         to the

            handling and disposal                          of    relatives             and the          deceased.              These        would

            only have            assisted            in    the     administration                 side        of    the       i ncident and                I

            can say           that       I was       there       in    that    gymnasium                possibly           longer         than

            anyone          else.         I    saw    no   thing w h i c h         1    could       descrioe             as    irreverence,

            co1dheartednes                s    or    disrespectful             an d      had      this        been       the       case     I       would

            have      taken         steps       to    ensure          that    this       was      corrected.

emotions       and deep sorrow.                       I briefly                related myself           to this

situation,         being a father                 of       E       young       daughters,       an d    I fully

appreciated           and a c c e p t e d t h e            Officers             reaction.          I remember           seeing

him    still     very tearful              and d i s t r e s s e d             a few hours          later      a nd     in

to both       leave      the       confines           of       the    g y m n a s i u m and     go home,         he

d e c lined    to do so an d              remained w i t h                 the young         pitiful         victim..

W i t h i n a short         space     of time,                 more an d more             bodies       were    received

m eans and       persons.            for     a    time,             the    s i t u a t i o n was    na t u r a l l y

confusing and            in    slight        d i s array             because,          again    not     only     were

supporters accompanying                      injured and                   deceased,         who    had never           ever

witnessed        or    experienced               such          a    distressing           and   distraught             scene..

of the g y m n a s i u m       proper where           they     received       immediate medical

early hours         of Sunday,           16th April,          1989,       I assisted,        in     receiving             the

bodies      of those          victims     of the disaster.                 These      bodies       were    laid           in

rows    of twelve         f rom the       back     to the        front     of the g y m n a s i u m a n d         I

recall      some    of them         being    covered by white               paper      clothes.

S u b s equently,       body      bags were made a v a i l a b l e            by the S o u t h Yor k s h i r e

in manpower,           being      commanded        by lir. Hopkins.

If    possible,        the body         i d entified and           the    p r o perty f r out it         itemised

remained wit h          the body.

and knowing that: the injured had been taken t& the area by the St.
John's Station outside the gym, I went round lo give help In that
area,* I then became involved with moving pec&le (substantially the
injured people) fro* the area.outside the gyniinto the gym itself.
The area outside the gyro w** $£fifee chaotic. $he entrance to the gym
was a normal household door sice entrance. JOirectly outside the.door
was the St* John’* Ambulance room. ' The spaoftiwas becoming jammed
full of peoplewith comparatively minor injuries, and also rapidly
filling with people presumed dead. I. assisted the police to make a
g&thttey to the dooirliaWt s t a r t e d ' " t b w v e * ^ * ^      the
prospective dead and the seriously injured,» I personallydid hot
have any dealings with the prospective dead. Other people were
taking those into the gym, but I was looking After the injured;
largely the ones that were conscious. The Police were very much in
charge of the area inside the gymnasium* At fcne point I had
difficulty persuading an officer on the door to let me through. He
did allow me in. -When I got irt I saw the way the gym had been
divided. . It was very apparent where you should go. They had used a
sports net to divide the gym into two halfe. .1 realised later, one
half was for the living and one half for the prospective dead. I
became quickly involved with the half that were injured. The door to
the gym was at one end. The first half of the gym as you went in,
was being used for the prospective dead so that going through to the
injured area, one had to go through, what turned out to be the
temporary mortuary. It was a clear passageway through. I went
through to work with the injured* There weraisit im tm t three doctors
                        t h Z * e ‘ ^ We Y*re ali c<*#*rned over the U c k of
any form of equipment and medication. One of the doctors said: “For

with was m a great deal of pain. I left that part of the ovc to co

                                        BEREAVEMENT MESSAGES


                present South Yorkshire Police training   irnput regarding the above        is
         as follows:-

            All new recruits on the Modular Training Prograzmne receive initial
            training on the aspect of bereavement messages during Module 2 Training
            at District Training School.

            This includes a role play scenario where probationers assume both
            sides of a death warning.  Also the emotional implications of fatal
            road traffic accidents, suicides and missing from home deaths are
            included.

            During Module 4 Training the subject is re-addressed to take account
            of   problems  accounted   during  actual  warnings   undertaken  by
            probationers*

            In the Post Foundation In-Force Training of probationers the subject
            of death warnings is again addressed by class discussions.

            On    Monday        17    April     1989    following       the       Hillsborough         Disaster       I    was       so


            engaged        on    C o r o n e r ’s   Officer     duties       at    the    Medico      Legal   Centre.


            Subsequent           to    that     date    I    dealt    with    a    form    Gen   18    Sudden    Death

            Report        in respect of Gordon Rodney Horn.                              My only dealings with it

            was as follows.

              I recall obtaining the form from the filing system as a result of

              receiving a telephone call from someone representing Humphries
                                                                                                        PAGE

                     Funeral Director*, St anley Road, Bootle.                I «»• i nformed by this

                     person that they were to look after the funeral a rr an ge me nts

                     regarding Mr Horn and that it wat to be a cremation.                   I entered these

                     details on the Gen 18 together with the details of a relative

                     furnished to me by the funeral directors.                 These details are

                                  Sister,                        Liverpool.

                     When I entered these details the only entries on the f orm had been

                     written by PC O ’Shea,              these relating to the names G o rd o n Horn,

                                             a n d Douglas Hardaker who had identified the body to PC

                     O ’Shea.

                     After      completing the entries            I made on the form I returned it to the

                     files.           At   no time did    I speak to any relatives   of this or any other

                     of the deceased resultant                 from the Hillsborough Disaster.

                     I did not tell the representative from Humphries that an y relatives

                     should attend at the Medico Legal Centre although                  I wo u ld have asked

                     him to tell them to contact us.

          7   .                Details        of the family doctor.

          3   .                Details,       ie name and address of the deceased's mother.

          All        these details were endorsed on the form Gen 18 after the deceased                                                      s

          mother,          a        I         h           a          d         attended at Watery Street to

          view the body.

          Until         that time no formal                   identification had taken place,                      this simply

          having been done at the temporary mortuary at Hillsborough by a

          friend, a Mr. Douglas Hardakre.

          When                           had viewed the body and made a formal                                 identification

          I entered the details as provided by her,                                        on the Gen 18.

          At no time prior to                                            jattendance did I ask her to attend,

          it      was      simply    a    cas.e     that      she     had    attended       to   view                    body         and

          because           the    Report      of    Death       was     incomplete         at   that   time,     the

          o p p o r t u n i ty     was    taken      to       complete       the    form    to   the    requirements        of        tne


          Coroner.

          Her       attendance           at   the    Medico          Legal    Centre       was   purely       voluntary,        a-a


          was       the     attendance         of    all       the    other      friends     and   relatives       of    the

I have received a message from Belinda Norcliffe (0274              as follows.


      She asks if she can have three copies of just the mortuary scenes taken
      (approx. 10/15 minutes duration) and sent up to her office not later
      than lunch-time 15.6.90.                                                f\~}

      I have spoken with Sgt          (AVA) and instructed him to prepare the
      copies.   I will arrange for a motor cyclist to take them to Bradford
      a.m. tomorrow (Friday) morning.


2. Belinda wants to inform you       that   technically   the mortuary   scenes   are
   a 'discoverable document1.

      With any discoverable document strictly speaking you are not allowed
      to put any terms on what is done with it. (Just to give you an example,
      once disclosed as a discoverable document it could subsequently be
      released to a newspaper).    Also if you have such a document to be
      disclosed it should be disclosed at the start and not half way through
      proceedings.

      Notwithstanding the above,    Counsel want to disclose the mortuary video
      because it is relative to quantum which will come in due course. However,
      they will (subject to our approval) disclose on the basis that the
      plaintiffs solicitors do not disclose to the plaintiffs or anyone else.
      Counsel feel this will be accepted by the plaintiffs solicitors on
      humanitarian grounds (ie,     not wishing to put the plaintiffs through
      watching the video scenes) and that our 'terms' would be adhered to.

      For information - if and when the Judge sees the video, and this will
      not automatically happen but only when asked, he will view it in private.

      Some time ago Belinda 'floated' the above with Norman Bettison but would
      now appreciate your views on the above.    (Norman Bettison is currently
      on leave)

      I informed her you will probably not be free to speak with her until
      after your 3.30 pm appointment (Dr Thornton).    She agreed to this saying
      after 4.30 pm might be an     even better time for you to telephone her as
      she will probably have another matter ready by that time which she also
      needs to discuss with you please. On your behalf I agreed to this.


      J.
      14.6.90



At 5.30 pm I (DCC) spoke with Belinda Norcliffe who reiterated the above
and we agreed that the videos be made available to the Court as 'discoverable
documents'.

She then referred to the mortuary photographs,        ie,   those used as part of
the identification process.

She has received information via the Liverpool Steering Committee lawyers
that they now want these on the same basis.

The Coroner has the originals and will release them.      The arrangement is
that West Midlands Police, who have enlarged glossy prints of these same                              )
photographs, will copy the Coroner's originals and through Hammond Suddards                       ^
these will be made available to the plaintiffs lawyers and to the Court
on request in the same form they were seen by the plaintiffs.

Whilst not enforceable, when making the videos and photographs available
we will ask that no copies be made and for them to be returned to the police
after the hearings ort the grounds this is sensitive information which could
be misused by third parties and cause unnecessary distress.
                                                                                              n
Re. evidential "bundles" - pleadings, statements, medical reports, legal
authorities, generic medical report - now submitted to the Court;     a copy
will be sent to me on 15.6.90 so that if from 19.6.90 onwards we need to
make decisions with the lawyers regarding possible admissions etc., we will                   - c y -£
each (them in Liverpool and ourselves in Sheffield) be considering the same                               „
documentation.                                                J     C                                         ^

The BBC and IBA media guidelines appear to have been breached and further
consideration is being given to enjoining them in the Contribution
proceedings.

The insurers and Counsel have agreed the plaintiffs proofs will be submitted
without the need for direct evidence.     This will spare the witnesses re­
living the incident - more importantly we cannot refute their allegations
such as "I saw the whole thing on television", "I became extremely distressed
at this" etc.

If the media are enjoined       in the Contribution hearing we          can    call these
witnesses.

Counsel wanted to admit liability in accordance with the McLoughlin -v-
O'Brien Lords decision doctrine - in short parent or spouse viewing bodies
in the immediate aftermath of an incident (in the case it was a road
accident) can be assumed to have suffered psychological damage.

After discussion with Hammond Suddards senior partners and consultation
with the insurers, this is not agreed as subsequent cases have sought to
distinguish with some success from McLoughlin.  This may become an issue
next week.

The nervous shock cases are to determine liability only not quantum at this
stage.

Immediately   after   the   nervous   shock   cases   post-death   suffering   cases   will
be heard -

Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH

With reference to my letter of 19 June 1990, please find enclosed herewith, as
promised, a summary and supporting statements relative to the identification of
Gordon Rodney Horn.

Yours faithfully
               /




Chief Superintendent
                   SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE


                                             REF:
FROM: Detective Inspector Cleverley
                                             DEPT: Hillsborough Incident Rn
TO: Chief Superintendent Main
                                             DATE: 19 June 1990


            SUBJECT:      INTERIM REPORT 2:
                          RESULT OF ENQUIRIES
                          REQUESTED BY HAMMOND SUDDARD

Further to ay repor^ nf    18 June 1990- with particular reference to Task
9 (g): "Shock Claim"                   re death of Gordon Rodney HORN:

Enquiries have been finalised       into   this matter,      and   the   evidence
revealed is as follows:

Gordon Rodney HORN, b 26.3.69, of                               Liverpool,
died on the Hillsborough terrace, o n 15 A p r i l 1 9 8 9 . HTs body was
examined at the temporary mortuary at 1602 hrs on that day and certified
dead by Dr Byrne.     The Police Officer concerned was PC 339 O'SHEA,
whose Coroner's Court statement (copy) is attached (Document 1).

The body was identified at 0010        hrs on   16   April     1989 by    Douglas
Hardaker, a friend of the deceased.
PC O'Shea partly completed a "GEN 18, Report of Death" form (Document 2
attached), with the brief details, "Gordon Horn", "Stanley Horn"
(father) and details of the friend Hardaker.
Detective Inspector TIMMS (Statement attached document 3), was the
officer in charge of the body reception team at the Medico Legal Centre,
Watery Street, Sheffield.    The identification of Horn by Hardaker was
sufficient for the Coroner's purposes, and it was not necessary for any
further identification to be made by anyone.

Police Constable 928 PARKIN (Statement attached document 4) was also
attached to the Medico Legal Centre, but as an assistant Coroner's
Officer.   He received a telephone call on Monday 17 April 1989 from a
firm of undertakers notifying the coroner that they had been asked by
the family to deal with funeral arrangements.     PC Parkin wrote their
details on the form "GEN 18" and also wrote the name, address and
telephone number of the undertakers' family contact,
          The undertakers were given no instructions that family must
attend the MLC, but the officer believes he would have asked for the
family to contact the Police.    It appears that this officer also made
out a supplementary form (copy attached, document 5).

Detective Constable Christine WALLACE (Statement attached document 6 )
was one of DI Timm's team of officers and attended many of the relatives
who went to the MLC to identify or view the bodies of the deceased.


GEN2                                                                      Page 1
This officer saw the deceased's Bother,               it MLC on 17 April
1989 when she went there to view the body of                    DC Wallace
obtained further personal details f r o * _______ wnicn  sne  wrote  on the
"GEN 18” form.   She decided to treat              viewing of  the  body as
a formal identification, and endorsed the for* to that effect.

Although the officer did not enter any details of                     m the
"GEN 18" it would appear that she had accompanied
to the MLC, because a _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ id sign the other form attached to the
"GEN 18" (Document 5).

The facts therefore seem to be that                       was playing a
supporting role to                       T n t n e arrangements made with
the undertaker, and attending with her at MLC, but at no time was she
required to attend, and certainly she was not required to identify

I request that this report and the attached documents be forwarded to
Hammond Suddard solicitors for their attention, and that a copy of this
report be supplied to DCC Mr Hayes for his information.

Copies of the statements of PCs Parkin and Wallace were faxed to Hammond
Suddards today, those of the other officers having already been
forwarded seperately.

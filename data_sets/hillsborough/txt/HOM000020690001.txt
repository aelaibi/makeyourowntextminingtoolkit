Dear Sir

ENGINEERING APPRAISAL OF SPORTS GROUNDS
THURSDAY 26 OCTOBER: GROSVENOR HOTEL, LONDON


Mr Whalley has asked me to thank you for your letter of 29
September 1989 extending a formal invitation to him to attend the
above one-day seminar as a guest of the Institution. He would
like to accept the invitation.

Mr Whalley would be grateful if you could send him details of
timings for the seminar as he is due to go to Scotland that
evening.

                                          Yours faithfully

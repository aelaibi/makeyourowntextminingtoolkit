    Dear Mr. Cleverley

    Re:      HILLSBOROUGH

    Further to our telephone conversation on the 28th August,
    I am enclosing our only copies of South Yorkshire Police
    documents 1 and 10 and South Yorkshire Police Composite
    Albums 1 and 2.

    The first two mentioned albums were part of the
    background material submitted to ttie Public Inquiry, the
    latter two were produced during the Inquiry.        These
    albums of photographs along with the West Midlands
    Composite Albums were the main photographs used during
    the Inquiry and they are to be similarly used for the
    Contribution Trial in October.   As such, we require four
    further copies of the albums I am enclosing and as you
    know it is possible that P.C. Greenway has already
    managed to track down most of them. If the West Midlands
    Police have indeed the negatives of these photographs, it
    will be necessary for the albums to be done as prints
    from prints, as we have already been advised by West
    Midlands Police that they are not prepared to provide us
    with copies of anything at the present time.

                                                                       Continued

     Continuation....

     With regards to the West Midlands Composite Albums 1 and
     2, these will also require copying and as soon as I
     receive the albums from Counsel, I will forward them to
     you so four copies can be produced.
     Yours sincerely

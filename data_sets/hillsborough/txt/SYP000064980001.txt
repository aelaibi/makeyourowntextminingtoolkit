no        intention of e n t e r i ’t y j the ground until                     as    late as      possible.          M an y

were           drinking alcohyi           from both              cans and      large bottles,           however,        due

to the number o f ^ieople                      doing       this and the thin               spread       of Police

Officers             it was      impossible          to do a ny th in g about it.               I was       c on tinually

the           turnstiles.        We   then went           down Vere            dT to the Police Room.

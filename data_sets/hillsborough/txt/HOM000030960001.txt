                    EVIDENCE-IN-CHIEF OF NOEL BURNE
    SELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




                                                                Friday,     5th October 1 9 9 0 .

                                                NOEL BURNE, sworn
                                               Examined by Mr. Payne

           Q.     Mr. Burne, are you Mr. Noel Burne?                   A.   I am, my Lord.

           Q.      Can you give us your address, please?    A.   I practise
                   from 4 Highfield Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham.

           Q.     Mr. Burne, do you produce the report which you prepared for
                  this trial, which consists of the body of the report and
                  two bundles of exhibits flagged A to S?    A.  Correct, my
                  Lord.

           Q.      And in addition to that, I think as a separate bound
                   volume, you have put in a document published by the
                   Institution of Structural Engineers called "Appraisal of
                   Existing Structures"?    A.  In substitute of my own
                   previous Appendix N, in volume 2B.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 That is not a document I have, Mr. Burne.

           MR. PAYNE:   May we give your Lordship one now, please?
D              (handed)   (To the witness)    I will ask you to refer to
               that in your evidence when it becomes appropriate.   First
               of all---

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   This is a new Appendix A?    A.  That is
               correct, my Lord.   It is the total document rather than
               extracts from it.

E           MR. PAYNE:  At Appendix S in bundle 2 of the exhibits, having
                set out your qualifications and experience - can you turn
                first, please, to that?    A.  I t ’s the last page in the
                report, my Lord.

            Q.     And you set out your qualifications, which perhaps it is
                   not necessary for me to ask you to go through it orally.
                   After you have set out your list of formal qualifications,
F                 do you describe your    experience after service with the
                   Royal Air Force in explosive demolition and crash recovery;
                   you have extensive experience in design construction and
                   repair of a wide variety of structures, foundations and
                   plant in various parts of the world; and in November 1973
                   you established the firm of Elrond Engineering, a privately
                   owned building and engineering consultancy specialising in
r                 expert witness and arbitration work in litigation;
                   chartered engineers and technicians employed directly or as
                   consultants with particular expertise, covering a
                   considerable range of disciplines which you set out, and
                   you have been employed in more than 1,500 cases and you set
                   out the nature of the work that you have been involved in?
                   A.  Yes.
    SELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




          MR. JUSTICE JOWITTs  I am not sure I understand the last
              sentence.  Does that say anything more than he has been
              involved in a number of arbitrations in which a decision
              has been made, or he has been an arbitrator making the
              decision?

          THE WITNESS:              Both, my Lord.

          MR. PAYNE:   That you very much, Mr. Burne.  Your report has
               been circulated some time in advance of the trial, and what
               I intend to do to try to identify the material parts of it
               is to ask you to deal with the parts of your report which
               relate particularly to three questions which have been
               suggested by the Judge and adopted by the parties, under
              which various other issues have been collected.    The first
               question I do not think concerns you - about the pressure
               at the Leppings Lane turnstiles build-up - except
               indirectly, but the second question is material for you,
              which is should the tunnel have been closed before Gate C
              was opened, and then under the third question (which brings
               in other factors which contributed to the crushing and the
               injuries) particular topics relate to the barriers, the
              gates in the perimeter fence, the means of escape and the
              certified capacity of the pens and the tunnel gradient.     So
D             I want you, please, if you would, Mr. Burne, by looking at
              your report, to collect together your evidence and then to
              help my Lord about the documents which are before the Court
              under the topic of the performance of the engineer in
              relation to certified capacity, which is a particular issue
              under the third question identified by the Judge and has a
              significant bearing on question 2 identified by the Judge
              about whether the tunnel should have been closed.    If you
E             take your report, please, and go to the passages which
              introduce that subject, first of all at page 1 under
              "Summary", paragraph B, you have in very brief terms - can
              you read out paragraph B, please?

                 A.      "No sub-division of capacity or management of flowss

                           1.     Armed with maxima for each subject area of
                                  system of directing by signs, measuring by
                                  counting or controlling by closing off from
                                  further inward movement, could have prevented
                                  overcrowding."

         Q.      I am going to ask you to amplify that in some detail when I
                 have collected together the other parts.  So now go to page
G               6, paragraph 7, please.

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT;   Before you do, I follow the argument that
             pens 3 and 4 taken together would have benefited from some
             counting and shutting off method, but would there be any
             need then to distinguish between pens 3 and 4 - in other
             words, to separate the counting in respect of each?   I ask
             the question for this reason.   If I think of myself as a
H           football fan, I  can see that pens 3 and 4 will be more
SELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




            attractive to me than the pens out on the wings.    As
            between pens 3 and 4, either is likely to be equally
            attractive to me, save for whether one is more full than
            the other.  It seems to me if I envisage the crowd going
            down the tunnel there is the radial fence dividing pens 3
            and 4 half-way across the mouth of the tunnel, and it
            strikes me that   between pens 3 and 4 I might expect them to
            fill up roughly   equally while it might be said you should
            come into the tunnel and there would no need to have a sub­
            division.  What   do you say about that?    A.  That would be
            absolutely correct, my Lord.   There is no point in
            attempting to sub-divide when the access down the tunnel
            meant that those who went there could go into either pen.

     Q.     So you would say you could treat pens 3 and 4 as one whole
            for the purpose of this monitoring/shutting off exercise?
            A.  In these circumstances, my Lord, for monitoring pens 3
            and four in total and closing off the tunnel on the
            turnstile end, rather than the pen end.

     MR. PAYNEs            Now go on to page 6, paragraph 7?

             A.         "In my view, the overcrowding would not have occurred
                        if appropriate numbers had been ascribed by the
                        Engineer for each separate entity within the terraces
                        identified by physical separation, namely each pen.
                        They should have been self-contained and provided
                        with a counting management system.  If such a system
                        could not be achieved, then overload provisions by
                        means of additional radial fence gates should have
                        been installed at the front of each pen.  Separate
                        pen capacities were essential."

     Q.     Just pausing there, in the penultimate sentence of that
            paragraph you are drawing attention to the relationship
            between the need for a counting management system and the
            related need for adequate means of escape?
            A.  Absolutely.  Without it, there is no safety.

      Q.    Page       11 then, please, paragraph 2.3(c)?

             A.        "In my view, the ordinary reasonable practising
                       consulting engineer ought to have identified specific
                       numbers of persons to be controlled as a maximum for
                       each of the pens and divided areas of the ground and
                       communicating such information, together with its
                       importance, to those responsible for stewarding or
                       control."

      Q.      Why, from the point of view of an engineer, Mr. Burne, is
              it necessary for the Engineer to communicate information
              about specified numbers to those responsible for
              management?    A.  It is pointless to establish numbers of
              capacity without there is a system of control to limit
              those numbers, and without both the limitation of number
    'sellers   aCo. / w. lloyd w o o d l a n d




         and the control is communicated to those who are responsible
         for the control.

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  In other words, action has to be taken
             when the numbers reach a certain level?    A.  It is
             pointless creating the numbers, my Lord, if one does not do
             that.  They are numbers which are adduced to having been
             safe.

         MR. PAYNE:  Collecting together under this topic the other
             paragraphs which deal with it, just go on, please, with
             (d)?

                  A.        "Identify safe means of access and egress,   including
                            signing for those persons".

         MR. PAYNE:               Page 12, my Lord.

         THE WITNESS:    In that context, my Lord,          I regard signing as a
             means of control.

         MR. PAYNE:  What is the next thing which the Engineer ought to
             have done is (e)?

D                 A.      "Should recognise that the licensed capacity ought to
                           be broken down to pen size and the available space
                           between individual barriers for the purposes of
                           comparing means of access and barrier design."

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   I understand what you mean by saying the
             licensed   capacity ought to be broken down to pen size; I am
             not sure   what you mean by the words "and the available
E            space between individual barriers for the purposes of
             comparing means of access and barrier design".    Do you mean
              regard must be had to the available space?
              A.  Absolutely, my Lord.

         MR. PAYNE:   What is the next thing that the Engineer ought to
              do, please, (f)?    A.  "Address the capacity of individual
              pens.

         Q.        And (g)?    A.  "Ensure that there was a system of control
                   to allow effective closing off in a safe way of each of the
                   pens*

          Q.      And (j) and (k)?    A.  "Investigated emergency escape;
                   advised appropriate sizes for the emergency gates
                   constructed in the perimeter fencing."

          Q.      Those seem to be the paragraphs which deal with or bear
                   upon the question of the certified capacity.  Go on,
                   please, will you now, to page 79?  We are here, part-way
                   through Chapter 5, which begins at page 76.  The general
                   heading of which you have given as  Spectator's Progress,
                   Analysis of the Defects", and the defects which bear upon
    ..SELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




                  certified capacity begin at page 79 at 5.8, and so will you
                  begin reading there, please?

                  A.        "No figures for spectator capacity in the individual
                            pens was added to the Safety Certificate either in
                            1981 when the first radial fences were installed or in
                            1985 when the remainder were installed.  Nevertheless
                            E & P (the Engineers) gave an arbitrary capacity of
                            1,200 to pen 3 and 1,000 to pen 4 in respect of plant
                            8945/1A showing the ground layout in 1987.  This needs
                            to be judged against the emergency evacuation
                            capacity"

                  (this is calculated from the Green Guide)

                            "at 937.  That in turn reduces to 717 if pitch gate
                            number 3 is omitted from the calculation.

          MR. PAYNE:  What Mr. Glasgow is saying on behalf of the Club -
              do you have Appendix 1, Mr. Burne?   A.  Yes.

          Q.      At the back of the Taylor Report?   A. It may be helpful
                  to look at 208 as well, the previous plans, which in fact
                  show that centre wall.
B
          Q.     The question that I was asking was this:   Before the
                  introduction of the radial fences, if you take Appendix 4
                 in the Taylor Report, you see the 1981 two radial fences
                  that you were dealing with?   A. Yes.

          Q.     Before those were put in 1981, if someone had come through
                  the bank of turnstiles at the back of the west stand and
C                got on to the concourse and then had made their way round
                  the back of the west stand or down the tunnel on to the
                  terrace, where could they then have dispersed themselves,
                  do you say?   A. Wherever they wished, if the radial gates
                  were open.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   The effect of putting up the two grey
              barriers, if the radial gates are shut, is that access to
D             what later became pens 3, 4 and 5 is through the tunnel
              only, via what later become turnstiles A - G, and access to
              what later become pens 2 and 3 is round the side, again via
              turnstiles A - G;   and access to what later become pens 6
              and 7 is via turnstiles 7 to 16.   Have I understood
              correctly?

          MR. PAYNE:             7 to 18 at that time, my Lord.
E
           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: 7 to 18, I am sorry.                    I misread that.
               That is the position, is it?

           MR. PAYNE:  That is what we understand the position to be, my
               Lord, yes.

P          THE WITNESS:              And to the north west terrace,     my Lord,   7 to   18.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Yes, that is 'why I said "what later become
               pens 6 and 7", 7 being the north west terrace, is it not?
           A.  There is also the north west terrace as well, my Lord.   I
               think it is all one huge area.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                   Have I misunderstood this ---
G
           MR. PAYNE:             If your Lordship looks at Appendix ---

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   Is that what you mean by the north west
               terrace?   (Indicating document). A. That is the lower part
               of the north west terrace, my Lord, pen 7.   In addition, if
               you move up to that part there, my Lord, that is the north
               west terrace, the 2,900 figure about which there has been
H              discussion.
    SELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




         MR. GLASGOW:  If it helps your Lordship, it is referred to in
             the documents as the upper north west terrace, in the
             Licensing Notice.

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                   The upper north west terrace is the 2,900?

         MR. GLASGOW:               2,900, my Lord.

         MR. PAYNE:             The white area.

         THE WITNESS:  The 7,200, my Lord, is in respect of the areas 1,
             2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

         MR. PAYNE:  Now, having looked at the effect of the 1981
             alterations against the background of what had been drawn,
             can you give your comments, Mr. Burne, about the
             performance of the Engineer?  In the mind of Dr. Eastwood,
             should the introduction of the radial fences in 1981 on the
             west terrace have any effect on the capacities which you
             have seen recorded in the Safety Certificate?    A.  I
             believe that the cul-de-sac created by the two green
             barriers added in 1981, to which access could be obtained
             primarily by the tunnel, ought to have had a safe capacity
             addressed to it at that date.
D
         Q.      Bearing in mind that the Certificate is issued by the
                 Licensing Authority, what was the duty o f the Engineer in
                 the circumstances which had arisen?   A.   In identifying
                 the installation of those radial fences and the creation of
                 the sub-division, I believe the Engineer ought to have
                 identified the safe capacities of the sub-divided areas ---

^         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   When you say "identified", do you mean
              calculated them?    A. Calculated them, yes;   and reported
               them in his annual report.

          Q.    In other words,   there should have been three or four pens.
                 The upper north west terrace is left untouched, so our
                 7,200 should have been split into three figures?   A.
P               Correct, my Lord.

          MR.     PAYNE: From the point of view of an engineer, Mr. Burne,
                  can you help my Lord as to the reason for applying a
                  particular number to a particular enclosed area on a
                  terrace such as this.   When I say "applying", I mean
                  working out, calculating a particular number.    Does it have
                  any safety implications?    A.  Primarily to establish that
q                 each of the people who were allowed in there had a
                  reasonable area to be able to occupy;    but, in addition to
                  t h a t ---

          MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:   Wait a moment;  yes.  A. In addition,            to
                  be able to get those people out with safety.

           MR. PAYNE:  Assuming that he had done what you say he ought to
H             have done and worked out the safe number for each of the


                                                        15.
        ELLERS & CO. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




                   new areas, from the point of view of an engineer, is there
                   a foreseeable consequence if those numbers should now
                   become exceeded?   A.  There is an inevitable consequence
                   of risk of not being able to get people out if the
                   appropriate means of escape is not provided, and there then
                   i s ---

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  Just a moment.  When you say "appropriate
                means" do you mean appropriate to the numbers admitted into
B
                that area?   A.  A safe route for each and every person who
                is admitted, my Lord, yes.

            Q.      Does it have to have regard to the number of people there?
            A.      Yes.

            Q.      In other words, what may be safe for 200 may be unsafe for
                    600?   A.  Absolutely, my Lord.  It will perhaps be safe
                    for 201.

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                   Yes.

             MR. PAYNE:   Having calculated the capacity of each of these new
                 pens, would the Engineer, Mr. Burne, have any duty to
                 consider how those numbers were going to be controlled?
D            A. Yes.    There is no point in producing capacity figures which
                 you have calculated for safety if the numbers are going to
                 be ignored.

             Q.      What means of control would an engineer specify if he was
                     performing his function correctly?   A.  The ideal would be
                     a control at the perimeter of the premises in the form of a
                     turnstile.
E
             Q.      Giving access to what?   A.  Restricted entirely to the
                     area to which those people who pass the turnstile can only
                     gain access.

              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  In other words, feeding one area only?
              A.  A set number of turnstiles feeding one area only, my Lord.

    ^         Q.     When you say "perimeter of the premises", I am not quite
                     sure what you mean by that phrase?   A. Where the
                     spectators are admitted to the ground at the outside of the
                     line of turnstiles.

              Q.     In other words, the turnstiles situated in the places that
                     we have seen at page 242 but each group of turnstiles
    G                feeding one area only?   A.  Discrete turnstiles for
                     discrete areas.

              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 Yes.

               MR. PAYNE:   Should the Engineer consider any other means of
                    control of the capacity in the individual pens?  A. If
                    there were not to be turnstiles, then some other system of
    H              management counting is essential, in my opinion.

        Q.      And how could such counting in practice be done?  A. By
                firstly directly flows of people by signs, and specific
                counting at the entrances to the discrete areas.

                     and the necessary corollary of a physical control mechanism when those
                     discrete areas are counted to be full.
             MR. JUSTICE 30WITT: Physical closing off in other words?                              A. Yes, my Lord.

             MR. PAYNE: Where would the Engineer's part come in in identifying the need
                 for one or other of those systems?      A.    At the very beginning when he
                  issues his annual letter relating to safety.
             Q.      In fact my Lord knows that neither of those systems was introduced or
                    recommended and in fact the system which was operated was one of visual
                     impression, by which someone was required to look at the number of people
     B              in the pen to make an assessment by that means of the number who have
                    gone in and were going in. From the engineering point of view, Mr. Burne,
                     can you comment please on the system which was in fact relied upon by the
                     Engineer and the Club?     A. I find it extremely difficult to even begin
                     to estimate the number of people in a crowd in a discreet area. The
                     photographs —
     r Q.            Yes, you are about to refer to some photographs which have just recently
                     been produced by Mr. Thorburn who is one of the Engineers, expert Engineers,
                     who are giving evidence on behalf of the other parties. I think those have
                     found their way into the bundle in some way. I did not put them in myself?
    ^               A. And also appendix 5 of Lord Justice Taylor's Report.
        MR. JUSTICE 30WITT: Rather than look at appendix 5 which is a xerox copy, is
             there a proper print of these photographs. It is easier to follow?
      D     A. It might help my Lord if there is a part of that reproduced in my own
             report in colour.
             MR. JUSTICE 30WITT: There seem to be copies about.
             MR. PAYNE: My Lord, we do have                               a copyof    the Interim Reportin    whichthereis
                 a colour photograph.
        E MR. GLASGOW: What was your Lordship asking for. There is a bit of dispute in
               Counsel's row.
             MR. JUSTICE 30WITT: If there is a copy of appendix 5 ratherthan just the xerox.
             MR. GLASGOW:                To the Taylor Report?
              MR. JUSTICE 30WITT: Yes.                           Simply that it is easier than making head or tail of
         F         the xerox.
              MR. PAYNE: My Lord, in the bundle the other photographs which have been produced
                   by Mr. Thorburn and are now being referred to by Mr. Burne have found their
                   way into the bundle at page 864. I am not sure whether that applies to
                   everybody. I see my learned friends have theirs bound up and with a flag
                   on.
         ^ MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, I wonder if it would be more convenient to have them
                separately so you do not have the whole bundle.
              MR. PAYNE: These are documents which we understand were produced shortly before
                   the commencement of the trial.
              MR. JUSTICE 30WITT: Then may I hand you back your copy.                           I do not think this
         H        in fact includes appendix 5.

                                                                           - 18 -

    MR. GLASGOW: No, my Lord, it does not. Your Lordship still needs the report.
         I thought you were handing it back a little prematurely.
    MR. PAYNE: Mr. Burne looking at this bundle, have you got the bundle of
A        photographs referred to by Mr. Thorburn?    A. Yes, 864 in core bundle 2.
     Q.     Have you got them there?                 A. Yes, they are black and white photocopies.
     Q.     You need to be supplied with the originals?                A.   I have the original that
             Mr. Thorburn suggested to me directly.
     Q.     Can you show me which one that is and I will be able to give the number
B           which appears in this bundle that I have just been handed?   A. It is
             that which appears at 863A.
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:              Do we know what time this photograph was taken?
  MR. PAYNE: My Lord, if I can ask the witness, it is a new document. Mr. Burne
       what do you understand this is being produced. What does it show please?
       A. It shows the second half of the Nottingham Forrest/Liverpool semi cup
c     final 1988 my LOrd. The clock is at 16.20.
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:              1988?     A.    1988 my Lord.   I am sorry I do not know the
          date in 1988.
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: It does not matter, another occasion?                    A. But between
          the same two clubs.
D MR. PAYNE: You have drawn attention to this photograph in answer to my question
       to invite you tomake a comment from the point of view of an Engineer about
       the system of visual impression, so what is your comment please? A. I
       ask you to compare my Lord the view of pens 3 and 4 and the west terrace
       in general in 1988 as compared with a similar view which appears in appendix
       5 of Lord Justice Taylor's report, which is at — the clock say one minute
       to three but it is understood to be a minute out — three o'clock on the
E     day of the disaster.
      q.      What is your comment?    A. The di^icuIt ’is to attemf^to compare the
              very substantial differences that are actually there in numbers of
              spectators, and the complete inability on my part to be able to see any
              difference in apparent numbers.
      MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I confess, looking at the two photographs myself, and
           comparing them, appendix 5 does suggest to me that the people at the front
           they can be seen more readily because the sun is shining on them, are a
           good deal more squashed up than appears at 863A, the 1988 photograph. You
           say that is a wrong impression?    A. I believe so, my Lord. I have
           attempted to address this very long and very hard.
       Q.     Can you tell me this this accurately represents what you say Mr. Burne:
              " In comparing the 1988 photograph with appendix 5, one cannot detect any
              difference in the degree of packing between the two photographs, although
              as we now know there must have been a substantial difference? A. Absolutely
              my Lord.
      MR. PAYNE: It is the system I am asking you to comment on Mr. Burne from the
           point of view of an Engineer and when the system depends on visual
           impression it is clear that different people can have different impressions,
           simply by even looking at these photographs, but I want you to comment from
    H      the point of view of an Engineer about the effectiveness of such a system?

                                                           - 19 -
    SELLERS & CO. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




            A. It is simply that I am unable in that situation to note a difference
            of twice the number of people.
A MR. DUSTICE OOWITT: May I add to this answer. Would you expect any difference
       in the ability to distinguish, not looking at photographs, but in the
       flesh on the days in the stadium? A. Only if one can see spaces my Lord.
       When you see a moving mass of heads it is almost impossible to get any
       genuine understanding of numbers.
  MR. TOULSON: My Lord, I rise to object at this stage and I do so on two grounds.
       The first is this: that there was an order in relation to expert evidence,
B      that expert evidence be admittedat the trial limited to thesubstance of
       the reports. The second point is this: this expert has given his
       credentials. The claimants inthese contribution proceedings have a very
       large number of officers who have been present at football grounds and
       who apparently it is said on their part attempted to work this system.
       We have heard no evidence from them and we are told we shall hear no
       evidence as to what you can and cannot see and I challenge the qualification
       of this Engineer to be able to state what you can and cannot see if you
C      are attempting to perform that function at a football ground. He is not
       commenting on primary factual evidence. Indeed we are not going to have
       that. Those are the two grounds of objection.
        MR. PAYNE: No, I accept the second ground and I would be grateful Dr. Burne
             if you would confine yourself to dealing with the idea of the system.
        MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: I am not going to stop the evidence. It may assist me
D            in weighing Mr. Burne's evidence when he is making comments on the
              problem of making a visual impression, and indeed part of the difficulty
              if there are difficulties in having a visual impression is whether you
              can by the use of one's eyes distinguish between packed and the absolutely
              over packed.
        MR. TOULSON: My Lord, having heard your Lordship's comment I withdraw my
E           objection.
        MR. PAYNE: Mr. Burne, would you on this question of system look in the bundle.
             Go back to page 159, the crowd capacity numbers.

                    On this Certificate, Mr. Burne, you see the crowd capacity
A                   numbers which at some stage were allocated by the certified
                    authority on the calculations which have been done by the
                    Engineer and put in the Certificate.  Do you see that?
                    A.  I do.

            Q.      I want to ask you a question which I raised hypothetically
                    in the course of opening, and I want to ask you to deal
                    with it from the point of view of an engineer.    When these
B                   figures were allocated to each particular area of the
                    ground, if there had been a meeting attended by the
                    Engineer at which   this question of how the numbers were
                    going to be controlled had been raised, suppose somebody in
                    the room had said it was going to be done just by having
                    some people looking at the crowd to see when the numbers
                    were reached, what in your opinion, Mr. Burne, would have
                    been the response   of aresponsible engineer in the position
                    of Dr. Eastwood?      A. My view is that the Engineers
                    should have said that one cannot control numbers visually.
                    There may be potential to attempt to estimate density of
                    packing; it is discrete, numbers have been established - it
                    is extremely difficult to count the heads in a moving
                    cr o w d .

D            MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:               Those are two separate matters?
                     A.  They are, my              Lord, I quite accept that.

             Q.      May I just be sure that I have that accurately noted? You
                     say there may be a possibility of assessing the degree of
                     packing, but not of helping others?    A.  Correct, my
                     Lord.

 E           MR. PAYNE:  A point which has been addressed to my Lord in the
                 trial is that this sub-division of the terrace, which you
                 have just been looking at in the Taylor Appendix 4 drawing,
                 is something which was requested by the Police in order to
                 control the whereabouts of the spectators so that the idea
                 was proposed by the Police?    A.  Yes.

             Q.     When such an idea is proposed, what is the function,
    F                Mr. Burne, please, of the Engineer in response to such a
                     suggestion by the Police?  What should his response be?
                     A.  There is a need to esr^Llish discrete numbers to
                     discrete areas; the idea of separating groups of different
                     spectators in order to avoid fights between people, for
                     whatever reason, necessarily means that the numbers must be
                     known.

    ^         Q.     Where would the Engineers part come into the planning of
                     this new arrangement?    A.  Simply to say what numbers
                     each of the areas which were to be allocated was a safe
                     figure for that area.

              Q. If it be said (as we understand it may be to my Lord)   that
                  the Police were the ones who had said that they wanted
    jj           these fences in order to control the crowd, therefore   it


                                                            21.
^ ^ S E L L E R S & CO. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




                    was reasonable for the Engineer to assume that the Police
                    would actually do that and that they would control the
                    crowd.  What is your comment, please, about— -

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                       That is not a matter for me.

           MR. PAYNE:               Well, my Lord—

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  I think you could put the question in this
 B
               way and it may be acceptable:  did you as an engineer think
               it right to leave it to the Police to control the numbers?

           MR. PAYNE:  My Lord. I am happy to adopt that suggestion.
               (To the w i t ness) What is the answer, please, Mr. Burne?
               A“  My answer is that whoever controls must know numbers
               who can safely be accommodated and they must carefully
               count those numbers and manage them.

           Q.      You have produced now, in a separate volume, a publication
                   called "An Appraisal of Existing Structures , Mr. Burne,
                   and I ask you just to turn to that in context, please.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                       This is Appendix A, is it?

 D         MR. PAYNE:               My Lord, it is the one that has replaced N.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                       Yes.

           MR. PAYNE:   I am going to ask you to refer to this certainly
                twice in the course of your evidence, and so just identify
               what the document is, please, Mr. Burne, for the first
                time, would you?  I will take it in stages:   it is
 E             entitled— -     A.  It's a document prepared by the
                Institution of Structural Engineers some ten years ago, my
                Lord, entitled "Appraisal of Existing Structures".

            Q.     It is published in July 1988, it gives the constitution---
                    A.  Sorry, my Lord, it was first published in July 1980.

            Q.     Sorry, 1980.  Thank you very much.  It gives the
  F                constitution of the ad hoc committee, a list of
                    distinguished engineers, and a list of ex officio members
                    of the comnittee headed by Dr. Eastwood, another
                    distinguished engineer, 1976-77.

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  May I say, Mr. Payne, I see there are 60
                pages to this document.  I shall only look at those pages
                that I am invited to look at.
  G
            MR. PAYNE:               My Lord,        I am very relieved to hear it.,

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  You need not necessarily ask the witness
                to identify them all, but I shall want a list.

            MR. PAYNE:               Certainly.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  Unless it is just a very few passages you
              are going to take me to.

          MR. PAYNE:  I am happy to say it is very few; I am going to be
              selective, but the document is available for anyone if they
              should care to ask.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  As I say, I shall not go through the

          MR. PAYNE:  Thank you, my Lord.  (To the wit n e s s ) On this
              topic that I am asking you to deal with about the function
              of the Engineer when proposals such as this are put up.
              will you look at 2.3 at page 8 under "Responsibilities ?
              Do you see that?
r
                 A.       "No engineer can avoid responsibility for his actions.
                          However, if the appraising engineer states his
                          opinions and advice clearly, gives the bases for these
                          and can be seen to have acted wholly objectively and

•D
                          prudently, he should have no need to fear legal action
                          against him, even if his opinions are later proved to
                          be wrong or his advice unsound."

          Q.     Just in that context, Mr. Burne, are you aware of any
                 evidence over this period that Dr. Eastwood raised any
                 objection to the introduction of this first set of radial
                 fences without there being any means of controlling
                 particular numbers into the new pens?    A.  I am not aware
                 of any.

 E        Q.     Over the page, please, there is a checklist of points the
                 Engineers should have in mind at the top of page 9.  I just
                 ask you to read the first three?

                  A.       "The Engineers should decide whether the brief is
                           morally and professionally acceptable; decide whether
                           to accept it, reject it or persuade the client to
                           alter it; remain objective at all times, be aware of
  F                        his responsibility for public safety, and decide
                           whether to report factors or findings not covered by
                           the original brief."

           Q.     That completes what I want to ask you about the first set
                  of changes in 1981 and I want you to go on comment, please,
                  in relation to the performance of the Engineer as to the
  „              certified capacity, about the changes which took place in
                  1985.  Can you remind yourself, please, of the drawings
                  which were produced by Eastwood and Partners, beginning in
                  the bundle at 284?  This was the occasion that further sub­
                  division of the west terrace was being proposed, and this
                  is the first of a series of drawings produced by the firm
                  in connection with that alteration.  Just remind yourself
                  by looking at the concourse area, Mr. Burne, of the
    jl           proposals which were then put forward for separate


                                                23.

                   turnstiling access to the various new pens.  Do you see
                   those?    A.  Yes, it's a very radical alteration.

           Q.    I think one can just go through now   the sequence of
                  proposals.  The next one is at 292. Do you see that this
                  is another scheme involving a different configuration of
                  turnstiles, each providing separate access to the new
                  separate areas in the pens?    A.  Yes.   Insofar as the
                  central pen and the two end pens are concerned; it does not
 B                separate out pens 6, 7 and the north west pens 1 and 2
                  separately.

           Q.    Looking at   the central pens at page 292 on drawing 3, one
                  cannot see the pens but one can see the entrance to the
                  tunnel?    A.   Yes, there are four turnstiles labelled 23
                  to 26.

           Q.      When my Lord asked; you at the beginning of your evidence
                   about your response to the idea of whether it was necessary
                   to provide separate capacity for each of pens 3 and 4, and
                   you replied---

           MR. JUSTICE J0W1TT:  Not quite separate capacity, but provide
               separate entry control.
 D
           MR. PAYNE:  Separate entry control to those pens.
               (To the w itness) You gave your answer - you see the
               proposal which was being put forward at 292, drawing 3,
               when there are four turnstiles for visiting supporters to
               the centre terrace?    A.  That leads directly into pens 3
               and 4.

            Q.     What is your comment, please, from the point of view of
                   safety of that proposal if it had been implemented?
                   A.  That proposal is fine in terms of monitoring the people
                   going in.

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 Into where?    A.   Pens 3 and 4, my Lord.

A                   No, 333.  That is                           '85?   A.     '85, yes, so that at that time
                    had the ---

          Q.        Just get the sequence in your mind, Mr. Burne.  A. The
                    light green radial barriers had been introduced then, but
                    had the dark green ones been added?

          Q.       No, the dark green ones were added as part                              of the 1985
B                  exercises ---

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                                 They are black in mine.      A. That's right
              my Lord.

           MR. PAYNE:   Black, yes.  So that the final result now, Mr.
                Burne, is shown in the form of a diagram at page 932, which
                is one of a series of drawings, the 64 series, by which
C              time at 932 it has got 64E.    A.  Yes.

           Q.      The only reason                            I ask you to look at it    is to see the
                    arrangement of                           the barriers as shown in    the Taylor Appendix
                    4 drawing with                           the light and dark green    lines?
           A.      Yes.   The dark                           green ones were added in    1985.

           Q.        Yes.  The evidence is that no amendment had been made or
D                    was proposed to be made to the annual Safety Certificate to
                     give any particular numbers to any of the n e w pens, and now
                     I ask you to give your comment on Dr. Eastwood's
                     Certificate dated 2nd August 1988, at page 933, the last
                     paragraph.   A.  "I certify that in my opinion the various
                     structures on the ground are in a satisfactory condition
                     and appropriate for the stadium to be used to the full
                     capacity as laid down in the Certificate of Ground Safety.”
E
            Q.       Your comment, please, on the performance of the Engineer,
                     the professional performance of the Engineer in producing
                     that Certificate in the light of the documents that you
                     have been looking at?    A.  I believe that it ought to have
                     had an additional sentence drawing attention to the need
                     for control to limit the numbers in the pens to the figures
P                    which appear on Drawing 64E, to which it relates. If you
                     look at 64E, 932, there are three figures in a single row
                     on the pitch path:   south west pen, 2,600 persons, central
                     pen 2,200 person, north west pen 1,600 persons.   Then, on
                     the left-hand side of the page, just above the words "North
                     Stand", you will see "North west corner lower, 800
                     persons", and on the right-hand side of the page above
                     that, "North West corner upper, 2,900 persons."
G
             Q.       When you say "means of control of the numbers", what are
                      you referring to?   A.  That those who were to go into
                      those discrete areas should be limited to those numbers, by
                      means of a physical counting and control system.

             Q.        And what is your comment on the failure of the Engineer to
                       qualify his Certificate by the addition of those comments?
    H

                                                                            32.
    I. S E L L E R S   &   C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




             A.        I believe that he ought to have added such comments and
                        that he was failing in his duty of care not so to do.

             Q.        With that Certificate in mind, I want you to look at the
                        Drawing which shows what the use of the turnstiles in fact
                       was on the day of the disaster.   That is at 1238.  Do you
                       have that, Mr. Burne?    A.  Yes.

             Q.        You will remember that the Certificate that you have just
                        criticised was issued in August 1988?  A.   That is
                        correct, yes.

             Q.        Which therefore fell between the date of the 1988 cup final
                       and the date of the 1989 cup final?   A. Yes, I understand
                        that.

             Q.            For which matches the ticketing arrangements were the same,
                           in other words, the same ticketing arrangements had taken
                           place in 1988 as then followed in 1989?   I do not know
                           whether you know that, actually, Mr. Burne?   A. No.  I
                           understand that that may be the case, but   I haven't
                           addressed myself to specific knowledge on the subject.

             Q.        That is at paragraph 21 in the Taylor Report.   Looking at
D                      1238, what you are looking at there is the use of the
                        turnstiles which is in fact made for those two matches, one
                        in 1988 and one in 1989.  Do you see that?   A.   Yes.

             Q.   And what in fact was done was to allocate the whole of the
                  batch of turnstiles A - G to the whole standing area of the
                  west terrace.   If you look at the boxes on the left-hand
                  side, the top one is headed "North Stand, 10 gates, 9,882
E                persons";  and then there is "West Stand".  Do you see?
              A. Yes.

              Q. And the last box is "A - G, West Terrace,                7 gates for
                  10,100 persons"?  A. Yes.

              Q. And you will remember that that 10,100 is the certified
P                 number which had stood since 1979?   A. Absolutely.

              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  Access to pens 6 and 7 and upper north
                  west terrace through the open gate - is that right?
              A. Yes, through the open gate in the wall, m y Lord.

              MR. PAYNE:                        That is right, my Lord.

G              THE WITNESS:  And, coincidentally, in conflict with the flow of
                   those trying to get to the southern stairs leading to the
                   west stand.

               MR. PAYNE:  Mr. Burne, what is your comment on the use of those
                   turnstiles A - G for the purpose of attempting to fill the
                   whole of the west terrace, now sub-divided as it is by the
                   radial fences?   A.   There is, in the first place, a
H                 reduction in the number of turnstiles.   There is, in


                                                                  33.

                       addition, a conflict of flow through the open gate for
                       those wishing to go to the north west terrace and pens 6
                       and 7.

            Q.         And does this ---

            MR. TOULSON:  My Lord, before my learned friend continues, I
                would be grateful for his assurance that this is not
B               intended to form the basis of any criticism of the
                Engineer.  I ask that for these reasons:   (a) it is not
                pleaded;  (b) it is not in the Issues;   and (c) it is not
                in the expert's report.

            MR. PAYNE:  The exercise which I am asking Mr. Burne to deal
                with is to explain and illustrate the comments in his
                report about the certified capacity of the ground and how
                it ought to have been changed by appointing separate
                certified numbers to each of the new pens and providing
                means of control of access to those pens.  Forgive me, but
                that is certainly set out at some length in Mr. Burne's
                report, as I started off this passage by asking him to draw
                attention to it.  All I am doing ---

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  Yes, but are the problems, if problems
D               there were, arising from the allocation of turnstiles
                consequent upon the decision that all the Liverpool fans
                should enter through Leppings Lane?   Is that something for
                which the Engineer is criticised?

             MR. PAYNE:   Certainly, for this reason:  that the Certificate
                  issued in August 1988 was issued after this configuration
                 of turnstiles had already been used at least once, and the
E                Certificate being issued by the Engineer made no comment
                 about the use to which the turnstiles had been put at the
                  1988 match and accordingly he adopted it, and his
                  responsibility accordingly applies to this arrangement ---

             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:    So your Particulars of Negligence should
                  run in this way, should they not - "Knew or ought to have
F                know that at the match only seven turnstiles would be in
                  use for the whole of the west terrace and north west
                  terrace, and that there would be a conflict of flow in the
                  open gate" - and that would be Gate A - "between those from
                  turnstiles A - G wishing to enter pens 6 or 7 or the upper
                  north west terrace, and those from pens 11 to 23 wishing to
                  enter the west stand".   That is the way your Particulars of
                  Negligence would be framed, is it not?
G
             MR. PAYNE:                      Yes, my Lord.
                                                            ,
             MR.          JUSTICE JOWITT: Is that pleaded?

             MR.          PAYNE: My Lord, it is not pleaded in  that way. For my
                         part at the moment - although I would like a moment to
                         think about it if the Pleadings are to be criticised - what
    H                    I have in mind at the moment is that this is merely another


                                                                34.

                     aspect of the failure of the Engineer to warn about the
                     lack of allocation of numbers to particular pens and means
                     of controlling, and this is merely a consequence of his
                     failure to do so.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  If it is said that the problem of control
              was exacerbated by a decision to allocate the turnstiles
              differently from what we can see in the plan at 1238, it
              may be that the Engineer would have wanted Further and
              Better Particulars of how it is said that he should have
              known about it.

          MR. PAYNE:  My Lord, I am slightly surprised by my learned
              friend's intervention, because this arrangement is one
              which had already been certified by the Engineer as ---

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                             Which arrangement?

          MR. PAYNE:  The arrangement at 1238.  It was used at one of the
              major events in the previous 1988 season.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  Mr. Payne, you have, it seems to me, to
              distinguish between a use which is envisaged in the plan
              that we looked at on 932 and the different use made of the
D             turnstiles on the day of the match, which is the plan at
              1238.

          MR. PAYNE:                    Yes.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   If you are saying that the different
              allocation of turnstiles consequent upon all the Liverpool
               fans coming in at Leppings Lane exacerbates the problem,
E             then you have to say, do you not, that the Engineer knew or
               ought to have known that that would be the case, that the
               Leppings Lane end would be used?

           MR. PAYNE:                    Yes.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                            For all the fans.
F          MR. PAYNE:                    Yes.

                         That is why I say from the facts of the allegation I can imagine the
                         Engineer would have wanted further and better particulars of how it is
                         said he should have done. I think Mr. Toulson does have a complaint.
        A         MR. PAYNE: Well, if I need to amend the pleadings to include this allegation
                      expressly I will do so.
               MR. JUSTICE 30WITT: You mean you will ask for leave. Whether you get it may
                    be another matter.
          MR. PAYNE: My Lord, I will ask for leave to do so. My Lord, for the moment
               I intend to ask Mr. Burne to comment upon the use that was in fact made
        B     in the light of the lack of any certified capacity for the indivicJual
              pens.
               MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: I think you are entitled in any event to ask about the
                   effect on safety of the decision to use the Leppings Lane end solely for
                    (inaudible) supporters that has a bearing upon the case against the Club.[
                    It also has a bearing on the responsibility of the Police.
        C         MR. PAYNE: Certainly.
               MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, with the very greatest respect it does have a bearing on
        ^           the case against the Club and that is why I rise.
        ^      MR. JUSTICE OOWITT:                         You say it does?
               MR. GLASGOW:                 It does.
               MR. JUSTICE OOWITT:                         Yes.
          MR. GLASGOW: And the reason why I object to it being done in this way, my Lord
               is two fold. Firstly it is not part of the experts report and we have gone
               through our comment on the report, as your Lordship will see, very carefully
               and restricted ourselves to two aspects, because this matter was not raised
        E      against us. Secondly, my Lord, it is not pleaded against us either. If it
               had been pleaded we would have addressed different pleadings, I regret to say,
               both against the Engineer and against the Police, because the decision to
               use that end of the ground may be one thing, but the pleaded complaint against
               us is simply in failing to have sufficient turnstiles to accomodate the
               crowd of 24,000. There is nopleaded complaint, be it our responsibility
               or the Engineer's, of the way in which weallocated those turnstiles, and
                if there had been it would have rebounded on the Police and I would have
        F      wanted to address that matter in the pleadings. My Lord, I do object to it
               being taken further with this witness, both on the pleadings ground and
               because there is nothing at all about in his report.
                MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: Are you proposing to argue in due course that the Police
                     decision that the turnstiles should be used differently exacerbated the
                     matter?
            G MR. GLASGOW:                   Yes, my Lord.
                MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: You say that is one of the contributing factors to the
                     build up in Leppings Lane?
              MR. GLASGOW: Of course, my Lord, and putting it at its lowest it had a --
                   horrible phrase and I wish I could think of a better one -- a knock on
                   effect, a consequential effect, on policing that had been recognised before
            H     and we would have to go into considerable detail on the way in which 1987
                                                                              -   36   -
    ■S E L L E R S & C o . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                and 1988 had been policed if this matter had been raised, but I repeat
                my Lord, it is the pleaded case that I failed to accomodate 24,000 people.
  MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: At the moment it seems to me personally that the decision
A      that all the fans should come in through the Leppings Lane end and that no
       turnstiles should be used for the Liverpool fans in Penistone Road, — •
       obviously one does not have to be an Engineer to appreciate this -- that
       there has to be a greater throughput through the turnstiles and consequently
       at least the risk of the build up of people waiting in Leppings Lane to get
       through the turnstiles. At the moment it seems to me, if that is a point
       you are proposing to make against the Police, you can hardly complain if
       the Police say you also should have known about the effect of the Police
B      decision?
      MR. GLASGOW:                 No, I would not complain about that and I am not complaining about
           that.
      MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: I do not think Mr. Payne at the moment is going beyond that.
       MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, he is. That is the objection. I amsorry I put it badly.
c          I have already acceptedthat the    pleaded complaint against me, whether I
            like it or not, is having not enough turnstiles to deal with 24,000 people;
            but it is not about allocation of turnstiles, cross-flow, gates in walls
^          and that kind of thing.    If that had been the case, related as it now is
B          specifically to 12.38, Iwould have pleaded to it differently, because
            as your Lordship can now see very graphically it introduces a major conflict
            between myself and my Engineer.
D MR JUSTICE JOWITT: I do not think there is any reference in the Engineer's report
       to cross-flow.
       MR. GLASGOW:                 No, my Lord.
      MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I do not remember and we may have to look at the pleadings,
           but my recollection is that so long as Gate C was closed there was not a
    E      great mass of people in the concourse.
        MR. GLASGOW:                Your Lordship is absolutely right.
      MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: And I do not remember snarl up of people round Gate C.
           So while, of course, there will be people going one way through the gate
           and others going the other way, one remembers that the Gate was enlarged
           at the request of the Police. It maybe that the factual basis for complaint
    F      about there being a cross-flow, i.e. that it caused problems is missing.
      MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, the difficulty is, and it is said with great respect,
           that your Lordship with characteristic thoroughness you have just analysed
           some of the matters that I would have needed to plead. These are matters
           which, if the allegation had been made against me, I would have taken those,
           and as I say other points. I do not want to stop it if it is helpful to
           your Lordship. I will register my protest now and address your at greater
    G      length at an appropriate time.
         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Mr. Payne, the video film does not show that as long as
             Gate C is closed there areproblems about peoplegoing oneway through
             the Gate and not --
          MR. PAYNE: The middle gate.
     H MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: - - - and others goingbackwards.

                                                             -   37   -
    S E L L E R S & C o . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




    MR. PAYNE: My Lord, I do not think cross-flow has got anything to do with it.
         Mr. Burne has mentioned it as a consequence of the use of the turnstiles in
         this way. It has got no causative effect in this case.
A MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: It was not a problem.
    MR. PAYNE:                No.        I am not relying on cross-flow at all.
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Mr. Burne hypothesised that it was but in fact it was not.
  MR. PAYNE: It is not a problem. It is not certainly notcausative of the
       disaster so I am not saying anything about that. If I need to answer
B      the pleading point, then if my friend would be kind enough to refer to
       Issues 14 and 15, in Issue 14 the question is were the turnstiles at the
       Leppings Lane end adequate to cope with the number of fans expected to be
       admitted on the 15th April 1989. Does your Lordship have that?
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                        Yes.
             PAYNE: The question is spot on, the number of fans expected to be admitted
              on the 15th April 1989. The Police comment: "Yes, if the spectators had
              arrived at a rate similar to that in 1988. The number of turnstiles provided
              was the responsibility of the Club and Engineer. The number of tickets issued
              per turnstile was the responsibility of the Club. Negligence by the Club
              is as follows: failing to provide an adequate number of turnstiles for the
              number of tickets issued; failing to heed and implement the provisions of
              the Green Guide for coping with large numbers of spectators; failing to
D
              head and implement 44 sufficient turnstiles whereby no unduly large crowds
              were kept waiting for admission."
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Let us see what the Club said.
     MR. PAYNE: My Lord, what is being said against me by both the Club and the
          Engineer at the moment is that it is not pleaded. I submit that it is.
£ MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I am simply looking at what the Club say to see whether
       those pleading for the Club were obviously well aware of the factual
       issues being raised about this. I am bound to say I think they were.
  MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, I am so sorry. It is a different factual issue as I
       said. If it is a bad point, of course I will be corrected but the pleaded
       issue is the failure to accomodate a crowd of 24,000.Issue 14 as    I
       pleaded to it is were the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end adequate
F      to cope with the numbers of fans expected. The only reason for my rising
       to object, and I think it is the same objection that my learned friend
       for the Engineer has, is that we are        now not     talking about the adequacy
       of the turnstiles for 24,000, we are        talking     as I understandit about the
        allocation within those turnstiles. This is a wholly new complaint. I think
        what is being said and what the expert is being invited to comment upon
        is whether turnstiles A to G should have been allocated for use of both
        west end and the central pens of the stadium. Now that is not pleaded
G      anywhere, and the whole objection that I am now making reflects that made
        on behalf of the Engineer because it raises a conflict between the two of us.
        It should be pleaded and there is no pleading of the wrong allocation of
        the turnstiles within the Leppings Lane end. I simply cannot understand
        my learned friend's failure to grasp the point. There is a difference
        between saying there are not enough turnstiles for 24,000 people and saying
        you have used the wrong turnstiles within those which there are for
„      different parts of the stadium. That is my worry. If that is to be made
 S E L L E R S & C o . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




           I would like it pleaded so that we can see the way it is pleaded and
           if necessary object, and your Lordship has my assurance that if it is
           something we have notice of we will not object.
 MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: The only difference between this day and an ordinary
      day so far as admission is concerned, the two differences so far as
      admission is concerned to the west terrace, is that the fans were alir
      from one side.
 MR. GLASGOW:                 Yes, my Lord,
 MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Secondly, that whereas A to G would normally be used for pens
      1 to 4, now they are being used as well for pens 6 and 7 and the north
      west terrace. That is the only difference?
 MR. GLASGOW: Yes, my Lord. The balancing exercise with which your Lordship
      may be concerned about is whether those who were responsible for making
      that choice were sensible in increasing the overall number of turnstiles
      available so as to cut down the density of the crush outside Leppings
      Lane, or whether they should have maintained the system as we see on the
      Eastwood drawing of only having four turnstiles for the terraces and
      sending everybodyelse for the north west terrace through the other bank.
                My Lord, I am not arguing the point and, of course, I would not
           trespass on it at the moment. That is for me to deal with if any evidence
           is presented that is worth dealing with at a later stage. At the moment
           all I am asking, and I think I am entitled to know, how is that being
           put against me or is it put against the Engineer, or both of us, because
           I for my part would like to reply to it and I think my friend for the
           Engineer would also like to reply to it if it is a question of allocation
           of the turnstiles as distinct from their number. That is all my Lord.
 MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Mr. Payne is not the real point here simply this: that
      because — and I forget how many it was -- however many turnstiles from
      Penistone Lane for understandable reasons were not going to be used
      to allow entrance to the north stand that a greater pressure was placed
      upon the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end?
  MR. PAYNE:              Certainly my Lord.
  MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: And you say?
  MR. PAYNE: I say this was the fault of the Club by failing to appreciate that
       by allocating seven turnstiles only for 10,100 expected standing
       spectators at the Leppings Lane end they ought to have anticipated that
       this would lead to a build up of turnstiles and a large number of
       spectators kept waiting contrary to the provisions of the Green Guide.
  MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                         Just remind me, how many spectators were allowed in the
       north stand?
  MR. PAYNE:               According to the safety certificate, it is 9,882.
  MR. TOULSON: My Lord, normally 6,000 would be fed from Penistone Road and it
       is those 6,000 who are diverted to Leppings Lane. My Lord, I am conscious
       of having started this. May be it has taken more time in argument. Your
       Lordship appreciates my concern is simply this: if there is a suggestion
       that the Engineer knew this had happened in 1988 and should have know in
H      1989, it has never been pleaded; it has never been put.
    S E L L E R S & C o . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




               It is completely novel.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Mr. Payne, the result of the decision to facilitate those
         controls was to put an extra 6,000 people into Leppings Lane?
A
    MR. PAYNE: Yes, my Lord, that is right.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                         We have got to decide who is at fault.
    MR. PAYNE:               Certainly.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Whether the Police, the Club or both?
B
    MR. PAYNE:               Certainly.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Does it add that there are seven turnstiles being used
         for 10,100 whereas ordinarily it would have been seven turnstiles being
         used for something less than 10,100, because if there are seven turn­
         stiles used for 10,100 people, true there may be pressure on those, but
         equally there is less pressure then into the others. When you ask
         yourself how that has affected the throughput, because that is the
         point, is it not?
     MR.     PAYNE:          Yes.
V    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: By the time the trouble occurred there were sti11a lot
          of people waiting to come through.

     MR. PAYNE:              There were.
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I wonder whether it really helps one to decide what went
          wrong to say which turnstiles were allocated for which people. I think-
          if you say it does, then I think it does have to be pleaded.
     MR. PAYNE: I think what matters is that the people coming through those
E        turnstiles had access to any of the pens on the terrace.
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                        That is a different point.
     MR. PAYNE: That is the significant point.
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: That has never changed since the Taylor Inquiry.
F MR. PAYNE: No. It also does have the effect that when the turnstiles A to G
       are allocated to 10,100 people instead of the other proposal whichyour
       Lordship has seen and the other turnstiles at Penistone Lane are closed,
       thereby diverting people who would have gone through those into these
       two banks of turnstiles as well, it means the cumulative effect of those
       decisions made a substantial contribution, a material contribution, to the
       build up at the turnstiles.
G MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Then you see if you have turnstiles A to G serving a
       smaller part of the pens and then you have turnstiles 1 to 23 serving
       as well as the north west stands part of the pens. I just wonder whether
       it sound right. If you want to say that the Club were at fault in not
       allocating more turnstiles for admission to the terraces, or to the west
       and north west terraces, that is something that ought to be pleaded.
       You may like to think about it over the adjournment whether it really
H      is a live issue.
                                                                  - 40 -

  MR. PAYNE: I will give it some thought and see whether it is necessary to make
       any amendment.
  MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: If you want to say whether the Engineer should have known
      about this I think he does have a (inaudible)
  MR. PAYNE: My Lord, may I ask your Lordship to look at Issue 14 on the question
       of the involvement of the Engineer and whether in fact he is taken by
       surprise because I submit that he plainly should not be. Does your
       Lordship have the police comments on Issue 14.
  MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                         Can you direct me to paragraph 9A of the particular of
       negligence.
  MR. PAYNE: Yes, my learned junior has been trying to get me to do that for
       some time. My Lord 9H. My Lord I am afraid my numbering is not quite
       the same as the bundle which your Lordship has. I have got 22 at the
       top of the page.
  MR. TOULSON:                 Page 24 in the bottom right hand corner.
  MR. PAYNE: H says: "Failed to advisethe second defendants that the
      existing turnstiles facilities at the Leppings Lane end were inadequate
      to accomodate a crowd of 24,000 and that for such facilities tobe
      adequate they should include the matters set out in paragraph A above,
      of the particulars of negligence."

                     My Lord, Issue 14.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                              I was going to look at paragraph (a).

           MR. TOULSON:  My Lord, the pleadings do not finish there,
               because your Lordship saw what we pleaded in our defence in
               express terms on page 58.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                             You say you did not know?
B
           MR. TOULSON:  Then we get the request for the further and
               better particulars and nowhere have we a plea of knowledge
               that in the previous year 6,000 had been diverted and
               therefore there was going to be 24,000.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  I think in fact, Mr. Toulson, you had
               knowledge of the allegation; did you ask for particulars of
               how you were said to know?

           MR. TOULSON:                      Yes.          We find those at page 92.

t          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:

           MR. PAYNE:
                                                            You can sit down, Mr. Burne.

                       I am sorry to interrupt, but we - namely the
D              Police - have made nearly all these bundles which your
               Lordship is using and given the numbers and organised them
               all and supplied them to my learned friends.  One of the
               few jobs that was allocated down to that end of the bench
               was to make paginated bundles of pleadings.  I am afraid I
               am trying to struggle with my own bundle, because we have
               never actually been supplied with one.

E          MR. TOULSON:  My Lord, I think we found, as second third party,
               that nobody had prepared a pleadings bundle, and we have
               prepared one for all parties and prepared indices.  I will
               see if we have got an additional paginated bundle.  We did
               want to know what the source of knowledge alleged was, and
               in question 36, "In each case giving full particulars of
               all facts and matters relied upon".  Plainly, there was
               going to be a plea of actual knowledge that that is what
F              happened the previous year.  That was an express request
               and there is not a plea of action of actual knowledge.

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  I would have thought that you had notice
                of the allegation which is made against you and you asked
                for particulars of how it is said you should know.

q          MR. TOULSON:                       And your Lordship sees the answers.

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   And you get the answer.  I think Mr. Payne
                 is entitled to adduce evidence in support of the
                 allegation; that is what he says about knowledge, and it
                will be a matter of whether what are said to be your means
                 of knowledge are sufficient in fact to give knowledge.
                What he is not saying is that you should have known that
H

                                                                     42.

                            the people in the north stand would be admitted by way of
                            Leppings Lane.

                  MR. TOULSON:                      Absolutely.

                  MR.       JUSTICE JOWITT: It is really a matter for   comment on the
                            state of the evidence and the state of the  pleadings. I
                            think you have got notice of that here, but he is
                            restricting in what he can say against you simply that you
      B                     knew that the Leppings Lane end was a visitor's stand.

                  MR. TOULSON:                      Yes.

                  MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                            Very well,    let us carry on.

                   MR. PAYNE:   (To the w i t n e s s ) Mr. Burne, I want to just
                        complete my examination of this drawing at page 1238 by
                        asking you to give your comment on---

                   MR.      JUSTICE JOWITT:  I will just complete the answer that was
                            never quite finished.  I think one has to add "Those
                            wishing to go to the west stand, they are part of the
*                           contraflow"?    A.  Some of those going to the west stand,
                            my Lord, because there are two sets of stairs, one of which
      D                    - this layout on 1238 - leads directly to.

                   Q.      Not that it matters now, because Mr. Payne does not                    attach
                            any importance to the contraflow.

                   MR. PAYNE:                   No.

                   THE WITNESS:    The main difference between this and the previous
       E               scheme is that instead of the left-hand part of the
                        concourse behind the turnstiles A to 6 relating purely to
                        the discrete numbers in pens 1, 2, 3 and 4, identified on
                        drawing 64E as 4,800.   In addition, there is all those who
                        are to go to the north-west terrace upper, north-west
                        terrace lower and pens 6 and 7, in total 5,300.   5,300, my
                        Lord:   it is 1,600 for pen 6, 800 for the lower north-west
                        corner, pen 7, and 2,900 for the north-west terrace, which
        F               is 5,300.   Those people were to go through the gate open---

                    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  This is what I have written:  "Instead of
                        as formerly, those between the outer gates and turnstiles A
                        to G have restricted to those going to pens 1 and 4.  They
                        now include also those who were going to pens 6 and 7 in
                        the upper north-west terrace, which means an additional
          „             5,300 people who will approach turnstiles A to G and be on
                        the south instead of the north side of the sheeted fence?
                        A.  That's excellent, my Lord.  What has concerned me most
                        about that problem is the lack of any indication to those
                        5,300 that they needed to go through a gate in a wall which
                        was unmarked.

                    Q.       So it is that which concerns you rather than the build up
          l_j                of extra people who were going to pass to the south side of


                                                                              43.
E L L E R S & C o . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




              the sheeted fence?    A.  To the south end, my Lord, there
              were only 2,600 to go; they had a very small sign to direct
              them.

    Q.        I have not made myself clear.  If you look at the plan at
              1238, you will see on the street side of turnstiles A to G
              a sheeted fence - it is labelled "sheeted fence"?
              A.  Yes, I see it.

    Q.       And it is what happens to those 5,300 people once they get
              through the turnstiles rather than what happens before they
              get through the turnstiles which concerns you?    A.   My
              Lord, I have not addressed the problem external to the
              turnstiles.

    MR. PAYNE: Would you look   at the photographs, Mr. Burne, and
         remind my Lord of what would then be displayed to those
         extra spectators and the ones who would normally go through
         this side of the dividing wall, by looking at your
         bundle 1, tab B, page 6?

    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                              Which bundle is this?

    MR. PAYNE:  It is the first of the two bundles of exhibits, my
        Lord, tab B, page 6.

    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                              Yes.

    MR. PAYNE:  What view is showing in this photograph, please,
        Mr. Burne?    A.  Sorry?

    Q.        Have you got tab B, page 6, paragraph 5?    A.  Paragraph 5
              is a view taken by the police at approximately quarter-past
              four on the day in question.  It shows the entrance to the
              tunnel, with the word "Standing" over it.

     Q.        Where is the photographer standing?                           A.   Inside, just
               inboard of Gate C.

     Q.        And there is a close up of the entrance to the tunnel at
               tab D (for donkey), page 2?    A.  Yes.  That is a Police
               photograph; we don't know the time of that, but it was on
               that day.

     Q.        In those two photographs, whereabouts is the wall that you
               have been speaking about?    A.   On the left. There is a
               photograph of the wall; if we go back to the beginning of
               my Appendix B, B2 shows a Police photograph of the
               turnstiles A to G and  Gate C from outside.

     Q.       And the wall is at?A.  The wall is inside the ground.
               If we look at photograph 3 on page 4 of my B there is the
              wall on the left, unmarked, with the open gate.

     Q.       Just to complete this   examination of the photographs, would
               you go on in the B tab to look at page 7, photograph 6,
    ' S E L L E R S & C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                       where the camera swung round to the right of it and you can
                       see at the far right-hand end the way round the pens
                       numbered 1 and 2?    A.  And in the shadow, on the last
                       column of the west stand, there is a sign.

             Q.        Where is that shown in the better photograph?    A.  Two
                       pages over, at page 9 - there is a policeman without his
                       helmet on.  One can see the sign on the column, two-thirds
                       of the way up the column.
B
             Q.        You can see where it is, you cannot see the sign itself?
                       A.  That's right.  Then I have taken two shots from the
                       Police video.

             Q.        Is that page 10?    A.  At page 10, where the video was
                       taken of the cameraman walking down towards the sign to see
                       what the wording was.

              Q.        You have told my Lord already (if I might just finish this
                        point before the adjournment) the importance of signing in


t                       your belief as an engineer in relation to the system of
                        control of access to separate areas.  What is your comment
                        about the signing system which you have just illustrated in
                        those photographs?    A.  It's frightening.  There are
D                       5,300 people to go through the gate on the left of
                        photograph 4, and there is no sign of any sort.

              Q.        If you remind yourself, by looking, if necessary, at the
                        photograph in the Taylor Report, Appendix 5?     A. It
                        shows the ground at three o clock.

               Q.       The spectators sparsely standing on the terrace in the
E                        foreground are in pens 5 and 6, are they not?    A. Pen 5
                         is the narrow channel.

               Q.       And those spectators,                to get there, must have gone   through
                         the gap in the wall?                   A. Absolutely.

               Q.        Not many of them have found it?                  A.   Very few.

    F          Q.        Are you able to make any comment about the effect of the
                         signing system on the way in which the crowd dispersed
                         itself on the day of the d' ait e r ?    A.  It has failed to
                         have any effect because it simply was not there.     There are
                         only two signs in that concourse:     one in letters eight
                         inches high over the tunnel in the centre of the stand, and
                         clearly obviously going to the area behind the goal, and an
                         unreadable sign to the extreme right for 2,600 people, and
                         no sign at all for 5,300 people.

  ^                    Do you see that passage?                 A.    I do.

            Q.         With those passages in mind, look at the Drawing at page
                       1238, please, will you?    A. Yes.

             Q.        And bring yourself to the time with which the Taylor Report
                       is dealing with, 2.50 p.m. or 2.52 p.m., by which time pens
                       3 and 4 down the tunnel had become grossly overcrowded and
  R                    uncomfortably overcrowded.  Do you see that?   A. Yes.
                       "They should not have been uncomfortably overcrowded
                       because this system of control should have been place to
                       prevent that eventuality happening."

             Q.        Can you look back to a Drawing that you looked at in an
                       early bundle at page 302?  That is in Volume 1.  A. Yes.

  C          Q.        If a system such as was being proposed in that Drawing had
                       been in place, what effect would that have had on the
                       happening of the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4?  A. There
                       are three turnstiles discretely controlling the area of
                       pens 3 and 4.

             Q.        So if that or a similar system had been in place, what
                       effect would that have had on the happening of the
   D                   overcrowding?   A.  If the number of people who were to be
                       allowed into the pens had been calculated, then the
                       turnstiles could have been used to measure and control that
                       number in.

              Q.       And would the pens have become overcrowded if that system
                       had been used?   A.  No.

   E           q   # At 2.52 p.m., Gate C, which is shown on Drawing 4241 just
                      next to the rank of turnstiles A - G, was opened for the
                      second time.   Do you see it?  A.  The one adjacent to
                      turnstile A.

              Q.       That is right; it was opened?                   A.     Yes.

               Q.      And a large influx of spectators came through the gate and
                       went across the concourse and down the tunnel?   A.  Yes.

               Q.       If there had been a system of control of entry into pens 3
                        and 4 at the concourse end of the tunnel, as you were
                        telling my Lord at the beginning of your evidence, would
                        any of those people from Gate C have been able to get entry
                        to pens 3 and 4 which were already overcrowded?
    c*             ■
               MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                     Is that not stating the obvious?

               MR. PAYNE:      My Lord, we think it is but we hoped that it might
                   be helpful for your Lordship's note.      If your Lordship
                   thinks it is obvious, I am happy to move on.      (To the
                   w i t nes s) I would like to ask you to do another exercise
                   while you are looking at ---

*       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  It is like asking "If someone shuts the
            door, would anyone go through it?"

        MR.      PAYNE:   We are happy to accept what your Lordship says.
                 (To the w i t n e s s ) I would now like to ask you   about the
                 opening of Gate C and the effect thatit had,          and I want to
                 ask you to help my Lord about an argument which was
                 addressed to his Lordship yesterday by Counsel for the
g                Engineer on the question of foreseeability.         Mr. Burne,
                 given that there was no system of control of numbers going
                 into pens 3 and 4, and given that the system for assessing
                 how many there were in the pens was that it relied on
                 visual appreciation, lookout, by those responsible ---
        A.      Yes.

        Q.      — from the point of view of an engineer, what will                            happen
C               if this system is put into effect?

        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                                In what circumstances?

        MR. PAYNE:  In the circumstances at this stage of ordinary use
            of the turnstiles and ordinary people coming into the
            concourse area shown in 1238.

D       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                                You mean if that just continues in that
            ordinary way?

         MR. PAYNE:   Yes.   From the point of view of an engineer with no
             control and visual appreciation, Mr. Burne, what will be
             the consequence for the arrival of spectators in those
             pens?    A.   There can only be two things happen.  Either
             people are turned away or people will continue to go into
®            the tunnel and try to find a place at the other end and be
             followed by others coming in behind them.    It is inevitable
             that there will be a build up of people in a location such
             as that.

         Q.          You mean because it is behind the goal? A. And because
                    there was only the one sign showing "Standing";   this is
P                    the place to come.

         Q.         So given that configuration, Lord Justice Taylor found that
                    pens 3 and 4 became grossly overcrowded by 2.50/2.52 ---

         MR.         JUSTICE JOWITT:                       Which paragraph is this?

         MR.         PAYNE:             Paragraph 115, my Lord.
G
         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                               Yes.

         MR. PAYNE:                     Do you see the line ---

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   That is not quite what the paragraph says.

                                "This disaster was the worst in the history of British
                                football.  It happened because pens 3 and 4 became
                                grossly overcrowded.  They were uncomfortably
                                overcrowded by 2.50 p.m."

          MR.       PAYNE:             That is right, my Lord.    I said,   "2.50/2.52".

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  Lord Justice Taylor is not saying that by
B             2.50/2.52 p.m. they were grossly overcrowded.  He is saying
              that they were uncomfortably overcrowded by 2.50 p.m.  Just
              read the text and you will see what I mean.

         MR.       PAYNE:  Yes.  If your Lordship would go to paragraph 63,
                   here Lord Justice Taylor deals with the same topic in the
                   second sentence.  I ought to perhaps read all of it:

                               "In the 20 minutes from 2.30 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. there
                               were crucial developments both inside and outside the
                               ground.  In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady increase
                               in pressure as more fans came through the tunnel to
                               the favoured area behind the goal.  By 2.50 p.m. these
                               pens were already full to a degree which caused
                               serious discomfort to many well used to enduring
                               pressure on terraces."
D
                   My Lord,               the other paragraph which dealt with this subject
                   w a s ---

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                               184.

         MR. PAYNE:   184, yes, your Lordship has that.   Mr. Burne, I
              want you just to take the position from here.   At 2.50, the
E            pens are seriously overfull, if I may be allowed to use
              that expression.  The turnstiles A - G amount to seven in
              number, do they not?   A.  They do.

          Q.      I want you to just look at the rate at which they were
                   expected to be admitting spectators, which can be found at
                   188 in the Taylor Report.  Do you see it says:
F
                                "The Green Guide recognises that the rate at which
                                spectators can pass through turnstiles depends on a
                                variety of local circumstances but states 'in general
                                based on observation and experience, it is unlikely
                                that the maximum notional rate per turnstile would
                                exceed 750 per hour'."?

G          A. I do.

          Q»                    "Since the semi-final was an all ticket match
                                requiring no cash transactions, the Club considered
                                that a higher rate of about 1,000 per hour per
                                turnstile could be expected."

                   Do you see that?   A. Well, there would be 7,000 people
H                 theoretically able to get through.
E L L E R S & C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




    Q.        Yes.  Just work out, would you, please, how that would work
              and what would happen after 2.50, by which time the pens
              Were uncomfortably overcrowded.   At the rate of 1,000 per
              hour per turnstile, by arithmetic, that works out at
              sixteen per minute per turnstile?    A.  Yes.

     Q.       Seven turnstiles in the period immediately leading up to
              the kick-off* at sixteen per minute, is 112 per minutes?
    A.       Of that order, yes.

    Q.       And the figure that my Lord was asked to consider was a
              period of eleven minutes between 2.52 and 3.03, so that
              eleven times 112 would give the result of  1,232, by
              arithmetic, Mr. Burne?     A. Yes, I hear what you say. I am
             not absolutely certain that arithmetic is perfect.

    Q.        It will be corrected if it is wrong, but I want you to
              comment on a proposition that was put to my Lord yesterday.
              If that is correct, namely 1,232 in eleven minutes through
              the turnstiles, suppose that 80 per cent of that number are
              attracted by the only obvious sign of 'Standing* over the
              tunnel, that would arrive at 985, just under 1,000 people?
     A.       Yes.

     Q.       And just suppose that half of them on their way   as they go
              down the tunnel go into pen 3 and half into pen   4.  A. Yes.

     Q.       This will result in an increase of numbers in each of those
              pens of 500 or so in the space of eleven minutes after
              2.52?   A.  Yes.

     Q.       From the point of view of an engineer, what is the
              foreseeable consequence of that when the pens are already
              uncomfortably overcrowded?   A.  If they are uncomfortably
              overcrowded, they would have to have had something like 900
              people in each pen, so the addition of another 50 per cent
              at least would obviously mean a very serious situation.

     Q.        What would be the consequences for the safety of people
               already in those pens?   A. It would be completely unsafe.

     Q.        And what consequences can reasonably be foreseen of what
               will happen in the pens?   A. If there is no means of
               escape, then the obvious consequences will be that of
               crushing.

     Q.        Is this matter something which ought to be in the mind of
               the Engineer when putting forward schemes such as you have
               been discussing?

     MR. T0ULS0N:  My Lord, what in the mind of the Engineer?          A
         lot of things have been put.

     MR. PAYNE:  The development of the situation as you have just
         described it to my Lord, Mr. Burne, in the light of the
    S E L L E R S & C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                    absence of any system of counting and control and the
                    signing matters that you mentioned?

    S E L L E R S & C o . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




              A. A system of counting and control is essential and fundamental to the
              management system for safety reasons alone. The consequences of not having
              a management system are those of an unsafe area in which people are being
              asked to attend. If there are no ways in which those people can escape
              the consequence of that unsafe situation must be that of crushing.
A
    Q.       Will you therefore go please now, moving slightly away from that topic,
             to consider the means of escape, and I ask you just to go back to your
             report now to refer to those passages which describe the subject and where
             you deal with this subject and then I want you to illustrate your report
              by reference to the documents. In your report can you find page 2 where
              in your summary under B.2?      A."Similarly outward emergency or exit
U            flows could have been managed by safe routes, signs and facilities for
              emergency operation."
    Q.       I have now got a note 5.14 which is at page 81. In these paragraphs you
              are discussing now the means of escape in the pens. The first paragraph
              5.14, could you read that please?      A. "There were accesses into
              adjacent pens via gates 1.1 metres, or 3*7i" wide, through radial fences
              1.7 metres, 5’7" high. The top rail is at shoulder height. These accesses
C            were without the benefit of any sign or indication of their presence for
              use either as communication into a less densely filled pen or as a means
              of escape. The gates could not be seen whether they were open or not."
    Q.       You have got a photograph there but that is a finding which has been made
              by Lord Justice Taylor, so you can go on to 5.15?      A. "There was an
              emergency route on to the pitch via a gate. Access to the gate was up
              three steps, a total height of .6 metres, 2 ’, from the well of the pen.
D            The only sign from the gate with its number oriented towards the pitch.
              It could only be unlocked from the pitch."
     Q.       Could you now then turn to your photograph 40, appendix D.3please.      A; ;That
              shows the back of the perimeter fence in pen 3.
     Q.      My Lord has visited the site so you can take it fairly shortly, but it
              illustrates the step up that you were talking about and the fact that there
E             is no means of opening the gate from the inside?     A. Yes.
     Q.        Go on to 5.16?     A. "There are no emergency escape signs of any kind.
               The only real emergency exists were completely unmarked. Even the normal
               exit routes were unmarked.", that is to say there was no sign on the end
               of the tunnel to show the way out.
p Q.          From the point of view of an Engineer, bearing in mind the annual certificates
               which were produced by the Engineer, what is your comment about the absence
               of any such signs?     A. I believe there ought tohave been emergency signs,
               emergency exit signs and that if tl.~y were r.ot present then I believe that
               the attention of the Club should have been drawn to this fact.
      Q.      By whom?                   A. By the Engineer in his annual   letter.
G     Q.      At 5.17?     A. "The only means of escape in emergency were (a)normal
               exit route retracing entry through the tunnel, which would be up quite
               a steep slope against the flow of an incoming crowd; (b) exit through
               the unmarked gate in the radial fence separating the next pen and which
               is not visible in crowded conditions; (c) through a narrow unmarked
               not panic operable from the inside gate on to the pitch up three steps
               and 2' higher than the well of the pens."
H     q.      As to the design of the gate and the operation of the catch on the gate,
               can you look in the bundle--

     MR. OUSTICE OOWITT:                        That is the perimeter gate?
     MR. PAYNE: The perimeter gate my Lord. Could you look in the bundle at 690
          in the bundle of documents, which is a letter from Dr. Eastwood to the
          local authority dated August 1987 enclosing four copies of the two
          sketches showing proposals for gate release devices, and over the page
          at 691 and 692 are the designs which were put forward. If you look at
          691, can you explain to my Lord how this gate hatched is intended --
     MR. OUSTICE OOWITT: I can see they are designed deliberatelyso as not to be
          able to be opened from the inside.
B
     MR. PAYNE:              Your Lordship has it. Thank you very much.
     MR. TOULSON: Your Lordship will also recall the unchallenged finding of Taylor
          in paragraph 72 that the gate in pen C in fact sprang open twice from
          pressure within and was shut by the Police.
     MR. OUSTICE OOWITT: You will be able to draw my attention to that later.
     MR. PAYNE: Finally, just completing your examination of the means of escape
          or lack of means of escape from these pens, can you read 5.18?    A. "33.1
          per cent of those of pen 3 and 32.3 per cent of pen 4 were more than 12
          metres from the tunnel. 29.1 per cent of pen 3 and 30.8 per cent of
          pen 4 were 12 metres from the tunnel or radial gate. In appendix M is a
          drawing --
D MR. PAYNE: Would your Lordship be kind enough to look at that. I know your
       Lordship has made a comment about this and I will not dwell upon it,
       because I understand what is in your Lordship’s mind, but it might be
       helpful just to have in mind the drawing Mr. Burne has made at appendix M.
       The Green Guide describes a 12 meter escape limit route. What is the
       significance of this drawing.    Oust take my Lord round it would you please
       Mr. Burne?     A. The Green Guide echoes what is already stated in British
F      Standards as an accepted minimum in respect of distance. 12 metres from
       the tunnel for pen 3 and pen 4 is a green hatched area of each flank of
       the pens, my Lord. Those people are also within easy access of radial
       fence gates. There are in addition the areas which are evaluated in
       number terms, 29 per cent and 30.8 per cent which are cross-hatched in
       red. Those people are more than 12 metres from either the tunnel or
       the radial fence gate. All those people are thereby very seriously at
       risk because they are so far away from an emergency exit, unless you
 F      count that one narrow gate on to the pitch.
  MR. OUSTICE OOWITT: In the situation which developed on the occasion of this
       match in pens 3 and 4, had their radial gates been two or three times the
       size with excellent sign posting and maybe closer, it really would not
       have helped those being crushed at the front, would it. There was only
       one way and that was forward?    A. If there were extra gates either in
       the radial fences, but more particularly, as your Honour has said, inthe
G      front of the pitch fence, there should have in my opinion been more gates
       in the pitch fence.
       Q.In the situation which developed, the only thing    which could have helped
            those in danger of being crushed and those being crushed would have been
            adequate means of access on to the pitch, is that right?     A. Absolutely
            right.
    H Q.          Nothing else could have helped?    A. Nothing else at all in the form of
                  a substantial amount of removable surface such as the gate.

                                                              62.
    1E   L L E R S & C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




    Q.          Radial gates and escape from the tunnel were out?     A. Absolutely
                useless, because--
    Q.          I do not mean because of limitation of numbers, simply from the fact
                that you could not go back?     A. That is what the 12 metre rule means
                my Lord, because it is not the fact of 12 metres being a long way to run
                 when it is exposed space, it is 12 metres of people who are already going
                 out through those routes which prevents your exit through those routes
                 which reinforces the need to provide additional exits for those who are
                 more than 12 metres from an exit route.
    Q           I am trying to get you to direct your mind to the circumstances which
                 developed in pens 3 and 4. I have had the benefit not merely of reading
                 the Taylor report, but being able to see the video films. One sees on the
                 video films police officers and civilians on the pitch gesturing to the
                 people in the pens -- at first sight one might think they are just saying
                 "Don’t try to get out", but with better understanding one can see they
                 are telling those who are further back to back off and it is not happening.
                 That is why I say those unfortunates who were being crushed, if they could
                 have escaped they could only have escaped , had there been the means, on
                 to the pitch?     A. Absolutely.
     Q          And however good other methods of escape were they would not have worked
                 in this situation?    A. That is exactly what the 12 metre rule is trying
                 to say.
     MR. PAYNE: I think you can take it this way Mr. Burne and then you will be able
^        to explain the point you are trying to make. Is there a connection from
          an engineering point of view between the control of the numbers who can go
           into the pen by means of counting such as you have been describing at
          turnstiles or some other means. Is there a connection between that and
          what one finds on entering the restricted area as here.and what the
          means of escape and distance from the means of escape ought to be?
J ^ ^ E L L E R S & C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                       A.  Yes.  The British Standard, which establishes the use
                       of a 12 metre number to guide us in the design of spaces in
                       which people will gather together in large assemblies of
                       this kind, has arrived specifically at that figure because
                       it is sufficiently large for the crowd through which you
                       would have to try to pass to get to your exit to be too big
                       to penetrate and, therefore, you must find another route
                       - another means of escape must be provided - which is
                       exactly what your Lordship is saying; that the only way for
 B                     these people, who were within a narrow distance from the
                       pitch fence - the only way - was for them to go out through
                       that fence by means of the provision of gates.

              Q.       My Lord is confining the question to the events which
                       occurred on the 15th April.

              MR. JUSTICE J O WI TT: My impression was that let us suppose
                  within five metres of an escape gate - if that had meant
                  moving sideways or backwards or sideways and backwards,
                  such was the crush that you could not have made it?
                  A.  I am with you 100%, my Lord.     We are saying exactly the
                  same thing.     All of those people who were at the front of
                  the pen---

  D           MR. PAYNE:                   I think I can bring you to assist his Lordship---

              MR. JUSTICE JOWITTs  Just let me make a note of that.
                  Mr. Payne. I have written this - and I hope I have it
                  right -   On this day as the overcrowding developed,
                  however near the access the people being crushed were
                  escape through an access which required movement to side or
                  rear would have been impossible.  The only way of escape
                  would have been if they could have gone forwards on to the
                  pitch."

               MR. PAYNE:  My Lord,                        that is my understanding of what Mr. Burne
                   has said.

               MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                         Thank you.

                MR. PAYNE:  Mr. Burne, my Lord has addressed his questions to
                    you on the basis of what happened on the 15th April.  Do
                    you follow?    A.  Yes.

                Q.       But in the light of the 12 metre rule as illustrated on
                         your drawing, Appendix M, from the point of view of an
                         engineer what ought to have been provided leaving out of
                         consideration altogether the events of the 15th April?
                         Once one has got the situation as shown in Appendix M,
                         forgetting all about the disaster, what ought to be done
                         here in engineering terms?    A. There should have been
                         two or even three gates of at least 1.1 metres wide on to
                         the pitch for each pen.

                Q.        And from the point of view of an engineer, without the
     H                    provision of such gates, in the event of a capacity crowd


                                                                    64.
C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




 attending, what are the implications for the safety of the
 people in these red hatched areas, leaving out altogether
 the events of the 15th April?    A.  They are in an unsafe
 situation.

  Bearing in mind that unsafe situation, could you just bring
  to mind the estimate of visual impression which was being
  relied on by the Engineer to assess the capacity of these
  pens?  Do you follow that?    A.  Yes.

  I want you to put in mind the two matters together, first
  of all the proximity of the exit route and secondly that
  the system of capacity depends upon look-out.  Bring those
  two to mind and I am going to ask you a question about it.
  Put yourself in a position now of the Engineer writing his
  annual safety certificate and he now has to address his
  mind to what he is going to put.  What ought a reasonably
  careful engineer to put in the Certificate?    A.  That
  there are many people, nearly a third of the potential
  occupants, who will be unsafe, and their lack of safety is
  unlikely to be recognised by visual attempts to define the
  density of the crowd.

  And you are aware from the letter we looked at, 933 (the
  certificate in 1988) that the Engineer in fact gave an
  unqualified certificate in relation to the safety of the
  ground - I do not think it is necessary to look at the
  document again?    A.  Yes.

  What is your comment about that?    A.  I believe there
  ought to have been clauses added to that letter drawing
  attention to what is a serious safety risk.

   One last thing I want you to do, please:  Looking at your
   Appendix M and the cross-hatched areas shown in Appendix N,
   I want you to bring to mind also your criticisms of lack of
   means of counting and control of numbers going into the
   pens and the lack of any system of turnstiles or management
   system to control the numbers going into these pens.  Do
   you follow?    A.  Yes.

   So that I want you to bring together in your mind the
   dangerous situation shown by the cross-hatching together
   with the lack of means of counting and control (which you
   have already been describing)?    A.  Yes.

   Now I want you to do the same exercise:  Here you are, the
   Engineer, sitting down to write the Certificate.  Should
   your certificate include anything about that?    A.  The
   Certificate ought to have, in my view, recognised that
   there were some 30% of the people---

    Never mind about recognised, what should it have said?
    A.  "Put more gates into the pitch fence".
    S E L L E R S & C o . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




           Q.        What about control of access to the pens?    A.  That would
                     have been an absolutely essential matter which ought to
                     have been addressed earlier.  In this situation, you simply
                     don't know how many people are in the tunnel coming in.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITTs   Just looking at Appendix N, the perimeter
               gates which are there seem to be fairly evenly spaced
               - spaced on the basis that there were no radial fences
               there.   For instance, pen 4, the perimeter fence there does
B              not seem to be sited with the position of radial fences in
               mind?     A.  I don't know when the gates were introduced,
               my Lord.   The very clever design of Dr. Eastwood for the
               release device is dated 1987, which post-dates the
               installation of both sets of radial fences.    So that
               suggests that the device at least was attached to the gates
               after the radial fences were installed, and it may well be
               that the gates previously existed before then.

           MR. TOULSON:                       As a matter of fact, some did and some did not.

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITTs  I doubt, for instance, whether the
                perimeter gate in pen 4 would have been sited there if it
                were put in after the radial fences.

D           MR. GLASGOW:  If it helps the note, my Lord - I am sure it is
                not contentious - that is an old one.  They were all
                existing - there is no secret about that.

            MR. PAYNE:   Thank you very much - most helpful.
                 (To the witne ss ) I am going to ask you to move on now to a
                 different topic, please, Mr. Burne - the question of the
                 barriers.  Will you begin that, please, by reference to
E               your report, beginning at page 32? Will you begin to read
                 Chapter 9, please?     A.  The foreward of Chapter 9 of the
                 Green Guide indicates that:

                                  "Many hazards can be eliminated by provision of well
                                  constructed, correctly positioned and properly mounted
                                  crush barriers."

F            Q.        So you ought to have open, please, Chapter 9 of the Green
                       Guide, which is in fact this page that you are referring
                       to.  It is at page 35.  You draw attention to the foreward
                       - please go on?    A.  I have only quoted a part of 110.

             Q.       Yes, 110 relates to the height of top rails?    A.  That's
                      right, and it relates to the part which is the most part of
r                    the body able to tolerate pressure.

                                                                  Monday, 8th October, 1990
        MR. PAYNE: My Lord, the first matter is that speaking on behalf of all parties
             we would like to thank your Lordship for the time which we have been given
             this morning in which to have further discussions about the case which your
A            Lordship heard during most of last week, whichhave enabled the parties
             to reach a final agreement.
                     Your Lordship is asked to make an order in the Tomlin form. My Lord,
               we have a typed copy here but it is the only copy which has survived the
               discussions, so perhaps I may read out the form of the order which your
               Lordship is asked to make and then hand it in to the Court. My Lord here
               are the terms. By consent that the third party claimant and the first and
B              second third party defendants, having agree to the terms set forth in an
               agreement in writing between the same parties dated 8th October 1990, it
                is ordered that all further proceedings in this action be stayed, except
               for the purpose of carrying such terms into effect, and also that there
               should be liberty to apply as to carrying such terms into effect. That
                is the order which your Lordship is asked to make.
c       MR. JUSTICE OOWITT:                          You agree?
        MR. GLASGOW: Yes, my Lord.
^ ^ M R . TOULSON: Yes, my Lord.
        MR. GLASGOW: Before leaving your Lordship's Court might we just also thank your
              Lordship not only for the time you gave us this morning but for the guidance
D            you gave us last week, because it is quite important perhaps that it be said
              in public that the terms which the parties have agreed this morning not only
              represent respect for your Lordship's guidance last week, but they represent
              a very considerable amount of good will that there was between the three
              parties at all times. It is important, in view of this litigation, that it
              be known that there is an enormous amount of goodwill and respect between
              the Club and the officers who policedthat footballground both before,
              during and after the disaster and also for theEngineer as well who is very
 E           well known in this field. It is because of that respect between all three
              parties in the light of the guidance your Lordship was able to give us
              during the early part of the hearing that we have been able to come to
              these terms. We are very grateful for that guidance.

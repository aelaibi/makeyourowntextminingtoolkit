             I am a Police C on s ta bl e                   in the South Y orkshire Police at                  present

             s t a t io n ed at M a i t b y .

             For       the     1988 F .A. C up semi-final                 at    Hillsborough       I was in a serial            at

             the Le pp in gs Lane                end of the ground              with the Liverpool fans.

             O n arrival             at the      g round our first duty was at the turnstile                          giving

             access          to the L eppings              Lane    stand.       We were    to   check tickets and

             se a rc h       people         prior     to e nt ry       into the ground.

             At    first all               the s u pp or ters were         in good spirits and          co-operative        but

             as kick off time a p p r o a c h e d                     the mood started to change.             More and more

             of these           fans        turning     up had been drinking,              some   quite    heavily.       Our

             job at this              time      became      harder with         the   fact   that some of the fans

             became u nc o— operative,                     trying       to get to the turnstile without showing

             tickets and               refusing        to be searched.            There were also         fans    outside       the
                                                                                                                     PA GE            2
                                                                                                                     S3214

              g ro un d wit h the opposing             fans,

              Shortly            before kick    off we were taken off the turnstiles                      and sent         onto

              the    control         terrace at L ep pings Lane and took                up positions along               the

              back wall,           we stayed here        for the first      half    of the game.

              The    terracing was           very full and we had d i ff ic ul ty             in m ai n t a i n i n g    our

              position here.

              A fter mealing we a g a i n          returned to the         tunnel       leading to the            centre         of

              the terracing            but were    unable      to get back      to our original             position as

              more     fans       had since     come   in,   there were     even people          standing         in the

              tunnel.            We took   up positions        then    in and aro un d the tunnel              area      until

              the    end of the game,

              To my knowledge              the gates at the top of the             tunnel      leading        to the

              terrace at Leppings               Lane were      not    closed.

                                                                                    M   G   C H A R L E S W O R T H S IG N E D

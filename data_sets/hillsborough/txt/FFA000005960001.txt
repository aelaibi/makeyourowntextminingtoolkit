     For

     York v. Sunderland - 26 March 1988

     I    attach an article from "Private Eye" of 26th May 1989.

     1 also attach Minutes of a Meeting of the Disciplinary Committee
     of 7 April 1988.

     I have searched *£TG  edited file and the FA Crowd Control files
     as well as the Disciplinary file in connection with this game but
     can find no trace o           1 report#.


m   JGW wants a copy and wants to know whether the FA did anything
    with regard to dangers caused by the gate being opened?
    I imagine the answer is "no" because once the disciplinary
    process has been undertaken, the F A does not consider its role to
    envelope matters relating to safety at grounds. Perhaps we can
    discuss this this afternoon.
    Regards

             "Hivinj considered all of the evidence presented
              In York, th* Members of the Commission are

              th® incidents after tb* match involved supporters
              o£ Sunderland F.C, only and that no York City
              supporters were involved.

             An £#r as th® first incident is concerned, it would
             appear that this was caused by serious congestion
             la one of the areas allocated to the Sunderland
             supporter# but that th® spectators who eliiabed

             dio so only to escape the crush and were not
             intent on interfering with play.

            m disciplinary action will be taken against either
            o f the Clubs as far as Football Association Rule 24
            i* concerned, but the Members are concerned at the

             satisfied that the duage to seating, the
           .*Jcroacheent onto the playing area and the breaking
             of a crossbar were caused by followers of th#
             Sunderland F.C,    Nevertheless, the incidents were of
           . such a nature that Officials of the Sunderland F.C.
             coula not reasonably be held responsible for failing
             to control and, therefore, no disciplinary action
             will be taken against the Club.

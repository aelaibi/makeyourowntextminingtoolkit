             places        a few m i n u t e s            later.         The          game     f inally         got    started         and    couple

             of m i n u t e s       into         the    game         I looked          towards        the       Liverpool            supporters

end.        I saw what               I thought               at      that     time          a    pitch       invasion.               I ignored

t he    game      and      k ep t     watching               what       was      happening.                  A few minutes                 l ater       I

saw a P o l i c e          Officer             run      onto         the     pitch          and        speak        to    the    referee.             The

referee         then       stopped             the      match and             took          the        players           off    the   field.            I

then      looked          back       towards            the L i v e r p o o l            supporters               end and        I saw        peopie

being       lifted         up    into          the      seating            area      of         the    s ta n d .        A fe w m i n u t e s

later       I saw a           p e rs on being                gtretchered                 away         from     that       e n d a n d as         he

was     taken          between        the       Spion           Hop     and      the        North        Stand,          1 said       to

             , “He        looks       dea d .           I think            t hi s    is m o r e          serious          than a       pitch

invasion.”                I suggested                 that        we    go    down and                 see     if we       could      be      of

assistance              but     we    decided              to     stay where                we    were       and     see       what    was

happening.               We     then          sa w    other          injured         p e o p l e,       and       the     three       of    us     then

went      to    the      side        of       the     Spion H op and                 informed               two     police       officers

that      we w e r e       doctors             and      offered            our      assistance.                   We w e r e     then

escorted          by     the     police              o f f i c e r s to       the        first         aid     room       by    the

g y m n a s i u rrlV   ' ■ / 1 here       I encountered                  about          5   people           who    were        injured       and

one     person          lying        outside            who       was      more      seriously               injured.            I believe

this      man was          the       first           person          who     I had          seen       being        strstchered             from

the     Liverpool             end.            I together               with      Dr s                                    and

               started          to    treat           the       injured.             A      couple          of m i n u t e s     late r       more

and more          injured            people           started           to a r r i v e           at    this       point.         I saw        by

this      that         this     was       a    serious            incident           developing                and       that    there        was       a

need      for     some        organisation.                       I then         s a w a St            J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e        woman

and     told      her      I wanted             something               to    identify                urgent        cases       for    transfer

to     hospital.              She     then           got    me       some     white             sticky       labels        and       a biro        pen.

I put a         label         on at           least        ten       people         with         the     letter          *T * p r i n t e d      on

 hem.          After       I had          placed about                  three        labels            on    people        who       required

urgent         medical          help,          I went           to     the    police             control          point        and    I spoke           to

     uniformed           officer.               I told            him      I wanted              a Senior           Police       Officer           to

said,       "I       d o n ’t k n o w w h a t ' s        going          on.      1 c a n ’t h e l p               you."           I

then       went       back       and assisted                the    injured.                I put a b o u t             another             seven          or

more       labels          on    people       who       needed          urgent        hospital               treatment.                    1 also

sto pped         people          who       were    rendering             mouth        to m o u t h           to people                and

examined             the       people       and    if    they were              dead       I would            cover          them          up.

About       two       or       three minutes             after          I ha d       been      to       th e P o l i c e          control

there       were          two a m b u l a n c e s        without drivers and                        asked          him       if       he    could

find       the       drivers          for    them         so      that I c o u l d get            Jrfte s e r i o u s             cases          to

hospital             as    s o o n as       possible.              He     told me                could            do    nothing             for       me

as    he    did       not       know who          they       were.        I again            returned              to    the          gymnasium

area       and       again       started          to    treat       the       injured.              After          about          15 m i n u t e s

of a t t e n d i n g           the    injured          the     gymnasium             was     opened           up a n d        the          dead       and

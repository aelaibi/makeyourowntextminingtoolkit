                 s h o r t l y after         15.00 hours       (1500)      I became aware            that an       incident             of

I went        to all       of    the       rooms w hi ch were          being        used for       casualties and

issued majax            numbers            to    people who       had not        been documsmted.                This

H a vi n g    c hecked all            the       relevant     rooms     in A + E,           I went     to the

went     up onto        various wards               and d o c u m e n t e d    casualties          there,     but as far

as    I am aware           none       of these        patients        died.

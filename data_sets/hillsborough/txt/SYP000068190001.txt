the Terrace,

At 2 .10        p.rj/. a p p r o x i m a t e l y ,    I've        chosen my        place    to stand and w a t c h

I'm standing.               Actually,           the double--fenced                 partition       is near       to me

The      time    is now about             2.20       p.m.         There    is a sudden           surge    behind       us and

all      four    of us are          pushed down and                 left.       I remember         s h o uting

empty.          It was      only a few minutes                     later    that     there       seemed    to be

another         large     influx         of fans,         but      I c a n ’t h o n e s t l y    remember       if there

was another           surge       or not.            Anyway        by now     it was       obvious       that    too many

were      in my Section.                 I knew       that        because my feet are              off    the    ground

( I ’m 6 feet         tall       too),      and      because        I've    been turned s i d e - o n           by the

S lo w l y    but    surely,         I was       getting        carried        nearer and nearer                 to    the

drop my        programme,            and make          the    stupid mist a k e            of d r o p p i n g    to my knees

I c o u l d n ’t.        I was       trapped          underneath.          I panicked,             I thought

som e t h i n g     terrible was            going       to happen to me.                   That    did    it I s u m m o n e d

up all        the s t r ength           in my     legs,       and forced myself                  back    up b e t w e e n the

crowd.         God     that was          close and           I knew      it.     I had to get             out        of there.

I heard _____ (shout me.                       He was        on the      other       side     of the      fence        on the 4

foot     gap between the                 two     sections.           I tried         to    climb the          fence       but     I

couldn't.            I ’m t ra p p e d again.                A t, t h a t m o m e n t t h e m a n n e ;<t t o m e , w h o

was     just    impossible.              The    time       by now m u s t ’ve been about 3.15.

Eventually         I climbed         back       down.        I ’d heard           one    lad shout        that      the    bes

the     back    of the      goal,        a d ozen or more.                 I went        over    s h o r t l y after       to

see what        I could do.              It was       then       I saw     it.      Death was          on this       ground

A   lad no older           than a teenager was                    laid at my very feet,                   a jumper

covering        his    face.        My words          rang out,           "My God,           please    d o n ’t tell       me

I d i d n ’t have         time    to dwell           on    it,    as    I n o t i c e d on my other             side      that

asked     the     policeman         if    I could help             because              being honest, I d o n ’t

positive           a lot of deaths             c o u l d ’ve been avoided,              if gates and fencing

mesh     had been dealt w i t h earlier.

A man w a l k e d up to me with a bucket                         of water,        and a pile of            cups.           He

offe r e d me a drink and                 I was       glad of        it.    I knelt       down to sip the

water.         It was     the only           time     that    entire       day that       events     caught          up

with me.            I began to         cry.       A W.P.C.        i n stantly     came      over    to me       to offa

comfort.            Quick as a flash,                I stopped        crying,     stood        up and said

I was O.K.            I a sked      if    it was O.K.           to    leave    the      ground     now.        Yes    said

another        policeman.           I f i n i s h e d my drink,            gently       placed the        cup on the

pitch and           trudged      off     back     into    the    terrace.         I crossed d e a t h - r i d d e n

steps and slowly              left       the    ground.         I was m u t t e r i n g     all    the way       to

P e n is t o n e    Road where         the     coaches       waited.

I m et                            again,        an d e v e n t u a l l y   boar d e d    the    coach.         It wasn'

until      we got      to M an c h e s t e r      that we s t o p p e d at a services                and had the

chance      to      ring home.           I fina l l y     contacted my family at a p p r o x i m a t e l y

7.0 0    p.m.        T h e y ’d been frantic             wit h w or r y     for four        hours.        We    got       back

qui te qui ck 1y and             I had a ve ry emot i ona 1 reuni on wi th my                        re 1at .ives

at about 3 .00          p .m .



                                                          I ’d seen things              that    ordinary        people

like me just           don't      n o r m a l l y see     in a lifetime.

I hope       people may be able                 to u n d e r s t a n d a bit      better what           it was        like

to expe r i e n c e     that      tra u m a t i c    day.       I ’m not      trying      deliberately           to

point any fingers              speci f i c a l l y ,      although         I do think          senior     policemen

had som e t h i n g     to do w i t h          it.    We shall         see.

Go d bless and          protect          those       lads and        lasses who         died for Liv e r p o o l

F.C.     last weekend.             We     shall      never      forget      them.        Their was        the

ul t imate         sacrifice.          None     of   them will         ever walk alone.

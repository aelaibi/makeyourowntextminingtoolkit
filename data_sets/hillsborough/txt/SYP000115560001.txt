       order     and        consequently               we    parked       the       vehicle           just        off    Halifax           Road

       any    traffic           problems.              This       position          allowed          a short            r o ut e    to     all

       potential           trouble          spots       on    our       area.

       At    about        12.45       (1245)        a message            was    received              that        Liverpool           fans       were

       getting        rowdy        on H a l i f a x         Road    close       to     its         junction         with Kilner                 Way.

       My    serial        attended           and      checked          out    the     area.             Kilner         Way    is a

       shopping           precinct          and     although            what    appeared              to     be Liverpool, fans

       were     in e v i d e n c e       in    quite         large       numbers,          there           wa s    no    trouble           and    1

       would      describe            their       mood       as.boisterous.                    Situated            on K i l n e r         Way    is a

       Gateway        Supermarket              which         had    a    large       queue          iin e x c e s s        of 20)          of

       Liverpool            supporters            waiting          to    gain       entry,          there         appeared           to    be

       Supermarket              officials           restricting               access       and        I could           see    th a t      upon

       leaving        the       premises          the       football          fans     were         carrying            packs        of a l c o h o l

       which      they         were    consuming             whilst       walking          a w av.

       Hy    serial,        resumed         from Kilner             Way       and    again          parked         near       the

       Travellers              Public       House,.          We    remained          at    this          p o int    until          approx.
/r.
       2 . 5 5 p m (1455).            D u r in g this         period          thousands             of L i v e r p o o l       fans        passed

       our    poi nt       and     it wa s        remarked          upon       on    several             occasions            that        although

       time     was       running        out      to    enter       the       ground       a       large      portion          of     the       fans

       were     in    no a p p a r e n t       hurry         to    get    there        and         in fact         many       were        walking

       away     from       the     ground         as    late as          2.40pm        (1440).               I would          estimate           that

       it w o u l d       take     a maximum            of    10 m i n u t e s       to    walk          to H i l l s b o r o u g h        from

       o u r p o in t .

       During        our       time    at     this      observation             point          a    l a rge       proportion              of    the

       fans     oId       e nough      t o d r i n k , we r e pass i ng                our         po i nt    car r y i n g        a 1 c o h o 1 in

       the    form        of    bottles        and      cans       which       they       were        consuming            whilst          walking

       towards        the       ground.           There       was       obviously          a       lot     of a l c o h o l        being
consumed       in the         short     distance       prior       to entering         the footbail

ground.        At    no time         did    I see a fan           I would        describe as        drunk.

Traf f i c    c o nditions        on the day          in and a r o u n d         the mai n      road     1 would

consider       to be        normal      for a s e mi-final              day and there           were     no major

h old-ups      in our         section.        By approx.           2.20pm        (1420)    the     traffic         flow

appeared       normal         for a S a t u r d a y but          sometime        just after 2 . 3 0 p m            (1430).

I saw 2 coaches               full     of L i verpool        suppo r t e r s      arrive what           I consider

to be     late.        These      appeared          to be the          last   of the trave l l i n g

s u p porters.

At a r o u n d 2 . 3 5 p m     (1435)       it a p p e a r e d    from the        radio    traffic         that there

was    some    sort      of    problem a t the Lep p i n g s Lane                  end of the           ground,,      and

co n s e q u e n t l y my serial           attended      there.          Upo n    reaching        the    location at

ar o u n d 3pm .(1500)           I saw a large number                   of supporters           outside       the

turn s t i l e s    o b v i o u s l y wai t i n g    to get       in the      ground.        At    this      time

an d from my o b s e r v a t i o n s          there    did       not    seem any major            problem.           At

this    time       I saw      Inspector R o b i n s o n who was walking awa y from Leppings

Lane and he          i n s t r u c t e d my serial         to     resume mobile           patrol        in the area.

actual       location.          Howe v e r     in the      next        few minutes        it was        obvious       that

there was a major                problem and that a m b u l a n c e s              and fire        engines were

requi'ririq urgent access                   to the     ground?         my serial       therefore           closed

Hali f a x    Road     to     thro u g h    traffic      by turning           it away from the              football

ground a l l o w i n g as much              free access          as     possible.         The     time was         now

around 3.20pm            (1520)        and Liverpool             fans were walking              back     up Halifax

Road    to their         transport.           They were          very abusive and at times we were

            'Superintendent                 Bates          asked    my    serial        to      keep any             unauthorised             persons

END   OF   REPORT
               A/
» PS. 1075 HALLBROCR.



 I am a Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police and am currently employed in the
 Police Driving School.

 On Saturday the 15th April 1989, in company with 5 PC's which were to make up my
 serial, I attended Hillsborough Football Ground for pre-match briefing in
 relation to the semi-final which was being played between Liverpool and
 Nottingham Forest.

 The briefing ccranenced at 10am and was carried out by Chief Superintendent
 Duckenfield and other Senior Officers. The serial I was in charge of was
 numbered 50. Call sign Tango 5 and its duties were mobile patrol on the Parson
 Cross area. The Officer in charge of this and two other serials was Inspector
 Robinson.

 At 10.20 am the same date after collecting a radio and packed meal we were
 issued with a Freight Rover Van Registered Number D646 OWE in which we
 immediately checked the whole area, including public houses prior to mealing in
 the vehicle on Kilner Way which is situated off Halifax Road.

 Following the meal my serial drove around the Public Houses, but found no
 potential trouble spots although the Five Arches Public House off Herries Road
 was full to overflowing with Nottingham Forest fans. At this Public House and
 the White Horse Public House off Halifax Road other Police Officers were in
 attendance to maintain order and consequently we parked the vehicle just off
 Halifax Road close to the Travellers Public House (Closed) to monitor the fans
 and any traffic problems. This position allowed a short route to all potential
 trouble spots on our area.

 At about 12.45 a message was received that Liverpool fans were getting rowdy on
 Halifax Road close to its junction with Kilner Way. My serial attended and
 checked out the^ area. Kilner Way is a shopping precinct and although what
 appeared to be Liverpool fans were in evidence in quite large numbers, there was
 no trouble and I would describe their mood as boisterous. Situated on Kilner Way
 is a Gateway Supermarket which had a large queue (in excess of 20) of Liverpool
 supporters waiting to gain entry, there appeared to be Supermarket officials
 restricting access and I could see that upon leaving the premises the football
 fans were carrying packs of alcohol which they were consuming whilst walking
 away.

My serial resumed from Kilner Way and again parked near the Travellers Public
House. We remained at this point until approx 2.55 pm. During this period
thousands of Liverpool fans passed our point and it was remarked upon on several
occasions that although time was running out to enter the ground a large portion
of the fans were in no apparent hurry to get there and in fact many were walking
away from the ground as late as 2.40 pm. I would estimate that it would take a
maximum of 10 minutes to walk to Hillsborough from our point.

During our time at this observation point a large proportion of the fans old
enough to drink, were passing our point carrying alcohol in the form of bottles
and cans which they were consuming whilst walking towards the ground. There was
obviously a lot of alcohol being consumed in the short distance prior to
entering the football ground. At no time did I see a fan I would describe as
drunk.

Traffic conditions on the day in and around the main road I would consider to be
normal for a semi-final day and there were no major holdups in our section. By
approx 2.20 pn the traffic flow appeared normal for a Saturday but sometime just
after 2.30 pm I saw 2 coaches full of Liverpool Supporters arrive what I
consider to be late. These appeared to be the last of the travelling supporters.
At around 2.55 pm it appeared from the radio traffic that there was some sort of
problem at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, and consequently my serial
attended there. Upon reaching the location at around 3 pm, I saw a large number
of supporters outside the turnstiles obviously waiting to get in the ground. At
this time there were a large amount of Police Officers on foot in attendance and
from my observations there did not seem any major problem. At this time I saw
Inspector Robinson who was walking away from Leppings Lane and he instructed my
serial to resume mobile patrol in the area.

We resumed patrol and although there was a lot of traffic on the radio we did
not realise either the extent of the disaster or the actual location. However in
the next few minutes it was obvious that there was a major problem and that
ambulances and fire engines were requiring urgent access to the ground, my
serial therefore closed Halifax Road to through traffic by turning it away from
the football ground allowing as much free access as possible. The time was now
around 3.20 pm and Liverpool fans were walking back up Halifax Road to their
transport. They were very abusive and at times we were called murderers. We
could not understand at this stage their reactions.

After conjestion had eased at approximately 3.45 I took my serial to the main
entrance of Hillsborough which is situated on Penistone Road, we assisted with
ambulance traffic and one member of my serial went to hospital with some
injured. At around 4.10pm I was instructed to attend the gymnasium at
Hillsborough and report to Superintendent Bates who would give further
instructions. Superintendent Bates asked my serial to keep any unauthorised
persons out of the area. A member of my serial 'Policed' the entrance door and
the remainder assisted outside the gym area whenever needed. These duties
included assisting in the movement of injured persons and cardoning off the
entrance. During this time many irrate Liverpool fans were remonstrating with
Police Officers in a manner which was understandable but difficult to control.

At 4.40 Sergeant Glossop informed me that 20 men were required for an unknown
task. They were selected and mustered in the 'quiet' end of the gymnasium, where
we stood by until 5.05 pm. This task, which was apparently to help remove the
dead bodies from the stand,never materialised and my serial minus the officer at
the hospital and the one on the gym entrance door were told to go to the seating
area in the North Stand on reserve.

After I had completed a briefing sheet and handed it to Chief Inspector Beal at
6.05 pm we were told to stand down. My serial minus the 2 Officers who were
accounted for left Claywheels Lane after handing in radio and vehicle keys.

From the start of the problems at appoximately 3 pm it was around 4.10 before I
was aware of the scale. The circumstances and exact location of the crushers
were unknown to my serial until after 4.40.

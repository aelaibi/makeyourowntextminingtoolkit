HILLSBOROUGH LEGAL BILL


You copied to Mr Fuller your note of 10 July to Mr Turney to see
if the College could help you out with this £37k.      Mrs Smith
subsequently wrote to the Commandant on 18 July about the matter
too.

I understand that you have now paid the £37k bill from monies
intended for other things and so the immediate pressure is off.
Obviously, however, you are now that amount short overall this
year.    I do not think that the College can help you out
immediately with this since, as you know we have had to draw our
own contingency plan to make savings of £743k in the event that
our supplementary estimate bid is rejected by the Treasury.
However, depending upon the outcome of that bid and how we get
on generally expenditure wise as the year progresses we may be
able to help out later. We will therefore keep the matter under
review and, if you do need help later, we will see what we can
do.

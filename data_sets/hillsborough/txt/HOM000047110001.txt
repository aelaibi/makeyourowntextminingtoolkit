Dear Mr Bone

Please find attached unsolicited correspondence to the Chief Constable from;




Each letter is pertinent to the scrutiny to be carried out by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. Some
of the correspondents suggest that they have fresh evidence to offer.                   I have
acknowledged each letter using the same format (a specimen letter is attached). In
response to my replies, I have received further letters from two of the correspondents
(attached).

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has asked that “fresh evidence” be forwarded to him. Rather
than pre-judge whether these letters offer fresh evidence, I forward them to you to deal with
as you think fit.

I would be grateful if you could acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

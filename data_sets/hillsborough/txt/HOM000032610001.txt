Hillsborough Publication of Evidence

I refer to your letter of 9 February 1998toJhe jghi^jConstable. He and I have discusseti
the contents and he is happy for une to m akefiisll^onse^on his behalf

I have consulted our legal advisers and noneofthem see' any legal reason to withhold any’
of the documents to which you refer The Chief Constable is, therefore, content for copies
of the following documents to be placed in the House of Commons Library:

a)    the report by Mr Noel Burne,

b)    the report by Mr David Phillips,

c)    the operational orders for the 1988 and 1989 semi-finals,

d)    the video tapes TB1,2, 3 and 4.

As you say, the video tape VRM2 should not be made publicly available.

One group of document* to which you refercause me some concern;tfie statements made
by South Yorkshire Police officers. Individual oncers penned their own recollections of the
events leading up to and after the disaster |Meny were written whilst officers were still
traumatised by the events and some contain strong language and emotional outbursts.
That language may well cause unnecessary offence to the people to whom it refers. Sbrrie
of the officers are still serving, some have retired and some are deceased. A few of them
may be unnecessarily embarrassed, nearly ten years after the event, if their words were
made public and perhaps selectively quoted in the press in a sensational manner.

Dear

Thank you for your recent letters to Mrs Thatcher and
Mr Moynihan which have been passed to this department in view
of our responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.
I apologise for the delay in replying to you.

You expressed concern that if football stadia provided seated
accommodation only, the resulting capacity reductions would
result in many stadia not being large enough to accommodate
all who wish to attend certain matches. However, Lord Justice
Taylor points out, in his Pinal Report on the Hillsborough
Stadium disaster, that of all the teams in Divisions One and
Two of the Football League in the 1988/89 season only at
Liverpool did the average attendance exceed the projected all
seated capacity of the ground. In fact, at 21 of these 44
clubs the projected all seated capacity was not exceeded at
all throughout the season. Consequently the problem of over
demand for tickets may not be as serious a problem as you
envisage.

Lord Justice Taylor also commented that it should be possible
for clubs to plan price structure which suits the cheapest
seats to the pockets of those presently paying to stand. He
pointed to Ibrox where seating is £6 and standing is £4, which
he did not consider to be a prohibitive price or differential.
Therefore, the fears of many spectators that they may no
longer be ablie to afford to attend football matches may be
unnecessary.
        As you are probably aware Lord Justice Taylor also criticised
        many clubs for the standard of sanitation and refreshments and
        urged them to improve both.
                                       Yours sincerely




                                       MR S BILBE

DO. 2
                                           2.6th June 1990



                       I    feel    th$    need   to write       to you
concerning      the   Governments      plans to     turn all football
stadiums into all-seaters.
    I feel that the       people    who are best educated to deal
with this problem are the football             fans    themselves.    We 1
are   the    people who go to matches every week and we know
what the best solutions are.
    The    inevitable     price     increases       that     all-seater
stadiums would cause        will    result     in working class and
young people (like myself) not being able               to afford     to
go   to    many,    if any     matches.
    For    myself    the   increased     prices on top of the huge
travel     expenses would      be a total cost too high to meet.
     Middle     aged   and    older people      who watch      football
regularly     now are      people who started watching football
when    they were young.        By    increasing     prices    you are
preventing young people         from    watching     games now and so
cutting the support for the future.
    In the past when grounds          have become all-seaters like
at   Coventry the fans damaged the            seats.    At   the   match
this season      between    Leicester City and Stoke City there
were so many Stoke        City fans that some people who wished
to stand had to sit.        So these people paid for a seat but
stood up anyway. This then prevented             people behind those
standing     from    seeing.    This incident could have started
trouble.
    Although the capacity of          grounds    will    be decreased
this will not normally be a problem because the increased
prices     will    lead to lower attendances anyway. This will
lead    to   people    saving    up just for the big games which
will lead to demand        for tickets greatly exceeding supply.
    The    knock-on    effect of this       will    be   thousands    of
people      without    tickets     causing     crushes     outside   the
grounds.     This    was   one     of    the    main    causes    of the
Hillsborough disaster and, as I have             just explained      all
seater     stadia    would    only    make    such an incident more
likely, or worse.
    The Hillsborough disaster would never have               happened if
fans were not allowed to board coaches without tickets.
    Instead     of   just   pointing out the        problems     in the
Governments      plans I am     also going to attempt to provide
some better ideas.
    Close circuit television is a good idea to punish only
the people who behave badly.           These    cameras     can also be
used     to   monitor     the   number     of   people.
   Instead of enforcing all-seater stadia you should           set
standards for the following areas at grounds.

Catering
              There    should   be  standards  set  in both
quality and  value   for  money.   Hygiene  should  also be
monitored.  Some   counters   are  unclean  and prices very
expensive.

Sanitation                                             *
                Terraces  should   be  clean without loose
stones orlitter. Toilets  should have wide entrances and
should be kept clean and large enough to accommodate large
numbers  of people. Again some   grounds  have  small  and
dirty toilets.

Prices
            These   should  be    kept  to a minimum    to
encourage young   fans  and to   prevent our national game
from fading into insignificance.

Policing
              Police should keep a low profile     so as not
to worry   or   provoke  a n y fans. Police should   try  to
promote a light enjoyable atmosphere.

   I hope this letter will        not   have   gone   to waste and
will help football.

                       I    feel    the   nafed to wyite         to you
concerning      the   Governments      plansvto    turn all football
stadiums into all-seaters.                             /
    I feel that the       people    who are best eaucated to deal
with this problem are the football            fans    themselves.     We 1
are   the    people who go to matches every week and we know
what the best solutions are.
    The    inevitable     price     increases      that      all-seater
stadiums would cause        will    result    in working class and
young people (like myself) not being able               to afford     to
go   to many,       if any matches.
    For    myself    the   increased     prices on top of the huge
travel     expenses would      be a total cost too high to meet.
     Middle     aged   and    older people     who watch       football
regularly     now are      people who started watching football
when    they were young.        By    increasing    prices     you are
preventing young people         from    watching    games now and so
cutting the support for the future.
    In the past when grounds          have become all-seaters like
at   Coventry the fans damaged the           seats.     At   the   match
this season      between    Leicester City and Stoke City there
were so m an y Stoke      City fans that some people who wished
to stand had to sit.        So these people paid for a seat but
stood up anyway. This then prevented            people behind those
standing     from    seeing.    This incident could have started
trouble.
    Although the capaci ty of         grounds   will     be decreased
this will not normally be a problem because the increased
prices     will    lead to lower attendances anyway. This will
lead    to   people    saving    up just for the big games which
will lead to demand        for tickets greatly exceeding supply.
    The    knock-on    effect of this      will    be    thousands    of

likely, or worse.
    The Hillsborough disaster would never have               happened if

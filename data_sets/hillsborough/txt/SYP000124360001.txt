 THE PERIMETER FENCE TELLING PEOPLE TO GET BACK,       IN FACT HE APPEARED TO BE

 DIRECTING IT^POWARD US,      BUT WE COULDN'T GO ANYWHERE, AS          BACKS WERE

 AGAINST T * f WALL.   AS I STOOD AT THE BACK I A S S I S T E D ^ *   PEOPLE UP !NTO

 THE STAND, THEN I REMEMBER 2 OR 3 POLICEMEN THAT HAD COME DOWN THE          TUNNEL

 TELLING US TO GET     OUT SO I DID.   IWALKED BACK ALONG THE TUNNEL AND     THROUGH THE

 NOW OPEN GATE TO GET THROUGH TO THE SIDE TERRACING, WHERE I REMAINED FOR ONLY

 A FEW MINUTES, WHEN I REALISED WHAT HAD HAPPENED,         I LEFT.

 054

 I ^ p ’HERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IF THE GATE IN THE DIVIDING WALL, THAT IS THE WALL BETWEEN THE COURTYARDS

 SEPARATING THE STANDING TURNSTILES AND THE WEST STAND TURNSTILES WAS OPEN,

 THEN I FOR ONE WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH IT INTO THE SIDE TERRACING, AS I DID

 LAST YEAR, HAVING     BEEN TOLD TO DO SO BY A POLICE O R H ^ E R STANDING AT THE           cf

 ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL.      I FEEL THAT EITHER P Q W E    OR STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL TO DIRECT PEOPLE INTO THE SIDE TERRACING,

 STATING THAT THE AREA BEHIND THE GOAL M E FULL, LAST YEAR THE TWO POLICE

 OFFICERS THAT WERE THERE WERE JUST TELLING PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PUSH

 ANYONE BACK.

       «



Q17

 Q49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS * OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 ONLY THE EXTREME CRUSHING OF PEOPLE IN THE PENS.      THE BARRIERS POSSIBLY CAUSED

 INJURIES TO SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE AT ONE TIME I CAME UP TO A BARRIER AND FELT

 MYSELF BEING PUSHED HARD ONTO IT.      I MANAGED TO GET UNDER IT.

 Q50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVER THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ^ O U T 4.15 <1615) TO 4.30PM <1630)

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OF MY OWN ACCORD.


Q 18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

^p3

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS A SMALL GATE AT THE FRONT OF THE PEN. ALTHOUGH IT WAS OPENED BY THE

 POLICE, HARDLY ANYONE COULD GET    THROUGH IT BECAUSE THEY WERE SO    TIGHTLY

 CRUSHED TOGETHER. LATER, POLICE    AND FANS PULLED A SECTION OF THE FRONT

 FENCING DOWN WHICH HELPED FANS TO GET OUT A LOT     MORE EASILY. IF   THEY HAD DONE

 THIS EARLIER I THINK THAT LIVES    WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED.

 Q54

 IS    THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARRIVED LATE BECAUSE OF HOLD-UPS ON THE MOTORWAY - I DON'

 THINK THAT DRUNKENESS WAS A FACTOR,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 TO HELP.         THERE WAS A LACK OF PROPER MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.   I DIDNT SEE ANY

 OXYGEN CYLINDERS AT ALL.         ADVERTISING HOARDINGS HAD TO BE USED AS MAKESHIFT

 9)     BETTER MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, NOT SUFFICIENT ON THE DAY.

 10) MORE CONSIDERATION AS TO THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS MUST BE INCORPORATED

 IN THE PLANS,

 THAT THEY CAN BE CLOSED OFF, AND CAN BE CONTROLLED AS TO HOW MANY ENTER THE

 PENS.

 GROUND AT 2.45 (1445) AND IF YOU ARE NOT THEN YOU SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED INTO

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON J&E WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1.     THE POLICE WOULD NOT OPEN THE X ATES DESPITE DESPERATE PLEAS FROM THOSE

 TRAPPED IN PENS 3 AND FOUR.THEy/SHOULD HAVE OPENED THESE GATES EARLIER.

 2.     APART FROM THAT I THOUGH ^L AT ER DID A GOOD JOB.


<3®

 <354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.      THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE OVERCROWDING IN PENS 3 AND 4.

 AND SHOULD HAVE CLOSED OR CORDONED OFF THE TUNNEL, SO PREVENTING

 FURTHER CROWDING OUT.

 2.      IF   PENS ARE USED THEY SHOULD BE FLEXIBLE            AND HAVE OPENINGS TO ALLOW

 THE CROWD TO DISPERSE SIDEWAYS.
                              /
      THE POLICING OUTSIDE jf^E GROUND WAS VERY POOR, THE POLICE PRESSURE

 WAS     INSUFFICIENT.

 4.      LAST YEAR THEY STEPPED PEOPLE 50YDS FROM THE GROUND AND CHECKED

 WHO HAD      TICKETS.   W I S YEAR THEY DID NOT AND           I KNOW OF PEOPLE WHO

 BECAUSE      OF THIS WERE ABLE TO GAIN ENTRY SO WORSENING THE PROBLEMS.

 THE POLICE SEEMED MORE CONCERNED WITH CROWD TROUBLE.       THERE WAS A CORDON ON

 THE HALF WAY LINE.    A LOT OF OFFICERS JUST JSnOOD AROUND DOING NOTHING

 CONSTRUCTIVE.    AMBULANCES TOOK A LOWS TPI^E TO ARRIVE THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK

      'CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN THE SERVICES BUT THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE LACKING

 MOST.

 BADLY INJURED PEOPLE LYING AROUND UNATTENDED.

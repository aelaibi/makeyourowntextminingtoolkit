    DOUGLAS ROSEVEAR - POLICE CONSTABLE 808
    OPERATIONS DIVISION, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE



    I was appointed Football Liaison Officer/Force Football and Major Events
    Manpower Officer on 10 February 1986.

    My role in relation to football fixtures is in essence two fold, ie 'Home'
    Liaison Officer and 'Away' Liaison Officer.

    My duties as Away Liaison Officer are irrelevant to this inquiry and I will
    set out my duties as Home Liaison Officer only. Approximately three weeks
    before the fixture I send a letter to the away Football Liaison Officer which
    sets out the route to be followed, rendezvous point for coach escort, parking
    facilities available for coaches, transit vans and private cars, details of
    suggested arrival times, ground regulations and other matters.

    For the Semi-Final a letter was prepared by me, signed by my ACC (Operations)
    Mr Jackson, and sent to the Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, Sir Kenneth
    Oxford on 29 March 1989, asking that details as above were given the widest
    possible circulation within the Merseyside area. A copy of this letter was
    also sent to my counterpart in Merseyside, Inspector J Clow for his
    information and attention. I also sent similar letters to the editor of
    Liverpool's hone programmes for the inclusion of my directions and
    instructions in the programme for 8 April 1989 at Anfield (Liverpool v SWFC).
    The letter asked that all vehicular traffic should approach Sheffield via
    the Ml motorway leaving at Junction 36. It then set out parking arrangements.
    All supporters were asked to time their journeys to arrive at Sheffield
    between 1030 and 1400 hours to ensure that they were in the ground for kick
    off at 1500 hours. It informed them that gates would be open from 1100 hours.
    It reminded fans that this was an all ticket fixture and that fans without
    tickets should not attend. Similar letters were sent to Nottinghamshire.

    Liaison is established and maintained with British Rail regarding special
    trains, arrival and departure times, estimated number travelling. Liaison
    with West Bar Sub-Division in order that special buses can be provided to
    carry supporters from Sheffield Midland Railway Station.

    I am responsible for the collation of information regarding home games by
    way of 1football match summary reports1. I have summaries for each time
    Liverpool have visited Sheffield since 1986. Summaries prior to this have
    been destroyed but a record written by a predecessor shows that their
    attendance on 17 January 1984 consisted of 4000 fans of 'good behaviour',
    'no problems', 'no arrests'. All other records in my possession show that
    each time Liverpool have visited Sheffield since 27 December 1986 they have
    been of good behaviour with no policing problems encountered. This includes
    the 1988 Semi-Final at Hillsborough.

    On Wednesday, 22 March 1989, I attended a meeting chaired by Chief
    Superintendent Mole where the responsibility for gathering match information
                                                                         I   S ( i -

and intelligence was deputed to Detective Sergeant Charlesworth, F Division,
and myself. It has become customary for DS Charlesworth to gather
intelligence regarding matches and myself information by which I mean coaches,
trains, transit vans, numbers travelling, any known groups of troublemakers,
behaviour at other fixtures etc. Our roles obviously intertwine and DS
Charlesworth and myself worked in very close liaison, myself passing to him
any information coming my way. I have a file on each club in which I keep
any previous information and the only information I have on Liverpool, except
as previously stated, is a copy of a football intelligence bulletin prepared
by the Metropolitan Police, undated but I presume post 9 November 1988 and
pre Christmas 1988 because it wishes a happy Christmas and a peaceful new
year at the end of it. That bulletin has a small article headed 'Arsenal
Lockout'. It reads 'Wednesday 9 November 1988 Arsenal v Liverpool, saw a
lock out of some 6000 supporters, good policing on the night prevented any
serious disorder developing outside the ground and positive action inside
(92 ejectments) ensured crowd behaviour was kept under control'. A copy of
the whole bulletin was forwarded to DS Douthewaite, Force Operations
Intelligence Unit (Football/Public Order) for circulation in accordance with
previous practice.

I have been informed by DS Douthewaite that he has sent DS Charlesworth a
copy. As far as I can remember Inspector Clow (the Liverpool FLO) was absent
from duty for the two weeks prior to the Semi-Final and on the two or three
occasions   I contacted his office about both the Semi-Final and their hone
fixture with Sheffield Wednesday on 8 April 1989    I spoke to a sergeant whose
name I believe to be Banner. The only information supplied to me was details
of names of coaches, 71 in total. This is quite usual and no other
information is really expected regarding Liverpool. I had the train times
and anticipated number on them from British Rail) behaviour patterns from
previous experiences. The gathering of more in depth intelligence is the
responsibility of DS Charlesworth. Whenever I have asked Liverpool Football
Liaison about the behaviour of their fans I have been told that they are well
behaved and previous experience has shown this to be true. I have never been
told otherwise by anyone.

I similarly liaised with PS Sydney at Nottinghamshire and received similar
details. Once again in-depth intelligence is left to DS Charlesworth.

All information obtained by me was passed to DS Charlesworth and Inspector
Sewell who also has responsibilities regarding football. West Bar are also
informed and the Motorcycle Wing.

Dear Sir

 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

 I thank you for your letter of 16 August concerning the above topic,
 it has been passed to Senior Members of my Authority for their
 consideration.

In the interim I believe it is appropriate that I take this opportunity
of drawing your attention to the concern that Members of my Authority
have regarding certain statements made by the letter of your Authority
on the issue of the responsibility of Members of the City Council
in either their capacity as Members of the Authority or as members
of the Police Authority and that they would welcome clarification
of such statements.    Further, they would also like to know whether
it is being suggested that the official position of your Authority
is that such Members should resign as a result of the recent decision
to allow the Chief Constable to remain in post.

In addition, my Members are also very concerned at the tenor and content
of a recent article in the Municipal Journal prepared by an officer
of your Authority (copy enclosed) and again I have been asked to obtain
clarification as to whether the comments expressed in such article
are those of the Authority as such article has caused considerable
offence to both officers and Members of the City Council.

I look forward to receiving clarification of these issues shortly.

Yours faithfully




MARK WEBSTER

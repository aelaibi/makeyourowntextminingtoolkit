 Dear Ian
 Hillsborough
 I have received correspondence from Ann Adlington asking for my comments with regard
 to some disagreement that is evidently taking place about the production of documents.
 Obviously the majority of this has nothing to do with the coroner and I intend to simply
 restate the basic position that I have maintained since my appointment in late 1991;
 • the coroner is provided with papers for the purpose of his investigation. Such papers
   are often generated for several different purposes as was indeed the case here. Blair
   Peach remains good law (see the recent case of Lincolnshire Coroner ex parte Hay)
   and thus the documents do not belong to the coroner. Thus the coroner has no right to
   distribute these documents freely. Different considerations may apply if the documents
   were made primarily for the coroner’s investigation, but that is not the case here.
 • however the coroner is, by statue, obliged to provide properly interested persons with a
   document specified in Rule 57 of the Coroner’s Rules 1984. In a spirit of openness I
   tend to interpret Rule 57 relatively generously.
However, I have been shown a copy of your witness statement dated the 18th May and I am
a little puzzled by a line in the second paragraph which refers to documents in the archive
“generated by the 1991 inquest (and held on behalf of the coroner)”.
My own understanding is that all of the coroner’s documents relating to the inquest are held
either at this office or in our own archive. It may very well be that the coroner dealt with
copies of particular documents at the inquest and that the originals are still held by you and I
wonder whether that is in fact what your statement means.


                                         Fax: (0114) 272-6247
                                                                                     CMJ7818A.DOC
One should not let confusion arise because the South Yorkshire Police have been kind
enough to provide copies of documents to relatives on our behalf. This was a practical
measure because you had the facilities to deal with large scale copying and numerous
requests whereas we did not. But all that was in effect happening was that you were using
your copies of “our documents” to provide copies on my behalf.
It would be helpful to clarify this before I reply to Ann Adlington. I understand that you return
to the office on Monday 21st I am actually on leave that week but I am down in Oxford and
your secretary has my pager number. I am more than happy for you to telephone me if
anything needs to be clarified prior to your reply.
Kind regards.

Dear Ian
                                                              Hillsborough Documentation

Thank you for vour fax received todav.

As you probably know R.57 Coroners Rules 1984 provides that on receipt of a request from a
person appearing to have an interest the Coroner is required to provide a copy of (inter alia) any
notes of evidence taken and any document put in evidence at an inquest.

R.38 provides that documents exhibited should be marked with ‘C’ numbers and it is my view that
the fact that these documents are so marked is prima facie evidence that they fall within R.57. I do
not therefore recommend making any representations to the Coroner on this point.

As to the question of Public Interest Immunity (PII), it is difficult to see how this could be relevant.
Until the case of Wiley - v - W Midlands Police it was usual practice to claim PII for statements
taken in the course of a S.85 inquiry. This practice was approved by the courts in the earlier
decisions of Neilson - v - Laugharne and Hehir - v - Metropolitan Police. The basis of the immunity

was that witnesses would only cooperate in an inquiry into police misconduct if they            were
guaranteed that their statements would not be used for any other purpose.

That doctrine was swept away by Wiley and the rule now is that there is no PII in such statements. In
my view it would in any event have been doubtful whether it applied to the documents now under
consideration because of the uncertainty as to whether these documents came into existence as part
of a S.85 inquiry.

As to the Coroner’s more general points there is no rule that the Police cannot claim PII where
appropriate: in Goodwill - v - Lancashire Police an officer injured in training sought discovery of
relevant extracts from the Public Order Manual. This was resisted and the Court of Appeal held that
there was a legitimate public interest in the Manual remaining confidential because of the danger of
criminals obtaining details of police tactics.

In a case in a lower court last year I was successful in maintaining a claim for PII in respect of
guidelines for the use of CS spray, for the same reasons as in the Goodwill case. This achievement
was undermined when (as I understand it) an MP placed a copy of the guidelines in the House of
Commons library but at least it shows that the courts are alive to the issue of PII.

However from the description of the two documents referred to by the Coroner Icannot see how
they can possibly fall into the PII category' and unless you would like me to look through them to
double check I would be inclined to respond indicating that you have no PII claim to put forward in
this case. If you would like me to draft a letter please let me know.

Turning to the prosecutions, I understand that George Croston had nearly completed his review when
he received 60 further pages of submissions from the HFSG. He felt obliged to allow the
Defendants’ advisers the opportunity to comment on these but I believe this has now been done and I
assume that the review* is either complete or very near completion.

However, it seems unlikely that the decision of the DPP will be known by 31 October when the
matter is next due in court.

                                          Yours sincerely,

 Dear Mr Dorries

 H illsborough D ocum entation

 As you may know I have been advising the Chief Constable in relation to documentation issues
 arising out of the private prosecutions raised against retired senior officers by the Hillsborough
 Family Support Group.

 Again, as you know, these matters are being dealt with at South Yorkshire Police by the Assistant
 Chief Constable, Ian Daines. He has asked me to respond to your letter of 30 September 1998
 relating to documentation.

 I agree with your provisional view that Rule 57 does apply to documents exhibited as C349 and
 C350.

  Turning to the question of public interest immunity the South Yorkshire Police do not wish to assert
  that such immunity applies to these documents.

  Before the House of Lords decision in the case of R -v- West Midlands Police Ex Parte Wylie
  [1995] 1AC274 it might well have been argued that these documents were effectively statements
  taken in the course of an enquiry into a complaint against the Police. However, the doctrine that
  public interest immunity applied to such statements was abolished by the Wylie decision and I see no
  other grounds upon which public interest immunity could apply.

  As to the general query which you raise about the authority of a Police Force to claim public interest
  immunity, this appears to be covered by the decision of O'Sullivan -v- Commissi oner o f Police o f
  the Metropolis - The Times July 3 1995 where Butterfield J ruled specifically that such a claim could
  properly be raised by “a responsible official within the Police Force.”

That case related to a report prepared by a police officer for consideration by the Crown Prosecution
Service. A claim for public interest immunity has also been upheld by the Court of Appeal in
relation to the Public Order Manual in the case of Goodwill -v- Chief Constable o f Lancashire
Constabulary.

I hope that this is helpful but if I can assist with anything further please let me know.

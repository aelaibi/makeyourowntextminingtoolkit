    represent collectively tho interests of relatives

    for which you are responsible*

    Although Stuart appears to have sent you a copy of
    this letter it nay cake little sense to you without

 >ear Sharp

     Thank you for your letter of 13th January about legal
representation, for people affected by the Ibrox disaotor, at
the forthcoming inquiry*

     I agree that it in not desirable for a large number of persons
to be individually represented at thia inquiry and that a more
osnsible solution would be to employ Senior and Junior Counsel and
one Solicitor to act jointly for all those concerned, the cost being
aet on an ex gratia basis from Government funds*

      In the Aberfan inquiry similar expenditure was borne on the
Law Charges Vote and I suggest that, in the present circumstances,
tho    vt Charges and Jourts of Law, cotland Vote, Class III, Ik,
r.ould ~>e th#e appropriate resting place i‘or* any expenditure incurred.
I am therefore sending a copy of this letter to FcTavish.

                           Yours sincerely,




                           (tf. P. H* STUART)

    Dear Stuart

    IBHOX       ■>

    As you may know, the Lord Advocate has arranged for an inquiry to bo hold into t*...
    circumstances in which over oO people died at Ibrox on 2 January,
    be held under the Fatal Accidents Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1895 as amended by the
    Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1906 and will be conciuo ,
    by the Sheriff Principal of Lanarkshire, Sir Allan Walker QC.   A date for the
    inquiry has not yet been fixed but it is expected to.be held next month.
                                             \


    The Law Society of Scotland, who are responsible for the day to day ciCuiiXiiJ-G'CjTCv'**T: .
    the legal aid scheme have expressed concern to the Department about the po^oibil;
    that a fairly large number of people affected by the disaster, particularly of
    course the relatives of the deceased, will seek legal aid for the purpose of I ..:',
    legally represented at the inquiry.   There is no statutory provision which wo..'
    enable a person, at the expense of the Legal Aid Fund, to employ counsel or g o ..:
    for the purpose of leading evidence or cross-examining witnesses at such an ii.             .
    but there is no reason why a person should not obtain legal advice in connectic;-.
    with this matter under section 7 of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 196?; and it
    also be competent for a person who was eligible on financial grounds to obtain
    section 5 of the Act a legal aid certificate which would at least enable hlo o-
    to attend the inquiry on his behalf, take notes of the proceedings and subsoqc .
    obtain a copy of the notes of evidence, perhaps with a view to instituting civ."
    proceedings at a later stage.

    The Legal Aid Committee in Glasgow are concerned that, unless some co-ordin,.>.t: •.,
    action is taken by the Law Society - and taken fairly quickly - there is a &c.r:Uv
    risk of perhaps 100 individuals receiving legal aid in one form or another fro..:
    separate solicitors (mainly in Glasgow) at the expense of the Legal Aid Fund,
    consider that, apart from considerations of cost, this is undesirable in priac:^
    and they have submitted for consideration by the Legal Aid Central Committee or
    Law Society a proposal that Senior and Junior Counsel and one Solicitor should V,
    appointed to appear at the inquiry on behalf of all those conccrned who wish to .
    collectively represented.    Individual applications for legal aid would bu hcl-'.
    abeyance pending- the outcome of the inquiry.   Instructions to thio c.-ffecc vo”.:..-*
    given to all legal aid committees in Scotland^ ftfie action taken would be V ;
                                                                                 --L
    This proposal is due to be considered by the Central Committee at a meeting vc
    held on 18 January; and the Department has been asked for its observations.
TJ.        ^                                    sztxs'JJe
lu seems to us here that this is an eminentk&olution to a rather difficult
proolem.     Apart from questions of cost - and it is difficult at this juncture
         orff^ m ,®6t,
                     lmate of      cost of employing counsel and one solicitor during
             m       i              proposal has these advantages, that it would
fn S o ^      ie WOr °        ln<*uiry if the interests of relatives and others concerned
                   u?re re:reS6nted collectively in this way; and that it would
   u the inevitable criticism that the interests of relatives of the deceased
                       ^    fvCt that leEal aid is not mailable for the employment of
    unoel at the inquiry.    /ou may recall that,before the inquiry held into the
   oerian disaster, it was announced that all reasonable costs incurred by nersons
'i         r       rePresente(i collectively at the inquiry would be met from oublic
 '~u s\    * do not suGgest than; the circumstances in the present case are in*all
reapecte the same; but the Secretary of State would undoubtedly be exposed to
criticism it no positive effort were made to ensure that those persons who wished
,o oe legally represented at the inquiry could be so represented irrespective
Oi means.                                                                r


f     thes° reasons 1 h°Pe that you would feel able, in the exceptional circumstances,
to approve an arrangement of this kind.      It would, in our view, be impracticable
ana undesirable to restrict this offer of collective legal representation to ucroo^c-
 ' ° nf *pplied r & ° f , Were ellSible for legal aid.   It would cost no more to
        * * icover/*f J*11 Persons affected by the disaster who wished to be represented
- I ? T ~ y; *              8X0 strons moral arguments in favour of the proposition.
            ™ ms ™ ef? h°wevef ’ U would seem inappropriate that the cost‘of enralovinr
   un?®J f ldKa 80licitor snould be met from the Legal Aid (Scotland) Fund and I*should
    8      r ha\e y°UI* ™   S ™ the possibility of such expenses being met direct
ivOm whe Consolidated Fund or carried on some other 1/ote.

I am sending a copy of this letter to the Finance Officer of the Department.

                                          Yours sincerely

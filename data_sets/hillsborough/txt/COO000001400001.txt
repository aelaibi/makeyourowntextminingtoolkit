                         THE HILLS B O R O UG H S T A D I U M DISAS T E R


                S T A T E M E N T BY HOME SECRETARY:             17 A P R I L 1989



Wi t h    permission,            Mr    Speaker,       I    should        like        to     make   a
state m e n t      a bout      the    disaster        at   the       Sheff i e l d        W ednesday
Football          Club      ground     at   Hills b o r o ug h     S t a d i u m on Saturday.
E v e ry o n e has been          horrified       by    this       incredible         tragedy       in
which 94 lost their lives and 174 were injured.


Shortly after the start of the m a t ch there was a surge of
spectators on the Leppings Lane terrace which crushed many at
the front a g a in s t the perimeter fence.                           This a c c ou n t e d for
m o s t of the deaths and injuries.


The m a t ch was due to start at 3 p.m.                           To help ensure orderly
access, the gates of the ground were opened at 12 noon.                                            At
2.30 p.m. m o s t of the N o t ti n g h a m fans were in the ground, but
many of the Liverpool supporters were still arriving.                                         It was
 clear to the p o lice officers in charge that there was ample
 c apacity        still      to be filled in some parts of the enclosure
                                                                            t
 a l l oc a t e d to Liverpool.


 At      about     2.45      p.m.     there was       a    large      crowd     of        Liverpool
 s upporters at the turnstiles in L e p pi n g s Lane behind the West
 Stand.          T here was diffi c u l t y in coping with the p r e ss u r e on
 the turnstiles and the police used                              loudhailers to urge the
 crowd to be patient.



                                                                     /At about 2.50 p.m.
At a bout 2.50 p.m. more Liverpool supporters arriv e d and the
numbers      in         front     of         the     turnstiles            increased.           Some
supporters        started         to     climb       the walls       and         turnstiles        and
those at the front of                    the       crowd o u t side        the     s t a dium were
under c o n s i d e r a b l e pressure from those behind.


The senior police officer present c o nsidered that there was a
possi b l e d a nger to the lives of the spectators at the front
of the crowd o u t side the stadium.                          In order to relieve the
press u r e he arranged for an exit gate near the turnstiles to
be    o p ened     to     let     a     section        of   the     crowd         through.         The
relationship of that action to the d i s as t e r on the terrace
shortly      a f t er w a r d s   is         clearly    a     central        q u e st i o n   to    be
investigated.


My Rt Hon friend the Prime M i n is t e r and I y e s te r d a y visited
the    football         ground         and    the    two S h e ff i e l d hospi t a l s which
received         casualties.            I would        like    to pay            tribute      to all
those     involved          in     the        rescue     opera t i o n s     at      the      ground,
                                                                             t

including the many spectators who gave their help;                                      and to
those     others,         including           the hospital         staffs         and      voluntary
agencies who have since been working so hard                                        treating        the
injured and c o n so l i n g the bereaved.                        We heard many accounts
of c o u ra g e exerted on behalf of others.




                                                                    /I have asked ...
I have a s ked for further factual reports from the police and
other        services,           the       local     authority               and        the      Football
Association.             Inquests will be held in due course.                                   But over
and      a b ove       this,       there     is    clearly          need        for       a     full     and
in d ependent           inquiry to identify the causes of the disaster
and to exami n e               what     needs      to be done               to p r e ve n t      such     an
a c c id e n t     happe n i n g       again.       I     have        therefore               asked     Lord
Ju s tice T a y lo r to carry out an                      inquiry,           with the following
terms of reference:


             "To       inquire        into   the    events         at Sheff i e l d
            W e d n e s d a y football ground on 15 April 1989
             and to recommend what further steps should
             be taken to improve crowd safety and ground
             control        at      sports        events,        including              any
             necessary              changes         in          the           relevant
             legislation".


[Mr      Brian         Johnson,        the Chief         C o n st a b l e     of Lancashire]              has
                                                                                    t

a g reed to a s sist the inquiry as an assessor;                                    and a r r an gements
will be m a d e as necessary for other quali f i e d asses s o r s to be
ap p o i n t e d and for the inquiry to be provi d e d with technical
a d vice         and    support.         I am asking              that        the       inquiry        should
p r o ceed with all possi b l e speed.                           Lord J u s ti c e T a ylor will
v isit S h e f f i e l d        tomorrow to begin his                       investigation.              I am
grateful to him for agreeing to undertake this task.



                                                                            /An appeal f u n d ...
An appeal      fund is being set up by the civic authorities of
Liverpool, N o t ti n g h a m   and Sheffield.   The Gover n m e n t will be
c o n tr i b u t i n g £500, 0 0 0 immediately towards this fund.


This was a d e v as t a t i ng tragedy.     Our deep sympathy goes to
the families of those who died, to those recovering, and to
those still fighting for life and health.                We owe a duty to
these p a s si o n a t e supporters of football      to examine urgently
and t horoughly the causes and background, and to do all in
our power to prevent such a thing happe n i n g again.

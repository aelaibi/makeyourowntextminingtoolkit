although          in general        the m a j o r i t y of fans          in the     city centre        on this

day were well           behaved.



I did b etween these                times a t t e n d    i ncidents         of unru ly b eh a vi o ur         in the

r e ceived over my VHF               radio.



H ow e v e r     i nitially    I was       de p lo y ed outside         a wa it in g   i ns tr uc t io n s

s ho uld we be n eeded              inside.



At a p p r o x i a m t e l y 3. 4 0 p m    (1540)    I went       inside       the g round w i t h my Poli ce

dog and stood facing                 the N o t t i n g h a m F or es t      s u pp or te rs who were          stood

on the S p io n Hop.               I was    stood on the          playing area near             to the

goalmouth.



I n ot ic ed that at this time a number                         of s u pp or te rs were         being brought

out of the g round towards                   the P ol ic e      room at the back of the N o r th

having         been d e t a in ed by P olice Officers.

The m oo d of the fans,           m a i n l y N o t t i n g h a m Forest,    in the a re a         in w h i ch   I

was stood was of a caring               nature a nd most a p p e a r e d s h oc k e d at what had

0 c cur r e d .



1 p ersonally did not have an yt h in g               to do w i t h     injured or dead persons.



Up until       being    stood down from the g r ou n d after disp er sa l                      of the

supporters,         my time was       spent    stood facing          the fans on the kop.



At 4.43pm         <1643)    I f o l l ow ed the fans     back    towards       the      city    centre

area.      The only        comments    that    1 have on the          incident were            that;™

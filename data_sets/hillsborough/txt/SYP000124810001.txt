I THINK IT SIGNIFICANT THAT HILLSSQROUGH DOES NOT STAGE BIG MATCHES ON A

REGULAR*M3 AS IS. SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY DON^OT ATTRACT LARGE CROWDS.             I D O N ’T

THINK THE POLICE THERE ARE FAMILIAR W I T H Y W E S I T U A T I O N . THE STRUCTURE AND

LAYOUT OF THE GROUND AT THE WEST STAND IS DISftgTEROUS.               I THINK SEVEN

TURNSTILES FOR THE TERRACE IS TOTALLY INADEQUATE.               FIND IT INCREDIBLE

THAT THE WEST STAND TAKES AS MANY SUPPORTERS AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO,                 FROM

PAST EXPERIENCE I KNEW HOW TO GET TO PENS 1 & 2 BUT WHEN I FIRST WENT I

THOUGHT THE TUNNEL WAS THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE T E R R A C E .        FOLLOWING MY CALL

TO THE POLICE INCIDENT R O O M , I MADE MY OWN NOTES OF THE INCIDENT.            THESE

ARE ATTACHED TO THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.          (JUfou,    C&LlL                /l& t * O ffr

 LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT,,
iilii



 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT

 WAS HANDLED , AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 WE WERE TOLD TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE POLICE OVER THE TANNOY, BUT IT

 SEEMED THEY WERE JUST STANDING T H E R E .



 £      THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 COMPARED TO THE ORGANISATION LAST YEAR,          THE POLICE WOULD HAVE STOPPED

 YOU ABOU i HALF A MILE f-ROM THE GROUND AND YOU WOULDN'T          HAVE GO 5 THROUGH

 WITHOUT A T I C K E T .    I ALSO THINK FANS LEAVING THE PUBS AT 143QHRS (1430), WOULD

 HAVE BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR AS WELL           I THINK THE POLICE WERE SLOW IN REACTING

 TO WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING         .

 QS 2

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.



 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 ■1)    THE POLICE WERE INSENSITIVE ABOUT WHAT b        "HAPPENED, THEY D I D N ’T DO

 ANYTHING CONSTRUCTIVE TO HELP FANS.           SOME POLICE DID HELP BUT I WOULD SAY THAT

 9 OUT OF    10 DID NOTHING.

 2)     THE MAIN CONCERN OF THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE THAT OF CROWD CONTROL.

 3)     THE FOOTBALL FANS TOOK THE INITIATIVE WHEN IT CAME TO HELPING DEAD AND

 INJ URED F-ANS .

 4)     IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES BEFORE THE FIRE BRIGADE ARRIVED.

 5 W    IT SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIME FOR PEOPLE TO REALISE HOW BAD THE SITUATION

 WAS.

 6 )    THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE ORGANISED THE RESCyE OPERATION.

 7)     A FAN WHO GOT ON THE PITCH JUMPED ONTO THE CROSSBAR        IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE

 NETS FROM THE GOALS AS THIS WAS HAMPERING RESCUE WORKERS.           THE POLICE DRAGGED

 HIM DOWN THEY WERE SLOW TO REALISE WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 •1)    THE ORGANISATION WAS QUITE GOOD UNTIL YOU GOT WITHIN HALF A MILE FROM THE

 GROUND THEN THERE JUST SEEMED TO BE A LACK OF CO-ORDINATION -         I THOUGHT THAT

 THE IDEA THE POLICE HAD    GOT FROM THEN ON WAS JUST TO GET FANS OFF THE STREETS

 AND INTO THE GROUND OUT    OF THE WAY,

 2)   THE LOCAL RESIDENTS   AROUND THE GROUND WERE FANTASTIC AND COULDN’ T DO

 ENOUGH FOR YOU.

 3)   I JUST HOPE THAT TH IS ENQUIRY I S N ' T A WHITEWASH,   THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD,

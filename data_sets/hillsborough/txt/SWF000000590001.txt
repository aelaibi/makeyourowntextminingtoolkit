                                   A message from
                     the Reverend Gordon L. Wilson
            Sheffield Wednesday F.C, Club Chaplain
d H H H H jjV '             As the Chairman has said in his message of hope and
              encouragement, the events of Saturday, 15th April and the days
     if       that followed will live for ever in the minds of those who were
                        present, 1 was profoundly impressed by the spontaneous
                  co-operation of so many people, not least the club apprentices
                   and ground staff, together with the emergency services, all of
             whom worked to the point of exhaustion helping those in need.

                       The commitment of the Chairman and Directors, and the
                           courage, courtesy and compassion of the club staff in
                     caring for bereaved families and injured people who visited
                      the ground, with the agreement and assistance of the West
               Midlands Police investigation team, was magnificent and greatly
                                                         appreciated by the Liverpool fans.

                     The tragic events have revealed the true depth of character
                    and new qualities of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
                      staff, which brings credit not only to the club, but reflects
                      to the benefit of the whole of the football scene, and gives
                                             real grounds for confidence in the future.

             Indeed it is, as the Archbishop of York indicated in his sermon at
                  the memorial service, through such people and actions that the
            love of God was evident and experienced in the midst of tragedy.

       Dear friends,
      What happened here at our beloved Sheffield Wednesday’s
      ground on Saturday, 15th April, 1989 was a horror we can never
      forget. I find it difficult now to consciously accept those terrible
      happenings.
      My thoughts and heartfelt feelings are with the bereaved who
      lost their loved ones—many so young as not yet to have enjoyed
      the flower of their youth. The injured, physically and mentally,
      who will still suffer into the future. The people of Liverpool,
      Nottingham and Sheffield numbed by the events but who did
      many noble things that day to help.
      The Board of SWFC joins me in thanking everyone who helped
      and worked so tirelessly on that fateful day, and we are very
      proud and grateful to the SWFC personnel at all levels for their
      complete response to this tragedy.
      I have had many supportive letters from all parts of the country
      and from abroad. It is helpful to know we have so many friends
      in our hour of darkness. To them all I send our grateful thanks.
      We must now turn our thoughts and actions to the future—albeit
      a difficult task at this time—but this Club which we love is a
      great Club, and I know that the tremendous Hillsborough spirit
      will lift and stimulate us all during the difficult months ahead.




                                                                                     H. E. McGEE, Chairman.

Today's game will no doubt focus
many minds on the tragedy that
happened here last month.
Everybody in the club is deeply
saddened by it. Mental scars will no
doubt remain for many people
associated with the club, for a long
time to come.
However, it’s important for us to get
our minds back on staying in the
First Division.
As this is the first gam e to be played
at Hillsborough since the tragedy, it’s
important that we all help each other
to com e through this test. The fans in
particular can help immensely by
their behaviour and by the reception
they give to the players.
Three points today are essential for
our First Division survival. It would
take us past 40 points and help us
immensely, for it w ould almost
certainly make us safe.
The result at Derby was unfortunate,
as we felt w e played very well
without getting any reward for our
endeavours. In the players’ minds,
there is no doubt that First Division
status will be maintained.
Our break in Guernsey has given the
players the chance to get away from
the Hillsborough situation, get their
minds back on the job in hand, and
relax and prepare for the game
against West Ham,
It is not an attempt to detract from the
seriousness of the Hillsborough
situation. But really we have to stay
in the First Division and it’s been a
break from the trauma of the
preceding week. It’s vital that we win

big man.
W hereas Lee, outstanding in the air,
had to w ork hard to im prove his
ability on the ground, Steve is a
naturally mobile striker with a
delightfully deft touch.
He is also quick and powerful and,
although he has never been a prolific
marksman, his potential to finish was
am ply demonstrated in the recent
3-0 home win over Millwall.
Atkinson was eager to point out after
the signing that W hitton's previous
clubs had played him in a variety of
positions. Perhaps he is now drawing
on that experience by bringing a
range of qualities to his favoured role
up front.
Certainly, com parison with
C hapm an’s excellent strike rate is
misleading and unfair.
Instead, it is significant to record that
fellow frontrunner D avid Hirst has
enjoyed his best form in three
seasons at Hillsborough since
W hitton's arrival, although A tkinson’s
own influence has also been
important.

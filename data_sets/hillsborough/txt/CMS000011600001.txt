But what happened this evening was, I repeat, somewhat
unfortunate.                                                 9.25 pm
  M r. D eputy Speaker: The hon. Gentleman has been in           Sir Malcolm Thornton (Crosby): The House will be

                                                             is not the purpose of this debate to go over that ground
                                                             again or to rehash the arguments that were dealt with in
                                                             some detail by the Taylor report.
                                                                 Tonight’s debate is narrowly and tightly drawn. It
                                                             relates only to the death of one of my constituents, Kevin
                                                             Williams. It is not my purpose to talk about events before
                                                             3.15 pm, the cut-off point that the coroner decided should
                                                             be set at die inquest. His suggestion was that all who died
                                                             that day were brain dead by that time. Therefore the
                                                             evidence from that day was dealt with only up to that
                                                             point.
                                                                 I should like to put firmly on the record the events
                                                             relating to Kevin Williams which occurred after 3.15 pin
                                                             and which, because of the coroner’s decision, were not
                                                             deemed admissible as evidence. The chronology of what
                                                             happened to Kevin that day is broadly speaking as
                                                             follows. At 3.28 pm Kevin was lifted out of enclosure 3
                                                             and helped on to the pitch by PC Michael Craighill. There
                                                             is visual evidence of that fact from BBC tapes. At 3.32
                                                             pm Kevin was rushed across the pitch on an advertising
                                                             hoarding—there is a timed photograph of that taking
                                                             place. Also at 3.32 pm, an off-duty Merseyside
                                                             policeman, a Mr. Bruder, who was in the north stand
                                                              spotted Kevin lying on the ground and left his seat to go
                                                              to attend to him. There is also visual evidence of that
                                                              incident, as a set of photographs is available from The
                                                              Times.
                                                                 At 3.35 pm, there is visual evidence of a second
                                                              ambulance entering the ground. There is a timed
                                                              photograph of that incident. It appears also on video. At
                                                              3.37 pm, Mr. Bruder says, an ambulance passed while he
                                                              was attending to Kevin and he asked the St. John’s
                                                              ambulance man present to stop it and to put Kevin in it.
                                                              The ambulance would not stop. Mr. Bruder said that it
                                                              looked as though it had orders not to.
                                                                 Since then, Mr. Tony Edwards of the ambulance
                                                              service has confirmed that he was the assistant to the
                                                              driver in the ambulance and that he would have passed
                                                              Mr. Bruder at 3.37 pm that day. Mr. Edwards also says
                                                              that he had orders to go straight to the Leppings lane end
                                                              of the ground, as there were fatalities.
                                                                  At 3.45 pm, special WPC Debra Martin came across
                                                               Kevin lying on the ground in the recovery position. She
                                                               says that she saw life in his face and found pulses in his
                                                               neck. Miss Martin and the police constable who was with
                                                               her ran with Kevin to the gym. Miss Martin was told by
                                                               her superiors to stay with Kevin and to carry out
                                                               resuscitation and heart massage. After resuscitation,
                                                               Kevin started to breathe again, his ribs were moving. Miss
                                                               Martin picked Kevin up in her arms. It was then that
                                                               Kevin opened his eyes, murmured, “Mom”, then closed
                                                               his eyes and died. Miss Martin said that Kevin turned grey
                                                               and then went quickly blue. The time would have been
                                                               about 3.55 pm.

 Dear Chief O fficer

INTERIM RE PO RT OF THE INQUIRY                  INTO     CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL A
SPORTS GROU ND S

        My letter to you of 16 May asked for your a s si st an ce in
a r r a ng in g for visits to be made to all u n c e r t i f i c a t e d sports stadia
in a ccordance wit h the Home S e c r e t a r y ' s request and for reports on
the visits to be sent to me.          As you will alre ad y k now from Home
Office circular No 54/1985, copies of w h ic h were sent to chief fire
officers, the Home S e c r e t a r y whe n a n n o u n c i n g to P a rl ia me nt the
pu bl ic at io n of the Inte ri m Report exp re ss ed his gra ti tu de            to chief
officers for the prompt, e f f i ci en t and careful ma nn er in which this
survey was carried out. I would wish to add my thanks to you for your
c ommendable efforts in this matter.

2.   The I n t e r i m Report c ontained a number of r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s and
p rovis io na l r ec om me n d a t i o n s .      I would be g ra teful for your assis ta nc e
in o b t a i n i n g cert ai n i n f o r m a t i o n w h ic h is required in relation to two
of the p ro v i s i o n a l r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s so that I will be in a position
to advise the Inqu ir y further.                      These p ro v i s i o n a l r ec om m e n d a t i o n s are
numbers 5 and 6 on page 51 of the Inte ri m Report and are as follows:

^            "5.  I am minded to r ec ommend that the S e c r e t a r y of
             State should e xe rcise his powers to des ig na te all
             sports g r o un ds w h a t e v e r their size, to include indoor
             as well as outdoor a c t i v i t i e s ( Paragraphs 3-145)".

             "6.  I am minded to recommend immediate d e s i g n a t i o n of
             any ground capable of h o l d i n g over 5,000 spectators, to
             cover all sports grounds, not mer el y football grounds.
             (Paragraph 3.146)".

3.  Taking P r o v i si on al         Recommendation            6 first we now need                 inform­
ation on:

              (a)       sports stadia with s pe c t a t o r c ap acity of more than
              5 0 0 0 . A sports stad iu m is defined as any place where
              s ports or other c o m p e ti ti ve a c t i v i t i e s take place in
              the open air and w here a c c o m m o d a t i o n is p ro vided for
              s p ec ta to rs c on si s t i n g of a r t i f i c i a l struc tu re s or of
              natural s t ru ct ur es that have been a r t i f i c i a l l y modified
              for the purpose and where this a c c o m m o d a t i o n w h o l l y or
              s u b s t a n t i a l l y surrounds the area used for a ct iv i t i e s
              taking place on the ground;
E.R.
        (b)     other sports grounds which are not stadia            (ie which
       «mrrm»n!!?Ve ^ ° n s t ^ucted spectator accommodation substantially
       surro un di ng the playing area) but where there is artificially
       ^ r u c t e d ^ e c t a t o r a c c o m o d a t i o n that has a capacity of


                that     n fed for these categories (and it would help if they
    thpi ar       separately listed in your return because to some extent
    they are      subject to different provisions of the Act) is:

       g r o u n d 1-18 nam8 3nd address of the sports    stadium or sports


                t? 8 Capacity of the stadium as a whole        or,    in the case
       acofs o d a t f o n -   ' the =apaCity of the a rt if icially provided

       ( m )      the capacity    (actual or permitted)    of any roofed
•      sports     grounds^               in those sports stadia         or^


       (iv)     the sport or sports carried on at the stadium or ground




                                i?oejSet;1;nc?h
                                              i:%sn
                                                  o;:xrof1^eofPjsj!0;an%";“?n
    for information, but it would nevertheless be a pp recia ted if the
       “   t”  1 , ' repeated for the purpose of thiS e x c i s e ! ^ o w l v e r
    in o.mation need not be provided on designated sports stadia..

  5. Turning to Provisional Recommendation 5, the new element here
 is the proposed extension of designation to indoor sports grounds'
 this would, of course, involve amendment of the definition under the
 Act, pres um ab ly so that the definition of a sports stadium would
 apply to indoor ones as well as open air ones.


    As far as the capacity threshold is concerned, although Provisional
Recommendation 6 mentions a figure of 5000 it will be appreciated
by chief fire officers that the potential fire hazards in buildings
are of a different nature than those in outdoor sports grounds and
it may therefore be necessary to advise the Inquiry that a lower
cut off spectator capacity is needed to achieve a comparable standard
of fire safety in buildings and in outdoor sports grounds. On this
basis we think that it might be prudent to look to a substantially
lower capacity threshold of 1000 for this category of stadium in the
designation context, and, moreover, not to confine it to buildings
where sports a ctivity is carried out in a single hall, but also to
sports complexes which may consist of several adjacent halls or rooms
forming part of s ubstantially the same buildings.  These should be
included provided that there is accommodation in total for more than
1000 spectators.
 ^    f  or the sports activities to be covered, the existing
 definition under the 1975 Act refers simply to any place where
 "sport or other competitive activities take place in the open air".
 It is not clear at this stage just how the Inquiry envisages this
 formula b eing adapted to cover indoor sport.     But it would seem
 reasonable for the purposes of this exercise to retain the implicit
 ingredient of competitive physical a ct iv it y and confine the
 information to buildings where c ompetitive sports take place involv­
 ing physical exertion rather than intellectual, cultural or dramatic
 skills.   It is appreciated that some b uildings may only be o cc as io n­
 ally °r i nfrequently used for sports activities; but tney should be
 included in the survey and an indication given to this effect in
 the report.

 8.   In so far as this exercise on indoor stadia breaks new ground,
 I am., afraid that we shall need rather more c om prehensive data. It
 would be helpful if the i nformation could be provided under the
 following heads:

       (i)     name and address        of premises;

       (ii)    name of the o w n e r s / o c c u p i e r s ;

       (iii)    maximum spectator capacity;

       (iv)    s p or ti ng activity or activ it ie s           catered      for.



      (v)   the legislation (if any) currently c on tr olling
      use of the building or part of the building for fire precautions purposes

      (vi)   date of last inspection                 by   the   fire a u t h o r i t y and
      the outcome;

       (vii)     any remarks        or comments.

 9.   Finally, I would be grateful if chief officers would provide me
 with some further information to s upplement the reports on sports
l.stadia they have already submitted.         Some of these reports indicated
,-that in the case of certain u n s a t is fa ct or y sports stadia the fire
 a uthority considered that the a dmission of s pectators should be
 prohibited or severely restricted until remedial work or rebuilding
 had been completed.        It would be very helpful to know how many of
 these prohibitions or restrictions still remained on the 17 August
 1985.   Please give the names of the sports stadia concerned, i de n t i ­
 fying the s t a n d (s ) and, where there is a restriction on its use,
 i ndicating the maximum permitted number of spectators.           This i nf o r m ­
 ation is requested on stadia or sports grounds of any capacity.

 10.   I recognise that this task will be an a dditional but, I hope, not
substantial burden on your fire prev en ti on department.  I would be
g rateful.if the information requested could be sent to me in the
suggested form as soon as it has been obtained and in any event HfSEF

list is attached       covering the i nformation               needed.

     JUSTICE POPPLEWELL INQUIRY — FINAL REPORT
 The Home Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd has recently spoken in Parliament on the final report of the Inquiry undertaken
 into safety and control at sports grounds which w as undertaken under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Popplewell.

 He has stated that in dealing w ith crowd safety there is a need to act quickly in implementing the Inquiry Report's
 recommendation, that all sports grounds and sports stadia in England and W ales w ith accommodation for more than 1 0 , 0 0 0
 spectators and w h e re association football, rugby union and cricket are played, which are not already designated under the
 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 19 75, should be so designated. Consultation, it is understood, is to begin im m e dia telyw it h t h e
 sports authorities and organisations concerned with a vie w to introducing legislation by the summ er of this year. In Scotland,
 it is intended similarly, to introduce an order designating stadia of clubs w ith accommodation for more than 1 0 , 0 0 0
 spectators in the first and second divisions of the Scottish Football League.

The Home Secretary also has accepted the principle, that safety controls should be extended to all sports grounds and stadia
with stands for over 5 0 0 spectators and to indoor sports facilities with accommodation for over 5 0 0 spectators w he re
adequate controls do not exist. However, before making any firm decision in this connection, the Home Secretary has stated
his intention to invite the local and fire authorities in England, W a le s and Scotland to inspect all such stands and premises
not previously inspected and report on them, before issuing a consultative document containing proposed ways of achieving
the objectives of the Inquiry s final report, fitting this into the review already under w a y on the future of the Fire Precautions
Act.

It is suggested by the Home Secretary me an while, that there will be no avoidable risk, because powers are already
immediately available under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1 9 7 5 and the Fire Precautions Act 1971 to deal with any
exceptional hazard which might be found in the course of inspections to be undertaken. Similarly, chief fire officers and
firemasters have been invited to keep under re view the places that they inspected under previous initiatives last year, with
the object of maintaining safety standards at those places.

        recommendations contained in the Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports
^ ^ c u n d s are printed below. It will be noted that the recommendations on crowd safety lean very much towards the
 submissions made to the Inquiry by the National Association of Fire Officers - That direct control over fire safety matters
 should be the responsibility of the Fire Service.

Actions of Mr R Clarke, Control Superintendent, on 15th April 1989,
regarding the Hillsborough Incident




1400 hours        I commenced duty as Superintendent in charge of Control
                 covering the South Yorkshire area.                                I commenced my duty
                 by     reading         the     necessary          details         associated           to     the
                 Football         Association           Semi-Final            to     be        held    at      the
                 Hillsborough             Football       Stadium,            between       Liverpool           and
                 Nottingham Forest Football teams.


                 I    did    this       in    order     to    update         myself       on    the     Officer
                 location,          the       vehicle        allocation         and       the     additional
                 information supplied by South Yorkshire Police,                                      in terms
                 of supporters            routes and car parking facilities.                                 These
                 documents had been supplied to Control by the Assistant
                 Chief Officer Mr D Jones,                     in charge of Operations,                        for
                 them to be read in conjuction with our own internal plan
                 for    any       incident      which        may    arise      at     the       Hillsborough
                 Football Stadium.


1506:29                             Control Assistant, who was on duty as part of
                 my shift,         taking telephone and radio messages received a
                 call       directly         from     Police       Force       Control,          Snig       Hill,
                 Sheffield.             She informed me            that      the Officer wished to
                 speak       to     a     Senior      Ambulance           Officer         on     duty.           I
                 immediately took the call and was informed by P C Rooke,
                 that he was advising me that Ambulances may be required
                 at the Leppings Lane end of the Ground.                                  This merely was
                 advice at this moment in time.                          He said that people had
                 been pushed and shoved and there may be people injured.
                 I then asked him if he was definitely sure that he did
                                                                    \

                 not need us now.               He replied "No, not at the moment, we
                 will come back to you if necessary".                               There was quite a
                 long       pause       and    he     returned          by    saying           that   he      was
                 requesting a fleet of Ambulances, that there were lots of
                 people injured.
          I told him we would send an initial response and assess
          the situation            from that point.             He said that he needed
          all the Ambulances we had.                    I responded by saying that I
          could not         do   that,     but we would assess                the    situation.
          (Track 9, extension 209).


1508:14   I    told    Mr   Hopkins      that     the    Police had           said    that   they
          needed a fleet of Ambulances, but no further information
          was available.            I then requested that the Liaison Officer
          within the Ground should be informed                          in order       to get a
          further update.


1508:49   Control Officer                       Informed Mr Hopkins over the radio
          to check the Leppings Lane end for an updated assessment.


1508:51   Mr    Hopkins      informed       me    that     he    was     unhappy      with     the
          information        received,         and was     responding          personally       to
          Hillsborough to see what was happening.


1509      Two    off-duty        Control       Staff     arrived by       mere       chance,    to
          visit       the   Unit,       they     were    Superintendent          Hartley       and
          Control Assistant


1510:35   Police Control came on the telephone and informed me that
          all    available         Police      man-power        within    the    county      were
          being called in to Leppings Lane.


1512      I then opened the Incident Log which would only be done
          at    times       when    I    felt     that    we     have    an     extraordinary
          situation developing.                 At this point in time we had been
          informed by Mr Higgins that there may be fatalities.


1513:52   I spoke to Doncaster Ambulance Station requesting two day
          crews to attend Hillsborough.


1514:01   I received a telephone call from Ambulanceman                                        who

          was     off-duty,         offering       assistance.            I    asked     him    to
          respond directly to the football ground.
!
    1514:30   I was       informed by Mr                 that the      Deputy Chief,     Mr
              Hopkins      and                 were now both mobile           in the one
              vehicle to Hillsborough.


    1515:47   I contacted        West Yorkshire       Ambulance     Service      and asked
              for their support and back up.


    1515:53   I rang Rotherham Ambulance Station and mobilised the crew
              to Hillsborough.


    1515:56   I rang Rotherham Ambulance Station again and mobilised a
              second crew to Hillsborough.


    1516:20   I summoned another vehicle to Hillsborough.


    1516:24   I summoned another vehicle to Hillsborough.


    1517:02   I    rang                      the    Public    Relations    Officer      for
              SYMAS, and asked her to attend Control as we had a Major
              Incident.


    1518      I rang the Derbyshire Ambulance Service requesting back
              up      Between 1508 and 1600,                           Control Officer,
              on duty in charge of the out-patient service, deployed 12
              out patient vehicles to the Hillsborough Football Ground.
              These    were      released    from    out     patient    duties    as   they
              became available.         Many were released immediately as they
              were on stand-by on Station.


                              immediately despatched all emergency stand-by
              vehicles available and I am aware that the initial number
              deployed was 5 emergency vehicles.                One from each of the
              following Stations:


              Parkway,      Batemoor,      Middlewood,     Maltby and Rotherham.          A
              short    time      later a    further two vehicles were            responded
              from Barnsley and Hoyland.
1522   I transferred the incident to the Major Incident Room in
       order to separate the domestic emergency calls from the
       ones    received     for    the    special    incident,    which had        now
       developed.


1530                    arrived and at 1532,          she contacted the Chief
       Ambulance Officer          to be       re-called to duty and        informed
       him     of    the   Major       Incident.       There    was     some     radio
       interference        but    at    1537    I   confirmed    with    the     Chief
       Officer that he was mobile to Headquarters and that there
       was a Major Incident in progress at Hillsborough.


1540   Mr A Smith, Assistant Chief Officer in charge of Control
       and Communications was informed and re-called to duty.


1541   Mr Jones, Assistant Chief Officer in charge of Operations
       was informed and re-called to duty.


1546   Mr    Jones    arrived     and    at    approximately     1548,    Mr     Smith
       arrived.


1550   Mr Page arrived at Control just as Mr Jones was                         leaving
       to attend Hillsborough as a Senior Officer in support of
       Mr Hopkins and Mr Morley.




       From 1532       I continued       to monitor     the incident      from the
       Incident Room.        Remaining in Control until I handed over
       to                   at a later stage.          I can confirm that Mr
       Page    left Headquarters         at approximately        1750 hours with
                     who had also arrived           into Headquarters by this
       time.
Actions of Station Officer Eason at Hillsborough Football Ground on
Saturday 15th April 1989


1410 hours        I arived at Hillsborough Football Ground.


1415 hours        I liaised with Inspector Sewell of South Yorkshire
                  Police.


1445 hours        I was positioned between the Spion Kop and North Stand
                 with Station Officer Higgins and Ambulancemen ___________
                                  The ambulance had previously been parked at
                  the top of the ramp by 'O' Gate.


1459 hours        The match kicked off.


1503 hours        From my position at the Spion Kop area I viewed what I
                  thought was a crowd disturbance at the Leppings Lane end,
                  south side of the terraces.     I immediately left my
                  position to travel along the path which runs parallel to
                  the north stand heading towards pen area 6 with
                  Ambulanceman


1504 hours        I reached Pen 6.    The crowd in the areas of Pen 5 and Pen
                  6 were viewing the game.    There appeared to be no
                  problems.    There were members of the crowd on the pitch
                  area behind the goals seated on the grass, watching the
                  game.     From my position at Pen 6, I could not see the
                  fences of Pen 3 or 4 because of the fans and Police
                  Officers, the game was still on, I walked towards the
                  goal looking to see if the Ambulance Service was
                  required.


1505 hours        Ambulanceman                and myself were attacked by a

50 seconds        football supporter as we approached the terraces by Gate
                  '3'.     I was distracted by this and retreated onto the
                  pitch.     There was a crowd of fans and Police Officers all
                  around me.     It was very difficult for me to assess the
                  situation at that time, but the Police appeared to have a
                  crowd disorder problem.
1506 hours   Two Liverpool supporters made contact with me and
             informed me of an injured colleague lying by the left
             hand side of the goal, viewing it from the Spion Kop.
             Ambulancemai                 and myself assessed this
             casualty to have a broken leg.       Because of the turmoil
             and noise I was not able to make visual contact with
             Station Officer Higgins or radio contact and for that
             reason we left to collect medical equipment and treat the
             casualty.


1506 hours   As far as I was concerned at that time I only had one
             casualty to deal with.      There appeared to be a pitch
             invasion taking place around me.       I did not see, nor was
             I made aware of any other casualties.       I was wearing my
             HV jacket - with 'AMBULANCE OFFICER' written across the
             back.


1508 hours   I returned to the Spion Kop area where Station Officer
             Higgins was standing.       I collected the equipment, ie,
             trolley stretcher, frac straps, portable oxygen and bag
             and mask.    Ambulanceman                and myself then
             returned towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground to
             treat the one casualty, accompanied by Higgins and
                         I am aware that Station Officer Higgins called
             for the one ambulance on stand by at Middlewood to be
             brought into the ground in order to provide cover for the
             one ambulance I was going to use to transport the
             casualty leaving the area.


1511 hours   I arrived at the goal mouth along with Station Officer
             Higgins and Ambulancemen
                                                       started to assist
             the casualty who had a broken leg whilst Station Officer
             Higgins and myself walked toward the centre of the pitch
             in order to assess the situation.       For the first time we
             realised that there were a number of seriously injured
             people and that we had a serious incident on our hands.
1511 hours and   We jointly decided to prepare the gymnasium in
23 seconds       line with our operational plan.       Station Officer Higgins
                 went back to the Ambulance to inform Control and organise
                 this.     Control were updated by Station Officer Higgins
                 that we had between 50 and 100 casualties as a rough
                 estimate at that time.       I stayed on the pitch and noticed
                 people being resuscitated.       Ambulancemen
                 i               started to resuscitate people around the goal
                 area.     I told them it was essential they retained usual
                 contact to ensure individual safety.


                 I returned to the Ambulance position at the Spion Kop end
                 of the ground to update Station Officer Higgins and
                 control.       I saw Station Officer Higgins in the ambulance
                 resuscitating a youth, whilst being watched by many other
                 injured people both in and around the vehicle.


                 I then removed a female asthmatic patient from the rear
                 of the vehicle to the front seat to take her away from
                 the stressful situation the she had been placed in, ie
                 watching the resuscitation of a youth.          I tried to use
                 the radio in the ambulance, but no contact with control
                 was made.


1514 hours       I returned to the pitch area where fans were now carrying
                 patients on hoardings to the ambulance and gymnasium
                 areas and I was seen 20 yards from the goal mouth at 1514
                 hours and 20 seconds as seen on the video.


1515 hours       I assisted a Doctor on the pitch who was resuscitating a
                 young male of approximately 12 years old.


1516 hours           I left the Doctor and ran for an ambulance in order to
                     remove the child, who at that time it was believed would
                     survive.   The ambulance crew involved were Leading
                 Ambulanceman             kid Ambulanceman
                 I returned to the Doctor with Leading Ambulanceman
                 and a trolley and the child was taken from the ground to
                 the Northern General Hospital.




1521 hours       Whilst the Ambulance was driving across the pitch, I
                 contacted Control and declared a 'MAJOR INCIDENT'.     I
                 jumped out and I returned to the Leppings Lane terraces.


                 I am seen on video when full evacuation is in progress
                 towards the Spion Kop end.    I directed fans toward the
                 gymnasium with the injured.


1523 hours       I returned to the Spion Kop end of the ground and met
                 Deputy Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer Hopkins on
                 his arrival.   I briefed Mr. Hopkins of the incident and
                 the aggression which had taken place.


1526 hours       I am seen (on the video) in a group of ambulance
                 personnel at the right-hand   side of the goal.


1527 hours and   I radio for the Major Incident vehicle on behalf of
46 seconds       Mr. Hopkins.


1528 hours and   I called for all available vehicles to be sent to
04 seconds       Penistone Road.


1529 hours       I took up the position at Penistone Road to marshal the
                 vehicles and for a short period of time became the
                 parking officer at the Spion Kop.


1537 hours       I returned to the pitch area and spoke to Ambulanceman
                        at the centre of the goal mouth in his vehicle.
1543 hours         I was seen in front of the goal assessing the situation.
                   It is clear at this time that all casualties had been
                   cleared from the terrace and no further evacuation took
                   place.   I was met by Assistant Chief Metropolitan
                   Ambulance Officer Jones who was making his way to the
                   gymnasium area.   I was left to marshal the vehicles at
                   Penistone Road North and at some stage later took
                   responsibility for stand down of vehicles at Herries Road
                   Bus Depot.


1800 hours         I remember making contact with Mr. A. Page upon his
                   arrival at approximately 1800 hours.   I was informed by
                   Mr. Page along with Assistant Divisional Officer
                   and Station Officer           to remain at Hillsborough to
                   assist with the removal and identification of bodies.      I
                   remained on duty at the mortuary and temporary mortuary
                   areas until 0530 hours on the morning of Sunday 16th
                   April 1989.   At 0645 hours on Sunday 16th April 1989, I
                   left the station to go off duty and return home.

Actions of Deputy Chief Metropolitan Ambulance        Officer/ at   Hillsborough
Football Ground on Saturday 15th April 1989                  £




1130 hours       I attended Control on a brief visit and            spoke   to Mr
                       who was Duty Officer for the day.

1150             I positioned my car on the bridge over the Ml, Junction
                 33 in order to assess traffic flow to the football semi­
                 final.   I did this because in the previous year there
                 had been congestion.

1350             I   left  Junction  33    of   the     Ml   and    returned    to
                 Headquarters for lunch.

1355             I arrived at Headquarters/Control and I took several
                 general calls within the Control Room assisting the
                 staff on duty. I remained in the Control Room and at:

1400             I heard Eason and Higgins informing Control that they
                 were leaving for the ground in order to take up their
                 stand-by positions.

1410             I heard Eason and    Higgins   radio    their   arrival at    the
                 Football Ground.

1508:13 secs     Superintendent Clarke appeared to me to be disturbed
                 whilst speaking on the direct line to South Yorkshire
                 Police Control.

1508:14          Superintendent Clarke informed me that the call from the
                 Police said that they had a problem at Hillsborough and
                 they required "a fleet of Ambulances".    He added that
                 they did not know what had happened and were unable to
                 give further details.    I told Control to get on the
                 radio to the Ambulance Officers who were in the ground
                 acting as liaison officers, and to get a clearer picture
                 from them.

1508:41          I spoke by telephone to the 2nd stand-by crew at
                 Middlewood Ambulance Station and told them to respond to
                 Leppings Lane and assess the situation.        I also told
                 them that Station Officer Higgins who w a l r e a d y in the
                 ground as one of our liaison officers was going to check
                 and inform Control.

1508:49          Control Officer         informed Station Officer Higgins
                 to check the Leppings Lane entrance as there appeared to
                 be confusion over the details from the Police.

1508:51          I left my position in the Control Room to go mobile to
                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground because of the un­
                 certainty of the situation and the reports we were
                 receiving.  As I left the Control Unit, I saw Mr      '
                 returning from operational duties and I told him that we
                 were both going to Hillsborough in the one vehicle.
We informed Control by radio that we were          leaving
Headquarters and were mobile to Leppings Lane.

We were informed by Control that there was trouble
getting into the Leppings Lane end of the ground and Mr
Higgins had requested that all Ambulances attend the
Gymnasium entrance on Penistone Road North.

We sent a radio message to Control asking for all
vehicles, especially Sierra vehicles, to become clear of
patients as soon as possible as they may be needed at
Hillsborough.

Control sent a general message via the radio that all
Ambulances were to become clear as soon as possible,
informing them that there were problems at Sheffield
Wednesday Football Ground.

Mr         and myself arrived on scene. We immediately
saw that there were many casualties, and our initial
message to Control upon our arrival included a request
for as many vehicles as possible to be sent         to
Hillsborough and if necessary to ask the assistance of
other authorities to back SYMAS up.

Mr :       also informed Control that we were changing
our radio channel from the domestic emergency wave
length channel to the emergency reserve channel.     We
were informed by Control that there were 12 vehicles en
route at that moment in time to assist us.

I had left my vehicle and ran down the ramp on to the
pitch.   Station Officer Eason met me and briefed me
whilst we both ran towards the Leppings Lane end.     I
passed through the Police line which was placed between
the half way line and the penalty box on the Liverpool
end of the ground. As soon as I passed through the line
I saw for the first time that people were laid on the
pitch and were receiving cardiac massage.   Many of the
bodies were covered by coats, or jumpers put over their
faces, indicating that these people were dead.    I was
approached by fans asking for help and it was clear at
this point that we needed more resources.

I immediately began to return through      the operational
line to my Range Rover, to inform          Control of the
situation and to get more vehicles and    man power to the
scene.  I did not see any Senior Police   Officers at this
stage.

I was running back towards the ramp when a Police
Officer carrying a young girl stumbled and as he did
this I took the girl in my arms and continued to run
with her towards the ramp. As I arrived at the ramp the
Police Officer was by my side and asked me if the girl
was dead.   I confirmed this and asked him to take the
child to the gymnasium which in line with our plan was
the Casualty Clearing Post, and temporary mortuary.
1529:19   I had left the pitch    and I made a radio call to the
          Control Unit, asking for the Major Incident Vehicle, and
          telling them that Ineeded as        many Ambulances   as
          possible to attend as    there were many people dead.  I
          was not in a position at that time to give any clearer
          details.

1535      It was obvious to me that the crowd were unaware that
          there had been a disaster at the Leppings Lane terraces
          and I decided to send a South Yorkshire Ambulance on to
          the pitch to signify to the cfrouicf that there had been a
          serious incident and that help was available and on its
          way.   That Ambulance was crewed by Ambulancemen
          and Edwards.

          As they attempted to     drive down the ramp on to      the
          pitch, they were stopped by a St John's Ambulance which
          was coming from the pitch and had got stuck against the
          railings, thus causing an obstruction.        After a few
          moments the vehicle was freed from the fencing and left
          the pitch and ramp area and        Jand Edwards were able
          to gain access to the pitch.    _ 0_
                                          I    _ _____
                                             gave  them_____________
                                                        instructions
          to put the blue lights on and to use their claxton horns
          to allow them into the ground and inform the crowd that
          help was available and on its way.

1536             and Edwards arrived at the Leppings Lane end of
          the pitch and are observed on the video.

1537:10   I made contact with Control asking them to contact the
          Chief Ambulance Officer and inform1him of the situation.

1537:33   Control informed me that the Chief Ambulance Officer had
          already been informed and was en-route to the Control
          Unit.   They also gave me an update on the vehicles
          positions and availability.

1539:40   1      and Edwards left the pitch with casualties.

1540      I knew I had no shortages of resources now.    Ambulances
          and crews were lined up to remove the injured.

          I was standing at the top of the ramp at the Spion Cop
          end of the ground where many casualties were brought up
          after the Ambulance manned by          and Edwards left
          the pitch.

          It appeared to me that people had watched the Ambulance
          leaving and had been made aware that assistance was
          available at that end of the ground.       There were no
          Senior Police Officers present at the Gymnasium area.  I
          could not leave this area myself because it was vital to
          the Ambulance plan that I remained in the area, and I
          could not spare Officers in wasting their time trying to
          locate a Senior Police Officer at that time.
                During this period I was with Mr I_____________y Mr Dale,9 -----
                                                                           Mr
                Eason  and Mr    Higgins  at various      stages    and was
                consistently being made aware of the situation at
                various locations within the ground.

                The   Major Incident Vehicle driven       by    Station   Officer
                \         also arrived at this time.

1544            The Medical Team arrived        from   the     Northern   General
                Hospital by Ambulance.

1546            I sent Ambulancemen            in his vehicle on to the
                pitch to assist the ambulance personnel on foot with the
                removal of casualties.     After this action had been
                performed I decided to cease with sending any more
                vehicles on to the pitch as casualties were being moved
                quickly up the ramp and ambulances were available to
                take them to hospital.

Approx          Many offers of help were made to me from off-duty
1546            doctors, ambulance staff and fans.     As casualties were
                brought up the ramp from the pitch they were loaded into
                the ambulance and sent directly to hospital, or they
                were   sent  into   the Gymnasium area    for a medical
                assessment by the Doctor in attendance.     At this stage
                any casualty who appeared to be dead was sent for a
                medical assessment and certification if necessary.      I
                did not want to use the Ambulances for bodies when live
                casualties wj^ere still being removed.

1550            I   entered   the   Gymnasium   and   spoke   to   Chief
                Superintendent Addiss of the South Yorkshire Police.   I
                also saw and spoke to the Medical Team who had arrived
                from the Northern General and informed them both that I
                was going to clear the injured from the pitch first and
                then undertake to remove the injured from the Gymnasium.
                However I informed the Medical Team that if it was
                necessary and if they identified any             injured
                patient in the Gymnasium, then I would remove them as a
                priority if one of the Medical Team would contact me by
                the ramp.

1558            I walked amongst the lines of bodies in the Gymnasium
                and counted them to get an approximate number.

1600 (approx)   I left the Gymnasium and returned to the top of the ramp
                to assist and update myself.      I saw Assistant Chief
                Ambulance Officer Jones and told him to take charge of
                the clearing area at the top of the ramp.    I also asked
                him to get the entire area surrounding the ramp and the
                Gymnasium clear of the obstructions by vehicles which
                had   been  parked   in   that   area.  This   was   done
                magnificently by Mr Jones and Mr

                At this stage I told Ambulanceman             to go into
                the Gymnasium and assist and help with the injured, this
                was  because  Mr              is   an  extended  trained
paramedic and I thought he may be of assistance to the
doctors.

I returned to the Gymnasium and liaised for quite some
time with Chief Superintendent Addiss who then briefed
me as to the Police actions concerning the
identification of the bodies, the certification and
removal of the bodies and the recording of personal
belongings. He asked if we would be prepared to assist
with the removal of the bodies to various mortuarys and
he identified the Northern General, the Royal
Hallamshire and the Medico Legal Centre in Sheffield. I
agreed that the Ambulance Service would assist with this
matter and was informed that the Police now had to wait
for the arrival of Mr Popper, the Coroner, before any
action could be taken.

I left the Gymnasium and told Mr        Ito get Mr Jones
to locate spare body bags from the stand-by vehicles as
all the body bags from the Major Incident Vehicle had
now been used and there was a shortage.

I also received from Mr Jones, Mr        and Mr Dale an
update of the situation of the vehicles placed at stand­
by locations.

I sent Mr Jones to contact the Chief Ambulance Officer
at Ambulance Control, on his car telephone.

I spoke to the Chief Ambulance Officer and informed him
that there were 53 confirmed deaths and that more were
being certified. I was able to inform him that all live
casualties had left the ground and the gymnasium and had
arrived, or were mobile to hospitals.   11 bodies were
brought from the Leppings Lane Service Road by Ambulance
to the Gymnasium.

I returned to the Gymnasium, saw Chief Superintendent
Addiss who informed me that the original plan which we
had jointly agreed with regard the removal of bodies,
had been changed by the Coroner and that no-one was to
be removed to the Mortuary until the Coroner arrived. I
was aware at this stage of an Inspector Charles who now
appeared to be co-ordinating the recording of personal
belongings and the identification of bodies within the
Gymnasium. I knew that I did not need all of the
Ambulances I had available to me at that stage.

I decided to keep six Ambulances for the removal of the
dead. Mr Jones informed me that he had ten Ambulances
on stand-by outside the ground on Penistone Road North
and a further 20 Ambulances standing-by on at Herries
Road Bus Depot, with Mr Eason in charge. Mr Jones was
asked to organise six vehicles to be retained in the Car
Park around the Gymnasium which had now been cleared and
to inform the other authorities's vehicles in order for
them to return to their bases.
The vehicles retained were all South Yorkshire based. I
then transferred operations from the 'O' Gate area of
the Ground to the Gymnasium Car Park which was now
clear.

I sent Mr                    to the Northern General and the Royal
H a l l a m s h i r e t o d o a physical check with the Police
Information Officer of the number of bodies which had
been removed from the Ground during the early stages.
This was done in order to assess the body deployment
which I knew had been undertaken later.

I spoke briefly to Chief Superintendent Nesbitt outside
the Gymnasium.

The Chief Ambulance Officer arrived to be briefed on the
Ground operation, he visited the Gymnasium/temporary
mortuary, spoke briefly to Chief Superintendent Addiss
and Mole and then spoke to the crews who were in the
vicinity of the Gymnasium area.

        Actions of Station Officer P Higgins at Hillsborough Football Ground on
        Saturday 15th April lOflO.




        1400 hours                    I reported for duty at Longley Ambulance Station and
                                     along     with     Mr    Eason,       Ambulancemen           j            and
                                                       we    left     to    attend         the    Hillsborough
                                     Football Ground*


        1410                         1 arrived at Hillsborough and did a radio check both
                                     on    the Ambulance radio and on the hand                         set.    All
                                     radios were in good working condition.


        1415                         X liaised with Inspector Sewell of South Yorkshire
                                     Police and was accompanied by Mr Eason in line with
                                     our agreed plan.         1 visually checked the Ground from
                                     my position at the Spion Kop end of the pitch.                              1
                                     could     see    that   the    Nottingham          Forest     end    of   the
                                     Ground,    ie, the Spion Kop end, was almost full.                          I
                                     viewed     the   Leppings      Lane    Terraces        and       Stands   and
                                     could     see    that    there    were         very     few       Liverpool
                                     supporters in the Ground and that there was plenty
                                     of space to be taken up.              A>    some stage between 1415
                                     and   1450 1 remember Liverpool supporters urinating
                                     on us from the family enclosure in the Spion Kop.


       1450 (Approx)                 We moved our position from the Ambulance area at the
                                     ramp,    to the pitch in order to gain visual contact
                                     of the stadium and its crowd during the match.


       1503                          I saw what I thought to be a crowd problem occurring
                                     behind the goal in the Leppings Lane Terraces, Pens
                                     3 4 4.     I saw the crowd in Pen 3 surge forward.                        The
                                     entire width of Pen 3 commencing in the corner by
                                     the tunnel entrance and rippling right down to the
                                     far corner of Pen 3 by Pen 2.                      I asked Mr Eason to
                                    go up to check that area.

        1505:53                           I radioed Control and informed them that I thought
                                          there might          be a problem in              the Ground which may
                                          result in slight injuries,                   I asked them to send the
                                          second         stand-by        vehicle           into          the      area        of
                                          Hillsborough           Stadium.             Mr     Eason         returned          and
                                          informed me that he had identified one casualty with
                                          a leg injury, possibly broken.                      This casualty was to
                                          be   located around            the goal mouth area at Leppings
                                          Lane.       Mr Eason and Mr                               |needed Ambulance
                                          equipment       to     treat     and    remove           this    casualty          and
                                          because of the surge I had seen, I decided to return
                                          with     Mr    Eason     and     Mr                            accompanied          by
                                          Ambulanceman                     to assess the situation in more
                                          detail.


                                          1    left      Mr     Eason    along        with    Mr                       and    Mr
                                                                treating        the    casualty           with       the     leg
                                          injury        and    immediately        returned          to     the    Ambulance
                                          parked by the Spion Kop, to call Control and up date
                                          them of the situation.                  At that stage my hand set
                                          would not transmit or receive.


        1508                              Mr Eason informed me of the aggression and that more
                                          people were on the pitch near Pens 3 and A.                                  By this
                                          time     we     were     both     at    Leppings           Lane        and    I    was
                                          approaching the           fences.           The panic was obvious,                   I
                                          saw a         Police Woman       grabbed         through         the    fence      and
                                          held to the fence by the fans,                           I immediately went
                                          to      her         assistance        accompanied           by       two      Police
                                          Officers,           we had to physically drag her away                             from
                                           the grips of the fans who had grabbed her through
                                           the fences.




                                                                         6.16.1989         15:03                               P.

        1508:                                I was     returning to the Ambulance when my hand set
                                             began to receive a message from control.                              They asked
                                             me   to   assess      the    situation             at    the    Leppings      Lane
                                             area,     as     they    were      receiving              various      sets     of
                                             information from the Police and it was difficult for
                                             them to assess the Ambulance needs at that tine.


                                             I had returned to the Ambulance and was conversing
                                             with Control using the Ambulance radio during which
                                             time a uniformed Police Sergeant appeared and told
                                             me of the incident at the Leppings Lane Terraces and
                                             that he     thought there may be some fatalities.                               Re
                                             was extremely aggressive, was swearing and was in a
                                             state of panic. I informed him that I had called for
                                             10 more Ambulances and that they were on the way and
                                             that      this    vehicle         had         to        stop     as    a    Radio
                                             communications vehicle              until back             up    arrived.       He
                                             then left and returned to the pitch area.


                                             By this     time Mr Eason was the Incident Officer on
                                             the Ground and I was the Communications Officer in
                                             line with our plan.               I left the vehicle and went on
                                             to the pitch to ascertain whether or not there were
                                             fatalities       as   this was          the    first          time anyone      had
                                             mentioned        that,      and     it had certainly                  not   been
                                             apparent to either myself or Mr Eason at that moment
                                             in time.


        1511: 23                             Control contacted me              and    asked          for     an update.       I
                                             told them that therewere 50 to 100 people on                                   the
                                             pitch,     who     appeared         to have             been     squashed      and
                                             possibly winded.              I    was now running                towards      the
                                             Leppings Lane Terraces on the pitch.                             I saw people
                                             coming over the top of the fences and people lying
                                             on the grass area.            At this stage we jointly agreed
                                             that we had a serious incident on our hands.

                                            I left Mr Eason on the pitch and started to return
                                            towards       the Gymnasium where          I knew           from our plan
                                            that     I would      have    to set     up      a    Casualty       Clearing
                                           Post, Loading area and possible temporary mortuary.


      1513: 52                              I made a radio call to Control informing them that
                                            there may be some fatalities and                       informed them to
                                           send as many Ambulances as they could.                              1 informed
                                            them of       the difficulty of getting Ambulances                          into
                                           the     Leppings       Lane    entrance        and          asked    for     all
                                           vehicles to arrive at the Gymnasium entrance which
                                           is off Peaistone Road North.


                                           I then went into the Gymnasium and spoke to a Police
                                           Inspector,       1 did not       recognise him,              I told him of
                                           the situation as 1 saw it and he immediately cleared
                                           the     Gymnasium        of     all     Police          Officers,          after
                                           ascertaining who I was,


      1517: 22                             I again returned onto the pitch at Leppings Lane and
                                           spoke to Mr Bason (Video 1517).                       I tried to assess
                                           the casualty numbers, but it was impossible as there
                                           were far too many people milling around and I could
                                           not see through the Police,               fans and photographers.
                                           We required 6 or 7 additional vehicles to set up a
                                           shuttle service between the Ground and the hospital.
                                           1     returned    to     the    Ambulance         and       was     unable    to
                                           contact Control on the radio.                     The vehicle by this
                                           time had casualties in it which had been brought by
                                           the Police and fans.


                                           1   saw    a    male   youth    laying      in        the    Ambulance       who
                                           needed      resuscitation.            I     immediately             began     to
                                           resuscitate him.          When Mr Eason arrived I asked him
                                           to remove a female, from the back of the Ambulance
                                           because of the stressful situation she was in and
                                           the fact that she was having an asthmatic attack.

                                     Mr Eason placed her in the front attendants seat of
                                     the     Ambulance.              I    continued         to        resuscitate         the
                                     youth,       at    the same time directing people who were
                                     bringing          more    casualties            from       the    Ground       to    the
                                     Gymnasium and the St John’s Ambulance Room.                                   At this
                                     time many          people were being brought up                          the     ramp.
                                     They were all alive,                  no fatalities had arrived at

                                     being       physically         man-handled            by    fans,       these       were
                                     very    quickly          followed      by       what       appeared      to     be    an
                                     organised         evacuation          on    hoardings.              These      bodies
                                     were brought by fans and Police Officers jointly.                                      I
                                     directed them to take the bodies to the Gymnasium.


^1523                                I     saw    Mr     Hopkins,          the       Deputy       Chief       Ambulance
                                    Officer, arrive.                He quickly asked me for an update
                                    of the situation and then asked me about two bodies
                                    which        had    been    placed          on   the    ground        between         the
                                    Ambulance          and    the    rear       of    the       Spion Kop,         out of
                                    public gaze.              I told him that there were more bodies
                                    in the Gymnasium and that at that moment in time I
                                    assessed between 30 and 40 fatalities.


                                    Mr Eason arrived and returned with Mr Hopkins on to
                                    the pitch.           I continued to direct the fans into the
                                    Gymnasium          and    organise          casualties        into       Ambulances
                                    for evacuation to hospital.


   1530 (Approx)                    Superintendent Dale                  arrived,         I briefed him and he
                                    began        to     direct       Ambulances            in     preparation             for
                                    loading and evacuation.                      He took over my position
                                    and     I then proceeded back                    to    the pitch         to gain a
                                    further update assessment (Video 1535).                                  I went to
                                    the Leppings Lane Terraces and to the left hand side
                                    of the Ground, close to the Police box.

                                              I returned to the Gymnasium.            Mr Hopkins informed me
                                              to stay with Mr Dale          to oversee the loading            and
                                              evacuation of all casualties as they arrived.


                                              As far as I am concerned there were always enough
                                              Ambulances for      the     patientsas they arrived off the
                                              pitch.     No-one   had     to waitfor an Ambulance.          There
                                              was   a line of     Ambulances waiting to gain entrance
                                              into the Ground on Penistone Road North.


                                              I stayed at that position until all live casualties
                                              had left the Ground and the Gymnasium and had gone
                                              to    hospital.          Ambulancemen     Edwards      and
                                              assisted     me     in     assessing      the    patients       for

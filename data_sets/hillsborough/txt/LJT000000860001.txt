                  The Football Stadia A dvisory Design Council was established
FOOTBALL STADIA   in August 1990 on the recommendation o f Lord Justice Taylor
                  and is funded jo in tly by the Football League and the Football
                                                                                    '


ADVISORY DESIGN   Association. Its aim, in publishing booklets such as this and
                  by developing further research, is to encourage improvements
                  in standards and a greater awareness o f stadium design. For
        COUNCIL   more information about the FSADCplease refer to page 172.
The safety and indeed the lives o f football spectators, as well
as their comfort and enjoyment, depend heavily upon the
design and maintenance o f the stadia provided. Appendix Two
                                                                          FOREWORD
of this bibliography tabulates the long, sad series o f disasters         by the Rt. Hon.
caused wholly or p a rtly by defective structures.
                                                                          Lord Justice Taylor
In my Final Report on the Hillsborough disaster I therefore
recommended that an A dvisory Design Council be set up to
research and give advice on the design o f new stadia and the
improvement o f those presently in use. Football clubs and
local authorities together with their architects and engineers
would thereby have access to the most advanced information
and be assisted in using available funds w isely to achieve
high quality stadia, safe and convenient for spectators.

I am glad that the Football S tadia A dvisory Design Council
has indeed been set up and is already producing authoritative
design guidelines.

This bibliography is an invaluable index o f publications on
a ll aspects o f football stadia. I t thus fulfils the need for a fu ll
and reliable guide to the available information and expertise.
I am sure it w ill prove useful and congratulate those whose
hard work has produced it.

In conclusion, I wish the FSADC, and a ll those dedicated to
raising the standards o f our football stadia, success in their
efforts.

                A. Scope

to              This is the first comprehensive bibliography of football stadia
                                                                                      INTRODUCTION
                referencecs ever compiled in the United Kingdom, and thus the
                FSADC has faced a number of difficult choices as to which
                subjects to include and which to omit.
on                Clearly the study of football stadia covers a wide number of
                disciplines, and often finds common ground with related topics
f               such as indoor sports arenas, crowd behaviour and the demands
                of other spectator sports. Inevitably, therefore, the bibliography
                extends beyond the limits of football stadia.
'e                The majority of references date from 1980-90, although some
s               pre-1980 entries have been included where deemed to be of
        i       significance, together with any 1991 references catalogued in
                time for publication.
I,                The bibliography is international in its coverage, with no
,               restriction on the form of material or the language of
'ort i          publication. This is reflected by the inclusion of commercially
                published monographs, government reports and circulars,
        '       British and International standards, conference proceedings,
                papers presented at conferences and seminars, journal articles,
ls r,           translations, audio visual materials, statutes, statutory
        I       instruments, and some important ‘grey literature’.
■uls,              Each piece of legislation cited has been validated to ensure its
D.,         j   currency and applicability. Any out of print documents may be
            I   borrowed from The British Library; additional details are pro­
                vided under the heading E. How to Obtain Publications.
                   The Council fully intends to improve and update the selection
                in future editions of the bibliography and will continue to
                monitor all known sources of information.
and
                B . M e th o d o lo g y

           Nineteen commercial on-line databases have been searched in
           addition to a number of printed abstracts, indexes, and cata-
nt      | logues held in various parts of the UK. The holdings of diverse
           organisations have been made available and this has facilitated
           recourse, where expedient, to some of the documents cited. A
tish ( number of organisations and individuals have also contributed
e       | by kindly donating material.
fish         Cataloguing practice largely conforms to the Anglo American
           Cataloguing Rules, Edition 2. The majority of citations are anno­
           tated. American spellings are not used unless they represent
il,        words used in the title field.
'ills,       Where it was possible for the FSADC to view the documents,
n       \the complilers have provided a summary of the contents. In
       1 other cases the Council has placed some reliance on existing
           abstracts and keywords. The aim has been to provide helpful
           annotations and sufficient and consistent bibliographical details
           to enable users of this publication to assess relevance and sub­
            sequently acquire items of interest.
              Following allocation of sequential document identification
            numbers, the content of each entry has been individually
\          examined and indexed in accordance with its subject content.

A miscellany of information and advice is available from libraries
and information centres. The UK's network incorporates major
libraries such as the British Library, public and academic
libraries, and a variety of special libraries housed in government
departments, research organisations and other institutions
(such as RIBA). Out of print items can be accessed by this
method.
   In certain cases, documents can be purchased either direct
from the initiating organisation or publisher, or orders can be
placed through a bookseller. When ordering items, quote the full
bibliographical details, including the International Standard
Hook Number (ISBN).
   Please note that the FSADC is unable to provide copies of
documents cited.

                   Inquiry in February 1971 showed no proven link between disaster and Rangers scoring
                   a late goal,as widely reported subsequently.

           surfaces and poor policing may have worsened the situation.

                                  ADVISORY DESIGN
                                      COUNCIL
             ‘...to provide an authoritative source of knowledge for all those involved in the design
                                           and construction of stadia...’
                        Report of the Technical Working Party for Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report




      Serving the needs of football
      In August 1990 the Football Association and the Football League combined to implement Lord
      Justice Taylor’s recommendation that an Advisory Design Council be set up. The Council’s aim
      is to encourage higher standards of stadium design, promote wider knowledge and foster
      research.
         The Council’s Chairman is Gwilym Roberts CBE, F.Eng., Chairman of Acer Group Ltd and a
      past President of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
         The five members are: Prof. Leonard Maunder OBE, F.Eng. (Dept, of Mechanical Engineering,
      University of Newcastle), Dr. Chris Nicholson PhD, C.Eng, MIM (Deputy Director at the Research
      & Laboratory Services Division, Health and Safety Executive), Geraint John (Chief Architect &
      Head of Technical Unit for Sport at the Sports Council), Alan Butterfield FRICS, FIHT, ACI Arb
      (Senior Partner at George Corderoy & Co) and Simon Inglis (journalist, author and member of
      the Football Licensing Authority).
         The Council's Executive Officer is Christine Gausden, MCIOB, to whom all enquiries should be
      made at the address below.
         The Council is privileged to draw upon the expertise of experienced individuals who form its
      Architects Working Party; Ernest Atherden, Duncan MacLean, Rod Sheard, and Terry Ward, and
      its Engineers Working Party: BK Bardhan-Roy, Stephen Morley, Bill Reid and John Thornton.
      Each group plays a leading role in the drawing up of publications, as do numerous other experts
      and organisations whose support for the FSADC’s aims is greatly appreciated, particularly the
      firms of Nabarro Nathanson for legal advice and Milne Ross for financial advice.

      Publications
      If you would like to receive notice of all FSADC publications, or would like to order
      further copies of this Bibliography, please apply in writing to the Executive Officer. Cheques
      for £ 3 7 .5 0 (inc. p&p) should be made payable to the FSADC.
         Forthcoming titles under preparation during 1991-2 include the following topics:

          • Feasibility Studies • Public Address Systems • Toilets • Roofing • Steelwork
             • Turf Systems     • Police Facilities • Appointment of Professional Advisors
        • Stadia Costs • Stadia Criteria for various Leagues and Competitions • Legal Issues

      Register
      The FSADC is in the process of compiling a register of consultants, manufacturers and
      suppliers with experience of, or interest in, all stages of stadium design, listed under their
      areas of specialisation. Extracts from this register will be freely available, on request, to all
      members of the Football League and Football Association. Outside bodies will be asked to
      pay a search fee.
        If you wish your company to be included on the FSADC register and have not yet received
      registration forms, please contact the Executive Officer at the address below.

the     body         of    a white             male,          but       I do       not     know       how       it     had       got    to       my    end

of    the       pitch.           The       face          of    the       body        was       covered          with        a    coat       of    some

Almost          straight             after          this       I saw          t wo      young     lads          running           the       length          of

the     stretcher               up    to       me    and       I saw          that        the    face       of       the        person       on       the

stretcher             was       covered             by    a    police          helmet.            Those           carrying             the

stretcher             asked          me    where             they       should          put     the    body.            I told          them          to    p ut

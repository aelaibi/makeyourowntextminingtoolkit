  THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION - REQUEST FOR A MEETING

  Mr Goulbourn of the FSA has been in touch about this meeting and
  we have agreed that it will take place on Friday 30 March at
  9.30 am. Would you provide pre-briefing at 9.00 amplease.

  I would be grateful if written briefing would reach me by close of
  play the night before.
  You will have seen the letter of 2 March from Mr Kershaw of the
  National Federation Football Supporters' Club which was copied to
  you yesterday. I have spoken to Mr Mould about this and advised
  him to ignore our request for advice. I have been in contact by
  phone with Mr Kershaw and he has confirmed that he and his
  colleagues will be along on 30 March.

NOTE OF A MEETING HELD WITH THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FOOTBALL
SUPPORTERS CLUBS ON 21 JULY 1988_______________________________



Present:   Lord Ferrers
           Mr Dorrell MP
           Mr Kershaw    )
           Mrs Hartland )    NFFSC
           Mr Todd       )
           Mr Norbury
           Mr Godfrey
           Ms Adams

The NFFSC raised 2 issues during the meeting, lack of consistency
in the police response to supporters travelling under the aegis of
the NFFSC, and membership schemes.

On the question of lack of police consistency, the NFFSC said that
they had written to chief officers last year introducing them to
the Federation sticker, and explaining that coaches carrying that
sticker would be carefully stewarded and unlikely to cause any
trouble. Chief officers were asked to notify the Federation if
any of their coaches did cause any problem.

NFFSC acknowledged that most forces recognised the stickers and
were on good terms with the Federation, but every now and then
there were incidents - such as one that had involved Wolverhampton
Wanderers Supporters - which gave cause for concern. A copy of a
letter about this incident is attached.

There were generally some 12-15 such incidents a season, and clubs
were advised to notify the chief officer concerned immediately.
An apology was usually forthcoming, but the damage had already
been done. It would be a tremendous encouragement to more
responsible behaviour amongst supporters, if the police reaction
could be more consistent.

Lord Ferrers emphasised the problems facing the police in trying
to maintain order outside the grounds - particularly on BR
property, and motorway service stations - but agreed that it would
be useful for him to write to ACPO drawing their attention to the
badge scheme, and to the NFFSC's concern that law abiding
supporters should not be alienated. This offer was gratefully
accepted.

                                        /The NFFSC's concern....
                                 -1-
FI.

  The NFFSC's concern on the proposed national membership scheme#
  was that it simply would not work. The recent incidents in
  Germany showed that even the most careful handling of admission to
  matches could not prevent trouble outside grounds. Furthermore,
  experience of computerised card systems on the Continent had shown
  that the gate system would be physically wrecked within a week.
  The delegation made it clear that they were in favour of
  membership schemes, but only where they were workable. They were
  particularly concerned that DOE did not intend to involve the
  NFFSC on the working group which was to discuss membership
  schemes. Lord Ferrers said that he would ensure that their
  concern was mentioned to DOE.

  In conclusion NFFSC indicated that they would welcome a further
  meeting in due course.

Thank you for phoning yesterday to agree a date for your meeting
with Lord Ferrers.
This is simply to confirm that the meeting has been arranged for
30 March at 9.30 am a little earlier than you had suggested, but I
hope that it is convenient.

I have also been in touch with Mr Kershaw of the National
Federation of Football Supporters' Club and he has confirmed that
the meeting is convenient for him. I have arranged for him to
have a room from 9.00 am so that he can discuss matters with his
colleagues and you are naturally free to use this facility too.

Lord Ferrers has asked me to thank you for your letter of 2 March
and to confirm that he will be pleased to meet you and your
colleagues on Friday 30 March at 9.30 am. Given that you and your
colleagues will not have the opportunity to talk beforehand I have
arranged for you to have a room from 9.00 am.

    Dear Lord Ferrers,

    You may recall that some eighteen months ago in company
    with my Member of Parliament Stephen Dorrell we had a brief
    meeting.
    We would be grateful if we could now make arrangements to
    have a more detailed meeting with you in light of the Taylor
    Report recommendations.

    We would be quite happy to share a meeting with representatives
    from the Football Supporters Association if you so wish.
    I look forward to hearing from your secretary in the very
    near future with a choice of alternative dates.

    Thank you in anticipation.

    Kind regap

   Youz's sincerely




   A. M. KERSHAW.

I am writing in reply to your letters of 6 February to the Home
Secretary and to the Minister for Sport in which you sought
meetings to discuss the implementation of the Final Report into
the Hillsborough Disaster.

The Minister of State, Lord Ferrers, whose particular
responsibilities encompass safety at sports grounds, police and
fire matters, would be happy to meet representatives of the FSA
and the Federation of Football Supporters Clubs. Perhaps you will
contact me on 01 273 2468 so that we can try to arrange a
convenient time and date.
Your letter provides a general area of discussion but I am sure
that there are specific points that you will wish to raise with
the Minister. It will be helpful if you would be kind enough to
provide a list of those items in advance of the meeting. I would
also appreciate a list of those attending and it will be helpful
if you could indicate their positions in the respective
organisations.

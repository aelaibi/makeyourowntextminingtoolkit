                I am a single              person      residing at the a bo ve addresj

                P olice        on M o n d a y 23 O ctober             1989.

                At a bout        five      to three       on the a f t e r n o o n o f /Saturday 15 April                        1989, I

                took up a seat              in the S o ut h S t a n d a t Hi 1 3jiborough.                      T he P ol ic e     control

                box was above me and to my                        left.        ^PreviyBus to this             I had been work in g

                in the kiosk            nearby.         It was my            ir^ten/ion to w a tc h the m a t c h from the

                S o u t h S tand for the             next f iftee n mi\/ttes.                 My c o l l e a g u e , _______       I cant

                remember         his surname was              running          the kiosk.

                M ys el f and                used to take              turns w a tc h i n g       the m a t ch for fift ee n

                minutes,         while      the other         ran the kiosk.

                I saw the game              start at three              o'clock and          it was very s ho r tl y after

                that,     when       I saw the first              person who             climbed over         the front          perimeter
                                                                                                            PAGE       2
                                                                                                            33544-

fence    from    pen three and drop onto                the track          behind the goal.                 From

that    point,    my a t t e n t i o n was drawn        to the       central       pens.         A ft er    the

first    person had got over             the     fence,      others    f ol l ow e d a nd the track

area    behind Bruce G r o b e l a a r ' s      goal    was filling          up w it h      people.             It

was at about          ten    past    three w hen      I could see that there were                      people

being    laid out on the ground                in the area of the goal,                  o b v i ou s ly

injured.        I had       prev io us ly o bt a in e d a basic first aid                cer ti fi ca te and

thought     I m ay be able           to help     in some way.          I left my seat and went

straight       onto    the    pitch.     I was       the third or f ourth             person to go onto

the    pitch,    thats apart          from the L iv er po ol         s u pp or te rs who         had got out

from the       pens.        At the time       of going       onto    the    pitch     1 saw that

some    ball    boys had taken down an a d v e r t i s i n g               hoar di ng and were

carrying an       injured          person towards       the H op end of the ground.

my colleague          from the kiosk          had    come onto       the    pitch at        the same            time

as me,    and our first             thoughts were       to get a no t he r         hoar di ng       so that we

could a ssist         injured       people.             and    I ran to the Kop end of the

g r ou nd to get a hoarding.                 We d i d n ’t bother      trying       to get a hoarding

from the sides          because       they are       s e c u r el y f ixed to the sic^fs and w ou ld

have    been very dif fi cu lt          to    remove.               and     I r i p pe/r down a hoarding

from    in front       of the Hop,       to the       left as you          look>ft     the Kop,            near to

the N o rt h Stand.           We    ran back    towards       the Le p a ^ g s      Lane end.              We    ran

d i ag o n a l l y a cross    the    pitch,    towards       &he    airner flag        in b et we en the

West S ta nd and the S ou th Stand.                   As we got back             to the L e p p i ng s Lane

end,    a mongst all         the    confusion,       I h eard a l ou d/shout           of    “Over         here".

I looked across and saw a male                      person    l yi n# on the         pitch w i t h two or

three    people       standing       round.    The    personas         lying       on the e ig h te e n yard

line,    on the S o ut h S t an d side o f t hs^sitch.                     The    person was about

f o u r t e e n or fifteen yards         from theygoal             line.     We went a cr os s and

h el pe d pick the man up a nd               pla c e/ h im on the hoarding.                 On    looking at

the man,       he was       still and appelfred in a very bad way.                          His     eyes were

       open,      but just       staring      into space.          His     lips and his face was turning

       blue.                   myself a nd four other             lads then carried this man to the

       far    corner of the            pitch,     in be tw ee n the H op end and the N o r t h S t a n d.

       W h e n we got         to the    far   corner      s o m e bo d y said       “Over    there",       I think       it

       was an a m b u l an ce ma n,       a nd he    i ndicat ed towards              the    concrete area

       alongside         the Stand,        that    n ormally gives a c ce s s           to the       pitch.        We

       placed the hoarding               down a l o ng si de      two or three          others that were

       a l r e a d y there,      near    to an a rea of sand.               After      placing       the    hoarding

       down,     s omebody       came a cross and had a quick glance at the                               person on the

       hoarding and said               "Cant you bring           one w it h a bit more              life    next time".

       The    person who         said this wore a uniform,                  he was      either a P o l i c e m a n or

       possibly an a m b u l an ce ma n.            We    left    that    person on the h o ar di ng and

       returned to the Lep pi ng s Lane end.                       I w o u l d esti ma te          that    I help ed

T b fi2- c arry this         person at some        time    b et w ee n t h r e je    f if te en and three          twenty.

       The    person who         I helped to        carry was a wpri te m a l e a n d a good six feet

       in height.            He was a well         b u i l t lad w ia h a large             beer    belly.    He had

       black     hair w h i c h was a bit over               coj/lar length a nd was                very u n t i d y ,

       either g re as y or very wet.                 He dad not wear                glasses or have a ny facial

       hair.          I w ou ld estimate        thAt hre was a g e d        in h i s mid twenties.                 I

       cannot         remember a n y t hi ng about         his    clothing,

       Some mi nu te s         later,    I cant     be more       precise,          I assj/§ted      in carrying

       an ot he r      person from the L eppings Lane                  end to thre corner              in b et we en the

      K op end and the N o r t h S t a n d .              Our a t t e n t ion ywas d rawn to the              penalty

       area     in front        of the Liverpool           goal.       The y e      were still       people       lying on

       the g round           in the area a r o u n d the         penally spot.                     a nd    I assisted

       in carrying a no t h e r male              person from A h e         a r e a a r o u n d the       penalty spot.

       A mo n g s t    the    people    carrying     this     hoar di ng was a Poli ce ma n.                 He

       a p p e a r e d to be a P o l i c e m a n    in a u t h o r i t y a n d he wore a flat               cap.        At

             In this a re a behind the stand,                    there are      two grsy st on e walls,             with

             already      in the a re a       by that time,           we had to       place      the h o ar di ng       on top

             of the two stone walls.                 I cant         remember wfytZi time          it was        then,    but       it

             n either     can I remember any deta/ls                   of his     clothing.          The    one    thing

 (   /       but    I may have        wore track suit            bottoms, navy blue            in colour.           I also

            wore     training        shoes,    either white           or black       ’A d id a s" t r ai ni ng     shoes.

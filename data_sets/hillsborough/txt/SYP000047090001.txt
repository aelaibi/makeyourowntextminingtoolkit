SAFETY IN SPORTS STADIUMS

1 . I am a third year student environmental health officer and as
     part of my course must produce a project. I have chosen safety
     in sports stadia as my subject and ask you for your help and
     for any information which may help me.

2.   My desk top research has revealed that this topic is nothing
      new and that government   reports date back to 1946, in fact many
      of  the recommendations   of the Taylor Report have been well
      documented in previous reports and legislation.

3.   Could you please pass comment on the following:

     a.   UJhy have recommendations regarding ground safety made in the
           UJheatly Report 1973 been generally ignored?

     b.   UJhat is your view on the Green Guide and the Safety of Sports
           Grounds Act 1975.     UJhy have these recommendations fallen
           on deaf ears?

     c.   UJhy are some clubs    acting now   on the Taylor Report when
          it has no legal power and the       associated legislation has
          not passed through parliament?

     d.   Should clubs spend money bringing the terraces up to a safe
          standard when the recommendation of the Taylor Report will
          lead towards all seater stadiums?

     e.   Has the subject of     ground safety received less attention
          due to the problems    of hooliganism and public order, are
          they related?

4.   I do not wish to reiterate the findings of previous reports
     on ground safety but produce a critical but balanced document
     taking into consideration the financial implications as well
     as attitudes and the will to get things done.

5.   I am in the early      stages   of this project and any   help would
     be appreciated.

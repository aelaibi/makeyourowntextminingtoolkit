                                              of
                                                                                                     Liverpool,
            WILL S A Y AS FOLLOWS



     I am           years old.              My date           of b i r t h     is
                                                                                                           I travelled
     to Hillsborough with ray friend,
                                                                                           by     car,      leaving          at
     a pproximately            11.00        a.m.         We    got     lost     on       the      way    but      finally

     got     to     the        ground        at     about          2. 4 0     p.m.        and      parked         at     the

     Nottingham          Forest        end.         We    walked          round      to      the     Liverpool          end

     and there were a lot of people                             there and a lot of people asking

  if we had             spare     tickets.              There w e r e         a few        Liverpool           lads who

 were        selling           spare        Nottingham             Forest       end        tickets          and      there

 seemed to be plenty of those tickets about.                                               You could see that

 the       pe o p l e   were     getting           crushed           against         the     fence         leading       to

 the turnstile.                 People were shouting at the police,                                      asking them

 if        they, could          section           people       off.          They        we r e n ' t    taking         any

 no ti ce      and      didn't        seem       to know           what      to do.          I could          only      see

 mounted          po l ic e     until       we     got        very     close        to      the      gate      and      the

m ounted po l i c e were mo v i n g                     their horses            around,           cau s i n g people

to     jump       out     of    the way           and    cau s i n g        further       panic.           The    crowd

that        I was       in was         at    the    right          hand      side     of       the      front     gate,
facing the gate.




As    we     got     close       to    the        turnstile,           a policeman              grabbed         my     arm

and    told me          to go     towards           the gate           and we        suddenly            found       that

we    were        through        the    gate        and       in     the     ground.            Th e r e      were      no

police or          stewards           inside       and everyone was hea d i n g                         towards        the

centre       tunnel.           As we got           to     the      end of       the       tunnel,        my    friend
        on the left of the tunnel and I was going towards                                       the wall.

He told m e quickly                to move    to the left but it was impossible                              to

move     at   all due         to     the crush.         I was we a r i n g        a leather jacket
                                                                                                              /


w h i c h got       caught on        the wall and ho o k e d over it.                    Fortunately,

it then came unhooked and I was cat a pu l t e d                            to the right of              the

wall.         I was      carried down.              You     couldn't        move     and       there    were

people collapsing all round me.                           I have since seen in the paper

 that I was about 5 rows f ro m the front.                             Everyone was screaming

 and    shouting         at    the    police    to     stop      the      game     and     there       was    a

gate by me at the front w i t h a policeman standing by                                        it but all

he     was    do in g    was       shouting    at     eve y o n e    to     push     ba c k     which    was

 impossible.             Some      people    tried     to    get     over     the fence but             they

were thrown back in by the police*

-I went _to- Whistori-JIospital^on                   t h e _ M o n d a y _ a s ^ _____




 I work       as     a                  in                                                 I    have    been

 unable to return to work since the incident.                                    I think I'm going

 to hand       my     notice       in as     I can't        envisage        feeling        up    to going

 back    in     the      forseeable         future.         I   am     on   sleeping           tablets       to

 enable me to sleep.
as    X got down onto the p i t c h there were 3 lads who w e r e sitting

there     sa y i n g    that     there   father     had    died.      There     were    dead

bodies all around me.               I can't get it out of ray mind.
                                                                                           /




I have n o w retrieved ray jacket but                 it is ripped.          It cost £170

and was       only about 4 months           old.     Also ray training        shoes wh i c h

cost £40 and we r e only a fortnight old were ripped.



In    ray view,        had   the police     opened       the gate,    lives    would    have

been saved.            The gate onto      the pitch that was near wh e r e I was

standing       had      people    crushed    against       it   but   the   police     would

still not open it, had they opened it earlier,                        lives w o u l d have

b e e n saved.

I    should    add ,that_. ray .t i c k e t .was   for    the part-of       the j>addock^J‘
                                                                                          -

think was         called Westgate,       but I couldn't get near the Westgate

lucastile and just got pushed through the gate with the crowd.

                 were      told that a serious                   incident was            taking       place at        the

                 H i l l s b o r o u g h G r o u n d and we were               to travel         there     straight         away,.

We a r r i v e d at         the    ground at about 3 . 2 5 pm              (1525)      the same        day to -.be

perhaps         50    in all., 'all of whom              then j u s t      stood around.              There       ...

appeared         to    be no       leade r s h i p at that          time.

After       about      15 m i n u t e s    all    the Dog H a n d l e r s      were     told to        take     their

dog      iiAo    the, ground.             This we .did but           this was a mistake,                   it was :

obvious         to me even then that we s h o u l d not have                           gone     into the ground

with      dogs and this was                echoed       by a .South Yorks.             Dog S e r g e a n t who

orde r e d      us out a g a i n         immediateiy„          This     we did.

To     clarify one           point,       1 -feel we        should not        have gone         in wit h dogs as

i t wa s bee om i ng o b v i o u s t ha t so me t h i n g mo r e seri o us t ha n a bit                          of

public         disorder        was      going    on.     A l t h o u g h at    that    time we        had been told

nothing,         but     from what         civilians who were                 leaving     the    ground told us

and      the    look     of fear and disbelief                  - their        eyes    gave away,           it' was

q   bv io u s l y v e r y    serious.

Once      outside        again       the dogs were           r e t urned      to their vans and              once

a g a i n we just           s tood around,         for want         of a . b e t t e r word,         and    then via

the      radio       system,       we    heard    that      eight    people were          dead and a

tempo rary rno r t uary was                to b e s e t up .

At     this     point,       a l t h o u g h we had not         been told anything               officially,            it

was     obvious        it was a serious                incident.        I felt        useless     and       because      of

this      1 approached             two S o u t h Yo r k s h i r e    Inspectors; to           request        that we

be us e d as Police                of f ice r s t o h e 1 p in any way we               c o u 1d .     0 ne .t o t a 11v

ignored me and               the     other      told me      to wait       where      I was     for    further

         L iv e r p o o l    fans       had    invaded the       pitch.         I told some what         had happened.

         T h e y were        obviously          shoc k e d but     glad to know why things               were

         happening.             I think         it was wrong        not    to   tell    people    the    truth of. the

         matter       and     treat       them as adults.

         F r o m my     point       of view one           thing was       very appar e n t - t,he. lack of

         Forest       end and           the    lack     of any   leadership.

         The    two     points- m e n t i o n e d above were              in no way       responsible       for   the

  RECOLLECTION OF FACTS RELATING TO HILLSBOROUGH SISASTER
  BY PC 1834 WHARVELL (O <5)75



  I am a Police Dog Handler of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary at present attached to
  the Force Support Department.

  At 7.30 am, Saturday 15 April 1989, I paraded for duty at Headquarters and then
  travelled to Niagra, the Headquarters of the South Yorkshire Police, Dog and Mounted
 Section, where togather with other Officers, I was briefed re the Nottingham Forest ■
 Liverpool F.A. Cup Semi-Final to be played at Hillsborough at 3 pm the same day.

 The briefing lasted approximately three quarters of an hour and then together with
 Pc 1496 SCARFF, a South Yorkshire Dog Handler, with whom I was double crewed, we
 commenced our designated duties which were to patrol the Bus Station and surrounding
 streets on public disorder, this we did also at times covering the Liverpool fsnS ex;
 from the railway station, where they were loaded onto buses and taken from the Static
 to the ground.


 At 1.30 pm I was involved in an arrest and at about 3.20 pa, whilst dealing with thij
 at a City Centra Police station, we were told that a serious incident            taking plac
 at the Hillsborough Ground and we were to travel there straight away.

 We arrived at the ground at about 3.25 pm the same day to be greeted at the Nottinghe
 Forest end    by several other Officers, perhaps 50 in all, all of which then just      *
 stood around.     There appeared to be no leadership at that time.

 After about 15 minutes all the Dog Handlers were told to take their dog into the
 ground.    This we did but this was a mistake, it was obvious to me even then that we
should not have gone into the ground with dogs and this was echoed by a South Yorks
Dog Sergeant who ordered us out again immediately.       This we did.

To clarify one point,     I feel we should not have gone in with dogs as it was    becoming
oovious that something more    serious than a bit of public disorder was going     on.
Although at that time, we had been told nothing, but from what civilians who were
leaving the ground told us and the look of fear and disbelief - their eyes gave
away, it was obviously    very serious.

Once outside again the    dogswere returned to their vans and once again we just stood
around, for want of a better word, and then via the radio system, we heard that eight
people were dead and a temporary mortuary was to be set u p .

At this point, although we had not been told anything officially, it was obvious it
was a serious incident.     I felt useless and because of this I approached two South
Yorkshire Inspectors to request that we be used as Police Officers to help in any way
we could.     One totally ignored me and the other told me to wait where I was for
further instructions.                                            1-------------
 After . short while all the Dog W l „ ,     including ny3elf, w. „              ^
 ground wl,h dogs and told t0 llBe up m    the pitoh f M .ng         NotUngham rorest'

 supporters to prevent a pitch invasion.     Agaln w. had &88n told „othing and ^

 was even worse ,a» the fact that the Forest supporters had been told nothing end
 thought the Liverpool fans had invaded the pitch.          I told some what had happened

 They were obviously shocked but glad to know why things wore happening.         I think'

It was wrong not to tell peopie the truth of the matter and treat them as adults.

            30 minutes we were ordered out of the ground where myself and Pc SCARFF
resumed back to the City Centre and public order duties.

My tour of duty finished at approximately 10 pm the same day.


From my point of view one thing was very apparent - the lack of information given
to myself and other Officers at the Nottingham Forest end and -the lack of any
leadership,


The ,wo points mentioned above were in no way responsible for the terrible incident
but if we had been given better information and good and responsible leadership
afterwards, we may have reacted better and possibly saved lives.

        Halfords        is the         supermarket,        G a t eway.         It    could be seen that               persons

        outside Halford^                off Pen i s t o n e Road.           Officers          from the M o u n t e d

        B r a n c h were       d e l e g a t e d and t o g ether        w i t h o f f icers       from my serial             I

        attended        on the         industrial       site as         potential          trouble was         r e p o r t e d and

        an a s s i s t a n c e    call       received.       Once       onto      the     site,    I saw several

        hundred        fans,      drinking        beer an d       lager     etc.,         most    can be said were

        peaceful        if noisy.             Most were      under       the      influence        of drink;        several

        fans were at             the    doors     to the G a t e w a y S u p e r m a r k e t .        The    special         train

        arrived        s l i g h t l y a h e a d of schedule and we were                      informed that           there

        were    a p p r o x i m a t e l y 430 on board.              All    wer e        quiet,    well     b e h a v e d and

        presented         no     p r o b l e m s w h a t s oever.       It was       deci d e d that my serial

        of the ground,              looking       for drink,         pubs,        etc.,      together w i t h other

        o f f i c e r s we     attempted        to turn most            of the       fans back        towards       the

        g r o u n d but      despite         our a s surance        that     no     pubs were open,            fans      still

T h e fans    fro m the         special       train were        escorted           by other      serials and

h o r s e m e n an d six       of m y   officers who           tagged along w i t h            the agr e e m e n t of

Inspector Ellis.                However       due to the         large       numbers       on the        grass verge

outs i d e H a l f o r d s     on P e n i s t o n e Road,      d r i n k i n g and the        large      numbers of

p eople still         in the area,            together w i t h two officers,                   I remained at my

location.          It w a s     now well       passed        1400 h ours and fans wer e a r r i v i n g

by coaches,         seve r a l      of w h i c h were        dropping        off    in P e n i s t o n e Road.          My

officers       p r e v e n t e d at     least six coaches              fro m d r o pping       passe n g e r s    off

the     coaches,      in P e n i s t o n e Roa d near W a d s l e y Bridge a n d                 d i r e c t e d the m

to the d r o p off           points      in Halifax Road.               The moo d of          the    fans at this

time was       excited,         jovial,       but the        vast m a j o r i t y were        still       drink i n g

canned beer         etc   j.    T h e r e were       large    numb e r s     of fans w a l k i n g        to w a r d the

ground,      when     I 'heard over the               personal      radio a request              for a gate to
                                                                                              X   \                    •

officers       s h o u l d ^ t r y a n d join up w i t h         the    rest       of the     serial^who                     |j

sh o u l d be m a k i n g      their wa y to C l a y w h e e l s        Lane       for meal,        during     the           1

match.

The time w o u l d        be a p p r o a c h i n g    1450 hours        en    route     to the       ground we

were a s k e d     to a s s i s t     other    officers who            had been called              to a pub near

Claywheels         Lane      after      fans had star t e d         fight i n g      inside.         Several      fans

were     injured      but were          ushe r e d awa y by friends.                 The    incident was

calmed and we            continued        towards C l a y w h e e l s Lane.             Again       I was

monitoring         requests         for a gate,         Leppings        Lan e end to be opened.

Several      such     reque s t s were made             before      I heard the            i n s t r u c t i o n for

the gate       to be opened.              By this time           three       of my serial           that was

my s e l f and two        c o n s t a b l e s were     now at C l a y w h e e l s     Lane.         My    idea was

to have our meal               as d i r e c t e d on the       operational           briefing        notes,      then

to find      the    rest of the           serial       and    regroup        ready for        the    second

phase.       However         at C l a y w h e e l s Lane,      a n o t h e r mobile        serial were
present,       Insp«ctor Wardle amongst                    them.        The     request      fro m G r o u n d

Control       was     r e c e i v e d for all      serials,       outside and at C l a y w h e e l s Lan

to go s t r a i g h t     to L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.                       At    this    togethe

w i t h other        officers      I ran to a P o l i c e         van a n d t r a v e l l e d to        the grou

along L e p p i n g Lane         end,   passed several                seri a l s    of P o l i c e   o f ficers.

At this       point      no one u n d e r s t o o d or could see what was                       h appening.

Once    o u t s i d e L e p p i n g Lane    I met     up w i t h       Inspector E l l i s and togeths

we c o m m a n d e e r e d other     c o nstables a n d for m e d a cordon o u t s i d e                     the

outer gates at L e p p i n g s Lane.                 There were           several       h u n d r e d fans

outs i d e w a n t e d    to gain access.             I then w ent            to the a w a y fans            entras

running a l o n g s i d e      the River Don,          towa r d s        the are a m a r k e d A / G         behira

the W e s t    stand.        I was      outside      the g r o u n d w h e n bodies were                being

brought       out     of the     concertina         type gates           near      the a r e a A/G.          Seven

persons w ere          being     laid down near            the    edge towards            the    river,       seve

of w h o m    lo o k e d dead.       Fans were        looking          on shoc k e d an d a n g e r e d ,          an;

he l p e d to f o r m a cordon of             constables          to shield the             injured a n d            j

dieing.        I then       tried to usher           fans       out    of the a rea who w e r e              t ryin

to find friends,             family,       etc.,     out    of    the ground to the p e r i m e t e r

gates,       Leppings       Lane    end.     Several        fans       were abusive,            punching       out

an d b l a m i n g    (me/police)        for what      had happened.                 At this         point    I wa

still     unaware        of what     had ocurred.               Ambulances          were a r r i v i n g an d       I

went    into     the a r e a     behind the West            s tand A/ G and together w i t h son

of the L i v e r p o o l     fans    tried to usher              the     leaving fans           t h r o u g h the

gates     leading        to the area        1-16,     to en a b l e       the      emergency         services       t

get on,       unhamp e r e d .      Before moving           into       the are a A/ G         I attempted           t
move    on four        or five men who were                s tood      next     to the      railings

'watching*.            These men turned out to                   be    club stewards who h a d take

off their        i d e n t i t y badges     because        of    threats        of violence m a d e           tows

them by L i v e r p o o l      fans.       M any    people       came     forward,        stating       the y we

medical       students,        nurses,      first aid           etc.,     offering        their       hel p and

                                                                                                                           R3^5
were    directed             toward          the     injured.

Doctors       came         forward           also        and       were       utilised            accordingly.                      I    still      at

this    point             had     no    idea        of        what       had        happened,           many          constables                  were

walking          aimlessly              about        having             been         separated             from           colleagues               and

were    in    my       opinion          lost        as    to       what       to     do.

Radio    transmissions                   at     this          time       were        few    and     still         the          full       tragedy

was     not       known.                I,     at        no        time       handled             any      bodies,              other             than

directing             where        to        place        persons             for     treatment.                 All the                bodies       I

directed         as       such,        had    police           officers              or    civilians             with          them.

Once    I     entered             the        area        A/G       I    went         towards        the         tunnel,             many          fans

were    there          crying,           upset,           angered.              I    attempted             to    move          the        fans      to

what    now       was        becoming           a    sterile              area.           (Area     1-16).                Many          moved       on

and     were          appreciative                  of         what        everyone             was        t r y i n g to               do,       many

refused          to    move       and        showed           their        anger           towards         me     and          other          police

present.              I     was       unable         to        clear          th e    tunnel          of     fans. The                  area       A/G

apart       from       the       tunnel        area        was         almost         cleared.           Then         I    directed               five

constables             up       the      stairs           to        the       seating           area       of     t he         West           Stand,

where       in        th e       passageways                  behind,           people          were       stood, awaiting                        the

game    to    restart.

At    this    time         I was        not     aware          of       whether           the     match         had       been          abandoned

but    decided            under         the    circumstances                        that     it    would         be.            I       therefore

instructed             the        constables                  to       quietly         ask        who      was        present             to       get

their       families,             friends,               etc.,          and     to    leave        the       stand.                 Surprising

the    fans       left       peacefully,                 many          asking        how    many        were      dead,             to    which         I

could    not          answer.           The    match           had        not       been    officially                called             off,      but

fans    accepted                that    it     would           be      and      left.       The     odd         one       or    two       passing

comments              about            Police            inadequacy                   and         that          the            Police             were

repsonsible               for     what        had        happened.              The        vast     majority               however             being

stunned       and         shocked,           left        the       stand        with       little          fuss.          It    was       at      this
                                                                                                    PAGE 6
                                                                                                    R3^5
point    I   was    able   to e n t e r t h e   seating         area    of   the    West    Stand    and    saw
                          m
the     commotion      on    the    field.          The    bodies       of    the    dead        having    been

already      cleared       from     t he   pitch.     I    helped      to    clear    the    seating       area

fully    and       after    which     I    decided    to       make    my    way    back    to    Claywheels

Lane,    where      I was    able     to   re-group       my    serial.

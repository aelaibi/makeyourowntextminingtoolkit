              The      briefinq        for      the m a t c h took          place at          10 am       (1000)        in the N o r t h

on Wall send Rd for             11.15 am       (1115).        W a l l s e n d Rd     is a single

ca rr ia ge wa y      road w it h one      ca rr ia ge wa y     in each direction.                     It    is

s it u a t e d off Hali fa x Rd opposite               the    railway station.                   The other          end

of W a l l s e n d Rd     is a dead end.          The    car     park we had for                 the    transit

vans was at           this    far end of the        road a n d was           not very        large.           As we

did not         know how m any        vehicles     to expect we           parked vehicles as                      they

a r r i v e d down one side           of W a l l s e n d Rd until       we    reached the              car    park and

then we started filling                 that.

E a r l y on very few vehicles              a r r i v e d but    those       that     did the o ccupants

were     s ea rched and tickets were inspected.         Some of the vehicles had
                             It. /
cans     of b e e r / l a g e r/inside but none of the o cc upants w is h e d to take the

alcohol         out of the vehicles.             The    fans who a r r i v e d          early were            not

drunk.          However,      the fans     that were a rr i v i n g          later      in the transit                 vans

had o bv i o u s l y    consumed a l c o h o l / o n the journey.                  D e s pi te    having          had a

drink      they were         not disruptive.

F u r th e r    up Hali fa x Rd a w a y     from the g ro u n d was            the      coach park.               We

n ot ic e d that m any fans were               b eg inning      to walk      down Hali fa x Rd towards

the ground.            I t h e r ef or e wit h other memb er s           of my serial              s to od on the

j u n c t i o n of W a l l s e n d Rd and H a l if ax R d .          W he ne ve r a transit                 van turned

into     the     road we w o ul d direct         it where            to park a nd it was           then

s e a r c h e d as    I have    p re vi o u s l y stated.

As m ore        fans were w a l k i n g    down Hali fa x          Rd we b el i e v e d we were               better

e m p l o y e d stood on the          junction.        I do not        know how m any transit                      vans

we    parked as        I did not       count    them but        I w o ul d e st imate            that       there were

no more         than 20.

As    the time got           nearer    to kick-off, more and more people were walk in g

not    having a ticket,           they said such things as,                    "I've       never        had a

ticket         but   I always    get    into the g ro un d, "         or,     "I'll      buy one on the way

M an y    of the fans who were walk in g              down the      road were        in large        groups,

most      of whom were         carrying and      consuming alcohol.              The    groups were             the

full      w i d th of the      pavement.      T hey were      drinking       from cans,        bottles,

and      litre a nd half       bottles.       The y were      carrying      extra bottles an d              cans

with      them an d had them         in shirt and trouser             pockets.         Many of them

were      drunk and s ta gg e r i n g     but they were         not disruptive.            Some      of the

lads were           stopping and sitting         on a wall       near me        to drink.       T hose who

looked        par ti cu la rl y drunk     or had    large     q u an ti ti es   of alcohol        w i t h them

I w ent over and spoke             to.     I o b v i o u s l y did not want        to a n t a g o n i s e   them

but      I a sked why they h a d n ’t stayed             in Li ve rp oo l   to get drunk as            they

didn't        seem    capable of getting         to a nd w at ch in g a football             match.         I

got      replies      such as,    "We're a l r i g h t , "   "We sober      up w hen we        get    into

the      gro un d,"    "We al wa ys w a t c h football        like this."

As time        passed PO L DS T ISSINGTON,           who was       the only member           of our

serial        to be    issued w i t h a radio,        informed me and other m e mb er s                of our

serial        to try and move       the    crowds a long       to the ground.

Shortly        before 3 pm       ( 1 5 0 0 ) , w hen there were      only a few strag gl er s

m ak i ng     their way to the ground,             our    serial    began to walk          down H a l i f a x

Rd    i n te nd ing to go to C la yw h e e l s      Ln.      There were m any e mpty bottles

and      cans a long     the   road.

As we got onto C l a y w h e e l s        Ln, we met up wit h a number of other serials

under        the    command of P O L     INS C H A R L E S . At this time a radio m e s s a g e

was      r eceived by the        Inspector who        then told us to make              our way       to the

ground.            At the time    I did not know why.              As we got onto

and approached           the gr ou nd     I n o t ic ed a crowd of          people outside           the

ground.            There was also a number          of    police officers         about.        POL     INS

C H A R L E S a sked on the       radio    for   further      i ns tr uctions and then told us

to make        our way j,nto the ground.              I made my way          in thro ug h an open

gate at        the side     of w h i c h was an ambulance.

                     I noticed       people were       being     carried out of the L ap pi ng s Ln S t an d to

                     the ambulance.           Ot he rs were      running       up to me and shouting                     such things

                    as,     "Murderer," and,        "You're       fucking         killing     us     in there."           B e c au se     of

                     this and the fact          that     I was    still      unaware       of what was             happening,        1

                    made my way        into the L ep p i n g s Ln S ta nd thro ug h the tunnel.                            I stood

                     saw total       panic,    people were     ever yw he re and were still coming and

                    help     carry the fans who were              by the gate out.                  He helped me onto              the

                     pitch.     I then began h e lping            to    lift      people    from the          inside       of the        pen

                    4 a nd    laid them on the          pitch.         I helped       carry out three or four

                    bodies,     one of w h i c h was a young             girl      w ith short         dark    hair w e ar in g

^                   leans and a L i v e r pool         shirt.      The others           were all men,              one   of w ho m was

                           3 very h eavy build.           All    of these         bodies     I laid on the               pitch

           X* w he rever        I could find a space.                  All   of      the bodies        I carried out              I did

    ft *            so wit h the help of other              officers.

                    On     returning    to the    gate a g a i n       I could       not get        for other        o ff ic er s who
           iy
           9        were    there so    I walked        round the a m b u l a n c e        that was       on the         pitch and

                    went     to the g a te at     pen 3 .        Here    there       was a chain of officers                     a nd the

                    bodies were        being    passed a lo ng         it to get        them out of this                 section    of

the     stand.     1 got      into the       chain and helped here               for some     time.      I

then m o ve d on to help move                the    bodies      off the       pitch,    because    of the

lack     of stretchers a d v e r t i s i n g        boards were         used and fans who were               on

the     pitch and not         injured were          bringing      them over       for    us to use.

I star te d      lifting      the    bodies      onto    the stret ch er s       with other       people who

then     carried them away.              As one was t aken awa y               I lifted the       next   body

on and so on.              Man y of the fans who were                 on the    pitch were     helping

wit h this and         carrying       the    bodies      off,    but    some    of the    fans were      very

a n g r y and were         shouting.        As   the    fans    had    less to do we were a s k e d           to

form a line across             the    pitch to         contain the       fans    in the i r own half of

the     ground.       M any were      o b v i o u s l y beg in ni ng    to    realise what     had

h a pp en ed and were         very distressed.              I tried to         comfort    them as     best        I

could.

Following        this,     a m e s sa ge was       passed over         the g r o u n d ’s PA sy st em that

the game was a b a n d o n e d .        The      crowds     then began to         leave.      W h e n the

t erraces      were    empty    I star te d to help move                the    fans who were       still      on

the     pitch out. of the           ground.        M any were     upset and needed          consoling.

                  WalI send R o a d , where                    par k i ng s p a c e had been m ade a v a i 1 a b 1e fo r t ran*

                   vans of L i v e r p o o l          supporters.            We w e r e t,old to search                      s u p p o r t e r s as

                   they a 1 i g h ted f r o m the                v e h i c Ie s , a n ci also        to    inspect        their      tickets.

                                                                                                            S2745A

We were       told that at the              commencement             of the    game we w o u l d be on

stan d b y d u t i e s ,    and at      the     c o nclusion of the m a t c h w e wera               to go onto

the    perimeter          track    of the      pitch.



Following       the       briefings       I took      refreshments            and took        up p o s ition with

the    rest of my serial               in W a 11 send R oad for             -11.15 am.         (1115)



W a l l s e n d Roa d     is a single         carria g e w a y       road w i t h one      carriageway          in

each direction.              It    is s i t u a t e d off Hali f a x Road opposite                  the    railway

station.        The other          end of W a 11send Roa d              is a dead-end.             The    car    park

we had for          the    transit      vans was at            the    far end of the          road and      was not

very    large.           As we    did not      know how man y vehicles to expect we parked

vehicles as          they a r r i v e d down one              side    of W a i I s e n d R oad until       we

r e a c he d t he    ca r pa r k , a n d t h e n we s t a r t e d f i 1 1 i n g t ha t .



Early on very few vehicles                     a r r i v e d but      the   occupants       of those       that       tii. d

were    searc h e d an d tickets were                 inspected.            Some     of the v e h icles         had

car\s of b e er/lager             inside      but   none       of the o c cupants w i s h e d to take

alcohol       out    of the       vehicles.         The       fans who a r r i v e d early were            not

drunk.       However,        the     fans     that were a r r i v i n g        later     in the     transit          vans

drink,       they were       not     d i s r u p t i v e at    this    time.



Furt h e r    up Hali f a x Road,           a way from         the    ground, was       the    coach     park.          We

noticed       that man y fans were               b e g inning        to walk    down Hali f a x Road

towards       the ground.           W i t h other memb e r s           of my serial           I stood at the

As more        fans were w a l k i n g                down Hali f a x Road we             believed we were              bette

transit        vans we        parked as               I did not      count     them,       but    I w ou l d estimate

the re were           no more     than          2 0   .



As the time            got nearer           to kick off more and more                        people were walk i n g

down Halifax Road.                  Some         of them did not             have    tickets           and were

standing        by me        trying        to    buy them from other                fans.         W hen q ue s t i o n e d      &

me about        not having          a ticket                they said such things as,                   'I've never           ha

a ticket        but     I     al w a y s    get           into the   g r o u n d , ’ or      ' I ’ll buy one on the

full     width of the           pavement.                   They were     drinking        from     cans,        bottles       an

were     drunk and s t a g g e r i n g                but    they were     not    disruptive.             Some        of the

lads were            stopping     and sitting                 on a wall      near me         to drink.           Those who

looked       par t i c u l a r l y drunk              or had      large   quan t i t i e s    of alcohol          with     the

I went       over and spoke            to.             I o b v i o u s l y did not want           to a n t a g o n i s e   the

but     I a sked why they h a d n ’t stayed                         in Liverpool          to get        drunk as        they

didn* t seem           capable      of getting                to and w a t c h i n g a football             match.         I

got     replies        such as,       ’We're a l r i g h t , ’ "we sober                  up whe n we           get    into

S h o r t l y before 3 .00                pm    (1300)       w hen there were             only a few s tragglers

making         their way to the                  ground,          our    serial     began to walk            down Hal ifax

Road     intending            to go to C l a y w h e e l s              Lane.     There were m a n y empty

bottles and             cans along              the    road.



As we got onto C l a y w h e e l s Lane we met                             up w ith a number               of other

L e p p i n g s Lane and a p p r o a c h e d                the    ground       I noticed a crowd of                people

outside        the grounds                there was also a number                    of    police         officers about.

Inspector Charles                  a sked        on the       radio       for further          instructions             and    to-u

us to make            our way        into        the       ground.        I made my way             in thro u g h an open

I   noticed          people were               being       carried out of the L a ppings Lane                       terracing

to the a m b u I a n c e ; others were                       running       up to ms and snouting                 such

Because        of        t h i s , and the fact              that       I was still       unaware          of what was

the    situation.              I saw total                 panic - people were                everywhere        and were

from Rotherham,                on top of the                 perimeter          fence,,   and m a n y       other       officers

were also           on too of this                fence       leaning       over     from the         pitch     side      into

were     reluctant           to do so,            stating         they were        looking          for    people.        I then

began     p h ysically            pushing         them b a c kwards as             it was a p p a r e n t       to me         that

          no one would find an y o n e           until     the       pen was        cleared.          As    I made my way

          down    I noticed     people       climbin9      over       the     fence         separating       pens 3 and 4.



          A colleague       shou t e d me     to go through            the gats and onto                   the   pitch to

          help    carry out     the    fans who were            by the        gate.         He    helped me       onto    the

        Zl> pitch and    I then began helping              to    lift       people          from the       inside   of    pen

          one of which was a young               girl, with short               dark        hair wearing         Jeans and

          Liverpool      shirt.       The    others were all men,                  one of whom was               of a very

           ieavy build.        All    of these        bodies     I laid on the                pitch wher e v e r        I cou

          find a space.         All    of the bodies            I carried out                I did so with the help

          of other      offleers.



          \0n returning      to the     gate again         I could          not get         through due          to other

          officers who were           there?     so    I walk e d      round the a m b ulance                that was on

          this section of the           terracing.          At that          time      I saw my husband,                Chief
                A/33G7
          Superin t e n d e n t NfcSBIl,      inside     the t e r r a c ing of              pen 3,    helping      other

          officers with the           removal       of bodies.          I got        into the         chaIn and h e 1 pad

          here for some time.               I then m oved on to h e 1 p w i t h t h e r e inoval                    of

          bodi es off the       p i t ch.     Due     to the     lack       of stretchers,             advertising

          boards were       used and fans who were on the                        pitch and not              injured were

          bringing      them over      for    us to use.



          I started      lifting      the    bodies     onto     the    stretchers w i t h other                  people wh

          then    carried them away.           As one was            taken away             I lifted the         next    body

          on,    and so on.

shouting.            As the       fans    had      less       to do we were a s k e d to form a                  line

across       the     pitch to        contain the              fans    m     their     own half      of the       ground.

Many were o b v i o u s l y          beginning          to     realise what had h a p p e n e d and were

very distressed,                  I t ri ed to comfort                them as best           I could.

The    previous year,              that       is in 1988,            I was also        on duty at        the     semi

1988.       The      spectators          in    1988 were         b o i s t e r o u s and     in high spirits             but

directions.              The    fans     began a r r i v i n g       wall       before      the kick     off     time and

at around 3.00             pm     (1500)       because        there were           very few s p e c t a t o r s    in

L e pp i n g s Lane and at             the turnstiles,                I was       released      from my duties            and

went     into the West S ta n d just as                       the game          commenced.        When     I left        the

turnstiles           in L e pp i n g s    Lane       there were           no queues - just a. few                people

standing ar o u n d who were                   not     causing any           problems.

                  To    clarify             I am    in no doubt           that     the m o r t u a r y     p ho to g r a p h    I have      been

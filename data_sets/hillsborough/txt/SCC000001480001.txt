r e p ly dated 16 Novmber 1989 from th e Home Office to r e p re s e n ta ti o n s
made by the Authority..

Whilst accepting t h a t th e problem of dog fouling was of concern
because i t was both a p o t e n tia l he a lth hazard and an unpleasant
nuisance, i t was the view o f the Home Office t h a t Local A u th o r i ti e s
were b e s t placed to decide on s o l u t io n s by means of a v a ila b l e byelaw
controls.

As regards fouling by horses and ponies, th e Home Office had pointed
o u t t h a t , l e g a l l y speaking, horses were not allowed on footpaths a t
a l l , and t h a t persons who walked on bridleways and o th e r areas used
by horses had to expect t h a t they would encounter a c e r t a i n amount of
fo u lin g . In parks, Local A u t h o r iti e s should ensure t h a t horse
r i d e r s stuck to designated r o u te s o r a r e a s to minimise th e nuisance.

l e t t e r dated 16 November, 1989 be sent to each of th e Divisional

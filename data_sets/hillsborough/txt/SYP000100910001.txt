                from the          uniform,       and the        rest    from the C.I.D.             who     had v o l u n t e e r e d to

               work at the           football        m a t c h on a w e e k l y       leave day.            There was another

                serial     attached         to ours and           in overall         charge        of the       two     serials was

                Inspector Steve Ellis.                     He    has been       recently        promoted from the

               T raffic      Division.            We were        bused     to H i l l s b o r o u g h    onto P e n i s t o n e Road,

                near    to the       entrance        of the       gymnasium.           We went          into    the mai n stand

               where      briefing         was    held by several              officers       who       had drawn        up the

                plans     for the m a t c h        including C.I.D.               officers         in relation           to   crime

               and we were           fina l l y    briefed by Chief              Superintendent                D u c k e n f i e l d from

                *F' Division.

                I had a t t e n d e d      the    previous        match     in 1988,        at this         gro u n d    in similar

                circumstances             a n d at that         time    I was     in fact at            the L e p p i n g s Lane        end

                controll ing         the    crowds and on the               comm e n c e m e n t    of the match,             I was      in

               the main stand w i t h the Liverpool                         supporters.             On that         o c c asion there

   was    no trouble w h a t s o e v e r , I believe                     there were           one or two arrests,

   but    no d ist u r b a n c e s    or    crowd trouble whatsoever.

   After      the    briefing        we    proceeded to our                duty w h i c h was at W a r d s e n d

   Ro a d North,        t h a t ’s on the         j u n ction w i t h Hali f a x R oad and d i r e c t l y

   opposite         the B r i t i s h Rail        S t a t i o n at W a d s l e y Bridge.               Our    duties were

   to    park mini         buses a r r i v i n g       down Hali f a x Road from the m o t o r w a y and

  a dvise      supporters           generally          the d i r e c t i o n      of the ground.

  L o c a t e d at the        junction       of W a r d s e n d Roa d and Halifax                     Road,     is

   licensed         premises        called the R a i l w a y             Inn,     when    I wo r k e d     in Sheffield,

   I recall         visiting        these    premises,             but    it    is some years ago,               but when

  we a r r i v e d at W a r d s e n d Road,             I recall          Folice       C o n s t a b l e Butler

   informing me            that     the    licensee          of the       premises        w ould      like    to see me.

   I met      the    licensee,        a tall       chap wit h a beard.                   He    informed me                that       he

  was    not    opening        the    front       doors and          that       the wind o w s        had been boarded

  but    he    intended        to    open via          the    rear door           in a small          co u r t y a r d at            the

  back and allow             certain supporters                   and o b v i o u s l y       his    regular

  customers,          into the        premises.              He    stated that           he had op e n e d       in 198<i

  for    the    semi-final           and    that       damage       had been         caused to the            toilets,

  a l t h o u g h there      had not        been any serious                   trouble.         He asked       that we

  direct any          ’older        e n d ’ supporters,             not    the youn g e r           element    who may

  cause       trouble       an d damage.           I recall          that       he was        quite    friendly,-              a sked

  us to keep an eye                 on the    place,          and he w o u l d         p r o bably     remain             outside

  or near       to the       door and we agreed that we w ould                                cover    the    premises                as

  well as o ur duties with the mini                               buses.

  I remember          him o f f ering        to    provide          a pot of tea for                 the o f f icers             and

  I agreed          that    12.30 w ould          be an       ideal       time and        that w e ’d split                    the

  officers          up so that        they    cou~hd' go to the                 back     of    the    premises             and

    it were all       in their             twenties,          that age       group,       they were        in a good

mood,       these     did not ap p e a r             to be drink i n g at all,                 they were         joking

with     the officers,                 there was         no    trouble.           They    parked where we             told

 them to       park and             I recall       that       this    first       bus    load made       their way

directly          to the        ground.

Buses a r r i v e d a f t e r w a r d s           but    there was         not a great           number     of     these

mini    coaches.               We    parked them on the                 side      of the      road an d a l t h o u g h

the m a j o r i t y       of    the     occupants         were       o b v i o u s l y exci t e d about        the

prospects          of the match,                they were        g e n e r a l l y well       beha v e d and good

humoured.           We j oked with                them,       talked about          the match,          and they were

gen e r a l l y    in high           spirits and there was                   no    problem whatso e v e r .

The    coaches        that were              proper mini         coaches,          the drivers          were     gen e r a l l y

remaining w ith                the    coach and we did not see                      evidence         of a great        deal

of drink          on this           type     of mini      coach.         Others which were               consisting             of

company vehicles,                    w o r k s ’ vans,     that       had obv i o u s l y been          b o r r o w e d had a

considerable              number        of    cans      of drink       in them.           But again,        the

occupants         were         no    problem w hatsoever.                 I recall         one van       load

“a r r i v i n g and asking             if they         co-uld obtain a drink,                 they were m a i n l y            in

the 30/3 5 age             group,          and a c t u a l l y w a l k e d     down      to the      rear entrance              of

the R a i l w a y Public House.                      Tol d them to go quietly                    to the     back      door

and they were              in fact a d m i t t e d         by the        licensee         into    the    premises.          I

did    in fact        go       into     the     premises       later      on through           the   back      door    there

was    no   problem            in the        public     house whatsoever,                as    I said before           they

seemed      to be         in high spirits               and    quite      good h u m o u r e d as        generally

Liverpool         fa n s a r e .

There was a steady                    flow of spec t a t o r s w a l k i n g            down H a l i f a x Road,

towards      the     ground,           and as every            officer         that was       on duty       in that a rea

will    say,      the m a j o r i t y         of these        fans,      the younger          element       in

bottles     of drink and openly                    drinking       them as        they walked along.                   All

the officers           were     quite    s u rprised         that      they weren't        carrying       just          one

can,    they were         c a r rying    a half dozen             cans     at a time,       and d r i nking

from    them.      As     some    of the spectators                 left    the pub again             there       was    no

problem,        they    even     thanked       us    for     informing         them and I saw one                 group

of fans    leaving          the pub      thanking           the licensee         and shaking          hands        with

him .

Whilst    we were         at   the     location       of Wardsend           Road    and Halifax          Road,          we

were    vi sited       by C hief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t      Nesbit       who was     touring       the       area

in a Range       Rover.          He came       and spoke          to us.        We were     also

visited    by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     M a r shall     who was      on foot,        and he was

checking    the        crowds.         This    was    early doors,             I would     say in       the    region

of 12 o ’clock          time,     he    came      and spoke         to me.       I do know S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Marshall    although           I've     never worked with him,                   I know him        from a

social    aspect.          His main         concern        was    that no weapons          arrived        in these

mini    buses    and noth i n g         was    taken       down     to the      ground which w ould               cause

any    injury.     He also r e q u e s t e d          that we        check      as many    for     tickets            and

advise    those        that hadn't          got    tickets        not    to make     their way         down       to

the    ground.

As    the mini     buses         started       to back up W a r d s e n d          Road,   we had       the use              of

a company       car park,          and we did in fact               park       a number    of mini       buses          on

this    car park.          One     thing I do recall              is     that a mini       bus    full       of

youngst ers      20 years        of age        pulled       onto    the    car park and when              I walked

up to this van          they'd     got      the    sliding        door    open,     I believe         two or three

round     public       house       tables and a half               dozen       pub stools       and    number           of

cans    of beer    on the          tables.          I asked      them     in a joking ma n n e r         what           they

were    doing    and     they    said       that     they knew          that    the pubs     would      be     shut          so

they'd brought           their     own mini          pub.        Again,    they were       no    trouble          I

               believe D e t e c t i v e      Con s t a b l e    Hill       just    had to warn             one     of these          lads who

               was   getting       a bit      stroppy,          to    clam down,          but    in general              we had no

               problem w h a t s o e v e r     w ith any         of the mini             buses       that    came.

               I counted a total              of only        17 mini         buses,       I e x p e c t e d that we w o u l d be

               inundated wit h mini              buses and            in the end w o u l d            be trying           to find

               places to      park them on both sides                        of the       road but this wasn't                       so.

               There were         very few and            I told the           officers         in my serial              that       if

               there were         late a r r i v a l s     with       cars     rather      than       send the           cars    to the

               ground where           they w o u l d      cause a          problem trying             to    park down there

               that we      could start          parking a few               cars as well             on W a r d s e n d Road,                 I

           did       in fact       radio      through        to the Control               Roo m where          I spoke          to

           Sergeant          Goddard.          I was        in fact         in p o s s e s s i o n    of a radio and

               informed him that              there were             very few       cars and          buses arr i v i n g .               I

               recall    the football            special         train arriving,                I was       stood at         the end of

           W a r d s e n d Road,        I saw the train                cross       the    bridge        over      the     road.           1

           would say about                  3/6 hund r e d fans            came     off    the       train,       they w a l k e d            down

           from the station,                  two m o u n t e d       officers were             in front          of them,           they

           just       held them for a short                     time,      until      they were a ltogether,                     then

           'they went         down Hali f a x R oad              towards        the      ground,        a g a i n a l t h o u g h they

m          were       in high spirits             and were            singing,        I did      not       see any        that       tried

           to break away,- they f o l l o w e d                      the   officers        and went          down towards                 the

           ground.

           Our       brief was         to    remain at W a r d s e n d Road,               until        kick      off     time       or

           short ly before              if the re was            no other          duty    to    perform          the; re,      but       I do

           r s c a l 1 as     late as         twenty minu t e s            to three,         young men,             I w ould         think

           that       they were         Liv e r p o o l    supporters,             running       up Hali f a x          Road away

           from       the    ground         towards a shopping                 precinct a short                distance          some 20

           or 30 yards             further       up,      and obv i o u s l y       they were           heading          for the          beer

           off and          the    supermarket            and    right       up to ten minu t e s              to       three    or even

           later,        crowds        of supp o r t e r s were            still      coming         down H a l i f a x      R o a d and

        the si g n i f i c a n t     thing ^.as the amount                  of drink they were               carrying,

        cans    of beer.            A l t h o u g h we    didn't     have any trouble              w ith them,          it was

        noticeable        at    the      time and         I ’m not     just       saying    this     in the a f t e r m a t h

        of what      happened,           it was      remarked on that why at this                        late     time were

        they    going     to the gr o u n d and               having a considerable                amount        of drink.

        I have gone        ta football            matc h e s all          my     life and big matches,                 I ’ve

        always     gone    early a n d w o u ldn't              think       of going       for a drink,           thinking

        of being        in the         ground and            having had drink,            but this       c e r tainly

        struck me       and         I related      to my        own two         sons who are       in their         twenties,

        a n d every time            I go to a football               m a t c h with them we al w a y s              seem to
+       meet    in a public            house,     but        probably       this     is what all         the y o u n g s t e r s

        do nowadays        and       it was      s ignificant          at       the time and as          I ’ve    previously-

        said,    I'm not stating               this       in the a f t e r m a t h       of what     happened,          this           is

        a fact and        it was        n o t i c e d by quite a lot of                  people.

        As we    left W a r d s e n d Road we                left as      a serial,        there    were      still      people

        walking     down at a p p r o x i m a t e l y          three      o ’clock       or just     before       and    I am

        almost     certain          that    I heard          over   the     radio as we got           towards

        Claywheels        Lane       the match,           the kick        off,     had been       postponed.            I was

        "certainly aware             of this and another                  thing      I recall      shor t l y     before           I

%       recall a radio m e s s a g e and again                      I know S e r g e a n t     G o d d a r d ’s voice,             he

        was    in the Control              R oom and         I recall       a    radio message        where       Serge a n t

        Goddard     in the Control               Roo m was asking                other    officers       if they had

        seen the S o u t h Y o rkshi re Tra n s p o r t                L i a i s o n Offi c e r    in the        v i c inity           of

        the Herries        Road        garage.           I recall      this       because    he was        ask i n g    for

        that    officer        to    contact      or at        least      if officers        were     in contact with

        him to     inform him they had                    closed L e p p i n g s     Lane    because        of the

        volume    of    s u p p o r t e r s and      that       the bus         drivers    should     be    i n f ormed of

        this.     We    carried on and went                    and a c t u a l l y    turned      into C l a y w h e e i s

        Lane,    where     our       brief was        to obtain a meal,                  we had    not     had a meal at

        this    time,     and as        I w a l k e d with the            serial     into C l a y w h e e l s     Lane,        I

heard over        the    radio a a appeal             for      officers        to go to the          ground as

there were        some    people          in L e p pings       Lane,     trying       to get      to the        ground

I stopped my serial,                 told them to turn                 round and we w a l k e d           towards

the ground.         I then met             Inspector Char l e s            coming       in the o p p osite

d i r ection a way from          the       ground.        As we met         he asked me where                  I was

going and        I told him about                the appeal          I'd heard over my              radio.        We

had a discussion,           I recall             John Char l e s        saying       no our     instructions

are    to go to C l a y w h e e l s        Lane and       I recall         saying to         him w e ’d check

again,     you    check    or    I ’ll      check on the             radio,     they want         officers at

L e p pings Lane.         Joh n Charles            did    in fact        go over       the air       he was       in

possession        of his    own       radio,       and he       received the same               in s t r u c t i o n as

me.

Joh n Charles       had got, the e quivalent                    of about        five     serials       and      the

only other        officer       w ith      him    I can       recall     was    Inspector         Bob Meek,

there may have           been    somebody else,                I c a n ’t recall.            I c a n ’t recall

any other S e r g e a n t       or    Inspector          Ellis       or any     other      Inspector with us

I   can only      recall    Inspector Charles,                      Inspector Meek and myself,                    and

we took     the    seri a l s    and       I believe          w e ’d got    five     serials        with       us up

'Leppings Lane,          and we       could ssre then the                volume       of s p e c t a t o r s    as we

approached        the    gates       to   the ground.               We stop p e d the       serials        at    the

j u n ction w i t h Vers        Road,       that's       the    last     road on the          left     before you

come to the        ground.           There was a          lot       of traffic       over     the    radio       and

were    trying     to ask       for       further     instructions.              Bob Meek         went     on ahead

to try arid obtain          inform a t i o n as a runner and                     Inspector C h a r l e s          and

I then     lined up the          serials          in their          serials,     and told         them     not

to move.         I looked a fter            the    serials          while John C h a r l e s        was    trying       t

get    over on the        radio.           I recall       telling        the    serials       to follow

Inspector Char l e s        and       I and not          to    break     rank    or move        away and         to

keep with their           individual             serials       so    that we     knew w h e r e      eve r y b o d y

was.     I remember        that we          doubled       up    in m i l i t a r y   style      up to the         gate

of the ground,              and    I recall           turning    round       to make       sure       that       everybody

was w ith us,          a l t h o u g h we were w i n d i n g         our way through               the     crowds           of

people,       and as we a p p r o a c h e d the             first     set of big           gates,        the      officers

that were        there       formed a kind of tunnel                    for    us to go through,                   and we

momentarily           s t o p p e d there and then an officer                       1' don't       know who            it

was,    it was an officer                  of    Inspector       or S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    rank,         told us,

"Straight        into       the    ground        lads,    go straight          into       the ground,             they

need some help."                  We    then went        t h r o u g h the    conc e r t i n a gate,             the    big

blue    concertina gate,                 as you       look at the L e p pings              Lane       entrance          it

was    to the     right       hand side.              As we went        into     the area          im m e d i a t e l y

behind the        stand       I could see             the tunnel        in q u e s t i o n that          goes      under

the main stand at L e p p i n g s Lane,                     there were         s u pporters           running

around,       mill i n g a r o u n d and          then    I saw      both officers              and     suppo r t e r s

carrying       three        people       from u n d e r n e a t h    the     tunnel       from     the     ground.               I

am    certain     that all             those     three    people were alive                because         they were

giving     them what          first aid they              could and          I recall          farming       a    circle

with    the    serials        that       we     had   round these          people,        and saying,             "Look

get    these     supporters             that are       getting       in the way,           get     them behind us

"so that      they     can see          to t he s e 'Tras ua 11 i es . "       I'd no          idea     that      there

was anymore,           it    looked        like a fainting            s i t u a t i o n and       I'm    certain that

these    people were              alive       and we     didn't      realise        the    enormity          of the

situation        in the       ground.

Other    officers,          a g a i n wit h supporters,               came     up the          tunnel      wit h some

more    casualties          and        I could then sea             that     it was a more              serious

situation.            They w e r e n ’t just           needing       their     ties       loosening,             or air,

the    normal     fainting             situations,        and   three - f o u r      or more          were       brought

out as     I say.           I recall          then a young          officer      running          up the         tunnel       as

they were       b r i nging        some       other    people and          I was     stood more            or     less

just    inside        the    tunnel       and     he was more         or     less    s c r e a m i n g at me

saying,       ‘‘Get    some men          in here,        come and help us,                we    need help          inside,

  -as many          chaps as           I knew,            I recall      getting       hold of Steve Cook who was

  wit h me and John Hill                        and saying,            "Right,       get     them    inside       the    ground

  they need us               inside          the        ground," and we went               under     the    tunnel.          We

  pushed our way                  to    the     front and as we got                  to the front we were                  then

  faced with all                  I can describe as a pile                      of bodies           that a p p e a r e d just

  stacked on top of one anot h e r                               to the    level      of the top of            the wall           and

  several           fast     back       from the wall.                 O f f icers    and s p e c t a t o r s alike were

  just       pulling at                these        bodies.       At this      stage       I ’m sure       that    they    w eren

  all      dead and we were               just          picking        a body up,          I c a n ’t recall         which

  officer,          and we         ran as          best we        could    up the      tunnel        out    into     the area

  w e ’d first            corne into          on the        other      side    of the       stand.         I think       I did

  this      something             like       eight,       nine,     ten times,         with officers              and

  spectators.                The       first       body you        picked up you            ran out w ith           him and

  there were           o f f icers           carried       on giving          assistance.            I remember         that we

  tried kiss           of       life and heart mass a g e                  on one      chap who we           thought was

  alive       for a c o n s i d e r a b l e             length of time and then took                       him out away as

  people were               falling          over       us on the       steps    of the          terrace     and we got

 ‘hi m to           the back.            As     I said,         this    took    place carrying bodies                 out,        as

  far as            I ’m c o ncerned           tan times,           it may      have       been more and          I c a n ’t

  recall w h i c h officer                    I saw,        I    can remember another               Sergeant         and     I ’ve

  just      thought          of        his     name       over the last day,           a S e r geant       Whit lam,       who

  used to be at R otherham.                              I can remember          carrying a body with                    him on

 a     c o u p 1e    of     o c casions,            but    the    others,      I've     no    i d e a w h o they w era.                1

  remember           then that           the        entrance       to the      tunnel        appeared       to become

  blocked and               I then       remember          Superintendent            G r e e n w o o d who was          on the

  pitch side               of     this       fence wit h a m e g a p h o n e          in          his      hand o r g a n i s i n g a

  chain,            and the        only way             to do    it was       to take the top           body      first.          We

 appeared            to be just              s n atching         at an arm a n d a           leg and       obviously           it

 was       t ra p p e d «       I remember              at first       I was    near       the   gate a n d       there w a ^ I

 or his foot,          and we were             just    standing       on him and e v e n t u a l l y          somebody

 got him out and            that was           preventing       us getting          through       the    gate.

Of f icers were           trying     to    carry bodies             through the       gate and this was

 impossible         due    to the w idth          of the gate.            I remember S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Gr e e n w o o d   c o n t i n u a l l y telling       them,    ‘’For m a chain,           form a chain,             don't

try and       corne t h r o u g h with          the    body,    don't     try and      come       through."              We

formed a chain an d we                  got some a s s e m b l a n c e       of order,       if you       can call

it that       in this       situation,           where we did          in fact       get a chain going.                       I

don't      recall      now whet h e r          this    came    to me afte r w a r d s       or at the          time,

but there was a m a n s o mewhere a long                        the    line    screaming          about       his

daughter.           At first we tried to shove                       him away and          realised       that       he

had got s o m e b o d y      there and he went                 through       onto    the    pitch.        One       of

the things          that    struck me was              the    colour    of the       faces    of    the

victims.           These    were    purple and you              could tell          that    they were          dead,

there were          blue areas          on the        body w h i c h was      obviously       pressure and                I

recall      sorna were       frothing          through        the    nose and mouth.              There       was

either one,          two    or    possibly more              people    there who were             obviously

‘doctors      and    I remember          one    of "these       chaps    saying       on several

occasions,          "Leave       him,     leave       him."     Obviously       he was       dead,       to    look

far someone          else.        I recall        also at       this    time    the    only       other       officer

that    I did see was Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t                Nesbit       and he,       with    other

officers was          tearing       at    the fence,           away    from    the    gate    some       10 yards

away    from the          gate,    and they a c t u a l l y          broke    the mesh       near       to the       top

corner and          peeled       it back,       and     thinking       about.it,       it was       like you             peel

a sardine          tin back,       and then he s t a r t e d           saying,       "Pass    ’em through."

They    ripped the          fence       out and        that    fence was       ripped       out    by hand,          by

brute     force      of several          Police        O f f icers    and as many          others       that

could.       They     ripped       it out       by     hand and we       started       passing          bodies       two

ways    then.        I reiiiembe r hearing              the    sound    of an a m b u l a n c e     coming,

w hich seemed ages,                 a*"id J.    thought       there was a fleet             of them and there

was     only one.

The orders were               being      given       by Chief        Superintendent          Nesbit         as    best       he

    could,    trying      to o r g anise         the men as          best     he    could an d       certainly by

Superintendent             Gree n w o o d .         My me m o r y    of him        it was as       if he'd        hung

himself        on the      fence       near      the    gate and was           just     giving       the    orders          to

the     lads    to     pass    these      bodies        in the       chain.

The     only other         Inspector            I saw was an          Inspector         from the T r a i n i n g

Department,           Rob and        I forget          his second          name.      He was       there and        I

believe        the re was       Inspector            Sykes     there.         I c a n ’t recall          now who        I

did see of the officers,                        I remember          seeing Bob Gut che r and several

other officers.

E v e n t u a l l y we got all           the     bodies      from behind the wall                  and they were

on the        pitch an d were           either         being     tendered          to by officers,           St.    John’

that     there were           signs     of      life    in his       chap,     a young man and we                 shouted

and     screamed for           oxygen and the Fire S e r v i c e                    came and       they got

cylinders        of oxygen and                 they then treat             this     chap w i t h     the    oxygen,

"whether he was            dead or not,              I'-don’t know.            The m a j o r i t y    in that       pile

were     dead obviously.                W hen w e ’d got            the    bodies     out we       remained        in

that     enclosure.            We    hadn't         time    to think,         I w a s n ’t conscious             of the

s pectators          a r o u n d me,    and      I never       gave       them a t h o u g h t , but after              the

bodies        had been        removed,         we    in that        enclosure,        then became           very very

conscious        of the        spect a t o r s       in the      seating       area above          Us,     and    for       the

first        time,    I became         f r i g h t e n e d and      I fe a r e d that      the anger         was    going

to be vented            on us and         I said,          " T h e r e ’s gonna      be trouble,           I can see

t h e r e ’s gonna       be tr o u b l e . "         They were        really angry.            I did        in fact

speak        to Chief      Superintendent               Nesbit       and    said,     "You know w e ’re gonna

have     trouble        here" a n d       then he          said,     "Get    them out,       get      the    orficers

out     onto    the     pitch."         I remember           saying        to Steve Cook           and Joh n Hill,

"Get     those         girls    out."        Mean i n g     our P o l i c e w o m e n    and I r e m e m b e r           in

parti c u l a r        having P o l i c e w o m a n    Marsh,       Kaz Marsh,           Jill      Donnelly            and

Julie Nesbit              who were      all     e x tremely upset            and      in parti c u l a r          Kaz Marsh

who was        just       shaking and I remember                  telling Steve              Cook      and John Hill

and Kevin Ya r r o w not               to lose        the    girls,      in any         event      to look         after

those      girls.          John Nesbit          then      o b viously       appreciated            the     s i tuation

and saw        that       those      fans,    they were          hurling       abuse       at us.          I've        got        to

be honest,             I didn't       see    a n y thing     thrown      at us,         it was       the     verbal

abuse,       and you         could     feel     the    anger      that was          being      vented        on us,           and

I don't        frighten         easily.         I've      been    in one       or     two situations,                  but        I

was    frig h t e n e d      and I was        w o n d e r i n g what we were              going      to do,        whether

we were        going       to turn      and run,          because       there was          a crowd behind us.

This     was     brought        home    when     one      of the Police             Ph o t o g r a p h e r s ,    Dennis

Bond,      came        and he a c t ually        spoke       to me,      I never         gave      it a thought                   at

that     time,         he was     dressed       in civilian           clothes         and he came            and       the

next     thing he was             virtually        surro u n d e d      by angry          supporters             who were

mill i n g     on the pitch and               came     away,      but    as I walked             over I saw

another        crowd       further      over     to. the       left     near    to the         control           box

su r r o u n d i n g    another      Police      P h o t ographer,          I don't        know his          name.            I

found out         later        his   name was         Spike,      and    officers          had     to vir t u a l l y

drag him         out.

I can't        recall        seeing     anyone        else     gett i n g    hold       of that        si t u a t i o n

other      than Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t           Nesbit      and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t      Gre e n w o o d

and    there were            a couple        of Insp e c t o r s      there     in particular,                   this

In spector        Rob and         I forget       his name         from Training,               who     I spoke           to.           I

 can't       recall      any    other     q,fficer coming             until      I saw the A.C.C.               Mr

 Jackson       come.       Whet h e r     h e ’d been there and                 I hadn't         seen hirn I d o n ’t

 know,     but     he was       the     only one when we got all                    the    bodies        out.        It was

 in my book,           it was      down to J ohn Nesbit,                  and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    Greenwood

 and all       those      lads who        wo r k e d just      bloody         fantastically.

We     then e v e n t u a l l y    got an order from Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t                      Nes b i t    to

 try and get the               spectators        off    the    pitch and           to try and get              them from

the ground.              Oh,    I ’d p r e v i o u s l y heard an appeal                by D a l g l i s h which

went     down very well,               and    someone      else      said that          the Notts Forest

Manager,         Clough,        had been on the            pitch but we didn't                   see him.            But

anot h e r    thing       that     struck me        is that an a n n o u n c e m e n t           was made         over

the Police          tannoy        by a Police          Officer,        I presume asking                the

spec t a t o r s    to    leave and when           he was making               it I was w o r r i e d         that       that

whe n w e ’d have          some       real    trouble,        but    in actual         fact      they just went,

certainly          out   of the       seating area,            and     it was       then that Chief

Superintendent             Nesbit       said,     "Try and          get    hold of some           .blokes and try

and     coax them all,            l e t ’s try and get              ’em out and off              the    pitch,"          and

we    did,    and they went,             there was        no trouble,             we didn't         have      to even

speak      to a n y b o d y     sharply,       they^ent         and       I d i d n ’t e x p e r i e n c e    any

trouble       until      saw one        tall Li v e r p o o l       s u p porter      in a blue         shirt and             I

actually       heard      h i m- s a y itig -y - "We--3-u-gh-t-‘'X6 " h a v e ‘a - r i o t . "     H e - s ~ a i d~ t h a t    a

couple       of times.           I think       it w o u l d    have       been foolish to try and

apprehend          him or anything,             but when we did go and speak                           to'him,          some

of his       own supp o r t e r s       got    ho Id of him,          p r o bably      he was       so upset

o b v i o u s l y he      was a n g r y and one         can u n d e r s t a n d      that,       but   he did         in

fact     listen        to his     own     mates     who we       spoke        to as well,          and       they went

and    I d i d n ’t see        him again.

I d o n ’t know           what     time it was         but we       e v e n t u a l l y went      and were           told to

go back       into        the     stand where       the       briefing        earlier       had taken           place.         I

remember asking               a Chief        Inspector Beal           if anyone          had thought            to

          officers       that were            there     that     this    had been        done,       they were           doing it

          an d that       provisions were                being made for us to              go    to     C l a y w h e e l s Lane.

          We were       direc t e d      to C l a y w h e e l s Lane where          I saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

          Brougham       of the Traf f i c Division.                     I informed him that                   the m a j o r i t y

          of R o t h e r h a m O f f i c e r s    had been       involved        in the      removal           of bodies       from

          the    terrace      and that I thought                they ought         to be taken          back to

          Rotherham.          Again       he       was very      good,    I don't        know where            he got       the bus

          from or buses           but     he     c e r tainly got        some    buses.         He    told me        that     he
<9        would     provide       drivers         to    take any officer            home who          couldn't          drive and

          we were more          or     less      bused a way back          to Rotherham.

          I t ’s very      hard      to d e s cribe       the    horre n d o u s    scenes,          i t ’s alri g h t      three

          days    later      being able           to talk about           it and      I have         said      t h a t ’s what we

          get    paid for but         I ’ve seen the              effects       on the D e t e c t i v e s       that     I ’ve

          w o r k e d with.           I saw the         effect    on Kev Yarrow, Steve Cook,                       who    at work

          can handle any             si t u a t i o n   but    I saw the        effect     of that.             I d i d n ’ t see

          Jo h n Charles        again,         I know he got          tied up in the gymnasium,                         it was an

          horrific       experience.              In 31 yelrrs on the Police                    I never         thought       that

<9        I w o u l d witness         the      horrific        scenes     that we        did meet        on entering           the

          ground.        I would        like      to say that         every      bobby that           I w o r k e d w i t h gave

          and also       the Pol i c e w o m e n .        Those P o l i c e w o m e n were           absolutely

          terrific.          Obviously           c r i t i c i sms w 1 11 be     levelled a             us and       I ’m s u r e we

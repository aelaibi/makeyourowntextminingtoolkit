             about 3.10 pm (1510) and were told to wait at the entrance to the

             pitch near to the Police             room.   Whilst here,                 I saw a number of

             officers who were standing at this location yet covered in liquid

             coming from the Nottingham Forest fans-

             After about 3 minutes,            with numerous other officers,                     1 was directed

             onto the pitch between the Kop and North Stand.

             I immediately saw a number of people on the pitch in front of the

             Leppings Lane Stand.              We were instructed to stand facing the North

             Stand.

             Immediately       I was    confronted by numerous Liverpool                       fans shouting

             obscenities at myself and other officers.                                I also saw a number of

             After a short time of being verbally a b u s e d , I was instructed to go to

             the Leppings Lane Stand behind the goal.                         On attending here         I saw

             numerous bodies and Police Officers,              Fire brigade and other                   person all

             attempting First Aid.              A Fire officer stated that a male 30-35 yrs,

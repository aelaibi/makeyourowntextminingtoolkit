                   At    8 . 4 5 a.m.         Saturday       15 A p r i l    1989,        I commenced            d u t y at W o o d S e a t s

                   Police        Station.            I was    transported            to       the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

                   at    the     g r o u n d we      were    briefed.            I was        detailed       to S e r i a l       8,    immediate

                   supervision was                  Police    Sergeant           1S 03 M a r p l e s       and   Inspector             Calvert.

                   On    conclusion            of    the    briefing        we    were        prov i ded w i t h a m e a l .             On

                   conclusion            of    the    meal    we   went      to     the       S p i o n Kop.      Together             with    other

                   officers         I was       to    provide       security         for       the L i v e r p o o l    supporters             that

                   had    been a l l o c a t e d        tickets      for     the     S p i o n Kop.          This      was       a small      area

                   adjacent         to    the       N or t h Stand.




                   At    2.10     p.m.        that    same    day,    I was         on    the     Kop area        of    the       ground,       when

                   my a t t e n t i o n was          drawn    to a g r o u p       of     youths       a    short      distance          away

                   from     me.      The       group were          chanting        and        gesticulating            to    the       Liverpool

officers        I went            to   this         particular             group.         One    member            of    the       group       I

had a    conversation with                          had    consumed a              considerable               amount          of    alcohol

a nd was      drunk.              He   was      arrested             by P o l i c e      Constable            41    Walmsley             for

the    offence          of     being         drunk, at          a designated              sporting            event          and                   ^

escorted        to      the P ol i c e          room.           Several           other     members           of    the       group were

also    arrested             by     other       officers.



At    2.40    p.m.       I returned                 to    the       Kop,     by    this     time       the     crowd          had    filled

the    Kop    to     the       extent          t hat      there       was     little        or    no     standing             r o o m on

the    terraced areas                   and     people were                standing         on the        access             walkways.

I saw    no     stewards               assisting           people          onto     the K o p         or k e e p i n g        walkways

clear.        I would             estimate           the       the    number        of    people         on    the K o p was              too

many    for     safety.                Whilst        making          my way        back     to    the      remainder               of m y

serial,       there          were       numerous           people          who     smelled        strongly              of

intoxicants,             although              the       behaviour           of    the    fans w o u l d           be d e s c r i b e d        as

well    behaved,.



At    about     3.04         p.m.       I was        on    duty        towards        the     rear       of    the       side       of    the

Kop,    th at      is a d j a c e n t          to    the N o r t h S t a n d .            I looked            across          the    pitch

arid saw      people           climbing             the    perimeter              fencing        of    the     Leppings             Lane

terrace.           On    initial             observations               it a p p e a r e d       to    be a        pitch

invasion.            Due       to      the     length          of    t ime    the     g ame      had     been       going          it was

obvious       that       this          was     not       the    case.         People        continued              to    climb       over

the    perimeter             fenc e ,        others        were        being       pulled        up    into        the       West    Stand

from    the     terraces.                 As    I watched              I saw       one    youth who            was       wearing          what

appeared        to      be a y e l l o w            shirt       or     jumper,        was     pulled          from       the       Leppings

Lane    terrace           into         the     West       Stand.           The     youth      got      his     f eet         onto    the

parapet       wall        of      the     West       Stand          then     fell     backwards            down         onto       the    fans

in the       terrace.               It w a s        at    this       t ime    that       I heard         over       a    personal

radio    t hat       there          may      have        been       fatalities.

     A small      group           of     the L i v e r p o o l        fans       that       we    had       been    guarding           were

     distraught             by    th e      scenes       from        the    far       end    of       the     pitch.        They

     requested          that       they          be    escorted        from          the    ground.           The     match          had    not

     at    this    time          been abandoned,                 but       they       stated          t hat    they     did      not w i s h

     to    remain       in       the     ground         any     lon g e r .



     Together          with Police                Constable           41    W a l m sl e y and          other       officers,              we

     escorted          these       fans          from     the    ground          onto P e n i s t o n e         Road.           At    this

     time    I was          approached                by a m a n w h o          identified             himself        to me          as a

     doctor.           He    was       escorted           by m y s e l f        and Police             Constable           Walmsley             onto

     the    pitch,          gaining          access        on    the       s 1 i p-way       b e t w e e n the        Kop and          the

     Nor th Stand.



     Whilst       at    the       top       of    this     slip-way             I saw       numerous           dead     bodies         and

     injured       people           being         carried        off       the       pitch       on    billboards           by P o l i c e

     Officers          and       other       Liverpool            supporters.                I ran o n t o           the    pitch,          there

     were    more       bodies           and      injured         laid      out       on b o a r d s .         I was       approached             by

     another       Police          Constable              who    asked          if    I had any             experience           of

     resuscitation.                    I had and           I went          to    the       first       board.         On    the       board

     was    a young          male,          apparently            dead.          Two       people        were       doing       mouth       to

     mouth       and    cardiac             massage.            As    I appraoched                the m a n         doing       the    cardiac

     massage       t o l d me          he    was       a doctor.            I went          to    the       n ext    board,          another

     young       male,       apparently                dead,     nobody with                him.        Police        Constable

     Walmsley          and       I were          about     to     commence            resuscitation when                    numerous

     Liverpool          supporters                ran     down       the    pitch          towards          the K o p      to    the

     Nottingham             Forest          supporters.               Fearing          another           incident          at    the       Kop

     end    of    the       ground          I and       other        officers          went       and       prevented           the

     Liverpool          supporters                reaching           the    Kop.
^   I was     told       by    either         an     Inspector          or C h i e f      Inspector            to .form" a         cordon

    across     the       pitch          to    prevent       more       disorder.              The    cordon       moved        up the

    pitch     to    the       centre          line.        We    remained          at    the    centre         line      unt i l    the

    order     came       to    clear         the     ground,          this    being       about       40 minutes            after        I

    had    first     gone          onto      the     pitch .          From    the       time     I went        onto      the     pitch        I

    saw    numerous           supporters             who    were       very abusive             and aggressive                 towards

    the    Police,        many          of   these        were    clearly          drunk.           The    situation           on the

    pitch was        very          chaotic,          there       were     many         orders       and    counter-orders.

    The    majority           of    decisions             were    made       by P o l i c e     Constables.                For a

    considerable              time       I saw       no    officers          on    the. p i t c h a b o v e        the     rank     of

    Chief     Inspector.




    I had     been       on the          pitch       for     a   considerable             length          of   time when           I saw

    Chief     Superintendent                   N e s b i t , who       appeared          to    take       some     control         of    the

    situation.            Shortly             after       the    match       was       officially          a b a n d o n e d and

    fans     were    asked          to       leave.        I went       with       other       officers           into     Penistone

    Road.      I was          detailed          to    stand       outside          C h a r l i e B r o w n âs t y r e       shop and

    stop     people       going          down      towards        Herries          Road.        This       I was      told,        was       to

    keep an access                 route       for a m b u l a n c e s .          It    soon     became        apparent          that
                     /                                                                                                              â 



    the    ambulances              were      travelling           in the          opposite          direction,           by this

    time     the    congestion               was     so a c u t e      on P e n i s t o n e     Road       that     nothing

    appeared        to    be m o v i n g .




    On    conclusion,              when      the     congestion           had      subsided,          I returned            to     the

    North Stand           where          I re-joined             my    serial.           We    were       eventually           stood

    dow n.     We    went          into      Penistone           Road and waited                for       s ome    time     for

    transport        back          to    Woodseats          Police        Station.             On a r r i v i n g     at    that

    Police     Station             I went       off       d u t y at    7.'13 p.m.

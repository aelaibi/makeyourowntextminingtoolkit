 At about         twenty to three              I noticed that       the Liverpool            s u pporters        in

 the two middle             pens were          climbing over       the fences,          separating         the

 pens,    into the          pens which weren't             so full,         and    I assu m e d that       the    fans

 were    doing       this    because       it was too       crowded          in the    pens they were            in.

 That    is how the s i t u a t i o n           looked to me.

 I kept       looking over          to the Leppings Lane stand and                      I saw several

 people       being    pu.13.ed up into           the West     stand situated above.                   All      the

 time    1 was       thinking       of             , my son,       who      I knew was       in the       terraces

 even though          I didn't       know his exact           position.            At three     o'clock         the

 football         m atch started and the teams                  kicked       off and started to              play.

 A few minutes            into     the game       I noticed that more               people     than before

 were    climbing         the fences           trying    to get    into      the other       pens and        I saw

 some    fans a c t ually          climbing       the    perimeter       fencing and getting               down

 onto    the       pitch.     As    I w a t c h e d them     I was trying           to follow the game at

 the    same      time.

 Then,    whilst       the ball          was    in the Liverpool            area    by the goal          I saw a

 Policeman          run onto the          pitch and a p p r o a c h the           referee.      It was at this
                                                                                                                 PAGE         ;
                                                                                                                 S 1213

             time    that the match was              stopped.        Then   I could see that there was

             obv i o u s l y something was           wrong     behind the Liverpool goal as                  I could    see

             fans    getting      out over     the       perimeter      fence and onto          the   pitch.

             After    a few minutes          the     police       started to help the fans over               the fence

             as s i st ed by other      supporters who            had alre a d y    got out.          Then    I saw

             people    being       carried from the Leppings Lane                  end on stretchers and

             hoardings       over to the       end of the         pitch near       to where      1 was.        I then

             started to worry          for my son's          safety      realising       that   people       had been

             injured and         I left my seat           in the stand and went down to the                    level

             where    the    refreshment       stand and the toilets are.                   I then brought            it to

             the a t t e nt io n of a couple of Police Offic e r s                  that    there was         some    sort

             of trouble          in the stand where my son was and the officer                          took me to

             the first aid          room so    I could see         if              was    in there

             Upon    seeing      that he wasn't           in there      1 made   my way onto          11ys   pitch

             intending        to walk over     the        pitch to the terraces            to try and find

                            As    I did so some      fans     placed a hoardi ng\caj^ryi ng a m a n ,down

             onto    the    pitch near       to me and they^/Tus’
                                                                r md off             back down to the            other

             end.     The man was       in his mid to/xate              t w e n t i es and my first          reaction to

             the man was         that he wasn't mo/i ng and o b v i o u s l y             in need of help.             His
sa*.         eyes were       shut and he w a s n         ' t moving.      I knelt    down a l ongside          the man

             and    commenced moutl~\to rooufxh resuscitation.                      I must      have done       this    for
4tU3r
             about    three minutes          bulTi       didn't   get any    response from him.                It was

^ 4? loi^)   after    that       I realised    it was       too   late and that          the man was         dead.

                c o u l d n ’t describe      the man neither            his facial       features      or his    exact

             clothing       except    that    I think       he had a red top on w h i c h was                probably a

             Liverpoo l       jersey and      I think he          could have     been wearing          jeans    but    I ’m

             not      sure.      I then left the          man and went back         into the      north stand          to

             get     above pitch      level    so    I    could see      if I could see my son.

             W i t hi n m inutes     I was    reunited with my son who was sligh t l y                       injured and

             who    had a puncture w o u n d to his               right hand which he           received whilst

                                                                                                         SI 213

             being    hauled over the         spikes at the top of the           perimeter     fence.        We

           ' both then wa i t e d      in the     stand until    there was an a n n o u n c e m e n t   that the

             game was       over and we then        left    of our own accord.

             Everything       I have   said     in this statement       is true and       I am will i n g      to

             give    evidence      if required.       I want    to say that      I w ould not     recognise

             the    person who      I tried to      resusitate.

             Also    in conclusion       I would     like    to say that my own feelings are               that

             the tragedy         occurred   because    the a l l o c a t i o n of tickets was wrong          and

             also    lack   of    information to Police and S t e wards who             should have        seen

             before     the game started that          the    two winged areas were empty when                 the

             two    centre ones were        full.     (Signed)

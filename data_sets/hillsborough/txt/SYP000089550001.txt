             At 9.0 0 am       (0900)      on Sa tu r d a y   15th April      1989       (150489)   I commenced

              duty at H a m m e r t o n Road Police Station.

             At     11.00 am     (1100)     together with Supt M CK AY we tr avelled around the

              area     looking    for   possible       trouble     spots     re   crime.



              At    1.55pm    (1355)    the same day I went               to the g y mn as ium where       I had a

              meal.

At 2. 2 0 p m     (1420)    together w i t h Supt Mc KA Y        I walk ed onto     t h e p erimeter

track of the         pitch in front of the Kop.                 There was a large

number of N o t t i n g h a m Forest         supporters      but still   a large number of

empty spaces.             I looked towards        the Le ppings Ln end of the ground and

I could see that            t h e middle     section of terracing        behind the goal and

in front         of the tunnel ap pe a r ed to have a large number                of Liverpool

supporters a l r ea dy        in the side        pens a p pe ar ed to be e m p t y .     The West

stand seating a p p e a r e d empty.



At 2 . 2 5 p m    <1425)    I wal ke d behind the S o u t h stand towards              t h e Leppings

Lane    end,      once at this        location    I stood behind a portable             barrier

together with a number                of un iformed officers.



I could see that a large                crowd had deve lo pe d near       to the turnstiles

area which was for the Leppings Lane standing area.                           The      crowd were

shoulder         to shoulder       pushing against        each other and     I heard some of

these fans         plead with Police officers to do something                  to      relieve the

situation.          The    crowd was       now all   the way out of the b a rr ie red area

and onto Leppings Lane                itself.     I could see and hear ma n y more fans

walkin g towards           this    large    crowd down Le pp in gs Lane over the bridge.

The    crowd was not moving at all and no one ap pe a r e d to be gaining

entrytothe           ground.



There were a number               of Pol ic e- of fi ce rs   standing    inbetween the

turnstiles and these were                  ordered away by an Pol         Inspector.



At 2.40      pm    (1440)    the situ at io n had wor se ne d and tempers              had started

to flare and Police               officers were      being su bjected to a great deal of

abuse    from      certain individuals           in the      crowd.   One Liverpool       fan said
                                                                                           PAGE         3
                                                                                           S3381

to me,     "This     is Heisal       all   over a g a i n . 11 people were now ob viously

distress ed.



I saw a number            of fans start      to climb on to the top of the

turnstil e wall and start              to wave      their    tickets at officials       inside    the

ground.          The gate that was         near    to my    right hand side kept       opening and

closing     this was        both to eject         people from the ground and also          to take

injured people            inside.     I saw that         one young    child was    carried from

the front of the turnstiles and                    into the ground.        This y ou th ap pe ar ed

to be unconscious.



1 saw two Police            ho rsemen were        now    in the thick of the       crowd and    could

not move         from their    positions.          I saw a beer       can thrown at    one of the

horses this was            from a group of youths who were               jumping   up and down

and shoving         the    crowd forward.



I saw a youth who was               standing      near    to me who    I know lives    in the

H i l l s b o r o u g h area of Sheffield,         he    called out my name an d      I had a

conversation with him.                He stated he h a d n ’t got a ticket           but he was

just    taking      in the atmosphere.



I then wal ke d       into the thick of the               crowd together with Supt HcKAY but

could only get a few yards                 before we had to go back to the safety

of the barrier.             There were a number            of youths    chanting and singing,

there was a strong smell               of alcohol         in the area.



I then heard a Police               loud hailer asking         people    to stop pushing and

then the ground speaker               system do the same.



At 2 . 5 5 p m    (1455)    the gate near         to me was opened and there was a sudden

rush of people          into the ground.             Many fans started to cheer after                th

decision.



It became ap parent            to me that a number            of you th §/ wh o    had been

wandering about ask ing              for     tickets were      ngw    j^fnning    into the g r o u n d .

The youth who       I had been talking               to ranQjarto the ground and a large

number    of other fans with tickets were holding                        them out        to us saying

they h a d n ’t handed them            in.    After    this    I went back along           the South

stand and onto          the    pitch a ga in       in front of the Kop.



At 3. 0 0 pm     (1500)       the match kicked off.



At 3.02    pm    (1502)       I saw a number         of youths       start   to climb onto the

pitch an d also up to the West stand.                        S h or tl y after    this    I saw an

Inspector       run onto       the   pitch and stop the game.                Large   numbers of

people now started to                climb onto      the   pitch,      I stayed at        the Kop end

of the ground as          I had no         radio and did not          realise what was        in fact

happening. Fans were             now being         carried from the Leppings Lane end of

the ground on stretchers and also ad v er ti si ng                      boards.       I walked over

to the Le ppings Lane            end but shortly a f te rw ar ds w^s              requested to

atte nd the gymnasium.                I a r riv ed at the gymnasirlim to find a large

number of bodies          being       carried      inside.     I ass is te d     in laying    the

bodies out       into    lines of         12 and    placing ythem in body bags where

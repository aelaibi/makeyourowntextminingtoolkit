             We    had    1unc h at      the S o u t h Yo rkshi re Po l i c e              Sports        & Social    Clu b which

             is s it u a t e d    just a few m in u t e s           walk      from the       ground.         There a p p e a r e d

             serv i c e    of meals was          very    slow and we did not                   leave       the C l u b until

             On w al k i n g     towards      the   gr o u n d     I saw      considerable          numbers       of L i v erpool

unlikely         they w o u l d all           have       seat     tickets       and    they were              leaving        it

rather        later      to get on to the terraces                        and    expect              to have a reasonable

a number         of big m a t c h e s , I was               i m m e d i a t e l y struck             by how s p a r s e l y

s e c tions      i mm ed i a t e l y b e h i n d the goal            were       t ight ly p a c k e d .            The area

b ey o n d the mi ddle Vsej^tfi oris looked                       less    c rowded than the middle

s e c tions      but my        r ec o l l e c t i o n    is that     there was           nowhere            near      so much

space as         there was          in the         s ec t i o n   closest       to me,         although          it may be

the     gaps were          less obvi o u s           because       that a r e a was            nearly the w i d t h of

               1 saw a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t          run from behind               the    goal      and up the g a n g w a y

               close      to w here        I was        sit ting          : I believe           it was      this      officer who

              almost       i mm ed i a t e l y    came back           down the g a n g w a y to try to attr a c t                    the

              p e r imete r     fence,      s e e me d to be getting                     out of hand,           I saw a Police

i m p o s si bl e    to judge          from w here         I was     sitting       what had happened.

T h e r e was what           1 can only describe                  as an a t m o s p h e r e    of    impending

v i o l e n c e as there were m a ny young male                          s p e c t a t o r s w a n d e r i n g about       the

trouble.           The    s p e c t at or s      seated    close     to me had no          idea at         that     stage

wha t      had gone w rong             or     that    people      had been s e r i o u s l y hurt and there

was     a general          feel i n g       of    i rr i t a t i o n towards     the spect a t o r s        on the

p it c h     ....    I recall          one s pe c t a t o r     below me an d to my              right a n d seat

very       close to the            pitch being            invol v e d    in a heated a r g u m e n t w i t h a

y o u n g m an who         had a p p a r e n t l y      come    from the       terra c e s     behind the

Liverpool           goal.

The a t m o s p h e r e was         tense a n d , since            I had      charge      of a      14 year        old,     I

considered           leaving        s t r a ig ht away         in order       that we      could safely             return

to m y       car    parked some             d i s tance a way       ? four      people     sitting         i m m e d iately

in f ront of me              left at          that    t ime    : H o w e v e r , I believe          it was     generally

felt       by all        those a r o u n d me that,             although        it was     obvious         some     people

had     been hurt,           the    game was          still     likely to        re-start a n d          people      just

sat     back       to wait       for     order       to be     restored.         As time went            on th o u g h      it

b e c a me    obvious        there were            people      on the     pitch who        had been s e r iously

i n ju r e d and         I remember           seeing      three    or four       being     g iven heart massage.

It was        only as        time went            on that the        seriousness         of the s i t u a t i o n

gradually           began to strike                home a n d     I reali s e d      there     had been a number

s pe ct at or s were a sk ed                to    remain      in their      places and         I was a p p a l l e d at

in stay i n g any            longer as most               of the     people      had    left.        E v e n whe n     1

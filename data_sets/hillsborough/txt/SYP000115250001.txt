     There were no problems experienced at either barrier until 2.30 pm

     (1430), when the crowd at the Leppings Lane end began to build up.                                      I

     had checked my personal                   radio and found it to be in good working order

     I began to hear radio messages to the effect that the crowd at

     Leppings Lane end were becoming agitated.                              Additional men were

     requested and Police Horses arrived.                               The barriers were opened twice

     to permit the horses access.                        The crowd was making more and more

     noise and it was difficult to hear radio traffic.                               I saw a beer can

     thrown from the rear of the crowd towards the turnstiles.                                  The can

     was opened and fluid was falling from it.                               Youths began climbing over

                    at turnstiles A-G.

     At this time the crowd pushed towards the concertina d o o r‘""adjacent to

     our barrier.              Suddenly the concertina door opened,                  I believed itxfrad

     been forced open.                About 200 fans entered unchecked before Police

     horses      cut off fans and t h ^ g a ^ ’ wasj j/l o/ed

     concertina doors.                There was no pressure against the barrier.                      I

     heard a message over the public address                             telling the crowd at the

     Leppings Lane end to stop pushing as there was room inside.                                    The

     crowd pushed forward towards the turnstiles.                               I saw Inspector Purdy

■X   standing on a crash barrier shouting at the crowd.                                  A young boy was

     carried over the head of the crowd to Inspector Purdy.

                  I heard a radio message concerning the kick off.  I did not hear the
                  *                                                             ,

                  message clearly because of the noise.  The message related to the

                      kick off.          It was either a request to postpone the kick off for                   15

                      iffiitiutes   or    message stating the kick off had been put back.

                      I heard       an iVijjyaictiOn Over, the radio stating that the gates at                  the1

                      Leppings M mi # end should b© o p e n e d . . As soon as I heard the message

                      the gate adjacent to our barrier opened.                  The     crowd surged t h r o u g h :

                      unchecked like water from a tap.   The forecourt cleared in minutes as

                      the outer gates were closed the concertina gates were closed and our

                      barrier was moved forward.                 The outer gates were opened and the crowd

                      once again filled the forecourt to turnstiles A-G.

                      The concertina gates were opened slightly and persons were allowed in

                      after checking of tickets.                 Inspector W h i te was supervising this

                      procedure.

                      1 walked to the barrier behind the rear of the South Stand.                          As I was

                      walking towards            it I heard a radio message          requesting every available

                      officer to go into the ground.                 I got to the barrier and no officers

                      were present.         I went to the BBC vans nearby and saw a technician

                      looking at a TV monitor.               I   enquired what had      happened and was told

                      that there had been a pitch                invasion,

                      I walked back to the top barrier at the Leppings Lane end in order to

                      check what men if any had remained at the barrier.                       As I approached

                      the concertina gates they were opened obviously from the inside.                               I

                      saw a man being carried by three others.                      The man appeared to be dead.

                  ^1 said to these mens                 "Wha t’s happening."        One answered:    "There's

q£SC- ^       0       people dying        in there get inside."          I entered through the concertina

                      doors and saw another man being                carried.       He was unconscious and

                      outside the concertina doors.                 He was not breathing and I applied

         very shallow.        I was joined by a female who stated she was a nurse.

         She felt the m a n ’s pulse and confirmed that he had a pulse.                             I later

         identified this patient on the television as a mar) giving the name

        __________________      No    sooner   had   the   nurse    confirmed a       pulse    than a man

        who     stated   he w a s    a doctor arrived*         I l a t er e s t a b l i s h e d t ha t this

         was Dr* JohrtAshton of Liverpool U n i v e r s i t y .             He exarhined

                    confirmed his pulse and the fact "that he was breathing but                               «

         not conscious.         I stayed with the patient until he was                    conveyed by

         ambulance from the scene at 4.00 pm.                  <1600)      He regained

         consciousness about 3.40 pm <1540) and complained of pain in his

         chest and in his           right leg which he was unable to move.                    I comforted

         him and assured h i m ..         I saw Dr. Ashton certifying dead bodies about

         10 and after my patient had been carried assisted in security of the

         bodies.     Dr. Ashton was also giving advice as to which patients

         should be carried by the ambulance service.                       Whilst with the patient

                             I heard repeated radio messages for ambulances to be

         directed to the Leppings Lane.

         I later formed a cordon against the crush barrier preventing the fans

         leaving the ground,           getting to the dead and injured.                  Many Liverpool

         fans were abusive as they left.                   They were calling the officers               in

         the cordon Murdering Bastards and Fucking Murdering Bastards.                                 When

         the crowds had left and the bodies had been removed to the temporary

         mortuary by Police vans I went to the North Stand and collected my

         serial with the exception of PC 3162 Pears who was on Mortuary

         Duties.     I later enquired from members; of my serial what                         part they

         took in the incident and wrote down a resume on the de-brief sheet.

         I retired from duty at 7.30 pm.                   <1930)

        The duties of Serial 6 was to man barriers to be erected at the rear

of South Stand adjacent to the car paricr and barriers from turnstiles A-G                    ^

at Leppings Lane end.          The area between the two   barriers was to remain

sterile.          Liverpool supporters were not to be permitted entry.   The only

personsgdlowedentry were to be aiAhozis^ persons and persons with tickets

for South Stand, ie Nottingham Forest Supporters.

        At 11.00am my serial took up their positions. Manning the barriers at

-rear of South Stand were 2-518--Marshall, 1159 Long, 169 Fillingham, DC 515

Cawkwell and DC 1828 Metcalfe.          The following officers were manning the ta p ^

barrier near turnstiles A-G, PC 28 Drewitt, PC 861 Wadsworth, PC 3217 Wadsworth,

 3162 Pears and 142 Long.
        There were no problems experienced at either barrier until 2.30pm when

the crowd at the Leppings Lane end began to build up.          I had checked my personal

radio and found it to be in good working order.           I began to hear radio messages

to the effect that the crowd at lappings Lane end were beccming aggitated.

Additional men were requested and Police Horses arrived.           The barriers were

opened twice to permit the horses access.          The crowd was making more and more

 noise and it was difficult to hear radio traffic.          I saw a beer can thrown

 from the rear of the crowd towards the turnstiles.         The can was opened and

 fluid was falling from it. Youths began climbing over the wall at turnstiles

A-G.
        At this time tbs crowd pushed towards the concertina door adjacent to

 our barrier.         Suddenly the concertina door opened, I believed it had been

 forced open.         About 200 fans entered unchecked before Police horses cut off

 fans and the gate was closed.

         The crowd pushed forward and once again pressed against the concertina

doors . There was no pressure against the barrier . I heard a message over

the Public address telling the crowd at the Leppings Lane end to step

pushing as there was room inside.               The crowd              pushed   forward towards the

turnstiles*      I saw Inspector Purdy standing on a crash barrier shouting at                                        "

         I heard a radio message concerning the kick off. I did not hear the
message clearly because of the noise.                      The message related to the kick off.                   , “

It was either a request to postpone the kick off for 15 minutes or a message

stating the kick off had been put back.
         I heard an instruction over the radio stating that the gates at the Leppings

to our barrier opened*             The crowd surged through unchecked like water frcxn a

tap.     The forecourt cleared in minutes as the outer gates were closed.                              The

concertina gates were closed and our barrier was moved forward.                              The outer                     I

gates were opened and the crowd ones again filled the forecourt to turnstiles

A-G. V
     The concertina gates were opened slightly and persons were allowed in

after checking of tickets.                Inspector White was supervising this procedure.

          I walked to the barrier behind the rear of the South Stand.                              As I was

walking towards it I heard a radio message requesting every available officer

to go into the ground.             I got to the barrier and no officers were present.

 I went to the BBC Vans nearby and saw a technician looking at a TV monitor.

 I enquired what had happened and was told that there had been a pitch

 invasion.

      I walked back to the top barrier at the Leppings Lane end in order to

check what men if any had remained at the barrier.        As I approached the

concertina gates they were opened obviously from the inside.        I saw a man

being carried by three otters., The man appeared to be dead.        I said to these

men,, "What's happening?"       One answered, "There's people dying in there get inside."

I entered through the concertina doors and saw another man being carried.          He        Wi­

I was joined by a female who stated she was a nurse.        She felt the mans pulse

and confirmed that he had a pulse.        I later identified this patient on the

television as a man giving the name                       No sooner had the nurse

confirmed a pulse than a man who stated he was a doctor arrived.        I later          /

established that this was Et. John Ashton of Liverpool University.        He examined -

____________ confirmed his pulse and the fact that he was breathing but not

conscious.   I stayed with the patient until he was conveyed by ambulance from

the scene at 4.00pm.      He regained consciousness about 3.40pm and complained of

pain in his chest and in his right leg which he was unable to move.        I comforted

him and assured him.      I saw Dr. Ashton certifying dead bodies about 10, and

after my patient had been carried assisted in security of the bodies.        Dr.

Ashton was also giving advice as to which patients should be carried by the

ambulance service.     Whilst with the patient                  I heard repeated

radio messages for ambulances to be directed to the Leppings Lane.

      I later formed a cordon against the crush barrier preventing the fans

leaving the ground, getting to the dead and injured. Many Liverpool fans

were abusive as they left.       They were calling the officers in the aordon

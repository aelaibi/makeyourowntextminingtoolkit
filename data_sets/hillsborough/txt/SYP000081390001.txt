              crushing,        all      I noticed was             that the         central     area at the L ep pings Ln

trouble.             After about 5-6 minutes          I saw a police officer run onto                         the

field,       talk to the         referee,    who    i y t u r n , stopped the game & led the

players        off the field.            On seeyfcj this,         I decided to go to the             toilet

knowing        it could be some           timar before the game was               restarted.        This

w o u l d be about        1510 hours ^1510).           On     returning         to my viewing

position,            I passed throuo/i the gap s eparating                 the Spion Kop from the

W o r t h Stand.         At this    p/int    I saw bodies          on stretchers          with blankets

covering        their faces.         jl assu me d that all             three    persons must       be dead.

I returned for a short               time    to my viewing             position & after a short

d is cu ss io n with my friends,             I decided to          return to the area to see                   if

I could be of assistance.                   I a pp ro a ch e d a police          officer.        I think       he

was    an Inspector,         he had one       ’pip'    on his shoulder,             who gave me

clearance            to go onto    the    pitch area.        As    I passed the          corner    of the

N or th Stand,          supporters were       running       o v e / with       injured    people    on

advertising            hoardings & stretchers.              j/ s a w    two men,    both of them were

a t te m p t i n g    to resuscitate a young          fyan of about            18-24 yrs of age,          a

white male,            slim build,       about S ’lPMO tall,            he had short       brownish hai r

whi ch ap pe ar ed to be ginger              in/places.           He was wearing          blue    jeans & a

whi te T shirt,           there was a g/ey black & white woollen                         pullover    lying

beside       him which      I took       to/be his.     He was wearing a gold                ’Be lcher

chain ar ou nd his          neck.        / took over from the older                of the two men &

continued to give m o u t Jrr~to— m outh             resus c it at io n for between 8/10

minutes,         having e st ab li sh ed     the two men had alre ad y been trying                       for

about 5 minutes.             After       this time we all          decided       it was    futile    to

proceed any further as the young man was o b vi ou sl y beyond help.                                      I

placed the            pullover    over his face & he was                taken away by St John

A m b u l a n c e Brigade.

S h o r t l y after      this all    three of us went             to almost       the    centre    line

w here we saw another              fan being       carried by spectators                on hoardings.

               He was wearing              blue jeans & a white T %nirt with a Liverpool                                emblem

               e mb l a z o n e d on the       chest.        We again stayed w ith him for                      10-13 minutes

               before       realising        he too was beyonsr help.                     I think some fans then

               carried       him to the First Aid Pq/s t .                       I then      left the two men who             I. had

               been with & went              to the       po 1 icfe    cordon lining           the    centre     of the field.

               I a g a i n e x plained to officers                    I was a ss i st i ng      the     injured & they

               lying     on the          pitch.     I tyould describe              him as about 30 yds             of age

               white male,, medium build,                    about 5*10-11             tall,    wearing       blue jeans         I

               cannot       recall what           else he was wearing.                   There were four          people

               at te m p t i n g    to    resuscitate        him,      one of whom obv io us ly knew what                  he was

               doing.        He was telling             the others how to                perform      cardiac massage.           I

               asked     if he wished me to assist                      him,      e xplained     I was a q ualified first

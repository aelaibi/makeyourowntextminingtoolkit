Please find enclosed a copy o f my recent letter to Mr Croston, Prosecution Team Leader. I
am also copying you the file of papers referred to therein, as an indication of my concern as to
what might or could happen to them. Whilst I appreciate that Mr Croston has been nominated
to deal with the “review” on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, I feel compelled to
take the extra precaution o f supplying you with copy documentation. This decision is heavily
influenced by the unique circumstances o f this case in which all o f the original documentation
is in the sole custody of South Yorkshire Police.

You will note that in my letter to Mr Croston, I make reference to a poor copy of a three page
statement made by Inspector White and dated 6thMay 1989, I now enclose a copy o f the
same, enhanced by myself during preliminary tests. I should be grateful if you would insert
this document as pages 10 lA -101C, together with a suitable note which indicates that, at this
stage this is merely my attempt to decipher the contents of the statement. Even allowing for
that caveat, I am sure you will appreciate the significance of the statement.

I should be grateful if you would immediately confirm receipt of this letter and file of papers.

Yours faithfully



A Adlington

        Dear Mr Croston

        Adlington v M urray: Adlington v Duckenfield

        I look forward to your letter confirming the contents o f our telephone conversation today.
        For the purposes o f your review o f the documents in this matter, and with reference to our
        continuing concerns that the South Yorkshire Police have custody of the relevant documents,
        we enclose a file o f questionnaires, statements and letters. Tab 1 contains different versions of
        the questionnaire sent out to South Yorkshire officers soon after the disaster by Chief
        Superintendent Wain o f that force for the purposes of their unsworn statements. Tab 2 is a
        sample of the different questionnaire used by West Midlands Police to put to spectators when
        formal witness statements were taken from them.

        Tab 3 contains a draft of the statement with a date of 17* July 1990 prepared by or for Chief
        Inspector Bettison, a copy o f which we have sent you already. The following tabs contain the
        original and edited statements o f a number o f officers, with highlighted marks for your
        convenience. You will see that the passages removed from the first three officers' statements
        (Holmes, K. Frost, and Wilson) show careful excisions o f factual matters which are adverse to
        the South Yorkshire Police, whereas many obvious comments, which are not adverse to that
        force, or which are adverse to Liverpool supporters, remain unedited in the second versions.
        A statement from Wilson was sent to the DPP in 1990, and occupies 9 pages according to the
        Master Witness L ist Both the edited and unedited statements are 8 pages long.

    On page 63 and 68, we have highlighted an important sentence from the first statements oFPC
    Guest (one of the few South Yorkshire officers who made a formal witness statement to the
    West Midlands Police) indicating that h was obvious at 2.40 pm that the crowds outside
    Leppings Lane could not be accommodated. This would also have been obvious to the
    defendants in the current case. However, it was the case for the South Yorkshire Police at the
    inquest that the overcrowding was not evident before the match started at 3 pm. This was a
    critical issue at the inquest, and the Coroner took the view on the evidence called before him,
    that the overcrowding was not evident before the match started at 3 pm. We note from the
    Master Witness List o f April 1990, that five or six pages o f statements only from PC Guest
    were sent. Guest died before the inquest, but no statement was read to the jury.

    The statements of PC Titterton show the removal of important factual observations from the
    end of the first statement, including, at page 88, matters going to the heart o f all investigations
    into the disaster. A statement from him is listed in the Master Witness List.

    Inspector White’s first statement tab 9, included passages at page 100-1 that were deleted
    from the second edited statement. (The first document came to us with the lines through the
    relevant paragraphs). You will see that the first deleted paragraph contains the evidence that
    White would always monitor the build-up of spectators in the Leppings Lane pens by climbing
    the steps to the control box (occupied on the day o f the disaster by the two defendants and
    others) to get a good view.

    There can be no honest reason for the deletion of this evidence. It is the kind o f assertions
    that Bettison at tab 3, pages 17-8 suggested, the following year, must be “clarified” where it
    appears on other officers’ statements. The statement o f the next witness, PC Woodcock, tab
     10, demonstrates the central importance of the deleted parts o f Inspector White’s evidence.
    The passage at the middle o f page 112 asserts that Inspector White normally diverted
    spectators from the central pens, but on this occasion was told not to. If true, it proves that
    paragraph 4 on page 15 in the statement of Bettison was wrong.

    This issue is at the heart o f the case. The South Yorkshire Police claim that the diversion of
    oncoming supporters from the central pens in 1988 was unknown to senior officers. Lord
    Justice Taylor had found in his 1989 report that the failure to divert the spectators in 1989,
    after the decision had been made to open the gates, was a “blunder o f the first magnitude” and
    the immediate cause o f the fatal crushing. The 1988 events prove foreseeability, which is of
    course critical to dvO and criminal allegations o f negligence. They are of the most obvious
    relevance to the manslaughter issue in the prosecutions.

    We have also received a very poor copy of a 3 page statement o f Inspector White dated 6,h
    ?^ay 1989 which we expect to be deciphered for us soon by technical experts.

    Faced with the evidence o f White and Woodcock, the honest course for the officers preparing
    the evidence would have been to ask Inspector White to say whether Woodcock’s account
    was true, and to produce his answers. Instead, the passages in both statements were excised
    and the truth was suppressed. A seven page statement o f White appears in the M aster Witness
    List. This may have been the first statement, submitted with the lines deleted.



                                                     -   2-
On the other hand, the Wilson statements, described above, were both eight pages long but
occupied 9 pages according to the Master Witness List. This would suggest that only the
second, six page statement of White might have been sent, and the extra page, in his and
Wilson’s cases were a title or introductory page in the original bundles of evidence sent to the
DPP. We note that, in either event, no statement o f Woodcock appears in that list.

Associated with this subject is the statement o f PC Lang at Tab 13. Neither the important
matters at the end of page 163 in the six page statement, nor any of the statement of 2"d June
1989, appears in the five page amended report at pages 167 to 171 of the file. The Master
Witness List shows that only a five (or possibly four) page statement o f Lang was sent to the
DPP. It appears clear that the DPP did not know, therefore, of Lang’s 1988 experience,
which confirms the facts set out in the original statements o f White and Woodcock.

We are not surprised to note that none of White, Woodcock or Lang was called to give
evidence to Taylor or at the inquest, at which they would have been cross-examined. Their
unrevised evidence shows that a senior officer used to monitor the pens; that a diversion from
the central pens took place in 1988; but that there was a failure to take this known and
obvious precaution in 1989, resulting in ninety-six deaths.

The statements o f Pattison, Tab 11, Tissington, Tab 12, Kennedy, Tab 14, Dunn, Tab 15 and
Royle, Tab 16, show important deletions of factual observations adverse to the interests of the
South Yorkshire Police, and are samples of the dozens of examples we have discovered. Of
these, Tissington was called before the Inquest, and a statement from him was contained in the
Master Witness List. None of the others referred to in this paragraph were called at the
Inquest, nor were their statements recorded in the Master Witness List.

Although the West Midlands Police Questionnaire asked spectators for “Views or
Observations” (question 53, page 12), we know o f no cases in which such observations were
removed from their witness statements. There are innumerable examples of police statements
which, even after editing, contain hearsay and comment adverse to Liverpool supporters. You
wilt see that the process o f amendments and deletions to the police statements o f matters
prejudicial to their own force goes far beyond that referred to in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
report. We believe he was misled.

It is only at the insistence o f the Home Secretary himself that we have been given access to
these statements this year. Before the report of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s “Scrutiny” we
knew virtually nothing o f all this. We shall send you a comprehensive analysis o f all the
statements by 8lh September, but you will see why we are so concerned that the South
Yorkshire Police are holding all the material, and, as the correspondence at Tab 17 shows, are
acting under the advice o f Hammond Suddards, and particularly Mr Peter Metcalf. This is the
solicitor who, according to the Bettison statement at Tab 3, pages 15 to 18, was taking a
leading part in what Bettison describes as “clarification” of witness statements, in the context
o f civil proceedings in July 1990. At the same time, o f course, leading counsel was preparing
to advise the DPP in relation to criminal liability on the baas o f a large number o f unsworn
 statements which had already been similarly “clarified” to the advantage o f the South
 Yorkshire Police, the year before.

 We are sending a copy of this letter and the file to Hammond Suddards. I f you cannot compel
 the police to hand over the material, can you at least give them some guidance? Your review
 will take several weeks as it is. The South Yorkshire Police are at present acting under the
 guidance (see page 202) that you have given them, namely, that they might not wish to hand
 over the material until your review is complete. Surely, in the light of this material, you can
 revoke that guidance.

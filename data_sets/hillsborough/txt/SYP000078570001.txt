Public: Ha use on Langsett- Rd and the F r e e m a s o n s Arms y f Walk ley i.~n,

At    1310 we          received a radio message           to att e n d a       ■'ious disorder           at

the Royal         Hotel     on Pen i s t o n e Rd.      Upon a r r i v a / a crowd was       shouting,

singing        outside and there were glasses a n c / b o t t 1es on the                    pavements.

The    public          house wa-3 overflowing and w / h a d          to shove       our way       inside

t hrough       the      crowd who were        shout i ng S singing     etc.,    the scene         inside

was    chaos with broken glasses,                 bottles,       tables and     chairs      overturned,

90    per    cent of the          customers     w!re    football    fans,    both Notts and

Liverpool.             There was     no fighting        taking    place when we arrived.                 Due

to the state             of the    premises and the        customers who were             quite

o b viousl y well          pii ed with dr ink the Sergeant             ordered the         clgsure of

t h e p ii.b 1 i c h o u s e w hich was       complied with,

At    1450 hours a message              was    received    to at t e n d theyH orse and Joc k e y

public house, Wads l e y Ln, fighting                    on the    premisses.       Upon arrival,
........   -..... —       JitlWn ... —-
a p p r o x i m a t e l y four minutes        later,    I saw thaj/a very        large      crowd of

fans     (mainly Liverpool)             had gathered on kfie forecourt               of the       premises

a p p ro xi m a te ly 60,     several       were sat or/laying         on the    pavement         or    in

su r r o u n d i n g    gardens.     Glasses,     botl/les, a n d food cartons             littered the

area.       We entered        the    public     hou/e and found        it pa ck e d to      ca pa c i t y .

Fans were         still     drinking,       shouting and singing,           mostly    in good humour,

broken bottles and glasses                    littered the       premises,     but no actual

fighting was taking                place.      Again this     public    house was         requested

to    close up,          this was done.

Shortly after att e n d i n g           to this      incident we a s s i s t e d officers at the

bottom of W ad s i e y Ln who had a r r ested a football                     fan,    we    provided

t r a nspor t      to H a m m er to n Rd Police        station.

At    1510 we were          sent    to Leppi n g s Ln to assist         other    officers.             Upon

arrival        at the Main Gate          to the Football /Ground I saw a large                     crowd of

football         supporters mill i n g around the/gates and                  into the       roadway.

Several        a m bulances       were arriv i n g fo 1 j/iiwed by Fire        tenders

        o t h e r o f f ice r s t,o keep the main gate             clear for the E m e r g e n c y Services ,

        w hi ch was e x t remely difficult              due to the       crowds    of    crying    shocked

        supporters           who were       leaving the ground by this            gate?    others were       then

        a tt e m pt i n g    to gain    re-entry to search for missing                  friends.     At this

        time     1 had no knowledge             of what      had taken place       inside    the ground,          but

        a ss u m e d a major a c c ident           of some    sort due    to the arrival          of more

  ^     E m e r g e n c y Service     vehicles.        I continued to assist at the main                   gate
  /\\J
  ■v for a pp r o xi m a t e l y one hour until              instructed by a        Police       Inspector    to

        guard a small              wicket   gate    leading    to the    terrace    immediately behind

        the Police Control              Post and      prevent    unauthorised       persons       (mainly    press

          and TV reporters)             from entering         the ground.

        At a pp ro xi m a t e l y     1630 I was      stood down from that          post and       i n structed

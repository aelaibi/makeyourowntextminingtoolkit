               I attended         the      b ri efing at about             lOam     (1000)      and was      in serial         18

               suppo r t e r s    who were at          the L ep pi ng s Lane            end of the ground,,

               At about        ten past        eleven      (1110)         we went     to stand       on the      turnstiles

               ready     to search the             fans.          I was    stood w i t h PC 43 Kirk by on the third

               t u r nstile along           and w a i t e d   for     people       coming     that we re going            i nto the

               West     stand.       At     first     there was           a very    steady stream of             people        coming

               to the       ground.         It was mainly            f a m ilies at      this      time wit h       quite a few

               young     children          and also       elderly         people.      As    the    fane a p p r o a c h e d    the

               t ur ns t il es we         checked the      tickets.        A lot of         people were          unsure        of

               w here    they were          going       and       1 gave    them the        directions       as to where            they

               needed       to go.         I star t e d    se arching        the    fans who        seemed     to    be   in a

               jovial      mood     in a n t i c i p a t i o n of the match,,            most      of them at        this stage

               were     good h u m o u r e d and had a laugh and                    joke w i t h us.         They were

               queueing       quite        s e n s i b l y and the re didn't           appear       to be any        problems,.

We    were        given       a    large          plastic            dustbin                to    put       any    property           in w h i c h we

confiscated.                  I took           a screwdriver                       off       of       one    young        lad w h o        said       he

was     an    electrician,.                    I also          took           a    large          banner          from     another          young

lad.         We    also       confiscated                   quite         a       lot       of    cans       but     it w a s      mainly         pop,

not     beer.           We    continued                searching                  in t h i s          manner       u n t il     about       half

p ast    two       (1430)          when        it      began         to       get       more          crowded.

As    the     crowd          increased                it    began more                  difficult             to    search         people

although           1 did. try.                 I saw a            couple               of    people          < lads       of    about       twenty)

get     in wi t h o u t           t i c k e t <5 fay one             person              handing            his    t i cket       in at         the

turnstile              and    someone             e lse       bobbing              down          behind       him and           they       both went

through           at    the       same       time          when      the          turnstile             opened.            At     t his     t ime      it

was     too       cramped          to    a c t u a l ly get. to                    them          to    do a n y t h i n g       about       it.

From     about,         twenty          to     three;         (1440)              the       crowd       of    people           seemed       to

increase           even       more       u n til           it was         just          a    solid          mass     of    peo p l e ,          J. got

pushed away                 from     the       turnstile              and          became             sort    of w e d g e d       against            the

wall.         People          began          to       panic       and         on e w o m a n           became        hysterical»

they were              just       passed          over        the      turnstile,

I can        remember             seeing          a    couple          of         ol d      men who were              so       drunk they

could        hardly          stand       up and             I noticed                  t ha t     a    lot    of    the        lads       had    been

intent        on       getting          into          the    ground.                   After          a while        I lost        s i g ht      of

most     of       the       other       P C ’a on m y             serial               and       was    just       wedged         against         the

beginning              to    get     angry            about       the         crush and were                      swearing         at      me    saying

do    because          I was          j ust   as     squashed            as     they       w ere.       I h a d n ’t got, a           radio

and      so    couldn't           communicate                with       anyone        so    it was       just     a    case      of

looking         after        yourself.               People         were        very       frightened        in       the    crush and

were      panicked           into        pushing         even mare              to    try and        get    out.        Somehow            one

of    the      other       P C ’s g r a b b e d         me    and       p u s h e d me      through        the    turnstile            to

get- out         of    the       crush.           I looked          at     my    watch       when       I got     to    the       other

side      and     it w a s        about       3    or    4 minutes              past       three     (1503/1304).                 I didn’t

know whether                the       teams       had    kicked          off     or    not,         I spoke       to    an

inspector             on    the       other       side       of    the     turnstiles             and    told     him what            it

was      like     on       the    outside.              He    realised           the       situation        but       there      was

nothing          he    could          really       do a b o u t         it,      People        coming       through          the

s t ill       being        passed        over.

We    stood       on       this         s i d e of    the      turnstiles              for a b o u t      f ive    or six

minutes.              People            were coming            up   to      us a s k i n g     where       to     go,. T h e y     had

come      through           the         West stand            turnstile          with        red    ticketswhich             I thi nk

were      for     the       Leppings           Lane          end    standing           part.

After         a few m i n u t e s         Inspector               Sykes       opened        the     right    hand side             gate

to    let us back                out    onto       the tu r n s t i l e          side and the              crowd has more or

less      completely              vanished.              There were              just a few strag g l e r s                  left at

the      turnstiles              and     I actually               searched           two more        people.           I then heard

someone          say we were w a n t e d                 inside          the gro u n d and everyone                     started

running.              I jumped          over       one       of the        turrist i 1 es and follo w e d                   everyone

else      and went           onto       the       pitch half w a y              down on the             right     hand       side..         At

first         it looked           like        it was a pitch                  invasion         but as       I got       closer         to

the      fences        1 could see that                      people were              being       crushed.            The West

stand         crowd were              very    noisey and were                    shouting           'Shitty Ground*.                   I

stood         in front           of    the wire at                the    centre        of the       pitch and there was

j u st    a deathly              silence.            The r e       were       three        faces    X can        remember          seeing

person          behind        him    had    been       sick        on    his        head-         I can       remember            another

policewoman              stood       behind       me    and        she     was       looking           into      the    pe n      saying

"She's          dead,     he's       dead"       etc.      and      just        picking           them      out.        I c a n ’t

At    first       I helped           a few       people          that      had w a lk ed           out        to sit        on the

him.        We w e n t         to    the    corner         of     the p i t c h .            H e w a s n 91 b r e a t h x ng so

wearing          jeans        and    a Liverpool             top.            ’fhe    only      thing          he h a d o n h i m          was

position and              stayed          with    him      in      c ase      he     stopped           breathing            again.          He

was      deeply         unconscious           and      d i d n ’t r e s p o n d          to m y        talking         to    him     or

Some       of    the     fans       began     ripping            down        the     wooden adverts                 from around

who    it w a s        though          whilst         I was          sat     outside           the     gym      people          kept

bringing            more     and       more        bodies        roun d.              There      was    a middle               aged       scruffy

looking         man     with       long        hair,        someone              had     put    an airw ay               in his          mouth

and    his      friend         was       bashing           his       chest        and      screaming            at       him    but       he was

Two    policemen             brought           another           man       round who             was    d e a d , they              plated        him

on    the      floor       and     hi s    trousers              came        down        slightly.              Someone            else        threw

a    coat      over     his       face     and        I thought              what        an    undignified                way       :i.t was      to

die.         People        kept        filing         past       me     with          dead     bodies        and         1 tried          not     to

some      time       someone           decided           that        the     boy        c o u l d go in a n a m b u l a n c e                   so I

helped         put         him     in.        I d i d n ’t k n o w           whether           to g o w i t h       him       or     not        so I

saw a        few     people        with        injuries              walking            towards        the a m b u l a n c e *            to get

treatment.              By     this       time        there          was     a    line        of P C ’s s t o o d a l o n g               the

centre         of    the     pitch.            I    carried           on w a l k i n g         towards          the       other          end    of

the    field.               I heard        a PC          a sk    ten       officers            to go a n d      stand           in the

went      in a n d      stood with                 some     others.               There        w e r e all          sorts       of       property

strewn a r o u n d , mainly                    odd       shoes        and        trainers         that       had         come      off     in the

A Scenes            of C r i m e       Officer           went        into        th e    pen a n d      began            to    take       some

pho t o s .         Some     of    the     f a ns        must        have        thought        he was          a    press         man     an d

about       a dozen          ran       over        and    tried         to       attack.          After         this          I went       from

we    stood         in a     line       whilst           all     the       f ans        were     let    out         of    the      gro und.

Most      of    them       left        quietly           but     a    lot        of     lads    were       making             comments
about,    us    ki 11 ing      the    fans a n d        getting        overtime       for    it,   also     they    didn'

seem     to    realise        that    we    had     been     inside       as   w e l l.

Whilst        I was     sat    with    the       b oy   by   the    gym      there    was    an    incident    where

some     P C *s h a d    to    draw    their        staffs       but    I didn't          actually    see w h a t    h ad

caused        it or w h a t     had    happened.

When     everyone        had    left       the    ground      and      all     the   casualties       had    gone    to

the    hospital         we    went    into       the N o r t h     stand       for   a de-briefing.

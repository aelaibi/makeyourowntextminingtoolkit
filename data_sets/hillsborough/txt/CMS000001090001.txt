HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST: LETTER FROM HM CORONER, DR POPPER

In your recent note to Miss Buxton, you requested a
contribution to your reply to the letter of 1 May from
Dr Popper, covering points raised about the relationship
between inquests and public inquiries into major disasters.

I suggest that the following paragraph is incorporated in your
draft reply to Dr Popper:

        "We are grateful to you for your helpful and constructive
        comments on the relationship between inquests and public
        inquiries into major disasters. You are correct in your
        understanding that officials are exploring the issues
        arising from the overlap between these two forms of
        inquiry. Consideration of these matters is at a
        relatively early stage and I understand that coroners
        such as yourself, who have held inquests into deaths
        arising from recent disasters will, by now, have already
        received a letter from the Chairman of the Working Group
        seeking views on the problems and possible solutions.
        The comments you have made in the light of your
        experience in conducting the Hillsborough inquest will be
        passed on to the Working Group for their consideration."

                     WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS t-


              I am 19 years old.               My date of birth is                                   I travelled
              to H i l l s borough with my friend,                                     by car, leaving at
              ap p r o x i mately 11.00 a.m.           We got      lost on the way but finally
              got       to    the     ground    at    about 2.40         p.m.         and       parked       at     the
              Notting h am     Forest end.           We walked round to the Liverpool end

              and there were a lot of people there and a lot of people asking
              if we had spare tickets.                 There were a few Liverpool lads who
              were      selling     spare      Nottingham     Forest            end    tickets             and    there
              seemed to be plenty of those tickets about.                              You could see that
              the people were getting c r u shed against                          the fence leading                  to
               the turnstile.          People were shouting at the police, asking them
              if     they     could     section      people off.         They weren't                taking         any
              notice and d i d n ’t seem to k n o w what                 to dn,             I   c o h IH    nnlv

              mounted        police    until we       got   very     close        to        the gate         and. the
              mounted police were moving their horses around, causing p«oplp
               to jump out of the way and causing further panic.                                           The crowd
               that I was       in wa? at the right hand side of                                the front gate,
               facing the gate.


               As we got close           to the turnstile,            a policeman grabbed my arm

               and told me to go towards the gate                      and we suddenly found                       that
               we    were     through    the gate       and in     the ground.                  There were no
               police or stewards inside and everyone was heading towards the
               centre tunnel.           As we got to the end of the tunnel, my friend
was on the left of the tunnel and I was going towards the v*ll.
He told me quickly to move to the left but it was impossible to
move at all due to the crush.               I was wearing a leather jacket
which got caught on the wall and hooked over it.                     Fortunately,
It then c a me unhooked and I was catapulted to the right of the
wall.    I was carried down.           You c o u l d n ’t    move and there were
people collapsing all round me.              I have since seen in the paper
                                                  • r

that I was about 5 rows from the front.                 Everyone was screaming

and shouting at        the police     to stop       the game and      there was a

gate by me at the front w i t h a policeman standing by it but all
he was   doing was       shouting     at eveyone        to push back which was
impossible.         Some people   tried to get over the fence but they

were thrown back in by the police,


I went to Whiston Hospital on the Monday as I was in pain                      with
my   chest    and    arms,   having    had    x-rays        I was   found   to have

 bruising but no broken bones.              I have been on a course of pair,
 killers since then and I am still taking the pain killers.


 X work as     a salesman     in Laskeys,        Dale Street.         I have been
 unable to return to work since the incident.                   I think I'm going
 to hand ray notice in as I c a n ’t envisage feeling up to going

 back in     the forseeable       future.      I am on sleeping         tablets   to

 enable me to sleep.
As I got down onto the pitch there were 3 lads who were sitting
there   saying    that    there   father   had   died.    There   were   dead
bodies all around me.        I c a n ’t get it out of my mind.-


I have n o w retrieved my jacket but it is ripped.            It cost £170
and was only about 4 months old.           Also my training shoes which
cost £40 and were only a fortnight old were ripped.



In my view, had      the police opened the gate,          lives would have
been saved.      The gate onto the pitch that was near where I was

standing   had   people    crushed   against     it but   the police would
still not open it, had they opened it earlier, lives would have
been saved,



I should add that my ticket was for the part of the paddock                l"

think was called Westgate, but I c o u l d n ’t get near the Westxate

lujtiiMtLie and just got pushed through the gate with the ciuwd.

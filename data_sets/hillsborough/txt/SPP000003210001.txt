                 FILE NOTE

                 TUESDAY,5 MARCH 1991

                 RE:

                 I showed Mr Manning the paragraph on the 3rd page of Mr I
                 statement of 25.2.91 re f e r r i n g to Supt. Murray ( f i r s t seven l i n e s ) .
                 Mr Manning said t h a t his c l i e n t would emphatically deny t h a t .
                 He also in d ic a te d t h a t he and everyone e l s e , including Mr Isaacs,
                 was aware of Mr                       1 and he would not th e re fo re put too
                 much credance on any statement anyway.             I said I was in te re s te d
                 in a s c e rta in in g whether Mr Murray would agree with what was said
                 and he had answered t h a t p o in t.

LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

VISITS




Since publishing his interim report Lord Taylor has attended 3
football matches:

                   Chelsea v Arsenal
                   Millwall v Sheffield Wednesday
                   Rangers v Dundee Utd

Where possible he has attended the police briefing for these
games and toured the grounds with the Police Commander. He has
also viewed the matches from the terraces leaving these at
half-time to sit with the Club's directors.
Lord Justice Taylor has also visited and toured Old Trafford and
Maine Road.

Away from football Lord Taylor has attended a Rugby League match
at Salford and, for half a day, the Ryder Cup Golf Tournament.

He has yet to     hold any meetings but will be seeing the Home
Office and ACPO   representatives in addition to DOE officials. He
has not yet       been abroad or spoken to overseas football
administrators.     There are plans for him to do so, in particular
he is hoping to   visit stadiums in Nimes, Utrecht, Rome and Milan.

In addition to overseas visits Lord Taylor intends to visit
'lots' of football and rugby matches over the next few months. No
details have yet been confirmed but attendance at the Wales v All
Blacks rugby match is thought likely.

                Nottingham             Forest.        I was       attached        to       serial        36,       in    charge         of     t h is

                and      th e    arrival       of    the    train     I saw a          considerable                 number           of L i v e r p o o l

                the      nearest        pu b w a s    that    was     open       . We       tried        to    deter          t he    f an s    and

                requested          they       returned       to H i l l s b o r o u g h ,        some      complied with                   this

      getting         noisier.               Numbers           of     fa ns    had    tried         to g a i n a c c e s s          to    two

      public      house®           near        to       our    location,           but     these were             boarded           up

      although         some        people           were       gaining        access          these        being      regulars.                Th e

      Landlords            were        turning           fans a w a y         from    their         premises.

      About      1400       hours           t he    special           train       arrived,          the     fans      who      alighted

      were    very         quiet        with        no       rowdiness         at a l l.          Some      were      searched            but as

      fa r a s    I recall              nothing              intimidating            or    unlawful           was     found         on

      anybody.             I certainly                  did    not     discover           anything          untoward           on    the

      people      I searched.                      The       fans w ere        asked       to     form      up on a           piece       of

      waste      ground           near       to     a    public        house       (the       name     of w h i c h        I cannot

      recall).             There        was        a short          delay whilst              all     the     fans       were       gathered

      together,            th e    delay was                 minimal        and    the n ,      together          with        some M o u n t e d

      officers         they were               escorted             to H i l l s b o r o u g h .       These        fans w ere            very

      orderl y and were                     not     in the          le a st    troublesome.                 On arrival              at    the

      g r o u n d at a b o u t          1420        hours,          th e    fans     arrived          at    the     ground and

      entered         orderly.               There           being     no m o r e     special          trains         we      r e m a i n e d at

      this    location,                this        being       Leppings           Lane.

      Leppings         Lane        at       this        time was           very    busy with           fans.          I recall            a

      senior      officer              (I    d o n ’t k n o w w h o )          requesting             th at    du e      to    pedestrian

      traffic         that        Leppings              Lane     be    closed        to    traffic,           to a v o i d       any

      accident.             The        mood        of    the     fans at          this     time was           that       they were             very

      noisy,      a    lot w e r e           drinking            from       beer     c an s     and a       lot     of     them were

      asking      other           fans       if     they       had a ny        ’s p a r e s * .       I took        this       to m e a n

      spare      tickets.               There           was    a lot        of m i l l i n g      about       by a g r e a t         number           of

      fans    n ea r       to     the       gates.

about       10 y e a r s ,       th e      man     i n f o r m e d me      that       he     had       been       queueing             to   gain           [

entry       to    t he    ground with               his     son,      he     had      hold        of    his       s o n ’s h a n d a n d

had    jostled           his son a n d             in a     reflex         action          turned        to       protect          h i m as

he    did    so    someone            else       had     stolen       the      tickets            from       his       ha n d .        He    did

not    know who           they were,               his    son was          obviously              upset.           He       realised

there was          nothing            I could          do a b o u t      it,    he w a s          not    bitter             about       the

incident          merely         disappointed               at     the     behaviour              of    the       so     called         fans.

As    time       progressed             Leppings          Lane      was      getting more                and more               congested

kick-off          time     approached               the     crush        seemed         to    be       getting          worse,          I can

on a Po li c e           Landrover            making        an appeal           to      the       fans       to    stop         pushing

and    to    form        orderly           queues,        these       requests             were        being        ignored.                The

Mounted          Section were                then      requested           to m o v e        nearer          to    the        turnstiles

in a n a t t e m p t        to       restore        some      semblance            of      order        to    t he       crowd.

Together          with      other          officers         I was        required            to    try a nd            j o i n the

Mounted          Section         to a s s i s t        them.        I was       aware         that       a    lot        of     th e    f an s

had    been       drinking            and     the      mood was          getting           decidedly              u g l y as       kick-off

time    approached.                   I cannot           recall       seeing          any     stewards.                 Although             I had

my    radio       switched            on     I could        not     hear       a great            deal       of w h a t         was     being

said    du e      to     th e    noise        of    the     crowd who           were         getting          noisier             and

noisier.           I can         recall          seeing      a number           of      f a ns     climbing              up a w a ll             and

gaining          access         to    the     ground        over      th e     turnstiles.

As    1500       hours      c am e      I could          h e ar    a shout         from       inside          the        ground,

obviously          as     th e       game     started,            this     caused          the     fans       outside             the

ground       to    redouble             their       efforts         at     gaining           access          to    the        ground,            the

mood    of       the     fans        was     turning        decidedly           ugl y .           A short          time         later        a

was     a young            lad       that          had        been          brought          out.             PC S c h o l e y          then went                  b ac k

parts        of    the         ground.               I could                see    a    number            of     people             lying         in the

also     assisted                  us.        We     took          a     number         of    th e        bodies             to     the      gate       in the

fence        and        passed           them        through                to    other       officers/                      I do       not       know       how

                  appeared        to   have      got m o s t       people         out.        At       this      time       I was       with a

                  of    the    fans    there        Was     getting       extremely               ugly and           they were             (in m y

                  opinion)        about     to      turn     on    us.      We     moved          onto        the    pit c h.

                  Once, on      the    pitch        I assisted with                first          aid     to     some       people.          I     placed

                  my anorak        over     one       d e a d m an .      I assisted               another           officer          (I do        not

     E N D OF   REPORT
                     p-f




PETER LEE ROSE   POLICE CONSTABLE 13   C1 Sub-division, E Group, Main Street Police Station


At 0850 hours Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Main Street Police Station, to
commence duties at Hillsborough regarding the Semi-Final football match between Liverpool
and Nottingham Forest. I was attached to serial 36, in charge of this serial was
Police Sergeant 1829 France* 1 I travelled to Hillsborough in a Transit with other
officers from C1.

Our duties were to be at Wadsley Bridge Station and to escort Liverpool fans arriving at
that station to Hillsborough. We took up our post at about 1115 hours. The train was
not due until 1*t00 hours or there abouts. During the time between our arrival at the
station and the arrival of the train I saw a considerable number of Liverpool fans walking
up the road (away from Hillsborough) some asked us where the nearest pub that was open
was. We tried to deter the fans and requested they returned to Hillsborough, some
complied with this request others continued up the road* Also large numbers of fans were
walking down the road with packs of beer and drinking from the beer cans, some were
noisy and in high spirits.

About 13^5 hours I was with PC 3183 Trcek near to the station when I heard an assistance
call coming from a large Gateway Supermarket further up the road. We did not attend
this call as we were too far away and shortly afterwards the assistance was cancelled.
I could see large groups of fans sat on the banking outside the Supermarket. All the
time the number of fans ias increasing and some were drinking and getting noisier.
Numbers of fans had tried to gain access to two public houses near to our location, but
these were boarded up although some people were gaining access these being regulars.
The landlords \ere turning fans away from their premises.

About 1*f00 hours the special train arrived, the fans who alighted were very quiet with
no rowdiness at all. Some were searched but as far as I recall nothing intimidating or
unlawful was found on anybody. I certainly did not discover anything untoward on the
people I searched. The fans were asked to form up on a piece of waste ground near to
a public house (the name of which I cannot recall)• There was a short delay whilst all
the fans were gathered together, the delay was minimal and then, together with some
mpunted officers, they were escorted to Hillsborogh. These fans \ere very orderly and
were not in the least troublesome. On arrival at the ground at about 1^20 hours, the
fans arrived at the ground and entered orderly* There being no more special trains
we remained at this location, this being Leppings Lane.

Leppings Lane at this time was very busy with fans. I recall a senior officer (I don't
know who)xa: requesting that due to pedestrain traffic that Leppings Lane be closed to
traffic, to avoid any accident. The mood of the fans at this time was that they were
very noisy, a lot were drinking from beer cans and a lot of them were asking other fans
if they had any 'spares*. I took this to meanspare tickets. There k h k x was a lot of
milling 4)out by a great number of fans near to the gates.

I recall one man approaching me with his son who would have been aged sbout 10 years, the
man informed me that he had been queing to gain entry to the ground with his son, he had
hold of his sons hand and in his other he stated he had his tickets. He told me that
someone had jostled his son and in a reflex action turned to protect him as he did so
someone else had stolen the tickets from his hand. He did not know who they were, his
son was obviously upset. He realised there was nothing I could do about it, he was not
bitter about the incident merely dissapointed at the behaviour of the so called fans.

As time progressed Leppings Lane was getting more and more congested with fans, I noticed
that only PSV’s were being allowed down Leppings Lane, these making only slow progress
due to the amount of fans. As kick off time approached the crush seemed to be getting
worse, I can recall a Senior Officer, Inspector Ellis I think, using a loudspeaker on
a police Land-Rover making an appeal to the fans to stop pushing and to form orderly
queues, these requests were being ignored. The mounted section were then requested to
move nearer to the turnstiles in an attempt to restore some semblance of order to the
                                                                               %2RZ
crowd# Together with other officers I was required to try and join the mounted section
to assist them. I was aware that a lot of the fans had been drinking and the mood was
getting decidely ugly as kick off time approached. I cannot recall seeing any stewards,
although I had my radio switched on I could not hear a great deal of what was being said
due to the noise of the crowd who were getting noisier and noisier# I can recall seeing
a number of fans climbing up a wall and gaining access to the ground over the turnstiles#

As 1500 hours came I could hear a shout from inside the ground, obviously as the game
started, this caused the fans outside the ground to redouble their efforts at gaining
access to the ground, the mood of the fans was turning decidely ugly# A short time later
a further shout went up in the ground which was obviously too much for the fans outside to
bear and a further surge was made. I do not recall seeing any gates being opened, I to
not hear any order given to open the gates because the noise where I was made it almost
impossible to hear the radio*

A short time later Isaw a number of my colleagues running towards the ground, I ran too
I then heard a voice on my radio say 'every availabel officer to the ground immediately*
On gaining access to the ground I saw a lot of people on the playing area and what appeared
to be panic at the Leppings Lane end* I gBdc made my way to the perimeter fence, by a
gate to the right of the goal post looking towards the Kop end* I assisted some people
out of this gate* I then saw PC Scholey of F Division carry somebody to the fence. I
assisted getting this person out and onto the pitch* As I recall it was a young lad that
had been brought out* PC Scholey then went back into the crowd, I followed him up to the
fence that seperated the two parts of the ground* I could see a number of people lying
in the bottom by the fence with other people treading all over them. Some of the people
lying there were obviously dead or dying. PC Scholey and myself then assisted a number of
people over the fence, some of the fans passing them over to us, some fans on our side of
the fence also assisted us* We took a number of the bodies to the gate in the fence and
passed them through to other officers* I do not know how many people I got over the fence,
I know that some were already dead and that some were injured. I also recall that on
some of my trips back to the fence I was kicked or punched by some fans who were directing
their anger at us. I recall people shouting X "Its your fault you black bastards . To be
fair there a number of people assisting us as well. I also recall telling people to leave
some people who were obviously dead and to pick up and help others who were obviously
alive but injured. These ihcluded children and young women* Not a decision I would ever
 like to have to make again, because obviously I am not qualified to make such a decision
 from a distance of over 10 feet away. After what seemed like eternity we appeared to have
got most people out* At this time I was with a Police Sergeant (I do not know who he is)
 we were the only two officers in this part of the ground as far as I could tell. The mood
 of the fans there was getting extremely ugly and they were (in my opinion) about to turn
 on us. We moved onto the pitch*

Once on the pitch I assisted with first aid to some people* I placed my anorak over one
dead man* I assisted another officer (I do not know who) render the kiss of life to a
man I can only describe as being overweight and aged about 50 . I recall he was placed in
a St Johns Ambulance* Eventually, at the request of Chief Superintendent Nesbit I assisted
in coaxing uninjured fans off the pitch. I recall two fans getting extremely upset at
one of our plain clothes video men as he was filming the West Stand area. They thought
he was the press* Eventually they were led off the pitch.

 I then rejoined the remnants of my serial in the North Stand supplying coffee/tea etc
 to colleagues in a state of shock. Eventually we were stood down returning to MSPS
 at 1900 hours.

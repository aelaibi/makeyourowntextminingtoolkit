                     MEETING WITH FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES



           The Home Secretary has seen your submission of 2 May and has
       agreed that an official and not a Minister should attend the
       Secretary of State for the Environment's meeting with the
       Football Authorities to discuss the Government's ideas about all
       seated accommodation at major football clubs. He has commented
       that he is not in favour of Government contributing to the cost.

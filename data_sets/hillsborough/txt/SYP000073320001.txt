            We tra v e l l e d up by train,                changing at New St,          Birmingham,         a r r iving    in

            S h e f f i e l d at   11.00 am            (1100).     I do not    recall    any other Liverpool

            fans     being on the train y l t h u s .

            On our arrival           in S h e j p i e l d our first          priority was to purchase a

            ticket       for the gamerf^ \4«^initially a s k e d about                    on the     railway station

            but got nowhere.             W ie then caught a taxi to the S p i o n Ho p end of

            H i l l sborough.        We then w a l k e d ar o u n d to the Leppings Ln end,                      en route
                                                                                                              PAGE            2
                                                                                                              S1757

       a sking    people    if they had a ticket to sell.                     There were a few people

       a bout at this       stage but y o u           c o u l d n *t e^feally call    it b u s y .

       At about        12 mi d d a y we saw a map selling              tickets       standing        in the
.•4s
       t u rnstile are a Leppi n g s Ln                                    iously a tout.              I purchased

       a £ 6.00 ticket for t h e L^p                                       , paying £25 . 0 0 for             it.        My

       mate     did the same.

       We then went and pur c h a s e d some                chips and tried a pub but                 it was       shut.

       We then just hung a r o u n d           finally a r r iving       back at the L e p pings Ln

       tu r nstile area a b o u t ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ J 4 ^ ^r-~~6y now             it was      quite    busy and           I was

       surpr ised because             it was    soearly bef o r e tbejaroe.              *

       I had been to the              same game       the year b e / o r eT"and then there seemed                   to

       be more     police about and the                crowd was more       orderly.          However,        I

       j o i n e d the   crowd and e v e n t u a l l y gained access           via the turnstiles,

       handing my ticket              in as    per    the usual     procedure at about 2.1 0 pm

       (1410).         I cannot       really say       it was too u n c o m f o r t a b l e whilst waiting

       to get     in and I did not exper i e n c e too m u c h diff i c u l t y gaining

       entrance.

       I then went        straight t o/my m atch viewing                point.        I knew exac t l y where

       to go becausJf, kike A. $ay,                  I have been to the ground before.                      I wa l k e d

       a long    the              y ^ d in q   to Pens 3 and 4.            The tunnel was             fairly ful 1

       at this     timt/but       I had a reasonable access                along      it.     Whe n    I emerged

       from the tunnel         I saw that both the               pens were quite            crowded and           I had

       to push my way thro u g h the                 crowd to my first m a t c h viewing               position as

       i n dicated by a number            1 on thj^ g ry ^ /\T \ m j ^ u j ^ p Q rters questionnaire.

              build up steadily and              I found myself          slowly moving          forward without

              choice.       It was      diffi cult to g e t , ^         breath and       it was ext r e m e l y h o t .

              I a c t u a l l y took my    coat off        Lrf the     crowd because       it was so hot and             in

              fact    I lost     it,    it fell       f nom ar o u n d my shoulders and I could not bend

              The    pressure of the           crowd e v e n t ^ d a ^ y ®Srced me to position 2 as

              indicated on the grid              in my supporters          questionnaire,         this   position

              being    centre of Pen 4 about              one yard from the             perimeter     fence.        By now

              it was about 2.50           pm    (1450)    and    I was w e d g e d so tight my feet were                 not

              touching      the ground.          I could hardly breath and                I was ext r e m e l y

              frightened.         I saw that          people ar o u n d me were         falling to the ground.

              As this was        happening        it created a small        gap        in the   crowd and      I    saw at

              l_east three       people     lying on the ground m o t i o n l e s s          in the   corner        of

              third person I cannot              really describe.

              I was    in so much discomfort at this stage                       I cannot       recall what the

              time was or even             if the game ha4 started.              I was shouting at everybody

              to stop p u s h i n g .       I then saw/two f a n ^ p u l M n g         at the mesh on t h e

              away.

              Prior    to this     I can remember             people    trying    to    climb out over the

              perimeter fence and              I can remember two          perhaps       three being      pushed back

              into    the   crowd by the         police.        I can under s t a n d them doing this

                  initially but there              did     come a point whefn it wa s ^ o b v i o u s                  that .

                  som e t h i n g    serious was       happening and «ypa/t f rjgxt\ / ,h e                  two    policemen t h a t

                  As    soon as the mesh was               pulled away            I b egan to help the                injured and

                  uncons c i o u s     through with the a s s i s t a n c e               of police        pitchside.          I by now

                  had m o v e d further         to my      left away from the goal                      to the outer edge of

                  the Pen therefore             I was     not w i t h i n       reach of the three                 people     I have

                  p reviously mentioned.

                  A fter about         three    or four minujjf^s/f afyself wen t                       through the hole            in

                  the fence         onto the     pi t c l ^ A y ^ t ^ h ' j ^ p o i i p ^ i i    seem to remember           that the

                  around      in a daze.         I did not           really know what                I was   doing.

                  After about          half an hour           of this       I started to look for my friend,

                                    I could not see him so I went                         to     look   in the medical          room

                  where     everyone was         being        taken on stretchers.                      I couldn't see him

                  there     so I a sked a Police S e r g e a n t who was o b v i o u s l y                     compiling a list

                  of the      people who had been taken to hospital                                if                 was   one of

                  them.      He      checked and told me he w a s n ’t.                         Nevertheless       he took my

                  details      should                    be    located.           I was         in the medical         room some

                  considerable          time.     I cannot           really be specific as to the time                          because

                  like    I say I was          in a daze.            All    I know        is that        I carried on looking

                  for                  in the ground           complex up until about 5 pm (ITtJO) w h e n                           I

                  left.       I went straight            to the       railway s t a t i o n and th^m k f u l l y met                up

                  with                  there.      We both then caught tfcje t r a ^ f back home.

                  I received slight             bruising        to my       ribs as 4            r v & J ilY of the    crush.

                  However,          I have not     received any medical/ t/real<fient for these                               injuries

                     At 9.45 a.m. on Saturday,             15th April,           1989,         I commenced duty at the

                     Sheffield Wednesday Football club with regard to the semi-final
                                                                                                                                         ,   V

                     between Liverpool and Notts Forest.

                     My    immediate supervisory officer was Police Sergeant Chapman and at

                     approximately 11 a.m. we took up our                        position at the bottom of the

                     players tunnel on the perimeter track.

                     At 1 p.m.   together with Police Sergeant Chapman we went to the rear

                     of the North Stand where we were provided with a hot meal, which we

                     consumed and then returned to our original position on the tunnel.

                     At    about 2.30 p.m. as the centre pen began tofill,                                        I saw a number.,

                     of    Liverpool supporters doing what I can only describe as storming *

                     from the top of       the centre pen to the bottom,                                         causing a. large numl

                     of people to be       p u s h e d    forward towards the security fencinq at the

                     front.                                            '

jacket type shirt.       My attention was then directed on the Forest

supporters.

At 2.41 p.m.    I noticed that the area allocated to the Forest

supporters appeared to be reaching capacity level and again on lookinc

towards the North Stand and Leppings Lane area,                 I said to Police

Sergeant Chapman,     "Where are all the Liverpool supporters."                        As there

appeared to be ample room in both areas apart from the .centre pen,,whit

looked reasonably full.                            '                                         . -''V

Nothing untowards happened until after -the .match kicked off when

after a few minutes the crowd appeared to surge forward and there was

what appeared to be a n     overspill onto the track at the back of the

goal at the Leppings Lane end.                                                                    >f

There was nothing else to suggest that there was anything other than

an overspill onto the track.

I then saw Superintendent Greenwood run onto the pitch and speak to

the referee,     it was then that I realised that this incident was

something more serious.

The players came off the pitch and the referee and linesmen stayed

with Police Sergeant Chapman and myself at the bottom of the tunnel.

It then seemed that all hell had let loose as supporters were all ; J

over the pitch.      Throughout the rest of the afternoon,              I remained at

the bottom of the tunnel preventing a large number of supporters whp

appeared,     not all,   to be the worse for drink,            entering the tunnel to

either get at the F .A. officials or to use the c l u b ’s telephones. '

At 5.15 p.m.when the ground had cleared,               I was                        to r e p o r t s

 to the North Stand for a d e -b r ieeff ;•

At no time was I involved in the handling of any bodies. • ' 1 was ?sj:‘oo<3

 down at 6.30 p.m. the same day.               ’                                *      *   5 ^

 OBSERVATIONS

 At the time I spoke to Sergea


                                              ‘r ’ *                “   -   ^
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              R228

        Liverpool supporters in the North Stand and Leppings Lane terraces,          I

        noticed that there was ample room either side of the centre pen.

        Mr Douglas Lock,   the Sheffield Wednesday Football club Security

        Officer, did comment at that time words to the effect that there was

        hell on outside the ground at the Leppings Lane end.                         S

        When Spurs and Wolves played in the semi-final about eight years ago,

        I was on duty on the track at the Leppings Lane end.       I am told, due

        to the sale of forged tickets a similar incident happened in the same

        pen and terraces which resulted in the gates having to be opened t o .•

        enable the overspill onto the t r a c k .

        In conclusion I would like to say that I have worked every semi-final

        at Hillsborough for the last 23 years,      but my duties have been

        usually at the Leppings Lane end.

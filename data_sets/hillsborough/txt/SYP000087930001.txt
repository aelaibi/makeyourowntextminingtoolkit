               youths who were            congregating           in the shop and a l l e g e d l y            taking       packs       of

               canned beer from the disp l a y and                      leaving without              paying for       them,

               e v e n t u a l l y the staff      decided to close the shop due to the                              lack    of

               staff and volume of             prospective           customers and stock                  being     taken,       ihe

               are a of the Off Licence was                     cleared but several                 of the youths          had

               ob viously       been drinking and they were advi s e d to quieten down,                                     no

               undue    concern was evident at this time as this                                is normal          in my

               experience,         when a large        football            match     is to take          place.



               At 2 . 5 0 p m    (1450)    customers were            leaving the           public house            nearby       in

               large    numbers and all were                in good spirits and they made                          their way

               towards H il ls bo ro ug h with PS K E E NA N and the                       rest      of the officers

               escorting        them down,        at 3 pm       (1500)      we     reached the junction              of

               C l a y w h g e 1s Ln and we halted              there      for a few minutes              in order        to a llow

               all    of the otheT'~v'Qfficers             to join us,             the supporters           continued on

            Police     for what    had h a p p e ne d   inside   the ground.    Throu g h o u t    the    next

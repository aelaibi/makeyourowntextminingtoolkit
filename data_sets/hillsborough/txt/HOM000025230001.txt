Dear Mr Walker

Thank you for your letter of 24 October with enclosures to Lord
Justice Taylor about the possibilities for research into the
technical requirements of sound systems for use at sports
grounds.  I am sorry that you have not received an earlier reply.

As you may be aware, a technical working group has been
established by Lord Justice Taylor to examine a wide range of
issues associated with ground safety, and your proposals have
been forwarded to its members for consideration.   It is too early
to say whether they will recommend research along the lines you
indicate, but we shall certaifily bear your suggestions in mind.

                                           Your sincerely

      Thank you for your letter of 15 September to the
      Home Secretary with one from Mr K Walker MBE, Chief Executive
      of the Sound and Communications Industries Federation about
      noise levels at sports grounds which a working group of the
      Federation proposes to investigate.

      In his letter of 27 June to Mr Walker John Patten explained
      that we felt that it would not then be right to set up a
...   Home Office study group.  I enclose a copy of his letter for
      information.

      Following its Interim Report, the Hillsborough Inquiry is now
      looking into the general questions of safety at sports
      grounds.  It is for the Inquiry to decide if it wishes to
      commission research.

      We shall consider carefully the recommendations contained in
      the Final Report including any recommendations on research.

      I think that we should wait and see what the Inquiry
      recommends before we decide how to proceed.

then be operated by competent personnel to give the right messages
at the right times to control the situation and encourage public

Unfortunately, there are a number of confIicting                  requirements.
First, overspecification of the m a x i m u m sound level output

delay the provision of such systems on a nationwide basis. Second,
overspecification could lead to u n n e c e s s a r y p u b l i c n ui s a n c e
outside the confines of      the sports ground           under non-emergency
circumstances, without considerable care in the s e l ec t i o n and
siting of loudspeakers, and the specification of ambient noise
sensing and signal processing for the control of output level.
Third, the relaying of emergency m e s s a g e s at too high a sound

The guidelines for the design and specification of sound systems
must include some means of being able to determine the sound level
output and coverage requirements of the system, and should also
provide guidance for the selection and zoning of a p p r o p ri ate
messages to deal with as many as p o s s i b l e of the potential
emergency situations that might arise. Since the pr ov i s i o n of
effective systems could be    a matter of life or death at some
future emergency, it is considered v i ta lly important that the
guidelines should be based on the results of a carefully planned
programme of field research and experimentation, rather than being
based solely on theoretical considerations, as would have to be
applied if the research was not carried out.

Research objectives

The objectives of being able to specify the technical requirements
of the sound system, and to specify appropriate messages can be
c l e a r l y s e p a r a t e d in terms of the n e c e s s a r y time scales.
Theoretical estimates of the technical requirements of the system
could be investigated by a limited study of crowd noise levels at
a representative selection of sports grounds and similar places in
the United Kingdom. This work could lead to an e m p i r i c a l l y
verified crowd noise prediction method within a relatively short
period, provided that the project was r e so ur ced to allow for
measurements at a number of sites simultaneously at each venue.
The parameters which would need to studied would include crowd
d e n s i t y and level of e x c i t e m e n t , the e f f e c t s of d i f f e r e n t
structures (such as grandstand roofs) and seating arrangements,
and the typical variability of noise levels from one meeting to
the next in different public areas. This prediction method would
allow precise specification of system technical requirements to
avoid dangerous underprovision or costly overprovision. A number
of final checks should be made by operating existing or temporary
systems in accordance with a provisional specification to ensure
that system intelligibility re q u i r e m e n t s (as ev al u a t e d both
subjectively and objectively) can be met within the guidelines as
proposed at that time. There is little doubt that such a programme
could be carried out successfully within a few months, depending
only on the level of resourcing to allow work to be carried out
either serially, or in parallel.

The objective of being able to specify appropriate messages can
only be met by a much longer term r e s ea rch project. Effecti ve
coverage must be the first priority, since there is little point
in being able to select from a range of specific messages to suit
different situations if only a proportion of them will be heard.
There are also a number of research difficulties, as the objective
is to investigate the effects of different types of message on
large numbers of the public under emergency situations. It will
clearly be necessary to devise some form of c o m p l e t e l y non-
hazardous yet convincing emergency s im ul at io n using c ar efu ll y
selected and instructed volunteers for any experiments, and to
overcome any doubts as to the validity of such data to real-life
emergencies. There is little prospect of significant progress in
this area within any short timescale. The best way to proceed
would be to conduct a comprehensive literature review in the first
instance, leading to a prioritised list of recommendations as to
possible experimental techniques to overcome these problems.      The
review should take account of all available reports and evidence
relating to human behaviour under emergency situations and the
extent to which it can be modified by the provision of different
types of message, bearing in mind the effects of training and
prior experience and the extent to which these factors influence
the comprehensibility of particular messages.
RecommendatIons

A purely theoretical assessment of the technical requirements for
effective sound systems for safety at sports grounds could lead to
dangerous underspecification,    or e xp e n s i v e and po t e n t i a l l y
objectionable overspecification of system hardware. We strongly
recommend that a short term study to deve lo p an e mp ir ic al ly
validated method of predicting crowd noise levels be put in hand
as a matter of Immediate priority, on the lines outlined above.
The results of this study will allow the output level and coverage
requirements to be precisely determined for all likely situations.
The working group can provide detailed proposals and costings for
such a study on request.

The matter of the selection of appropriate messages, and therefore
the specification of how such systems should optimally be used
must be left to the o p e r a t o r ' s d i s c r e t i o n on the b a s i s of
experience for the time being as there is little justification for
delaying the publication of new guidelines while the necessary
long-term research is carried out. Nevertheless, we recommend that
a comprehensive literature review be carried out as a first step,
with the objective of identifying ex perimental techniques for
future application that may overcome the difficulties referred to
above. Any new knowledge gained as a result of that research would
then be incorporated into updated v er si on s of the gu idelines
whenever possible.

Depending on the availability of resources, the crowd noise level
prediction study should take first priority, with the literature
r e v i e w on m e s s a g e s e l e c t i o n and e f f e c t i v e n e s s as a s e c o n d
priority, purely because any work resulting from recommendations
made on the basis of the literature review would be likely to
require a timescale measured In years rather than months.

            Your Lordship,

            In our previous communications to you; 25 April and 5 September 1989, we
            expressed concern that the "Guide to S a fe ty a t S p o rts G rounds" was inadequate
            and the hope that the sound and communications industries would be invited to
            assist in the preparation of technical specifications.

            Having established a Working Group for Safety at Sports Grounds (Sound
            Systems), your Lordship's attention was requested to the need to research the
            "high level of noise" referred to in the Interim Report. Similar observations
            were made at that time to both the Home Secretary and the Minister for Sport.

            The Working Group now submit it's outline of the desired research for your
            Lordship's consideration since in a reply given by Lord Ferrers it is indicated
            that the Home Office awaits your recommendations before initiating any of the
            necessary research.

            The Working Group continues preparation of it's suggestions for a re-wording
            of Section 12. Communications, in the "Guide to S a fe ty a t S p o rts G rounds" in
            anticipation that your Lordship may consider as a possible recommendation.
            Within this wording reference will be made to a proposed "Guide to Sound
            Systems for Safety at Sports Grounds" which the Working Group are also
            actively preparing.

            The activities, findings and suggestions of the Working Group are being made
            available for wider observation and comment, from within the sound and
            communications industries. A particular opportunity has been created for a
            presentation to be given, at a 'prime time',   to the Fifth Annual Residential
            Conference of the Institute of Acoustics being held at Windermere from 2-5
            November attended by all the principal Consultants and Consulting Engineers,
            having responsibility for sports stadia in the UK. Any message which your
            Lordship might consider appropriate and wish to convey to the industry, at this
            time would be most welcomed.

            Yours sincerely,

     Outline of research required to inform a new "Guide to the design
     and specification of sound systems for safety at sports grounds
     (and other places of public assembly)"


     I n t r o d u c t ion

4P   The only practicable method of communicating with any large mass
     of people in an emergency situation is via an e f f ec ti ve sound
     s y st em . In o r d e r to be e f f e c t i v e ,          the s o u n d s y s t e m must
     p r o v i d e c o m p r e h e n s i v e c o v e r a g e of all p u b l i c areas, w i t h
     negligible distortion, and at high enough sound levels to overcome
     any competing background noises, either due to the crowd, or
     arising elsewhere. Given these basic requirements, the system must
     then be operated by competent personnel to give the right messages
     at the right times to control the situation and encourage public
     egress        without         panic      or      creating    further      emergencies.
     Unfortunately, there are a number of conflicting requirements.
     First, overspecification of the m a x i m u m sound level output
     capability can dramatically increase the cost, and will therefore
     delay the provision of such systems on a nationwide basis. Second,
     overspecification could lead to u n n e c e s s a r y publ ic nuisance
     outside the confines of the sports ground                         under non-emergency
     circumstances, without considerable care in the s election and
     siting of loudspeakers, and the specification of ambient noise
     sensing and signal processing for the control of output level.
     Third, the relaying of emergency me s s a g e s at too high a sound
     level could be counterproductive in controlling panic situations.
     Underspecification will, of course, result in an ineffective
     system.

     T h e r e is a l s o the p r o b l e m of the s e l e c t i o n of a p p r o p r i a t e
     messages. In many cases different messages may be appropriate for
     different zones of the public areas. There is a case here for
     digitally pre-recorded messages, with alternative high quality
     microphone inputs to the system to deal wi th the unexpected.
     There are a number of problems associated with special non-speech
     warning sounds and sequences.            Such signals can be misinterpreted,
     or have unexpected effects, unless the public have been trained in
     their use in advance. Standardisation and pre-event demonstration
     could be of considerable benefit in this respect. Warning tones
     have been used to alert staff without alerting the public, who are
     l i k e l y to i n t e r p r e t th em as a fault r a t h e r than b e i n g of

     ensure that messages can be heard correctly by the majority of the

The guidelines for the design and specification of sound systems
must include some means of being able to determine the sound level
output and coverage requirements of the system, and should also
provide guidance for the selection and zoning of a p p r o p r i a t e
messages to deal with as many as p o s s i b l e of the potential
emergency situations that might arise. Since the p r o v i s i o n of
effective systems could be    a matter of life or death at some
future emergency, it is considered v i t a l l y important that the
guidelines should be based on the results of a carefully planned
programme of field research and experimentation, rather than being
based solely on theoretical considerations, as would have to be
applied if the research was not carried out.

Research objectives

The objectives of being able to specify the technical requirements
of the sound system, and to specify appropriate messages can be
c l e a r l y s e p a r a t e d in te r m s of the n e c e s s a r y time scales.
Theoretical estimates of the technical requirements of the system
could be investigated by a limited study of crowd noise levels at
a representative selection of sports grounds and similar places in
the United Kingdom. This work could lead to an e m p i r i c a l l y
verified crowd noise prediction method within a relatively short
period, provided that the project was re so u r c e d to a ll o w for
measurements at a number of sites simultaneously at each venue.
The parameters which would need to studied would include crowd
d e n s i t y a n d level of e x c i t e m e n t , the e f f e c t s of d i f f e r e n t
structures (such as grandstand roofs) and seating arrangements,
and the typical variability of noise levels from one meeting to
the next in different public areas. This prediction method would
allow precise specification of system technical requirements to
avoid dangerous underprovision or costly overprovision. A number
of final checks should be made by operating existing or temporary
systems in accordance with a provisional specification to ensure
that system intelligibility req u i r e m e n t s (as evalua ted both
subjectively and objectively) can be met within the guidelines as
proposed at that time. There is little doubt that such a programme
could be carried out successfully within a few months, depending
only on the level of resourcing to allow work to be carried out
either serially, or in parallel.

The objective of being able to specify appropriate messages can
only be met by a much longer term r e s ear ch project. Effective
coverage must be the first priority, since there is little point
in being able to select from a range of specific messages to suit
different situations if only a proportion of them will be heard.
There are also a number of research difficulties, as the objective
is to investigate the effects of different types of message on
large numbers of the public under emergency situations. It will
clearly be necessary to devise some form of c o m p l e t e l y non-
hazardous yet convincing emergency s im ul a t i o n using c a ref ul ly
selected and instructed volunteers for any experiments, and to
overcome any doubts as to the validity of such data to real-life
emergencies. There is little prospect of significant progress in
this area within any short timescale. The best way to proce ed
would be to conduct a comprehensive literature review in the first
instance, leading to a prioritised list of recommendations as to
possible experimental techniques to overcome these problems.        The
review should take account of all available reports and evidence
relating to human behaviour under emergency situations and the
extent to which it can be modified by the provision of different
types of message, bearing in mind the effects of training and
prior experience and the extent to which these factors influence
the comprehensibility of particular messages.
Recommendat ions

A purely theoretical assessment of the technical requirements for
effective sound systems for safety at sports grounds could lead to
dangerous underspecification,    or ex pe n s i v e and p o t e n t i a l l y
objectionable overspecification of system hardware. We strongly
recommend that a short term study to d e ve lo p an e mp iri ca ll y
validated method of predicting crowd noise levels be put in hand
as a matter of immediate priority, on the lines outlined above.
The results of this study will allow the output level and coverage
requirements to be precisely determined for all likely situations.
The working group can provide detailed proposals and costings for
such a study on request.

The matter of the selection of appropriate messages, and therefore
the specification of how such systems should optimally be used
mu s t be left to the o p e r a t o r ' s d i s c r e t i o n on the b a s i s of
experience for the time being as there is little justification for
delaying the publication of new guidelines while the necessary
long-term research is carried out. Nevertheless, we recommend that
a comprehensive literature review be carried out as a first step,
with the objective of identifying e xperimental techniques for
future application that may overcome the difficulties referred to
above. Any new knowledge gained as a result of that research would
then be incorporated into updated v e r s i o n s of the guidelines
whenever possible.

Depending on the availability of resources, the crowd noise level
prediction study should take first priority, with the literature
r e v i e w on m e s s a g e s e l e c t i o n and e f f e c t i v e n e s s as a s e c o n d
priority, purely because any work resulting from recommendations
made on the basis of the literature review would be likely to
require a timescale measured in years rather than months.

Your Lordship,

In our letter to you of 25 April 1989 we expressed concern that the "Guide to
S a fe ty a t S p o rts G rounds" was inadequate and the hope that the sound and
communications industry be invited to assist in the preparation of technical
specifications.

The Federation has established a small Working Group in collaboration with a
representative from the Institute of Safety & Public Protection and an observer
on behalf of the Noise Council and the Institute of Acoustics.

The Recommendations on Communications within your Interim Report are noted and
the Working Group particularly welcome Recommendation 33 "....th a t th e re s h o u ld
be a p u b lic add re ss system                                          ".

Your L o rd s h ip has made a p o s it iv e and s p e c if ic , te c h n ic a l re q u ire m e n t th a t
"Im p o rta n t announcements s h o u ld be preceded by a lo u d s ig n a l to catch the
a tt e n tio n o f th e c ro u d d e s p ite a h ig h le v e l o f n o is e in th e g ro u n d ." The
Working Group, respectfully, suggest that the "high level of noise" is a factor
which is presently uncatalogued and needs to be investigated, researched and
recorded, as a matter of urgency so that appropriate equipment can be
determined. Such an investigation will however require funding. Is it within
the remit of the Inquiry or is your Lordship able to prevail upon the Home
Office to fund such a project ?

The Working Group for Safety in Sports Grounds (Sound Systems) is gathering
material towards definitive specifications or at least more positive guidelines.
It is also seeking information regarding the responsibility for the approval,
within the requirements of a Safety Certificate, of public address systems in
sports grounds as there appears a wide variation in the officers appointed by
Local Authorities.


Yours sincerely,




Ken Walker MBE.,
Chief Executive.

 Lord Justice Taylor,
 For the attention Mr Whalley,

 London,
 SWIH 9AT                                                                                                                                  25 April 1989.


Your Lordship,

Arising from the unfortunate occurrence at Hillsborough on 15 April and the
setting up of an inquiry under your jurisdiction.

It is noted that the terms of reference include the making of "recommendations
about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events".

In the light of, now, four major disasters in football stadia in UK the time has
come for positive, statutory, requirement rather than guidance, which when
examined is far far too vague.

Guidelines on measures for improving the safety of spectators at sports grounds
first became available on a more or less comprehensive scale with the Wheatley
Report in 1972. Following the fire at Bradford City FC in 1985                and the
subsequent Mr Justice Popplewell's Inquiry, working parties were established
which produced further recommendations that were incorporated into the most
recent edition, 1986, of the "Guide to S a fe ty a t S p o rts Grounds", published by
HMSO.

The Guide "provides voluntary guidance", "does not attempt to set a minimum
standard" because of thevariety of type, function and layout of sports grounds
and openly states."...the criterion to be aimed   for is that of a reasonable
degree of safety. It would be unreasonable, even if it were practical, to seek
absolute safety of everyone attending a ground." A damnable admission with the
ever rising toll in death and injury.

Over two years ago     the Federation appraised the situation following Bradford
and the Home Secretary's intervention into safety by decreeing that certain
grounds; all Football League, some lesser Leagues, some Rugby League, Rugby
Union and Cricket grounds, and Wimbledon became 'designated sports grounds' and
as such would require safety certificates to continue to be used. The immediate
observation was the utter vagueness and lack of positive direction or
requirement. The responsibility for certification is passed down from Government
to Local Authority each of which determines it's own particular requirements.
Subsequent responsibilities are passed still further away from any centralised
or standardised, requirement. The certification of public address systems being,
in most cases known, ultimately ending in the hands of a member of the local
Fire Service. Whilst it is appreciated that some Services have deputed very
knowledgeable Officers to this task, on an almost full-time basis, the doubt
occurs concerning the ability of a Fire Officer to decide the worthiness of a

    public address system, given that no standards are provided by which he may
    evaluate.

    The Guide states that automatic fire detection, fire warning, emergency
    lighting and public address systems should be tested twenty-four hours
    before an event in accordance with methods laid down in BS 5839: Part 1 and
    BS 5266: Part 1 respectively, and goes on to point out that there is
    currently no British Standard for public address systems. Whilst this is
    not strictly true; the scope of BS 6259 does claim to give guidance on the
    design, construction, use and maintenance of sound distribution systems for
    installation   in   buildings   and  outdoor   stadia,   regrettably   further
    statements on such installations is practically worthless and certainly
    has no bearing on circumstances to which attention is presently focused. BS
    6259 is presently being re-written, with strong Federation representation
    which will press       for more positive standards to be established        in
    anticipation of the    future requirements for safety in outdoor stadia.

    Communications are vital in any life support situation and systems
    available today are capable of giving clear pree.iso instructions under
    almost any adverse conditions. The Guide requires that there should be a
    "communications system capable of clearly relaying essential messages to
    all parts of the ground in both normal circumstances and in an emergency"
    and that "It should be capable of coping with all emergencies." Obviously
    "all emergencies" now requires to be far more explicitly determined and
    defined. It has been suggested that the sound emitted by the terrified and
    suffering crowd at the Lepping Road end of Hillsborough was appalling to
    such an extreme that any conventional public address system would have been
    incapable of surmounting. Without being present one cannot judge and it is
    doubtful in the circumstances anyone had a sound level meter, let alone
    switched it on. But sound is measureable; it will deflect a needle to a
    point on a scale which can be registered and noted as a reference. Sound is
    a science in which, from such references, calculations and predictions are
    made. It must therefore be possible to determine and specify, a particular
    point on the scale that the system must be capable of attaining and for
    future safety such a determination must become statutory.

    Hillsborough, as a     'designated sports ground', has the required safety
    certificate. Within the requirements of the Local Authority, who are
    responsible for certification, Hillsborough has a public address system
    which has obviously met their demands. If those demands were made within
    the vagaries of the Guide then let it not be said or even suggested, that
    the Hillsborough public address system was incapable but more to the point,
    it is the Guide that is inadequate.

    The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has to be revised. It must become
    morfe positive and may require suitable legislation to give it 'teeth'. The
    sound and communications industries have the ability to not only produce
    the equipment and provide systems to cope with extreme eventualities but
    also the expertise to assist those that may be required to re-define,
    statutory, new regulations.

    Yours sincerely,



    Ken Walker MBE. ,
    Chief Executive.

           A^bout q uarter                  to three      (1445)           I noti ce d a y eying man                climbing         over    into

               he N o r t h Stand,,              I told my mate                down at           l^te bottom and as             the young

           man d r o pp ed             into the N o r t h S tand two P o l i c e m e n                        caught   hold of him and

            took      him away.
             Just after         kick   off    there    was>4    surge     of     people             coming   into the N orth

             S t a n d where     I was,      and beoause       of the numbers we were unable                         to    check

             the     tickets and for o u r / o w n safety we stood                       to one s^ide moving away

             from the gangway.               A bout    the same time        I also              noticed that       in the West

             Stand     people were        bending      over    from the        seating area above and                     pulling

             people         up and other      people     trying    to   c 1 im ii/ -'   . ip    the   perimeter     fence.        My

             immediate         reaction was       that    they were       tj^ing               to   invade   the   pitch,    and.

             I saw the Police           form up to stop tl



             .1 then        realised that       it was more       serious        and went             to the   rear o f the

            ^starid t o he 1 p shomt pe o pI e the way out.



             Wit h    regards     to the      incident whe n the young man was                          ejected,     I am

             u nable        to describe      him or the P o l i c e m a n who            e sc o r t e d him from the

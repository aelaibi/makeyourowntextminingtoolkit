                 They were still             drinking.          When a patrolling              transit      van was     seen,

we    resumed w al k in g       back      up Halifax Ro<

It was       obvious     that a lot            of the >flcohol          had been bought            from the

super market          on the     p re ci nc t y* m d from an off               licence f urther          up

Halifax      Road.       This    shop wes always               full w ith fans.            It was apparent

by this       time    that a ll ot / of         supp or te rs       had had a lot of drink.                   There

were    very few o f f i c e ^           in the     precinct at this              time.

As we w a lk e d        back    up the         hill,    we noticed there was               one serial outside

a pub on the            m ain   road,       w h i ch was full         and overflowing.

We then wal k ed         back    up to our original                   points    to await        the   coaches and

further       fans.      The    coaches         started to arrive              shor tl y a ft er wa rd s and

the    fans were       checked           as they       left    the coaches.

By now the side            roads         off Hali fa x R oa d were          just about       full w ith         cars

and    there were        crowds          ma king    their way down to the ground.                     This      was

at a p p r o x i m a t e 1y 2.00         pm.     My ^serial         then w a lk e d back    up to the         far

in order       to taka/our meal                at C la yw h ee l s Lane.          AT this       time a b s ol u te l y

nothing       rvXd cjeme over        the       radio    regarding any           trouble.         IN fact       the

radio    seemed        to be      receiving         very few transmissions.

Wh il s t walking        down    the      road     past       the    precinct     the whole        floor area

and grass       banks     were     just        covered    in empty beer            cans and bottles.

There were        lads    from one of the               shops       collecting         them up     in bin

liners.       There were man y more on walls all                           the way down Halifax                Road.

C om m e n t s were made at/the                time as to what            state    the    fans w ould be            in.

At 3 .1 4     pin just ay*we         reached C l ay wh ee ls            lane,     an    Inspector      told us

there was       rioting at         the L ep pings Lane               end of the ground and to make

our way       ovW«nhere.           A transit           van then picked us up and                  took us to

L e pp i ng s Lane.       On our arrival               there was a large               crowd of fans          outside

the gate and a large             number       of officers           too.     No one a pp ea r ed      to be

going    in or out at          this    stage.        We then went           to the gate and my

a t t e n t i o n was d ra wn to a man          coming       out.      He was      obv io us ly distressed;

shouting at the          police       that    there was        too m any         in.    I then saw an

a mb u l a n c e at the gate and on a pp r oa c hi n g               it,    I saw three         people     lying

on the ground           at      the side       of    it. The y were         being a tt en d ed to,       but

didn't appear           to      be mo vi ng and were            very       pale.       I still w a s n ’t aware

what    had happe ne d as        far as       I knew there           had been rioting and             people

were    on the      pitch.

We were       then met       by some    officers       coming        o u t , a^tfQ I o ve r he a rd them say

that    it was      terrible and        that there were              ' 1 qj£A% dead.*

We    continued thro ug h        the         gate and up the f u n n e l           w hich   led to the

terraces.          AS   we      went    through the                 tya-rinaa, m a n y were      coming out.

O ff ic e rs were       carrying       people      out w m    looked unconscious.                 In some

cases    their      clothing was        torn or ripped out.                  At    this   point    I became

s e p a ra t ed from the       rest    of my serial           but    continued on.          On emerging

from the tunnel,             I saw that       there was        still       a large      crowd

on the terraces.             T he y were      shouting and swearing an d one                     lad pointed

at me gave me some a b u s e .               I still     didn't k n o w why they were               upset.         I

then    looked down t h ro ug h              the    line off Lifers an d saw a pile of bodi es                    up

a ga in st    the wall and fence at the J*ottom.

Fans    were shouting          such thiF^j^as          "It's your           fault you bast ar ds ."

I then made my wa y down the steps a n d a s s i s t e d j^fher o f ficers                            to    lift

the    bodies      up a nd    pass    them through the gat« onto the pitch.                           Several

I thought           I should.             W hen M l    the bodies          had been m oved from the

terraces          I looked up to the               stand above.            Threats and abuse were                  being

hurled at us.               The      terrace     floor was         covered w it h various a rt ic le s                 of

clothing and            possessions.             I was    then      instr uc te d to go onto               the    pitch

w it h other members                 of my serial.           The whole a tm os p he r e was

see    relatives and anger                   f l ar ed up.        There was a constant               p ro ce s si o n of

injured       people        to ambula nc es .         Trouble           nearly flared up on several

occ a s i o n s    due to upset and              irate    relatives and friends.

This     continued u n t i 1 about 5.0 0                 pm w hen the ground had been                      cleared.

At    this    point       our     serial      began to walk             back    up Hali fa x Roa d to our

points.           As we w a l k e d back         up the      hill a nd         past   the    coaches,       g e n e r al l y

we were       just      started at.            Pe o pl e were       full       of shock and disbelief.                  We

w ere a s k e d by several                people about        e me r ge n cy numbers,             but we    could not

tell    them anything                definat e as we         had not       been given          information.

C oac h e s   then began             leaving     the are a and we were                e ve nt u al l y s tood down

at 6 .30      pm at C l ay wh e el s          lane.

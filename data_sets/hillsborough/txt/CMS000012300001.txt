     APS/Secretary of State



     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL   u
     Mr Moynihan has seen the attached minute of 20 April from Mr
     Lee and is content for the payment of Â£l/2m to be made to the
     Appeal fund,  subject to the Secretary of State's
     confirmation.  I understand that the date for payment has
     been slightly delayed and we are now awaiting clearance from
     the Treasury.


     I would be grateful to know if the Secretary of State is
     content.

Report of the Regional Legal Adviser


HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY




1       At the preliminary hearing of the Enquiry convened by Lord Justice
        Taylor     in Sheffield on     the 28th April,        the Authority's         Solicitors
        applied unsuccessfully for leave for the Authority to be represented at
        the Enquiry.      Overall the responses throughout the NHS to this disaster
        appear to have been both speedy and efficient but it is considered,
        principally      for   the   following    reasons,      that     the    RHA   should   be
        represented:
        1.1   The vulnerability of staff who will be called as witnesses;


        1.2   Aspects of the involvement of SYMAS with the football club and
                 South Yorkshire Police prior to the match, and operationally at
                 the match itself could be subject            to critical examination by
                 Counsel for the other parties;


        1.3      SYMAS considers it should make representations to the Enquiry
                 that the Ambulance service should be consulted in relation to
                 future licensing of sports grounds by the Licensing Authority in
                 order   in future to make       less   likely some of the operational
                 difficulties of the sort it actually faced at Hillsborough;                   and


        1.4      there has already been some public criticism of aspects of the
                 "medical services" that were available at the ground.                 These may
                 well be given expression at the Enquiry.


        Extensive debriefing has taken place by the R H A ’s managers, assisted by
        their solicitors and all the         indications ere that               there are   sound
        answers to       any criticisms that may be forthcoming.




                                                                                                                       ■r
Accordingly instructions were given to the A u thority’s Solicitors to
renew privately   to Lord   Justice   Taylor   the Authority’s request      for
representation at   the Enquiry.      However,   it   seems   likely that   the
application wiil have to be renewed in public when the Enquiry re-opens
on the 15th May 1989v

                    Dear Jack,
                    Hillsborough Disaster
                    I enclose a draft of your statement.     It is deliberately
                    fairly short as the documents which will accompany it speak

                    secretary as soon as possible to notify us of any changes.
                    The statement can then be updated and sent to you for
                    signature. I am not sending the enclosures but I am sending
                    the index.

John Alexander Costley states


1.   I am employed by Trent Regional Health Authority as the
     Regional Health Emergency Planning Officer.


2.   My date of birth is


3.   My home address       is 24 New Road,   Holymoorside, Near
     Chesterfield, Derbyshire, S42 7EN.


4.   I joined Yorkshire Regional Health Authority in 1975 having
     previously been in the RAF for 26 years.         I became a
     training officer in the RAF in 1965, a Staff Officer in 1968
     and a training adviser and co-ordinator of courses in 1972.


5.   When 1 joined Yorkshire Regional Health Authority I was
     given a job as a legal executive.          I have no legal
     qualifications except for the legal content of one of my RAF
     exams.    In 1976 I was appointed Senior Administrative
     Assistant (Capital and Service Planning) and was appointed
     Deputy Secretary BTS (Blood Transfusion Service) in February
     1980.    I was appointed as the Regional Health Emergency
     Planning Officer in February 1982;   I am the first person to
     hold that position in Trent.


6.   The most important aspect of my job is to plan for a whole
     variety of possible emergencies in order to ensure that the
various parts of the health service are in a position to
respond and are able to liaise with all relevant parties.


In January 1977 the Department of Health and Social Security
had issued a circular,    number HC(77)1 entitled "Health
Service Arrangements For Dealing With Major Accidents", a
copy of which is enclosure 1 to this statement.           The
circular was, itself, used as a guide until I produced
separate guidelines in 1986.     That document is entitled
"Guidelines on Major Accident Procedures"           and forms
enclosure 2 to this statement.   The Guidelines were approved
by the Regional Health Authority at its meeting of 11th
April 1986.    Enclosure 3 to this statement is a bundle of
documents on the first page of which is a copy of the
relevant Regional Health Authority minute, and on the second
page of that bundle is the Regional General Manager's report
referred to in the minute.   The Guidelines were circulated
to those persons listed on page (ii) of the Guidelines with
a letter dated 15th April which appears on pages 3 and 4 of
enclosure 3.


I understand that major incident response procedures were
discussed at a meeting of Regional General Managers in 1986
and following this a letter dated 29th January 1987 was sent
from the Department of Health and Social Security to all
Regional General Managers.    A copy of that letter and its
enclosure appears at pages 5 to 7 of enclosure 3.    A copy of
the Regional General Manager's response (which I had been
involved in drafting) appears at pages 8 and 9.     Further
relevant correspondence appears at pages 10 to 13 of
enclosure 3.


Major accident procedures are constantly under review and as
part of this review process I wrote to all District General
Managers, the Chief Ambulance Officers, the Director of the
Blood Transfusion Service within Trent on 22nd August 1988.
A copy of that letter appears at page 14 of enclosure 3 and
the responses of the General Manager at Sheffield Health
Authority, and of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
Service appear at pages 15 to 18 inclusive.


At pages 19 and 20 of enclosure 3 there is a copy of a
letter which was sent to all District General Managers on
19th December 1988 referring to two meetings which I had
arranged which relate to planning for a major disaster.    I
produce this letter merely to emphasis the fact that major
incident planning is an ongoing procedure.


At enclosures 4, 5 and 6 respectively I produce the major
incident plans of each of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan
Ambulance Service, the Northern General Hospital, and the
Royal Hallamshire Hospital.     Updated versions of these
documents are sent to me from time to time.    Although the
major incident plan of South Yorkshire Metropolitan
      Ambulance Service is actually dated 1985 I know that it has
      been updated since then.


12.   I have not,   in my statement,      gone through each of the
      enclosed documents in detail because I believe that those
      documents speak for themselves.


Dated this      day of            1989.

SCALE OF CASUALTIES SHOWS NEED FOR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND FLAW ING

THE disaster throws into sharp relief the appalling consequences of an absence
of "first line" medical equipment, of a stand-by medical team and irmrediate
disaster strategy for any event bringing together thousands of people, Celia
Hall writes.

Doctors at the match who specialise in emergency medicine were shocked by the
absence of even basic resuscitation equipment.

Crisis procedures based on combat experience group casualties into the dead
(those for whom no intervention will help), the critically ill (those most in
need of first aid), and the less seriously injured.

John Ashton, senior lecturer in community medicine at Liverpool University,
who was at the match, said "There was nobody in charge, no plan, no
organisation at all. I had to assume control of the casualty situation
myself. I had to make sure the people who were still alive and most seriously
injured were got off to hospital first. People were being put in ambulances
in any order when I got there".

"The whole thing from beginning7to end had incompetence running right through
the organisational arrangements,” Dr Ashton added.
                           \
.‘I think it is time we started to ask questions about the accountability of
some of the senior officersijin the FA and the minister himself".

"They treat our people here .like animals and it-results in their deaths.    I am
outraged

Police were doing what they^could, he said, but "there was a total lack of
leadership and a total lack"of any overall plan at the Leppings Lane end."

Glynn Phi Hips, a GP and a Liverpool supporter, from East Kilbride,
Strathclyde, who described ’the scene as "sheer mayhem", was one of the first
to identify the lack of life saving equipment.

He said he was appalled to discover there were no defibrillators at the
ground. Defibrillators are machines used to pass 200 volts of electricity per
second across the chest wall, to chock a heart which has gone out of rhythm
and is "wobbling" back to normal.

He spent 10 minutes resuscitating one man.  "We were just about to give up
when we got his heart beating, but I don’t know what the state of his cerebral
function is going to be like".

 "We asked for a defibri1lator and I was informed that there was not a
'defibrillator in the whole ground,, which is appalling for a major event like
Ithis.*'

He added: "We were given an oxygen tank to help with our resuscitation and it
was empty.

"I think that is an absolute disgrace."

                   Mr John Thurston, secretary of the Casualty Surgeons Association, said: "The
                   best first aid for many would have been the kiss of life alternating with
                   heart massage".

                    “Anyone can learn to do this and we believe that every child in school should
                    be taught. It should be in the core curriculum".

                    "It is inconceivable that at events of this size there is no defibrillator.
                    With numbers like this you can expect someone to have fa heart attack, at
                    1east.                                                1

                    The other classic first aid action, in the hands of trained personnel, is to
                    put a tube into the windpipe through the neck through which oxygen can be
                    passed directly into the lungs.

                    ‘‘Obviously one woi^ld not expect there to have been 90 tubes available or the
                    people to use them. But a collection in different sizes is pretty standard,"
                    he said.

                    Mr Thurston said his association believed that any major event should be
                    required to have a medical officer and an operational plan to cope with the
                    immediate aftermath of a disaster.

                                YORKSHIRE POST             17 APRIL 1989

            Doctor attacks M a c k of a plan'
            The Footbal1 Association reacted sharply yesterday to scathing claims by a
            senior doctor at the ground of "organisational incompetence".
                                                                       i
            Dr. John   Ashton, Professor of Medicine at Liverpool University, said
            ordinary   policemen on the scene did what they could, when the disaster
            happened   but added "There was a total lac1'         — nil plan at the
            Leppings   Lane end".
            Dr. Ashton, who was a spectator at the match, said "The whole thing from
            beginning to end had incompetence running right through the organisational
            arrangements.                                      s
            "I think it is time we started to ask questions about the accountability of
            some of the senior officers in the FA and the Sports Minister himself. They
            treat our people here like animals and it results in their deaths. I am
            outraged".
            A GP who was at the match, Dr. Glyn Phillips, who practises in East Kilbride,
            Strathclyde, said he was appalled to find there were no defibrillators -
            machines used to give electric shucks to victims to restart the heart - and
            Lhdl lit waa yivfcK an axygen tank to holp recuecitat® victims hut it was
            empty,                      1

            But an FA spokesman, Mr. Glen Kitson, said last night: "We can't speculate on
            who is to blame. That is the job of the.inquiries and it is far too soon to
            speculate, it would be wrong to do so".
            He added: "Sheffield Wednesday operates under the Safety at Sports Grounds
            Act. If the inquiries find it to be a club organised in accordance with the
            requirements of that legisTation, the question of blame would not* I hope,
            arise.
            We are distressed as anyone and desperately sorry for all the families
            concerned, and we will learn whatever may need to be learned as a result of
            the inquiries' findings".
            The Chief Ambulance Officer in charge of operations at the ground denied that
            having defibrilators there would have helped.
            "The chaos in the evacuation process just would not have allowed anyone to
            use equipment had it been there", he said.
            "You are just not expecting the sort of situation that we faced yesterday.
            I don't think a football club like that would expect to purchase such equipment.
            "Defibrilators certainly couldn't have been used yesterday. They can kill .if'
            you come in contact with them* because of the surge of electrical power through
            them.
            "They can (sill if misused, and with the thousands of people around in that kind
            of situation, there would have been more fatalities.
            "A doctor is used to working in a surgery - not in a mass evacuation situation".

      The Sheffield Star - 17 April 1989

      Doctor Attacks "Chaos*'

      A Doctor who fought for hours to save lives at Hillsborough said this
      afternoon that lives could have been saved if there had been better
      medical and emergency facilities at the ground.

      Dr John Ashton, lecturer in community medicine at-Liverpool University
      claimed "At least &0 people could otill be ?*1 i.ve today if there had
      been a rapid response and basic medical facilities".

      And he has bitterly criticised the police, medical equipment and ground
      facilities as "woefully inadequate in the face of tragedy".

      Dri Ashton, who was at the match with his two young sons, was one nf the
      first on the scene when an appeal went out for volunteers to treat the
      in,j ured.

      He rushed to the emergency station in the gym.      "I found absolute
      ohuv*-

      "At that time there were no medical, personnel apart from one o^-
      two St John Ambulance Brigade men.     1 set up a clearing station behind

      knew what to do.       !

      "I had to assume control and separated people into three categories -
      survivors, injured and dead.

      "The police weren't dispatching in order of severity and that l@
      not the right thing to do.

      He gave first, aid to the dying and injured men, women and childreri who
      lay sprawled across the pitch.

  SCALE OF CASUALTIES SHOWS NEED FOR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND FLAWING


  THE disaster throws into sharp relief the appalling consequences of an absence
  of "first line" medical equipment, of a stand-by medical -team and inrnediate
  disaster strategy for any event bringing together thousands of people, Celia
  Hal 1 writes.

  Doctors at the match who specialise in emergency medicine were shocked by the
  absence of even basic resuscitation equipment.'

  Crisis procedures based on combat experience group casualties into the dead
  (those for whom no intervention will help), the critically ill (those most in
  need of first aid), and the less seriously injured,

  John Ashton, senior lecturer in community medicine at Liverpool University,
                                                          ,
  who W&o cit the match, said "There was nobody in charge no plan, m
  organisation at all. I had to assume control of the casualty situation
  myself. I had to make sure the people who were still alive and most seriously
  injured were got off to hospital first. People were being put in ambulances
  in any order when I got there".

   "The whole thing from beginning to end had incompetence running right through
   the organisational arrangements," Dr Ashton added.

   ''I think it is time we started to ask questions about the accountability of
   some of the senior officers in the FA and the minister himself".

   ‘‘They treat our people here like animals and it results in their deaths.    I am
   outraged."

   Police were doing what they could, he said, but "there was a total lack of
   leadership and a total lack of any overall plan at the Leppings Lane end."

   Glynn Phillips, a GP and a Liverpool supporter, from East Kilbride,
   Strathclyde, who described the scene as "sheer mayhem", was one of the first
   to identify the lack of life saving equipment,

   He said he was appalled to discover there were no defibrillators at the
   ground. Defibrillators are machines used to pass 200 volts of electricity per
   second across the chest wall, to chock a heart which has gone out of rhythm
   and is "wobbling" back to normal.

   He spent 10 minutes resuscitating one man. "We were just about to give up
   when we got his heart beating, but I don’t know what the state of his cerebral
   function is going to be like".

   "We asked for a defibrillator and I was informed that there was not a
   defibrillator in1-the whole ground,, which is appalling for a major event like
   this."

   He added: "We were given an oxygen tank to help with our resuscitation and it
   was empty,

       "I think that is an absolute disgrace,"

       N.'
        Mr John Thurston, secretary of the Casualty Surgeons Association, said: "The
        best first aid for many would have been the kiss of life alternating with
        heart massage".

        "Anyone can learn to do this and we believe that every child in school should
        be taught. It should be in the core curriculum".

        "It is inconceivable that at events of this size there is no defibrillator.
        With numbers like this you can expect someone to have a heart attack, at
        least."

        The other classic first aid action, in the hands of trained personnel, is to
        put a tube into the windpipe through the neck through which oxygen can be
        passed directly into the lungs.

        ''Obviously one would not expect there to have been 90 tubes available or the
        people to use than. But a collection in different sizes is pretty standard,”
        he said.

        Mr Thurston said his association believed that any major event should be
        required to have a medical officer and an operational plan to cope with the
        immediate aftermath of a disaster.

                     YORKSHIRE POST   -    17 APRIL 1989

Doctor attacks 'lack of a plan'
The Football Association reacted sharply yesterday to scathing claims by a
senior doctor at the ground of "organisational incompetence".
Dr. John   Ashton, Professor of Medicine at Liverpool University, said
ordinary   policemen on the scene did what they could when the disaster
happened   but added "There was a total lack of#.any overall plan at the
Leppings   Lane end".                                  jiB
Dr, Ashton, who was a spectator at the match, said "The whole thing from
beginning to end had incompetence running right through the organisational
arrangements,
"I think it is time we started to ask questions about the accountability of
some of the senior officers in the FA and the Sports Minister himself. They
treat our people here like animals and it results in their deaths. I am
outraged".
A GP who was at the match. Dr, Glyn Phillips, who p r a c ti s es in East Kilbride,
Strathclyde, said he was appalled to find there were no defibrillators -
machines used to give electric shucks to victims to restart the heart - and
Ihdl he wdi y i a n exygen tank to holp retUEcitate victims hut it was
empty.
But an FA spokesman, Mr. Glen Kitson, said last night: "We can't speculate on
who is to blame. That is the job of the inquiries and       it is far too soon to
speculate, it would be wrong to do so".
He added: "Sheffield Wednesday operates under the Safety at       Sports Grounds
Act. If the inquiries find it to be a club organised in accordance with the
requirements of that legislation, the question of blame would not, I hope*
arise.
We are distressed as anyone and desperately sorry for all the families
concerned, and we will learn whatever may need to be learned as a result of
the inquiries1 findings".
The Chief Ambulance Officer in charge of operations at the ground denied that
having defibrilators there would have helped.
"The chaos in the evacuation process just would not have allowed anyone to
use equipment had 1t been there", he said.
 "You are just not expecting the sort of situation that we faced yesterday.
 I don't think a football club like that would expect to purchase such equipment.
"Defibrilators certainly couldn't have been used yesterday. They can kill .if'
you come in contact with them, because of the surge of electrical power through
them.
"They can fei11 if misused, and with the thousands of people around in that kind
of situation, there would have been more fatalities,
 "A doctor is used to working in a surgery - not in a mass evacuation situation".

Dear Jack,
Hillsborough Disaster
I enclose a draft of your statement.     It is deliberately
fairly short as the documents which will accompany it speak
for themselves.  Could you please telephone either me or my
secretary as soon as possible to notify us of any changes.
The statement can then be updated and sent to you for
signature. I am not sending the enclosures but I am sending
the index.
Yours sincerely,




A. J. CALLAGHAN

Superintendent R. Chidley
Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry
 into the Hillsborough Disaster
Fernville House
Sheffield


Dear Superintendent Chidley,
Hillsborough Disaster
I am delivering with this letter four ring binders.   Two of
the ring binders contain original signed statements, one
contains transcripts from the tape kept at SYMAS Control, of
the radio and telephone conversations between 3.00 p.m. and
4.40 p.m. on Saturday 15th April. The last bundle contains a
variety of documents. I should be grateful if you could sign
a copy of this letter and copies of the indices to the
bundles to acknowledge receipt.
As far as the statements are concerned. There are a few more
from Trent RHA and SYMAS which are awaiting signature and I
shall deliver these to you as soon as possible. We are also
obtaining short statements from personnel involved from other
ambulance authorities which I shall give you when they are
available.
We have not had the opportunity to double check the
transcripts against the tapes.   If, having listened to the
tapes and read the transcripts there are any necessary
amendments please let me know and I shall arrange for this to
be done.   The transcripts are on our word processors and
there seems little point in you having these freshly typed.

When delivering the documents to you I shall go through the
contents of the fourth bundle fairly quickly in order to
explain what the documents are, and what their relevance is.
If, having read the statements, there are any points which
you or the Treasury Solicitors wish to raise with the makers
of the statements could you please contact us. We can either
9 May 1989


put any relevant points on your behalf, or if you do want to
see any of the makers of the statements arrangements should
be made through me and I would wish either one of my
colleagues, or one of the SYMAS officers to be present.
Obviously I would prefer that witnesses should not be
interviewed again if that is possible.

Finally, I should be grateful for an early indication of
which witnesses the Treasury Solicitors would wish to call,
and when it is likely that they will be asked to give
evidence. Having said that, however, Trent RHA and SYMAS are
to make a further application for leave to be granted
representation before the Inquiry and if representation is
granted I am uncertain as to who will take the decision as to
which witnesses to call.

Yours sincerely,




A. J. CALLAGHAN

Matter              Trent - Hillsborough

Date                4 May 1989
Ref                 AGC/


I telephoned Mr Page upon receipt of Mr        s fax.

He said that he accepted the corrections in full and final
settlement but I was to make it clear to the Association through
the solicitors that in the event of there being any similar
complaint he would not hesitate in pressing the matter all the
way.

I spoke to Mr           and confirmed that the correction was
accepted subject to two things.       The first being that the
distribution of the correction must take place quicker than 7
days.   He said that he understood that his clients were running
around like headless chickens trying to find out the total
circulation list.    I said that they must get the correction
published as quickly as possible.    The second point was that Mr
Page had asked me to inform the Association through its
solicitors that in the event of there being any repetition of the
libel or similar libel he would not hesitate to take the
Association all the way to Court.        Mr        bnderstood our
point.   I said that I would write to him ro conrirm but in the
meantime he is to arrange for the correction to be published.

Superintendent R. Chidley
Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry
 into the Hillsborough Disaster
Fernville House
Sheffield


Dear Superintendent Chidley,
Hillsborough Disaster
I am delivering with this letter four ring binders.   Two of
the ring binders contain original signed statements, one
contains transcripts from the tape kept at SYMAS Control, of
the radio and telephone conversations between 3.00 p.m. and
4.40 p.m. on Saturday 15th April. The last bundle contains a
variety of documents. I should be grateful if you could sign
a copy of this letter and copies of the indices to the
bundles to acknowledge receipt.
As far as the statements are concerned. There are a few more
from Trent RHA and SYMAS which are awaiting signature and I
shall deliver these to you as soon as possible. We are also
obtaining short statements from personnel involved from other
ambulance authorities which I shall give you when they are
available.
We have not had the opportunity to double check the
transcripts against the tapes.   If, having listened to the
tapes and read the transcripts there are any necessary
amendments please let me know and I shall arrange for this to
be done.   The transcripts are on our word processors and
there seems little point in you having these freshly typed.

When delivering the documents to you I shall go through the
contents of the fourth bundle fairly quickly in order to
explain what the documents are, and what their relevance is.
If, having read the statements, there are any points which
you or the Treasury Solicitors wish to raise with the makers
of the statements could you please contact us. We can either
9 May 1989

put any relevant points on your behalf, or if you do want to
see any of the makers of the statements arrangements should
be made through me and 1 would wish either one of my
colleagues, or one of the SYMAS officers to be present.
Obviously I would prefer that witnesses should not be
interviewed again if that is possible.
Finally, I should be grateful for an early indication of
which witnesses the Treasury Solicitors would wish to call,
and when it is likely that they will be asked to give
evidence. Having said that, however, Trent RHA and SYMAS are
to make a further application for leave to be granted
representation before the Inquiry and if representation is
granted I am uncertain as to who will take the decision as to
which witnesses to call.

Yours sincerely,




A. J. CALLAGHAN



I acknowledge receipt of this letter and the ring binders
   erred to, and have signed copies of the indices to the
   cr blusters.

Telephone call made to Mr Pat Slavin, who is the Head of
Operations for the Nottinghamshire Ambulance Service.           I
explained to Mr Slavin my firm's involvement on behalf of SYMAS,
and the fact that we were handing over the original statements
taken from all Officers and staff involved with the Hillsborough
incident, to the West Midlands police.     I asked him to confirm
whether or not we had the Nottinghamshire Ambulance Service
permission to hand over the original statements/reports to the
West Midlands police, and he replied by saying that the Ml
Ke gworth Disaster has set a precedent in relation to such
statements.     He explained to me that the statements were
au tomatically handed over to the police in charge of that
disaster, who were based at Loughborough.          He therefore
specifically confirmed to me that we required no confirmation in
writing from the Nottinghamshire Ambulance Service to hand over
the statements to the West Midlands police.

Mr Slavin also made the point that if the statements were not
handed over to the police at this stage, it was highly likely
that the men involved in the incident would be badgered by the
West Midlands police for statements in due course.

Dear Sir,

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
OUR CLIENTS - SOUTH YORKSHIRE METROPOLITAN AMBULANCE SERVICE
(SYMAS)


We have been instructed to act on behalf of SYMAS in relation
to the Hillsborough Inquiry which is due to commence on Monday
15th May 1989.

As you are no doubt aware, four of your own Officers assisted
at Hillsborough football ground on Saturday 15th April, 1989,
the four men being Qualified Ambulanceman           Qualified
Ambulanceman |        ' |
                        , Ambulanceman            and Leading
Ambulanceman

Following the incident, each ambulanceman provided a written
report covering their respective involvement at Hillsborough,
and thereafter you kindly forwarded faxed copies of these
reports to our client's headquarters in Rotherham.

We have now provided the West Midlands Police with the
original statements from every member of SYMAS who were
involved with the incident at Hillsborough on the 15th April.
The statements have been handed over to the West Midlands
Police pursuant to their specific request.                     In addition, West
M i d l a n d s P o l i c e h a v e r e q u e s t e d s i g h t of all o t h e r
statements/reports from ambulance personnel not otherwise
m




    10 May, 1989
    employed by SYMAS.
    It is our intention, with your permission, to release to West
    Midlands Police the original reports of the four ambulancemen
    referred to above, and bearing in mind the shortage of time
    before the Inquiry commences, we should be grateful if you
    will deal with our request as a matter of urgency.     If you
    are in agreement with our request, we should be obliged if
    you will arrange for each ambulanceman concerned to sign and
    date their respective reports, and at the same time to sign
    and date the appropriate forms of authority which are
    enclosed.
    So far as the report of                 is concerned, with the
    permission of Superintendent Gerrard, we actually attended on
    Mr         briefly on the 9th May, in the p resence of
    Superintendent Gerrard.     Our attendance on Mr            was
    simply for the purposes of clarifying one paragrapn ot his
    report concerning the use of defibrillators.     As a result of
    our brief discussion, Mr            ]has no objection to the
    addition of the following sentence after the words "using our
    defibrillator which had just been obtained by my colleague"
    in paragraph 5 of his report, namely;        "I should make it
    clear that in carrying out a paddle check the doctor only
    used the monitor, w h i c h f o r m s part of the o v e r a l l
    defibrillator equipment, and that the defibrillator itself
    was not actually used."
    We look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible, but
    if you have any queries regarding the above, please do not

Dear John,

Hillsborough Disaster

I enclose Mr Kallipetis' draft Submissions/Opening and, as I
mentioned on the telephone, I should be grateful if you could
telephone Andrew Chappel or me later today to discuss this.
Lord Justice Taylor has asked that Mr Kallipetis keep his
application short on Monday.

Yours sincerely,




A. J. CALLAGHAN

                    Dear John,
                    Hillsborough Disaster
                    I enclose Mr Kallipetis' draft Submissions/Opening and, as I
                    mentioned on the telephone, I should be grateful if you could
                    telephone Andrew Chappel or me later today to discuss this.
                    Lord Justice Taylor has asked that Mr Kallipetis keep his
                    application short on Monday.

                    Yours sincerely,

                       HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

                  Outline Submissions on behalf of
          South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Services



Pursuant to the leave granted on 28th April we apply on behalf of

SYMAS to be allowed representation at this Inquiry.        There are
three areas of the Inquiry's investigations to which SYMAS can
give considerable assistance to the Tribunal:-


A.   PRE-MATCH ARRANGEMENTS

     1.    Although there is no statutory obligation to consult

           the ambulance services as there is as regards the fire
           brigade under Section 3 of the Safety of Sports Grounds

           Act 1935, in fact, there were consultations with SYMAS
           following the publication of the Popplewell Report, as

           a result of which some safety arrangements were made at

           the request of SYMAS.


     2.    The co-operation of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

           was limited to providing two season tickets in the

           South Stand from where ambulance officers could see the
           whole ground, and from which position their portable

           radios had good contact with emergency Control.      This
           concession was not made available for the F.A. Cup

           Semi-Finals, as a consequence of which two officers
           made   private   arrangements   with   police   and were

           positioned on the touch line between the North Stand

           and Spion Kop.     From this position their overall view
     of the ground was limited.


BUILD UP TO THE DISASTER

1.   SYMAS officers were present from 2.15 p.m. onwards and

     observed the build up of crowds in the West Stand.


2.   They were first alerted to a problem just after kick
     off and two officers went       to investigate.      They

     realised     that   there was an emergency and alerted
     Control and, as a result of their action,     the SYMAS

     Major Accident Plan was instituted.


3.   When   the   ambulance crews arrived pursuant to the
     initiation of the SYMAS Major Accident Plan, their

     operations were directed by those officers.



FUTURE PLANNING
1.   SYMAS has     substantial    submissions concerning the

     inclusion of the ambulance services as one of the

     bodies who should be consulted under Section 3 of the

     1975 Act.



2.   These submissions would more cogent and pertinent if
     they are in a position to have taken a full part in the
     first part of the Inquiry.
REASONS FOR REPRESENTATION

1.   SYMAS hd as much, if not more, involvement with safety

     measures generally at the Sheffield Wednesday Football

     Club Hillsborough Ground than the fire services who
     have already been granted representation.



2.   SYMAS   has been the     subject   indirectly of severe
     criticism of two doctors which was reported widely in

     the press.       The allegations were that there was no
     control, chaos, lack of plah,      lack of equipment and

     incompetence generally.      If any of those allegations

     are to be repeated, we submit that it is only right
     that SYMAS should be in a position to challenge those

     allegations in cross-examination, establish the factual
     position through examination of other witnesses, and be

     in a position to call evidence of its own to deal with
     those allegations.



3.   SYMAS has criticisms of its own of Sheffield Wednesday

     Football Club as regards       its refusal   to pay for

     adequate ambulance presence, and for constructing an

     additional gangway which hindered access to the pitch
     /            .   .



     by ambulances. SYMAS also has severe criticism of some

     portions of the media, whose persistent telephone calls

     to Control blocked lines which were urgently required
     by nurses, doctors and ambulance men off duty who were

     calling in to see if their help was required and asking
          for directions as to where they should go.


    4.   At the request of the Treasury Solicitor the police

         have taken details of the Control Action Plan,          the
         Major Incident Plan,    and transcripts of the tapes

          recording all messages through to Control.     It is, in

         our submission, only right that if that Plan is to be
          the subject of investigation by this         Inquiry   the

          authors of that plan as well as those who implemented
          it on 15th April should have representation.

IN THE MATTER OF A PUBLIC INQUIRY
INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


LEADING COUNSEL'S SUBMISSIONS IN SUPPORT OF AN APPLICATION BY
TRENT REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY FOR REPRESENTATION



A.   I am instructed on behalf of Trent Regional Health Authority
     (TRHA)    which     is   responsible      for the management          of South

     Yorkshire      Metropolitan          Ambulance     Service          (SYMAS) in
     connection     with      their     involvement     in     the   Hillsborough
     Disaster.



B.   An application for the grant of the right to representation
     was made by my Instructing Solicitors at the preliminary

     hearing on the 28th April and was refused, but you indicated
     that any party whose application was refused could make a

     further application.             I am instructed to make a further
     application.         TRHA    seeks   representation       on    a    number of

     grounds which are set out in a letter from my Instructing

     Solicitors and in written representations from me.                     I shall
     merely summarize those representations.


1. SYMAS EVIDENCE

The evidence     which    SYMAS    is   able    to   produce    to   the    Inquiry
includes:

     (a)    The observations of on duty officers who were present
            in the ground prior to 3.00 p.m.
(b)   The evidence of two ambulancemen who were off duty at
      the    time     but    who    attended             the   match,    one    as    a
      spectator       and   one    in       his     capacity    as   a   part    time

      caterer.


(c)   Evidence       of   Senior    Officers             and   ambulancemen      who
      attended the ground as the incident developed.                             This

      will include evidence relating to the crush and rescue,
      and the difficulties which were encountered in gaining

      access    to    the     ground        and     in   manoeuvering     vehicles

      within the ground and onto the pitch.


(d)   The    evidence       of    the       Chief       Ambulance    Officer,        of
      another Senior Officer (now with another service), and

      of two other officers,                 relating to SYMAS' desire to
      have     its    officers          (and      in     appropriate     cases       an

      ambulance) present at the ground.


(e)   Evidence relating to SYMAS own Control Action Plan in

      the event of a major incident at Sheffield Wednesday

      and the implementation of a Major Incident Plan.



(f ) The original tapes of radio and telephone messages to

      and    from     SYMAS      Control          and    transcripts     of     those

      messages.       These are relevant to the timing of events


                                        2
            as they unfolded and to the manner in which the police
            and others in authority reacted.   A number of messages
            from the police are recorded.   The tapes are already in

            the possession of the Police.




2.   CRITICISM OF SYMAS



Criticism of SYMAS by a Community Physician and a G.P. who were
present at the disaster were widely reported in the press in the
days immediately after the disaster.    In particular the Community

Physician    is reported to have said there was a lack of control,
incompetence and lack of overall plan and the G.P. is reported to

have said that there was a lack of life saving equipment and in

particular    defibrillators.     Similar   complaints   continue   to

receive mention in the press.


Given the criticisms which have already been made, it is highly

probable that evidence if presented will be critical of SYMAS.
The Ambulance Service should have legal representation to enable

it to refute any such criticism, and give it the opportunity to
establish the accurate position through all relevant witnesses.



3. ADVANCE WARNING



     (a)    It is difficult to anticipate precisely when adverse
      comments or criticism will be made during the course of
      such an Inquiry, and thus adequate advance notice may
      not always be possible.              However it is often the case

      that such criticism can be anticipated by Counsel from

      the cross examination of the other witnesses by other

      Counsel and that the nature of such criticism is                        such

      that    Counsel       can    establish         facts    refuting        that
      criticism      from    other       witnesses    before    the    critical

      witnesses themselves are called.


(b)   West   Midlands       Police    have       requested,    and    have    been
      supplied with, statements from SYMAS some of which are
      critical       of   Sheffield        Wednesday        Football     Club's

      management.           Pursuant        to    Lord    Justice      Taylor's
      direction and the usual              practice,       advance notice of

      those criticisms will be given to the people concerned.
      Inevitably they will give evidence anticipating                         such
      criticism and will seek to answer deflect or refute

      this and may well in so doing                   attack the author of

      these criticisms.           It would be invidious if the Chief

      Ambulance Officer and other officers or staff were not

      able   to   put     these      criticisms      to    those      witnesses
      through their own Counsel who can                   test the replies by
      cross examination. Further,                 unfairness may result to

      the    SYMAS    officers       if    they    give    evidence     and    are
      themselves      cross    examined      by     the   representatives       of


                                     4
               those witnesses without having the benefit of being

               represented themselves.



4. STATION OFFICERS' PRESENCE



Two Station Officers were present with an ambulance and crew, in

the ground before the match               started.      As   stated    above their
evidence is relevant to what happened as the incident developed.

It is also highly relevant to the dealings between SYMAS and the

Club relating to involvement of the ambulance service at matches.

They    will    for example give evidence            that    because    the   season

tickets provided to them by the Club did not cover the F A Cup
semi-final a request was made                for tickets to be provided for

their    normal     seats,    but     this    request    was    declined      and   in
consequence they had to make arrangements through the police to

view the match from pitch level - a much less advantageous view

point than their normal seats in the stand ( from the point of
view    of     monitoring    events    and     effective     communication      with

Control).


6. FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS


SYMAS will be in a position to make more cogent representations

to the second part of the Inquiry if it has had the opportunity
to participate        in the Inquiry by full legal representation.

Involvement       throughout        the    Inquiry    will     save    duplication.
Furthermore   the questions which SYMAS will wish to put, so as to
establish its recommendations as to what should happen in the

future, will not greatly lengthen the proceedings,       but will if

put in the first part of the Inquiry, make it unnecessary for

such witnesses to return.



C.
I am instructed on behalf of those persons from whom statements

have been taken.    They all wish to have legal representation if

required   to give evidence.      That representation will be more

meaningful if I am able to represent SYMAS' officers and staff
throughout the Inquiry and in my respectful submission the SYMAS
evidence could not and should not be in isolation from all the

evidence given at the Inquiry.



D. FAIRNESS


Each of the SYMAS officers       and staff involved in the disaster

have been asked to supply a statement to the Inquiry.          Those
statements have been prepared by my instructing Solicitors, but

the   officers and staff wish to be legally represented if they

are to be called.     Each of them is an important witness as to

fact as regards either one or more of the following;



           (a)   the events leading up to the incident




                                   6
            (b)   the    way    the     incident         was   dealt   with     by    the

                  ambulance service


            (c)   the   broader        issues      of    crowd   safety    at   sports

                  stadia.


As a matter of fairness where criticisms have already been made

the ambulance service ought to be legally represented.                          In any
event I respectfully submit that it has an equal if not greater
contribution to make than the Fire Service who have been granted

representation. I understand from my instructing Solicitors that
the   Fire Service      argued that         they    should have representation

since they must be consulted before the Local Authority grants a

licence    to   the   sports        stadium.       The     ambulance     service     has
significant points to make in relation to why it too should be

consulted.


1   respectfully      submit    that     for    the        reasons     which    I    have

outlined    SYMAS     ought    to    have   full        representation    before      the

Inquiry.

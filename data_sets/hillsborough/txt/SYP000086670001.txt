avid waving      their arms about,               others were           crying and being          comforted b

what    a p p e a r e d their   friends         and some        other     fans were fighting amongst

themselves.         Several        fans did make           very as s e r t i v e attempts           to gain

e ntry to the       g y m n a s i u m mo s t l y worse      for    drink.         These were        restrained

and when      calmed down exp l a i n e d the              reasons        for    not a l l owing       entry.

T hey were     then e s c o r t e d away from the entrance                       of the gy m n a s i u m

Members     of our serial           were a sked        to assist          in making an ad hoc

casualty desk         in front          of the     g y m n a s i u m at the      edge    of the North

Stand.      Here we o b t a i n e d details and                 descritpions           of miss i n g    fans and

details     of the     people       concerned.            They were        then a sked to        check      their

motor    vehicles and writing                phone     numbers         on their       hands    of the

casualty      lines    that were          being     set    up,    as well       as    the t e l ephone      numbs

of H a m m e r t o n Road Police S t a t i o n         regarding any further                  developments.

Whilst at      this    desk,       a l th o u g h most     of    the    fans     came    upset and w o r r i e d

several     were very a ngry and agitated,                       smelling        the worse      for     drink,     I

recall     a small     group       coming       up to me as k i n g me questions a n d a young

female     in the group,           who was       the worse        for    drink,       asking me,        "How big

is your w i l lie?"          I was       confused      by what         she was       saying and w h e n she

again    spoke    to me      she    tried to a p o l o g i s e         saying,       " I ’m sorry      I ’m just

trying     to make     light       of    it."      Later    I saw her and her               friends      re­

uni t e d w ith someone         they had         reported as missing.

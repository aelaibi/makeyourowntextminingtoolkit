            We set       off for SheffVe-iba at about                   10.30        <1030)    and    I think       tra v e l l e d

            via the M 6 2 , but              I am not      sure.

            On    route      to S h e f f i e l d we      stop p e d at a serv i c e          station on the m o t o r w a y

            for a bite           to eat an d        to use     t he t o i 1e t s , I cannot           say whi ch >«Jne i t

            Just       prior       to getting into S h e f f i e l d we were held up jyy roadworks,

            this       was     just as we         came    from the motor          way, but ^ / c a n n o t       say w here           it

            was.    I will         say       that about       this    time we         did have a p u n c t u r e , we had

            no spare and so A n d r e w and                             had to get a taxi and take                      it for

            r e pa i r .

            On    route      to the game           I did not       sea any other           supporters          consuming

            alcoho 1.

            We a r r i v e d     in S h e f f i e l d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1.30pm     (1330)      and    parked       in

            Fairhank         Rd,      N o r w o o d are a of Sheffield.

            F r o m where        we    parked      the    car we did not             receive any Police             directions

            or escort          to the ground.

            All    five      of us w a l k e d      straight       to the      ground,        I walked w ith Andrew,

            jut the others went                   off a head      of us.      We w a l k e d to the ground w i t h a

          crowds were             really h eavy             and    so said to Andrew,             "Let go back,"             but as

          we    turned        to go,       a great          number of       people        came down the      tunnel      and we

          were        unable      to.

          This        was a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 , 5 0 p m     (1450)       and a l t h o u g h the    crowd was        heavy

          there was           no fighting            or d r u n k e n e s s and       I did not see anyone             consuming

          a 1 c o h o 1.

          At    the      end of the tunnel                  we went       to the right and           into   "Pen Wo          3".    I

          have seen the              "Sketch P l a n / G r i d          of Pens 3 & 4 and            I w ould estimate             my

          more        intense.          The    numbers       of    people        i n creased d r a m a t i c a l l y and we

were    pushed towards               the    pitch,        we were     near a barrier and                I had to

duck    under         it.     A n d r e w stayed where            he was     on the other          side       of    it.

He was       im m e d i a t e l y a g a i n s t    the    barrier.        This was about 3 . 0 0 p m               (1500).

The    teams were            out a n d     the game        just    starting.         The       crowd was       still

bu i lding       up and there was a lot of                       pushing     and    I remember one             "surge”

I had     been turned            round and was             facing     awa y from the            pitch.        I could

not    see      the    game.       I did see A n d r e w          for a short        time       leaning agai n s t

the    Wary      but    then     lost      him from view,            he    did    not seem to be          in too

rnh     d if f i c u l t y at this          time.

At about 3 . 05pm             (1505)       I had been           pushed against           the    r a ilings     of Pen 2

a n d was       getting       crushed.            Somehow       or other     there a p p e a r e d a little

space     a r o u n d me and a lad                in Pen 2 put his           hands       through the          railings

and    cupped         them toget h e r         to give me a f o o t h o l d         to climb out          of P e n 3

i nto Pen 2.

I then w a l k e d over            to    the far         side    of the Pen and sat down exhausted.

I was     sat     down when          the m a t c h was          stopped.         I did    not see a n y barriers

break     in Pen 3,           I was      not aware any had been broken until                            later.

I was     not     injured        in anyway.              After a short while              I stood up and             could

see    people         being    lifted out of              the Pens        towards    the       front.

I will       say that whilst               in Pen 3 I did see               people       being    crushed badly,

one    fel low springs            to mind,          he was age d a bout 30 years,                  he tried          to

duck    under a crash barrier and                         became     stuck       by his head.           The    bar was

being     crushed agai n s t             his      neck.      1 did    not    see him get          from this

p o s i t i o n as     I was     pushed away from the spot.                        This man w ould            have    been

w i t h i n 2 ft of Andrew,                A n d r e w was      on the same        side    of the       barrier,          but

I did not         d i r ectly w i t n e s s any           deaths,     or was       I in a position to

assist       anyone         injured or dead.

I stood w a t ching            for      some      time,    but    I did     not    see any       of my other

         her    to     inform my          parents      that      I was     okay.

         I     visited 2         h o s pitals        in S h e f f i e l d and     the ground to try a n d find my

         I then went           to the Po l i c e S t a t i o n and            r e p orted An d r e w and my other

         friends        miss i n g and then to a "Boys Club"                         building where            people were

         other        lads,    we    r e t urned home         on the S u n d a y afternoon.

         On    the day of the m a t c h               I wore a black            shirt wit h small            white     spots

         all    over      it and a black and white                      stripped         collar and edgings            to the

            the      crowds,       trying       to    control       them.        I feel       a "1o u d h a i 1e r " would

            have      been vital          in a s i t ua t i o n such as              this,      for the O f f i c e r s a p p e a r e d

            to have         lost    control          of the     crowds       completely.

             I feel     that       if there          had been more           s t e wards and Police at the entrance

            to the      ground,          once    in thro u g h the turnstiles,                       this s i t u a t i o n w ould

            not      have arisen.           The       fans    should       have      been d i r ected away from the

            areas w h i c h were           o v e r c r o w d e d to     less     crowded areas.

            Can      I add,    I feel       that       the    problem s t e m m e d from the                 large      build up of

            fans      outside       the    ground.           If and when the                 "Identity Card"            system    comes

             into force,           this must          make    things worse,              people       "queuing",        waiting       to

            get      into    grounds,       tempers          fraying,        getting          impatient       because      of the

             time     it will       take to get           large       numbers        into      the    ground.

                                                                                                           A C A M P B E L L SI G N E D

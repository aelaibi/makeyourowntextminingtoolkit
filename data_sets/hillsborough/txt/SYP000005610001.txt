                  The      route       we     took          was       from       Liverpool             along        the       M62    to L e e d s         where       we

                  We     walked        to     the       ground          which          took       about        five       minutes.              On       the    walk

                  was      trying        to      get        into       the       ground.              There     was       a    lot       of    people          there

                  but      no    more       than        has       been       at       other       big    matches              I've       been       to.        I went

                  through         some        big       wrought             iron       gates          with     my    mates          and       got    caught          up

                  in     the     crowd        trying             to    get       to    the       turnstiles.                  There       was       no    queues

                  and      we    just       got     caught             up    in       the    rush.           There        was       no    Stewards             about

                  b ut     there       was       two        Policmen             on    horses          who     were       trying          to    organise             the
                                                                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                                                                              S3h i

    crowd.          However              they       were       more          in    the       way       than           helping             the       situation.

    When    I was          in       the       crowd          trying          to    get       to       the     turnstiles                      I was          being

    pushed       and       jostled                from       all    sides          and       was       seperated                    from       all       my    mates

    except       Albert.                 I    could          see    people             climbing             up        a    corragated                   fence          at

    the    side       of    the          turnstiles                to    get       out       of       the     crush             and       there          was       a
     io         S
    Policeman          and          Steward             on    the       roof       above          the       turnstile                    who       pulled          some

    people       out       of       the       crowd.           I had          never          been        in       a       crush          like       that
u
    before.           After          ten          minutes          of    this          I got          pushed              into       a    turnstile

    entrance          and       got          through.              The       turnstile                o p e r a t o r had. h i s                   foot       on       the

    opening         device           and          was    just       letting             people           through.                    He       did       not    check

    or    ask    to    see          my       ticket»

    Inside       I was          in a          large          open       space          behind          the        stand.                 There          me    and

    Albert       met       up       with                       Although                there          was     alot             of    people             about

    there       was    no       crush.              From       where          I was          1    could           see          no    entrances                to       the

    terracing          area          and          there       was       no    signs          showing              which             way       to    go.        On

    my    right       was       a    brick          wall       which          had       a    gap       in     it          leading             to    another

    forecourt          but          immediately                in       front          of    rne w a s        a       stairway                leading          to

    the    upper       West          Stand.              On    the       stairway                there        was          one       steward             and       one

    Policewoman.                    1 thought                that       I'd       try       to    get       up        this          stairway             into          the

    upper       stand       to       get          out    of    the       crowds.                 I tried              to       get       up    the       stairs

    but    the      Policewoman                    stopped          me       and       checked           my       ticket.                 On       seeing          it

    was    for      the     terrace                she       sent       me    back          down.           I then              went          to    the       toilet

    with    Albert          and          then       returned             to       the       stairway.                     It    was       then          about          2.

    35pm.        I saw          that          policewoman                and       steward             were           occupied                with       other

    spectators             so       me    and       Albert          went          up    the       stairs              quickly             and       got       passed

    them    without             being             checked.              We    were          then       in     the          Upper          West          Stand

    snd    went       back          of       the    stand          and       sat       on    the       barrier                 there.              We    were

    just    to      the     left             of    the       goal.           the       players           were             on    the       pitch          but       they

    had    not      k i cked         off.

    From    where          I was             I could          see       the       front          of    the        terracing.                       The       match

                                                                                                                                            S561

           kicked       off     and      -after a         couple       of    minutes          I saw    some       people          on    the

           track    around             the    pitch.        I then          some     a Policeman            run    onto       the       pitch

           and    the     match         was    stopped.           I then          looked       down    again       and       saw       people

           c 1 irnbi ng      over       the    fences       at    the       f ront      of    the    terrace       onto       the       pitch.

           I didn't          know       what    was       wrong    but       then       I saw       people    lying          on    the       floor

           being    given          the       kiss    of    life    and       some       supporters          trying       to       pull       down

           the    fences.              I stayed       where       I was       watching          what    was       going       on       and    saw

           ambulances           come         onto    the    pitch       and       people       being    carried          away          on

           hoardings.              I    could       see    that    people          were       dead.     An    announcement                   was

           made    over       the       tannoy       to    say    the       game     was      abandoned       so    I    left          the    ground

           at    3.50pm.           We    made       our    way    back       to    the       cars.     There       everyone             turned

           up    except       Peter.           We    stayed       at    the       cars       until    six    waiting          for       him    to

           turn    up     and      then       went    to    the    Northern             General       Hospital          to    see       if    Peter

           was    there.           Me    all    gave       our    names       and       addresses       for       the    safety             list.

           There    was       no       organisation          there          and    we    couldn't       find       anything             out    so    at

           S.30pm       we    all       came    home.        It    was       not     until      the    next       day    that          I found

           out    that       Peter       had    died.

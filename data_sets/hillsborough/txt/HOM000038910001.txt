         this as.it. being probable, he. did. enter .the, Resuscitation.Room, of the.
         Northern General. Hospital, but a cardiac tracing showed np,cardiac activity

99.___ PHILIP STEELE......
             There is no evidence in the medical record nor any evidence from the post
             mortem findings that Mr. Steele received any resuscitation.                                                                               I think it
             likely that he was triaged                                    as dead.


11?.         ARTHUR          H0RR0CKS
             There is no evidence in the medical record of any resuscitation attempts
             and there is no evidence in the post mortem findings of any resuscitation
             attempts.                  I therefore think it likely that Mr. Horrocks was triaged as
             dead.


In summary, there is definite evidence both from the hospital records and post
mortem reports that six patients received resuscitation attempts.                                                                                    In a further
three patients there us some evidence that the patients may have received some
resuscitation attempts.                                    In four patients there is no evidence of resuscitation
and it is likely that these patients were triaged to the mortuary on arrival
at the Accident and Emergency Department.


I feel it may be helpful to give a brief summary of our experience of traumatic
asphyxia.                  Traumatic asphyxia is a fairly uncommon condition, normally occurring
 in sporadic cases, either in car accidents, or heavy injury.                                                                               There are a
number of well documentedinstances wherelarge numbers of people have died
 in crowds as a result of traumatic asphyxia.                                                            Such events are fortunately
rare.                 The Northern General..Hospital Accident ^d_Emergency Department__

James Wardrope will say as follows



I am a Consultant in charge of the Accident & Emergency

Department at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield.        I

have been a Consultant at the hospital since 1 May 1987;

prior to that I held the post of Senior Registrar at the

Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield.       I qualified in

                       in 19      and my qualifications are




The Accident & Emergency Department is quite a busy one.           It

had 55,000 patients last year, of which 42,000 were new

patients.   In terras of medical staffing, there are seven

Senior House Officers, an Associate Specialist (six sessions

A & E, four sessions Fracture Clinic) and five GP Clinical

Assistant sessions.     I am the first on call, except every

other weekend when one of the Orthopaedic Consultants takes

the on call duty.



Saturday is usually a busy day for the Department, especially

in the afternoon.     On Saturday, 15 April there were two

medical staff, of SHO grade, on duty and I was on call.        I

had been into the Department at 10.00 am on the morning of

the 15th.   The Department was fairly busy.     At about 1.00 pm

I telephoned the Department from home to let them know I was

going to be out for the afternoon as I planned to take my
family to the park.     I ascertained the waiting time in the

Department was two hours, which means it was quite busy.             I

took my wife and children to               .   We were just

returning, and were about 200 yards from our home in

           when my bleep which I had been carrying went off,

I arrived home within about a minute and telephoned the

hospital immediately.    I spoke to Charge Nurse Batty, who

indicated he had been notified of some sort of incident at

Hillsborough and that the hospital was to stand by and to

expect to receive some crush injuries.    He gave no indication

of numbers or that a major incident had been called.        He

indicated that no patients had yet arrived and from the

details he gave me I thought perhaps the hospital would

receive half a dozen or so.    I knew the Department was fairly

busy and I decided I should go in to help out, but I did not

think it was a major emergency.



I immediately left for the hospital in my car.     The time on

the car clock, which is two minutes fast, was 3.25 pm.        The

journey was very quick as the roads were quiet and I arrived

at the hospital at 3.35 pm, according to the car clock.          I

parked my car in the Consultants' car park.     I started

walking towards the Department, but as I approached the

entrance I saw three ambulances and I began to run.     I was

met at the door by Charge Nurse Batty who informed me three

patients were undergoing resuscitation in the Resuscitation

Room which is adjacent to the side entrance.     I asked him

whether he had implemented the Major Disaster Plan and he
replied he had.   It was obvious to me that it was necessary

to implement the Major Disaster Plan.



I went into the Resuscitation Room where there were three

patients undergoing resuscitation.   One was a ten year old

boy who was being attended by the Senior Paediatric House

Officer.   I gather she had been called when the Department

were alerted to expect a paediatric cardiac arrest.       A Senior

House Officer from Rotherham, who had just been passing the

hospital, was resuscitating another patient and one of my

SHOs was working on the third patient.   I could see the staff

were having trouble getting intravenous access on the child

so I assisted with that.



More ambulances arrived almost immediately.   I went to the

front door with Charge Nurse Batty to receive the injured,

almost all of whom were dead or dying.   Some were sent to the

Resuscitation Room and I then went to the Resuscitation Room

myself to intubate with endotracheal tubes.   I cannot now

recall how many patients were in that batch of arrivals.



I then returned to the entrance and stayed there until about

5.00 pm, to triage patients as they arrived, and also to

triage Doctors so that they could be assigned to appropriate
duties.



By about 3.45 pm a lot of staff had arrived in the Department

and the Resuscitation Room was fairly well manned.    I
allocated Doctors to the Resuscitation Room initially, and

then into Ward 60 which had been cleared and which was acting

as the receiving ward.



I realised the Resuscitation Room was becoming very full as

almost all the first lot of casualties required resuscitation

and I therefore sent one of the SHOs, Mr Duncan, to telephone

SYMAS Control and request cases be diverted to the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital.



By this time Medical Records staff had implemented the

tagging system to identify the casualties.     Because of the

volume of patients arriving staff were unable to use the

coloured labels.



At about this time I started sending the dead on arrival

direct to the Plaster Room.   Previously, I had sent the whole

batch of casualties, including dead, into the Resuscitation

Room to attempt resuscitation in view of their age.



Also about this time, I received a request to send a mobile

team to the Hillsborough football ground.     The request came

via                           .   i realised everyone was very

busy and that we could not spare sufficient staff to send a

mobile team immediately and I decided it was more important

to retain the resources within the Department.    However, by

about 4.00 pm the position had eased such that I was able to

despatch two Doctors with an equipment box, in an ambulance,
to the football ground.     The staff who went were

Dr Davidson, SHO, and an Anaesthetic Registrar.       The

Department has a specially prepared box of equipment for just

such an emergency and this had been checked and re-stocked

only two weeks earlier.     As it transpired, when the mobile

team arrived at the ground there were sufficient medical

staff already there and the Doctors were sent back to the

hospital and only the equipment retained.



By about this time I think I was notified the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital were receiving about half the

casualties.



After 4.00 pm the situation became more controlled and less

serious injuries were arriving in the Department.      These were

sent to the Physiotherapy Department which had been cleared

to receive non-urgent casualties requiring minor treatment or

rest or awaiting transport home.    By about 4.30 pm the

Department was becoming much quieter.    I asked Dr R Elson,

Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, and Dr D Edwards, Orthopaedic

Registrar, to attend the non-urgent casualties in the

Physiotherapy Department.



Dr Tim Shaw, Consultant Anaesthetist, was in charge of the

Resuscitation Room.



The last patient I remember receiving arrived at about 4.45

pm.   He had fainted from the exertion of carrying bodies out
of the ground.



At the time I did not know how many patients the Department

had received, although I knew at one point that about sixteen

patients were all undergoing resuscitation.   The Department

is set up for ten resuscitation patients and all the beds
were being used.



The triage area was established near the side entrance to the

A & E Department.   In a major disaster the main entrance is

closed and all casualties are brought into the side entrance

and thus through the triage point.   The Resuscitation Room is

immediately adjacent to the triage area in room 23 and beyond

that rooms 18 (Treatment), 16 (Anteroom), 14 (Plaster Room),

15 (Treatment Room), 57, 58 and 61 (Examination/Treatment

Rooms) and cubicles were used.   Any casualties who did not

require resuscitation were sent to the receiving ward, ward

60, or, if they were minor casualties, to the Physiotherapy

Department.   Only one patient required surgery - a

laporotomy.   Almost all the resuscitation patients required

intensive care and therefore were transferred from the

resuscitation areas to either the General Intensive Treatment

Unit or the Coronary Intensive Care Unit.



In the initial ten minutes the Department was overwhelmed by

the volume of patients requiring resuscitation.   I think this

is due to three factors, namely the speed of extraction of

casualties from the site, the speed of transportation to the
hospital in view of its proximity to the football ground, and

the nature of the injuries.



I do not recall any desperate need of equipment.     I believe

at one time we ran out of oxygen flow meters, but these were

provided very quickly by the Supplies Department.     The

hospital does not have a CT scanner and one of the

ventilated casualties required a CT scan during the

afternoon.    He was transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.    A further two patients were transferred during the

evening and four patients were transferred during the night

to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for CT scans.



By about 5.30 pm the Department was almost clear of

casualties.



Non-urgent casualties were directed to the General and

Maternity Wing Physiotherapy Department.   The dead were

transferred to the mortuary which had been set up temporarily

in the Orthopaedic Plaster Room.   The bodies were later

transferred to the temporary mortuary which was established

at the football ground.



The Major Disaster Plan provides for patients to be labelled

with appropriately coloured labels once they have been triaged,

so that, for example, those requiring immediate resuscitation

should receive a red label, those requiring urgent admission

and surgery should receive a blue label, non-urgent a green
label and dead a white label.     In fact, because of the speed

of arrival of the casualties in the first twenty minutes, it

was impossible for staff to use the coloured labels.        This

did not make any material difference as staff were writing on

to the labels the patients' destination, once triaged.



I only had contact with the families of the patients later in

the evening.   I recall I was in the Control Room when one

woman arrived trying to find her husband and daughter.       I

recall speaking to her and telling her that her husband had

survived but that her daughter was dead.     The families

appeared to be well marshalled on Level C, which is the floor

below the A & E Department.     I was not too conscious of the

presence of the press and media.     I think there were some

press outside the A & E Department but they seemed to keep

well back from the arrival area.     By the following morning I

was able to calculate that ninety-three patients had been

through the Department, of whom fifty-five were admissions,

twenty-seven discharges and twelve dead.     Of the admissions

fifteen were in intensive care, although by the following

morning (Monday) that figure had dropped to eleven.     Seven

patients had been transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.



The type of injury sustained by the casualties - traumatic

asphyxia - is fairly uncommon.     In the two years I have worked

at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital I have seen only one such

case.   The most common cause of this type of crush injury is
from a car falling on top of someone who is working beneath

it.   The Department had approximately twenty—five to thirty

traumatic asphyxia cases in the space of an hour and I

believe handled the incident extremely well.

 I realised the Resuscitation Room was becoming very full as

almost all the first lot of casualties required resuscitation.

 I therefore requested the Ambulance Liaison Officer to divert

cases to the Hallamshire.     I believe that Mr Duncan, Senior

Registrar in Surgery, also telephoned SYMAS at that time with

the same request.



By this time Medical Records staff had implemented the

tagging system to identify the casualties.     Because of the

volume of patients arriving staff were unable to use the

coloured labels.



At about this time I started sending patients arriving with

no cardiac output direct to the Plaster Room (mortuary).     Up

to that point patients with no cardiac output who were having

active cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the ambulance were sent

to the Resuscitation Room to continue resuscitation, in view of

their age and the nature of the injury.



Also about this time I received a request to send a mobile

team to the Hillsborough football ground.     The request came

to me by word of mouth but I believe that the call originated

over the direct line to the Accident & Emergency Department

from SYMAS Headquarters.     At that time there was a large number

of seriously ill patients in the Department with not sufficient

medical staff.     However, very quickly more staff arrived and I

was able to despatch two Doctors with the Major Accident

Equipment Boxes.     The staff who went were Dr Davidson, Senior

House Officer, and an Anaesthetic Senior House Officer.     The
Department has specially prepared boxes of equipment for just

such an emergency and this had been checked and re-stocked

appeared to be well marshalled on Level C, which is the floor

below the A & E Department.      I was not too conscious of the

presence of the press and media.      I think there were some

press outside the A & E Department but they seemed to keep

well back from the arrival area.     By the following morning I

was able to calculate that eighty-eight patients had been

through the Department from Hillsborough.     Fifty—five of these

were admissions, twenty-one were discharged to home after

treatment and twelve patients were dead.     During the time of

the alert, the Department also dealt with five other patients

who were not from Hillsborough.     Of the admissions, fifteen

were admitted to Intensive Care and two further ventilated

patients were transferred to the Hallamshire Hospital.       Later

that evening a further five patients were transferred to the

Hallamshire Hospital for CT scanning.



The type of injury sustained by the casualties - traumatic

asphyxia - is fairly uncommon.     In the two years I have worked

at the Northern General Hospital I have only seen one such

case.   The most common cause of this type of injury is a car

falling on top of someone working beneath it, or from heavy

industry.   The Northern General Hospital treated twenty-five

cases of severe traumatic asphyxia in the space of one hour and

I believe it handled the incident extremely well.

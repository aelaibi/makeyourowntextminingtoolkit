             Dear Mr Turney

             SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS

              le County Surveyors' Society has, for some years, maintained a group
             which works on the problems coming out from the application of legislation
             relating to the safety of sports grounds. The group tends to be
             orientated around engineering matters and deals with safety barriers,
             fencing, entrance and exit arrangements and other practical features.

             The group was re-constituted about two years ago and is now composed of
             personnel from a limited number of Authorities. The meetings of the group
             have been spasmodic, basically on an annual footing. Could I make it clear
             that this group represents the English and Welsh counties as well as the
             Scottish regions.

             Concern has been expressed repeatedly regarding the manner in which Author­
             ities respond to legislation. Where it is recognised that the majority of
             Authorities no doubt are dealing with the statutory requirements in an
             efficient and workmanlike way, nevertheless, in view of the disasters
             which have occurred, it was felt that some basic rules of procedure could
             be suggested to Authorities for their consideration. The concept behind
             these rules is to try and ensure that the appropriate people accept
             responsibility for the requirements and that the Authorities and public
             are kept fully informed as to progress on these matters.

             Rules of procedure along this basis were produced recently and submitted
             to the County Surveyors' Society Committee No. 3, and at the meeting of
             that group held on 24 April 1989, it was suggested that consultation
             should take place on the nature of the rules of procedure and how we
             progress this through the Local Government associations. In response to
             this, I agreed to inform you as to what was happening and also to send you
             a copy of our draft rules of procedure for consideration.

             In addition to this, it has been suggested that the current National Com­
             mittee dealing with this should be extended to the provision of four
             Regional groups which would report Regional matters to this National group
             in the future.

             This/

This follows a questionnaire sent out by one of our members, where the
response indicated there would be a good deal of support for Regional
groupings held in Scotland, the Midlands and in two other appropriate
locations.

It appears to me that there are many bodies dealing with safety of sports
grounds, both Local Authority and private. Whilst I feel strongly that
the group that I chair has a worthwhile role to perform and that the rules
of procedure and new constitution suggested are worth pursuing, I would
still like to be given the assurance that there is no duplication of our
efforts and that the procedures are being co-ordinated. For example,
should our rules of procedure be agreed by the Police and Fire Authorities
before progression through the Local Authority groups? This may well be
the case.

With the advent of Hillsborough and the public enquiry into it, it may be
  opportune at this stage to make final decisions on these matters, but I

•  anxious to progress the issue without undue delay. Perhaps you could
  give me your advice as to the way forward in terms of the matters put to
you in this letter, so that we can have guidance on how you see the
picture developing, particularly following the Hillsborough disaster.


Yours sincerely
RULES OF PROCEDURE
SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS


1.   PREAMBLE

     These Rules of Procedure are not intended to reiterate the legal require­
     ments in relation to Sports Grounds but for ready reference purposes the
     legislation currently in force is listed in the Appendix.

2.   DELEGATION

     There has been a tendency to delegate execution of the requirements
     relating to Sports Grounds to a variety of staff in an organisation, to
     consultants and to others. The legislation clearly requires that an
     Authority   be responsible for the actions which occur, and although    dele­
     gation is   permissible, it should be duly documented and in noway
     removes the Authority from its ultimate responsibility.

^    RESPONSIBILITY

     The appropriate officers of the Local Authority who are the Directors
     or Chief Officials concerned should personally be constantly vigilant
     as to the way in which the matter is being progressed. The employment
     of consultants to do the work is permissible but it is the job of the
     professional officers to ensure that any such consultants who are
     appointed   have the necessary appropriate expertise to achieve what is
     required and the choice of consultant will be regarded as an example
     of the vigilance which must be pursued by the Chief Officer in the
     execution of his responsibilities within the terms of the legislation.
     Where an Authority uses its own staff in the enforcement of the
     legislation (and this is a requirement under certain parts of the
     rules), there should always be full backing by the Chief Officer for
     the action suggested.

k.   REPORTING

     It is strongly recommended that Authorities should produce an annual
     report signed by the relevant Chief Officers' indicating the action
     taken to safeguard the position of Sports Grounds within legislation
     and the work which is being done by both Sports Ground owners and the
     Auth ority in pursuance of the rules. This report should also detail
     certificates which have been made for the various aspects of control,
     including temporary and permanent requirements. The report will be
     open to the public and would, therefore, alert the public to the way
     in which the Authority is tackling its problems and give political
     support to the measures undertaken. In the absence of this report,
     then the Authority should have, within its system, records which can
     be produced to establish that the legislation has been enforced and
     these records must be capable of being interrogated to determine how
     the rules have been pursued by the Authority and by which officers.
     However, the production of the report or the records is only a paper
     exercise and should not be regarded as being the only requirement,
     since the constant pursuit of safety is of paramount importance in
     this exercise.

    5.    FEES

          Charging policy is a matter for local decision which in some cases may
          be determined by Elected Members and in other cases by Chief Officers
          to whom delegated powers have been granted. It should, however, be
          borne in mind that Authorities may only determine a fee to be charged
          in respect of an application for the issue, amendment, replacement or
          transfer of a safety certificate and that such a fee shall not exceed
          an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done by or
          on behalf of an Authority in respect of any application. It is also
          not intended, within the spirit of the Act, that a new Safety Certif­
          icate be issued annually by an Authority as a means of trying to
          recover its annual monitoring and mandatory inspection costs. In
          dealing with recovery of all legitimate costs under the Act, it has in
          the past been the policy of some Authorities to seek reimbursement for
          all such work whilst others have charged only a nominal fee to enable
          more Club finance to be diverted to ground improvements.

    ^     It is recommended that teams of appropriate officers meet at regular
          intervals to review aspects of this topic and come to collective
          decisions. These decisions should be imparted to the Secretary of the
          local Clubs. Where the matter is purely one of professional interest,
          it would be imparted through that professional officer to the Club in
          question.

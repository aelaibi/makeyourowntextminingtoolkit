  Dear Sir,

              PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


           This Council set up a working party to prepare comments for the
  Public Inquiry which has been concerned with spectators attending football
  matches.

           I attach a copy of the working party's observations which it
  wishes to be formally submitted to the Public Inquiry          ^ xa&



              Yours sincerely,

OF THE PUBLIC ENQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

That      alt hou qh   this Council possesses no soccer            stadia   within    its
o oLincJ3 r iss    that commands regular attendance figures comparable               with
that      of    Hi 1Isborough, we recognise that the sport            remains   a major
spectator        a ttraction and that many of the people living "and working
within       this borough      regul a r 1y a t t e n d such fixtures   and   enjoy 'Ihe
atffiosphar e created       by   standing on the '"terraces,          alongside   fellow
supporters, watching the game of football.                  We are'Jancerned that     itee
opportunity for people to c o n t i n u e "to be "able to attend'' the game
exist, but t hat every possible safety lisson is 'learnt from the t^age-
dy in Shef f ield.       While this Council recognises that the dee isic#i:s''
crowd      contr ol and crowd safety to -be taken upon the day are
to     the part icular stadia and fixture, y*e feel that -fc'hSre are            several"

That alcoholic drink on c oa c h e s and t r ai ns t r an s p o r t i n g s u pp o r t e r s ‘to

4.    P UB L I C F A C I L I T I E S W I T H I N S T A D I A

(a) The Working Party c al ls upon the Football A s s o c i a t i o n to r e c o gn i se
the      need     for   the proper p ro vi s io n      of  faci li ti es    with in     football
grounds.         T h e sport g e n e r a t e s a large income t hr ough       g at e   receipts,
media        coverage, the p o ol s p r o m o t e r s etc., yet still       a    comparatively
small        amount    of  this      income is injected       back      into     t he   g am e      in
p r o v id i ng f ac ilities for its customers.           The s ta n da r d of a c co m m o d a t i o n
and of r ef reshment and toilet faci li ti es in most g ro u nd s r e ma i ns poor*#
The      comfort and safety of s u pp o r t e r s s ho ul d be of p r i m a r y       imp or ta nc e
and not be t r e a t e d as a s ec on da ry or trivial matter;

(b> However, care must be e xe rc is ed in the siting of t he se       f ac ilities
so   that they are not located w he re a c o n g r e g a t i o n of people     would
hamper the free movement of p e rs o n s a ro un d the stadia; and

Cc) That football clubs should be e n c ou r ag e d to s ta ge p r e - ma t ch e n t e r ­
tainment.       Together      with the p r o v i si o n of   proper   facilities,     this

their     dress, be instantly r e c o g n i s a b l e to m e m b e r s of the   public    and
the a u t h o r i t i e s alike.

6.       M E A N S OF E S C A P E


(a)   That ade qu at e m e an s of e scape must be e ns ured from all          p ar ts   of
the s tadia and be included within the a p pr ov ed a r r a n g e m e n t s under       the
General Safety C e r t i f i c a t e (where applicable).  Such a r r a n g e m e n t s must

that the public are on the premises.

7.       PERIMETER FENCING

(a) P erimeter fencing should be r em ov ed i m me di at el y for it  encouraged
the   perception  of  the   "fan’ as an        'animal'.     Problems  of  p it ch
invasion are part of a men ta li ty a ss oc i a t e d with football which  n ee ds

(c) If there is to be s e g r e g at io n of s u p p o r t e r s upon the t e r r a ci n g         it

with         no m ea ns of a cc es s into a d j o in i ng sections.         R eg ular   gateways
must         be pro vi de d within the fencing and these s ho ul d b e              staf fe d      by
s te wa r d s   at       all times that the public are upon            t h e premises.           All

Dear Mr Jones

 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

Thank you for your letter of 24 November with

grounds.

We would, of course, be pleased to receive a

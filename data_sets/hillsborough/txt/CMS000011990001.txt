HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER ^jJL

I spoke to Douglas Hurd's Political Adviser this morning about the
                                                                                   A
Football Spectators Bill.    He informed me that the Home Office
view was that they were in the lead in discussions with the
football authorities about replacing terraces with all seated
accommodation. Naturally they will be consulting closely with the
Department about these negotiations. Apparently Clive Whitmore,
the Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, will be contacting Sir
Terence imminently to tell him of this.

I raised with him three other matters. First, whether it would be
sensible to raise in discussions with the football authorities the
question of reducing capacity in terraced areas immediately. He
indicated that the Home Office was likely to be sympathetic to
this point of view.   Mr Kinghan records that the
authorities haven't even considered this point.

Second, I stressed to him the need to ensure that tne Government
should consider putting in evidence to the enquiry in some shape
or form which contained positive material about the Football
Membership Scheme.   In particular I suggested that Lord Justice
Taylor should be encouraged to see the GEC presentation on their
technology. Since he will be getting a lot of evidence from other
sources that the Membership Scheme would delay entry through the
turnstiles, it is very important that he should see for himself
that this would not in fact be the case. He agreed this should be
considered.

Finally, I brought him up to date with our view that a delay on
the Bill was needed to allow things to cool off and that no
commitment should be given on timing of Lords Third Reading or
Commons Second Reading.    Home Office Ministers strongly concur
with this.   I mentioned that small groups of backbenchers might
need to be called in in due course to persuade them of the merits
of the Bill and that we would need to consider which Ministers
should see whom.

No doubt points      two   and    three   will   crop   up   in   Cabinet   this
Thursday.

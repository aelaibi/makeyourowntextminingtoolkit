  Thank you for attending the meeting here the other day.

  I attach a note of your discussion with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. Please let me know if you
| are content with it or, if not, what changes you think I should make.

  Please see especially paragraph 10 (and 20).   We would of course be happy to hear from you
  about this over the phone if you prefer.

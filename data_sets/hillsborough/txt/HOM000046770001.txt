                                                                                          3rd Sept 1997.




                      Dear Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

                      Thank you for your letter of the 16th July 1997.

                      I lost my 15 year old son Kevin Daniel Williams at the Hillsborough disaster, I
                      am realy pleased that the Rt Hon Jack Straw has asked you to look into any
                      evidence that was not available to Lord Taylor's Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to
                      the prosecuting or poiice disciplinary authorities.

                      Mini - Inquests had been held in the cases of all the victims in April and May
                      1990, for the purpose of presenting allegedly non-controversia! evidence as to
                      the circumstances of individual deaths. This evidence was presented only as
                      summaries by investigating Police officers from the W est Midland Police force.



                       In the case of Kevin two Inquests were held one on the 2nd May 1990 and one
                       on the 4th May 1990. The evidence presented at the Mini-Inquests was
                       bizarre. On the 2nd May 1990, the statement dated 27th April 1989 of P C.
                       Bruder, an off duty Merseyside Police Officer, was summarised. The
                       summary omitted the evidence in relation to vomiting the pulse and an
                       ambulance that Mr Bruder said passed him at 3.37.pm while he was tending
                       Kevin.                                                          , ., _ .
                       The evidence of Special Constable Debra Martin of the South Yorkshire Police
                       was summarised, inciuding the assertion tha at 4 .pm. Kevin opened his eyes
                        said "Mum’' and died.


                        On the 3rd May 1990 P C. Bruder was visited at his home by [                           l of
                        the W est Midland Police, a new statement was signed by P C Bruder
                        retracting his                                             -------------------,
                        first statement, while P C. Bruder was being interviewed by________           Pr
                        Slater who carried out the autopsy on my son rang Mr Bruder up to discuss
                        Kevin's injuries. Later that day I was also visited by             of the West
AMSTRAD   F / 7 9 0 0 m'T                                                  26   M a r,   34   0 ^ :0 1   P . 00 d




               Midland Police, he came to tell us that P. C. Bruder has now changed his
               statement a year after he had made his first statement.                   aiso told
               us that they were holding another Inquest on Kevin the next day 4th May
               1990, I told him I could not go all the way back to Sheffield I was to ill,
                          old me not to worry it was mainly medical evidence that would be
               heard I asked                 about the Police lady saying Kevin had called
               "Mum" at 4pm mat areaaTui day,                   [told me that Miss Martin was
               only young she had not been in the Police force very long and that it was body
               wind she had heard.



               On the 4th May 1990 at Kevin's second Mini- Inquest the retracted statement
               was summarised, and Dr Slater was recalled to say that death must have
               occurred before Miss Martin tended Kevin. Doctor Slater was caHed again to
               say that the twitching spoken of by P.C. Bruder in his new statement was
               possible after death, in spite of the severity of the asphyxia.



              There was so much confusion in Kevin's case that I needed to see the
              statements of the two Police officers, i was shocked when I read them, there
              first statements made within weeks of the disaster say that Kevin was alive up
              to 4pm tha* day, there second statements made a year after the disaster, all
              the signs of life had been changed.



              I then tracked down P C. Bruder and S W .P .C Martin and had meetings with
              then, i was even more shocked to hear that they had both been put under
              considerable pressure by the W est Midland Police to change there
              statements. Both Police officers are sticking to their original statements and
              both officers say Kevin was alive while they were tending him.



              My memorial went to the Attorney General in April 1992. It showed that Bruder
              and Martin had been induced to change their evidence. They adhere to their
              original accounts that Kevin was alive long after 3.15. pm Neither has ever
              been called to give evidence, but each has been presented to the Coroners
              Court as wrong-headed and feeble.



             I was refused a new Inquest so then I went for a Judicial Review with new
             evidence, On the 5 th November 1993 again I was refused a new Inquest on
             Kevin.



             i have spent hours disscusing Kevin's injuries with two forensic Pathologist Dr
             James. Burns M.D. F R C Path of the Department of forensic Pathology at the
             University of Liverpool. Also Dr lain West, M B.ChB ,F,R,C. path.,D.M.J.
             Department of Forensic Medicine Guy,s Hospital London. Both pathologist
             are of the same opinion of how Kevin would have died, his injuries were by no
-.f I S f f P w D ? ' 7 S O 0 h T                                                26   M ar   94   0 '£ : 0 ^   P . 004




                    means fatal, with the right care and attention he could have been saved. Kevin
                    did not die from Traumatic asphyxia.


                    In June 1994 Roger Cook ran a programme about Kevin's case, Roger Cook
                    also found Mr Tony Edwards who was the asssistant to the driver of the
                    ambulance that came on the ground at 3.35.pm In Mr Bruders first statement
                    he mentions a ambulance that passed him at 3.37.pm while he was tending to
                    Kevin, he asked a St Johns ambulance man to stop it as he wanted to put
                    Kevin in it, it would not stop, the W est Midland Police told Mr Bruder that the
                    only ambulance on the ground at that time was exiting full thats why it would
                    not stop for Kevin


                     I also found the ambulance on video compiled by the W est Midland Police
                     entering the ground at the penmstone Lane end at 3.35.pm.
                     Lord Justice Taylor did not know about Mr Edwards ambulance.



                     Tony Edwards asserts that he was interviewed by W est Midland Police in
                     some detail but was never called to give evidence. He made it quite clear that
                     a secound ambulance was involved and appears on video yet W est Midland
                     never pressented the court with this information or apprised the court of the
                     existence of tony Edwards or the relevance of his evidence. This amounts to
                     deliberate concealment and a suppression of evidence.



                     On the Cook Report Dr Popper admitted that there was difficulty with Mr
                     bruders evidence with regard to the timing of the ambulance, he said he was
                     worried because if he was in errer if you like on the ambulance he might have
                     been in error on other things Mr Edwards ambulance was suppressed at
                      Kevin’s Inquest.


                      I also found two of the carriers that carried Kevin across the pitch on an
                      advertising board,                   3nd Mr Tony O'Keefe, both say Kevin was
                      alive.

                                        i hitherto untraced spectator who saw Mr Bruder give first aid
                      to Kevin, has been located and has made a statement. The statement offers
                      still further support to the evidence of P C Bruder and the ambulance.



                      After the Cook Report Sir Malcalm Thornton m.p. took Kevin’s case for a
                      parliamentary debate. (26th October 1994.) I attended the debate because I
                      felt that what Sir Malcolm Thornton had to say was the truth of what happened
                      to Kevin. This is recorded for all time in the Hansard Most importantly the
                      3.15. pm.
                      cut off time does NOT relate to Kevin as the evidence clearly shows.
                                                                                                                      1

                ! then submitted another memorial to the Attorney General under section 13 of
                the coroners a c t , again I was refused my Inquest on Kevin.


                Please Mr Justice Stuart-Smith will you look at the evidence that my solicitor
                and I will put to you ; and send it to the Attorney General under section 13 of
                the coroners act, so I can have a new Inquest on my son. Then I will be able
                to rest and put poor Kevin to rest.

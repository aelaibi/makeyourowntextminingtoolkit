HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


I refer to the evidence you submitted for Part II of the Inquiry
on the wider issues of crowd control and safety at sports
grounds.

Lord Justice Taylor has read these submissions and would like
further information on the following points:-

i.    On page 15 (xii) you refer to the computerised entry system
      installed by Plymouth at their ground which you say "proved
      so impractical and problem ridden that it was scrapped." I
      should be grateful if you could give further details about
      the events which led you to make this statement.

ii.   In the same paragraph, you refer to the 100% membership
      scheme introduced by Colchester and say that their gates
      fell by 50% and that the lost supporters have not returned.
      Again, it would be helpful if you would give further details
      with specific information where possible.

It is also said that, at home matches, Arsenal can have 1000
supporters from Scandinavia. Have you any further information
about this?

I look forward to your reply as soon as possible.

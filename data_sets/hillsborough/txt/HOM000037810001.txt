HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY: DISCLOSURE OF MATERIAL

I would be grateful for your advice on whether certain material considered by Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith in the course of his scrutiny of evidence about the Hillsborough
Disaster attracts legal privilege.

2.     When the Home Secretary announced the outcome of the scrutiny on 18
February, he indicated that he would release as much of the material considered in the
scrutiny as possible by placing copies in the House of Commons Library. We are
currently in the process of writing to those whom Lord Justice Stuart-Smith consulted
to seek their consent to disclosure.

3.     Among those we have yet to approach are:

       The Hon Mr Justice Collins (Counsel for the Taylor inquiry)

       Her Honour Judge Elizabeth Steel* (Chairman of the Hillsborough Solicitors’
       Group Steering Committee)

       Mr Benet Hytner QC (Counsel for the bereaved and injured at the Taylor
       Inquiry)

       Mr Peter Whitehurst (Treasury Solicitor Team for the Taylor Inquiry)

       Mr Douglas Fraser (Member of the Hillsborough Solicitors’ Group Steering
       Committee)

       Mr Peter Metcalf (of Hammond Suddard Solicitors, acting for the South
       Yorkshire Police following the Hillsborough disaster).

4.     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith consulted them because of their positions during the
Taylor Inquiry and Inquests. Copies of their letters are attached behind. Before we
approach them, though, it would be helpful to have your advice on whether this
material should be excluded from that being released on the basis that it is privileged
material. An early reply would be appreciateJ

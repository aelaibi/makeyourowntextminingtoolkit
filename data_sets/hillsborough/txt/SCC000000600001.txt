            Rogan Taylor to discuss mutual issues

            conjunction with the football supporters association

            Wednesday to discuss stewards' concerns

*          arranged a visit to Liverpool in September to talk with
            Liverpool supporters

The committee is now in the process of finding a solicitor to represent
stewards interests in getting compensation.

If there is enough interest from all West Stand stewards, we would be
willing to organise a meeting with the solicitor,             [from
Bradfomj in the near future. The meeting would be in Sheffield and if

Notes from the meeting held on 31st July 1989
between the West Stand Steward's committee and
Mr. Mckrell and Mr. Locke of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club at Hillsborough Ground



______________ from Family and Community Services outlined the background
to why the meeting had been called. It was agreed that he should chair the
meeting.

___________of the Steward's Committee then introduced the main concerns of
the West Stand Stewards, emphasising the need for closer communication and
liaison between the club, the stewards and the police.

Graham Mckrell responded by explaining that the intention of the club was
to recruit more stewards to work in the West Stand and that all would be
issued with clear written instruction before games. He also .stated that
the terraces would not be used duringthe impending season. Pens 1 and 2 at
most would be open this season.

He promised to look at installing an emergency telephone in the stand for
emergencies and stated that proper briefings of ground staff would be introduced
before matches. These would be for up to groups of 40 - 50 personnel. At
the end of each meeting a de-briefing    would also be      held to givean apportunity
for stewards to raise any issue of concern. Notes would be taken from the
de-briefing meetings and followed up with appropriate action.

He stated that more stewards would be recruited in agreement with the South
Yorkshire Police who feel that they (i.e the police) have in the past taken
on some of the work that should according to the green guide not be their areas
of concern. Stewards would in the future be responsible for manning perimeter
gates and the concourse with only some police presence.

A question was asked by the stewards about police presence on gangways.
Graham Mckrell stated that these would be predominatly clear of the police.
The police would also have to give their number to stewards if requested
and they should not request stewards to leave their point of duty without
a very valid reason.

Crowd control would in the future be through turnstiles A to G into
designated areas only. Liaison with the police will be more formalised in the
future, including the briefing meetings prior to matches, he stated all
personnel would have much clearer role in the future.

Graham Mckrell felt that one of the problems during the ill-fated 15th April
match had been the deployment of experienced police officers in crowd control
outside the ground rather than within.

A question about training of stewards was asked. Graham Mckrell stated that
in future training evenings/events including first aid training would be
organised. St. John's Ambulance Brigade have agreed to co-operate and the cost
of training will be covered by the club. This training will not be a requirement
to stewarding but anyone wishing to attend will be welcomed to do so.
A question was asked about checking attendance records of stewards.
Graham Mckrell replied that the club would expect greater commitments
than in the past from all stewards. They would be expected to turn up
at all general training evenings and their attendance would also be
monitored by the club, not just stewarding attendance at matches.

What if people turned up casually on the day of the match wanting to
steward, it was asked. Graham Mckrell and Mr. Locke stated that they
would not be accepted unless they could prove previous experience of
stewarding, and in any case more people had already ..applied to do
stewarding than had indicated would not continue..Training would be
organised for all.

Would it be possible to establish an apprenticeship scheme for new stewards
Graham Mckrell replied that he would rather overstaff to ensure that
experience staff was available at the ground including e.g. contingency
gate personnel. He also stated that attendance record sheets would be
compiled into a register which can be monitored both by club and the
City Council.

A question was asked about the lack of availability of programmes at _ l ; * . 1:
strategic points. Mr. Locke explained that the supply of programmes
was in f’atio of 1:4 in relation to spectators. The club is currently
looking at making available a sales kiosk on the concourse and will £e
looked at in more detail when the ground organisation is finalised, a
site near the now closed tunnel might be likely. Generally matters will
be improved and the club does not want to go back to what was the practice
before.

It was asked whether a colour coded map of the ground could be made
available to stewards, as is the practice e.g. in Wembley. Graham Mckrell
thought this would be an excellent idea and that in fact there were maps
ready for use.

A question of stewards pay level was raised and Graham Mckrell said that
he heard what was being said and would look at the issue. In return for
commitment and punctuality he also promised better organisation in the future.

Would it   be possible to have regular, say monthly meetings with the West Stand
Stewards   ? Graham Mckrell replied that he did not wish to create an elite
group of   stewards but would nevertheless ensure that there would be more
frequent   meetings.

Why had the first Liverpool match been scheduled for a dark winter night in
November ? Graham Mckrell and Mr. Locke explained that the police had
requested this as generally fewer away supporters were likely to turn up on
a winter weekday night. Mr. Locke also stated that he would try generally
to visit the west stand more frequently during the matches in futrue.

A question was asked about the clubs insurance cover for stewards. Graham
Mckrell stated that the current insurance covered public liability including
first aid administration. He would be wiliing to make a specimen copy of the
policy available to the stewards.
                                   3

He also stated that a phone line had now been installed for St. John's
Ambulance and promised to look at the possibility of installing a lints
line for ground staff use at the snack bar end.

Would it be possible to have a store room for stewards vaulable and
other belongings ? Graham Mckrell promised to look into the matter.

Would it be possible to visit the stand prior to matches starting ?
Graham Mckrell stated that this could be done on the training nights to
see how stewards will react. He also stated that the broken and twisted
fencing had now been removed or repaired.

Geoff wilkinson then gave a brief outline ofstewards contact    with and
planned visit to Liverpool Supporters Association.

Graham Mckrell asked what the stewards felt about having away stewards
attending matches. All agreed that this was a very good idea and in fact
had proven useful during the 15th April match.

A question was asked on what would happen if lots of ticketless fafts
turned up at a match. Graham Mckrell replied that pen 7 could be used as a
contingency area. Ticket prices to the West Stand have also been reduced
and concessions have been introduced to OAP and Children. The club will
also take adverts in Liverpool papers asking people not to turn up without
tickets.

Could access to reporters be restricted. Graham Mckrell said this would be
difficult, accreditations are only given by the club to journalists for
the press box in any case, but a ban on news cameras may have to be
introduced.

Graham Mckrell was asked to clarify Ms.            [s role. He explained
that she was one of the those in command with himself and Mr. Locke. Her
title is admin manager and she is involved with all turnstile administration
with occasional powers to instruct stewards.

It was asked if light refreshments could be made available to stewards during
matches. Graham Mckrell promises to look into the matter. He also stated that
car park 2 had now been sold by the company the land belonged to and could,
therefore no longer be used.

The meeting was then closed with thanks to everyone involved.

Dear Miss




I thank you for your letter of 21st July and would refer to our
subsequent telephone conversation.     We would have no objection
whatsoever to your stewards attending on 11th September and I look
forward to meeting you on that date.     I would point out that the
meeting starts at 8.00 p.m. and is in the Bradford Hotel, Tithebarn
Street, rather than the Bedford Hotel.     I attach herewith a street
map which I hope will assist you.


If you have any difficulties my phone numbers     are
051-227-3151 (work) and                 (home).


Yours sincerely

 Dear Sir

                                       ^              HILLSBOROUGH


           After the stewards employed by Sheffield Wednesday Football
 Club at the West Stand and terrace end of the ground had given
 evidence to his Lordship's Inquiry, they requested to meet with
 our clients, the Football Supporters Association, to discuss the
 question of stewarding generally with particular reference to
 Hillsborough.                Since that meeting the stewards have formed
 themselves into a Committee and have intimated to our clients that
 the stewards will be seeking to join our client's organisation and
 liaise with the South Yorkshire Branch of our client's
 organisation on future matters relating to their role at Sheffield
 Wednesday.                       £


           However, the stewards' Committee has, in the meantime, drawn
 up a submission of its own which it would wish to submit to his
 Lordship through the auspices of our client.                                         Accordingly, we
 enclose herewith 3 copies of the submission that has been sent to
us and we should be grateful if you could place it before the
tribunal for their consideration.


           Whilst we appreciate that saany of the matter raised in the
submission may be pertinent to Part 2 of his Lordship's Inquiry,
 it may well be that some of the points ought to be considered
prior to an interim report being made by the Inquiry in the event
that his Lordship feels that any of _the submissions can be taken

        We are sending a copy of this letter and the submission to

setting aside; any question of potential conflict of interest
between our clients and the stewards in so far as the event on the
day may be concerned.

 Dear

 You are probably by now aware that the West Stand stewards have formed a
 conEmttee to represent your interests following the Hillsborough Disaster.

 So far the committee have:

 *              met with the football supporters association representative,
                Rogan Taylor to discuss mutual issues

 *             written and submitted a report to the Taylor Inquiry in
                conjunction with the football supporters association

 *             arranged a meeting between the committee and Sheffield
                Wednesday to discuss stewards' concerns

*              arranged a visit to Liverpool in September to talk with
                Liverpool supporters

The caamittee is now in the process of finding a solicitor to represent
stewards interests in getting compensation.

If        is enough interest from all West Stand stewards, we would be
willirg to organise a meeting with the solicitor,              from
Bradfssrl in the near future. The meeting would be in Sheffield and if
you radicate interest, we shall notify you of the time and date.

Could j d u please return the attached slip in the enclosed stamped
addressed envelope as soon as possible.

If yoa have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact me, Leena
Jones o n 7 3 4 8 8 2 or Albert Marsh on

Dear Mr

I am writing to you on behalf of the Hillsborough West Stand (Leppings
Lane) Stewards Committee.

We recantly met with Rogan Taylor and he suggested that we contact you
to fini out whether it would be possible for the Committee to attend one
of yoar supporters meetings to discuss issues of mutual concern.

We wouUd, if possible, like to attend your September meeting, which we
understand will be on Monday 11th, at 8 pm in the Bedford Hotel.

Could t o u please let me know whether this is possible, there would be
about £ dozen people and then we could make the necessary travel
arrangements.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH WEST STAND STEWARDS AND THE RESIDENTS MEETING

We have continued to meet and have now managed to get a date for a get-together
with McKnell and Locke*

This will be on Monday 31 July at 7 pa at the ground, with a 6 pa pre­
meeting at the Crown pub on Penlstone Road (near Owlerton Stadium). We
shall be using the Inquiry submission as an agenda for the meeting*

In your absence I have kept in touch w i t h b u t since then the
stewards have also asked for social worker presence at the first few
games of the new season at the ground.

I have also had a chat wi t h ____________ , your newest team member about
the stewards - I know him from before and we are also near neighbours,
so he will probably raise with you a few of the Issues we have discussed
and he has some very good ideas himself.

We have fixed and advertised a public meeting for the nearby residents on
2 August and I think we need to have a chat about that quite urgently.
So, when you have recovered from your hopefully excellent holiday, could
you please give me a ring?

Ifyou have been injured as a result of a crime of violence, you can apply to
the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board for payment of compensation.
The Board will decide whether they can make you an award under the
terms of the Crirninal Injuries Compensation Scheme. The members of the
Board are all very senior, experienced lawyers.

You can apply for compensation if you were injured -

• As a result of a crime of violence (which can include arson or poisoning).
• When you were trying to stop someone from committing a crime.
  When you were trying to apprehend a suspect after a crime.
• When yoy were trying to help the police apprehend someone.
You can also apply for compensation if you are the widow or widower of
someone who died from criminal injuries or who was injured but died from
some other cause. A parent of an unmarried victim who was under 18
years of age may apply too. O ther close relatives and dependants may also
have a claim.
If you are not a relative or dependant of the victim but you paid towards the
funeral, you can claim reasonable expenses.
You can apply for compensation even if the injuries were caused by
someone who could not be held responsible under the criminal law, for
example because they were too young or were insane.
You can also apply even if the person who committed the crime is not
known o r has not been brought to justice.
You must apply within three years of the date you were injured. The Board
will not make an exception to this rule unless there are very special
circumstances.
Do not delay in making application to the Board because from time to
time the lower limit of compensation is increased.




The Board cannot pay compensation for all injuries.
These are some of the conditions;
 •T he injury must be serious enough for them to award a compensation
  payment of at least £550. The Board awards what a court would award
  for the same injuries.

 •Injuries caused by traffic accidents are not covered.

 •You should have reported the incident to the police without delay, and
  helped them in bringing the offender to justice.
* You must be able to convince the Board that you were not responsible in
  any way for the incident in which you were injured. Otherwise the Board
  may decide that they cannot make a full award, or any award at all. The
  Board may also take into account your character and way of life.


Some of the conditions are different if you and the person who injured you
were living together as members of the same family. (A man and a woman
living together as husband and wife, even if they are not married, are
members of the same family.)


* The person who injured you must have been prosecuted (unless there are
  good reasons why this cannot be done).
* You and the person who injured you must have stopped living together.
  (This condition does not apply if it was a child who was injured.)




If you wish to apply for compensation, write to the Board for an application
form as soon as possible after the incident in which you were injured; the
address is shown on the back page of this leaflet.
The Board have a duty to check the information you give. You will have to
sign a section at the end of the form which gives the Board permission to
write to the police, your doctor, your employer or other persons to
confirm what you have said about your injuries and loss of earnings. All
these enquiries are dealt with in strict confidence.
One of the Board members will decide whether your case is covered by
the Scheme, and, if it is, how much compensation you should be awarded.
You will be informed of the decision. If you are not satisfied with the
decision, you can ask for a hearing.
At a hearing, three other members of the Board look at the case afresh.
They may decide to make an award even if the Board member who looked
at the case earlier did not do so. O r they may reject your application
although an award was made earlier. O r they may increase or reduce the
award.
Hearings are held in private and are as informal as possible. You have to
provide whatever evidence is necessary, and arrange for any witnesses you
want to call to be present. The Board will give what help it can, if you ask.
You can bring a friend or legal adviser to help, but the Board will not pay
legal costs. You may be able to claim reasonable expenses for yourself and
your witnesses.
Compensation is usually paid as a lump sum by cheque. It is assessed by the
Board in the same way that courts of law assess damages. For injuries, it
includes payment to compensate for pain and suffering, and may cover loss
of earnings and out-of-pocket expenses. There are special rules for
assessing compensation if the victim has died. If the injured person is under
 18, and in some other cases, the Board may order the compensation award
to be held in trust for the benefit of the victim or his or her dependants.
The compensation payment has to be reduced to take account of other
payments that may be made:
® Social security payments are deducted in full.
* There are special arrangements if the victim’s employer is providing a
  pension, for example a retirement or widow’s pension.
• The payment also takes account of some kinds of insurance policies, or any
  other compensation received for injuries, such as awards made by civil or
  criminal courts.
When you sign the form accepting an award, you also have to agree to
repay the Board from any damages or compensation you may get later
from any other source.




If you wish to apply for compensation, send for an application form to:

      The Scheme for compensating victims of crimes of violence was announced in both Houses of Parliament on
24th June 1964, and in its original form came into operation on 1st August 1964.
   The Scheme has since been modified in a number of respects. The revised 1979 Scheme which applies to all
incidents occurring on and after 1 October 1979 is set out below.
   Requests for application forms and all inquiries should be addressed to:
                                                                                      Criminal Injuries Compensation Board,

                                                     THE SCHEME
Administration
     1. The Compensation Scheme will be administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, which
will be assisted by appropriate staff. Appointments to the Board will be made by the Secretary of State*, after
consultation with the Lord Chancellor and, where appropriate, the Lord Advocate. The Chairman and members
of the Board, who will be legally qualified, will be appointed to serve for five years in the first instance, and their
appointment will be renewable for such periods as the Secretary of State considers appropriate. The Board
members and Chairman will not serve on the Board beyond the age of 72, or after retirement from legal practice,
whichever is the earlier, except that, where the Secretary of State considers it to be in the interests of the Scheme
to extend a particular appointment beyond the age of 72 or after retirement from legal practice, he may do so.
The Secretary of State may, if he thinks fit, terminate a member's appointment on the ground of incapacity or
misbehaviour.
    2. The Board will be provided with money through a Grant-in-Aid out of which payments for compensation
awarded in accordance with the principles set out below will be made. Their net expenditure will fall on the
Votes of the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department.
    3. The Board will be entirely responsible for deciding what compensation should be paid in individual cases
and their decisions will not be subject to appeal or to Ministerial review. The general working of the Scheme will,
however, be kept under review by the Government, and the Board will submit annually to the Home Secretary
and the Secretary of State for Scotland a full report on the operation of the Scheme, together with their accounts.
The report and accounts will be open to debate in Parliament.

Scope of the Scheme
     4. The Board will entertain applications for ex gratia payments of compensation in any case where the appli­
cant or, in the case of an application by a spouse or dependent (see paragraphs 15 and 16 below), the deceased,
sustained in Great Britain, or on a British vessel, aircraft or hovercraft or on, under or above an installation in a
designated area within the meaning of section 1 subsection (7) of the Continental Shelf Act 1964 or any waters
within 500 metres of such an installation, or in a lighthouse off the coast of the United Kingdom, personal injury
directly attributable
        (a) to a crime of violence (including arson or poisoning) or
        (b) to the apprehension or attempted apprehension of an offender or a suspected offender or to the
             prevention or attempted prevention of an offence or to the giving of help to any constable who is
             engaged in any such activity.
Applications for compensation will be entertained only if made within three years of the incident giving rise to
the injury, except that the Board may in exceptional cases waive this requirement. A decision by the Chairman
not to waive the time limit will be final. In considering for the purpose of this paragraph whether any act is a
criminal act, any immunity at law of an offender, attributable to his youth or insanity or other condition, will be
left out of account.
     5. Compensation will not be payable unless the Board are satisfied that the injury was one for which the total
amount of compensation payable after deduction of social security benefits, but before any other deductions under
the Scheme, would not be less than the minimum amount of compensation. This shall be f£ 4 0 0 except for cases of
violence within the family under paragraph 8 below, where the minimum shall be f£500. The application of the
minimum level shall not, however, affect the payment of funeral expenses under paragraph 15 below.

*       In practice this function will be exercised, as appropriate, by the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for
         Scotland.
t       From 7 November 1986 the amount is £550 in respect of all injuries sustained on or after this date and
        whatever the circumstances. The new limit will also apply to all injuries sustained before 7 November 1986 if
        the application is received by the Board after 6 January 1987.

    Inf 11 (1/87 )
     6. The Board may withhold or reduce compensation if they consider that —
        (a) the applicant has not taken, without delay, all reasonable steps to inform the police, or any other
            authority considered by the Board to be appropriate for the purpose, of the circumstances of the
            injury and to co-operate with the police or other authority in bringing the offender to justice; or
        (b) the applicant has failed to give all reasonable assistance to the Board or other authority in connection
            with the application; or
        (c) having regard to the conduct of the applicant before, during or after the events giving rise to the
            claim or to his character and way of life — and, in applications under paragraphs 15 and 16 below,
            to the character, conduct and way of life of the deceased and of the applicant — it is inappropriate
            that a full award, or any award at all, be granted.
Furthermore, compensation will not be payable —
       (d) in the case of an application under paragraph 4(b) above where the injury was sustained accidentally,
           unless the Board are satisfied that the applicant was at the time taking an exceptional risk which was
            justified in all the circumstances.
     7. In order to determine whether there was any responsibility, either because of provocation or otherwise, on
the part of the victim, the Board will scrutinise with particular care all applications in respect of sexual offences
or other offences which arise out of a sexual relationship or where the relationship between the victim and the
offender is such that there may be difficulty in establishing the facts or it seems possible that the offender might
benefit from any award of compensation made to the applicant. In such cases the Board will especially have
regard to any delay that has occurred in submitting the application. Compensation will not be payable unless the
Board are satisfied that the offender will not benefit from an award.
    8. Where the victim and any person responsible for the injuries which are the subject of the application
(whether that person actually inflicted them or not) were living in the same household at the time of the injuries
as members of the same family, compensation will be paid only where —
        (a) the person responsible has been prosecuted in connection with the offence, except where the Board
            consider that there are practical, technical or other good reasons why a prosecution has not been
            brought; and
tt      (b) the injury was one for which compensation — as assessed under paragraph 5 above — of not less than
            £500 would be awarded; and
        (c) in the case of violence between adults in the family, the Board are satisfied that the person responsible
            and the applicant stopped living in the same household before the application was made and seem
            unlikely to live together again; and
        (d) in the case of an application under this paragraph by or on behalf of a minor, ie a person under
            18 years of age, the Board are satisfied that it would not be against the minor's interests to make a
            full or reduced award.
For the purposes of this paragraph, a man and a woman living together as husband and wife shall be treated as
members of the same family.
    9. If in the opinion of the Board it is in the interests of the applicant (whether or not a minor or a person
under an incapacity) so to do, the Board may pay the amount of any award to any trustee or trustees to hold on
such trusts for the benefit of all or any of the following persons, namely the applicant and any spouse, widow or
widower, relatives and dependants of the applicant and with such provisions for their respective maintenance,
education and benefit and with such powers and provisions for the investment and management of the fund and
for the remuneration of the trustee or trustees as the Board shall think fit. Subject to this the Board will have a
general discretion in any case in which they have awarded compensation to make special arrangements for its
administration. In this paragraph “ relatives" means all persons claiming descent from the applicant's grandparents
and "dependants" means all persons who in the opinion of the Board are dependent on him wholly or partially
for the provisions of the ordinary necessities of life.
   10. The Board will consider applications for compensation arising out of acts of rape and other sexual offences
both in respect of pain, suffering and shock and in respect of loss of earnings due to consequent pregnancy,
and, where the victim is ineligible for a maternity grant under the National Insurance Scheme, in respect of the
expenses of childbirth. Compensation will not be payable for the maintenance of any child born as a result of a
sexual offence.
    11. Applications for compensation for personal injury attributable to traffic offences will be excluded from
the Scheme, except where such injury is due to a deliberate attempt to run the victim down.


Basis o f compensation
    12. Subject to the other provisions of this Scheme, compensation will be assessed on the basis of common law
damages and will normally take the form of a lump sum payment, although the Board may make alternative
arrangements in accordance with paragraph 9 above. More than one payment may be made where an applicant's
eligibility for compensation has been established but a final award cannot be calculated in the first instance — for
example, where only a provisional medical assessment can be given. In a case in which an interim award has been
made, the Board may decide to make a reduced award, increase any reduction already made or refuse to make
any further payment at any stage before receiving notification of acceptance of a final award.



This limit applies only if the injuries were sustained before 7 November 1986 and the application is received by
the Board before 7 January 1987.
    13. Although the Board's decisions in a case will normally be final, they will have discretion to reconsider a
case after a final award of compensation has been accepted where there has been such a serious change in the
applicant's medical condition that injustice would occur if the original assessment of compensation were allowed
to stand, or where the victim has since died as a result of his injuries. A case will not be re-opened more than
three years after the date of the final award unless the Board are satisfied, on the basis of evidence presented
with the application for re-opening the case, that the renewed application can be considered without a need for
extensive enquiries. A decision by the Chairman that a case may not be re-opened will be final.
    14. Compensation will be limited as follows: —
        (a) the rate of net loss of earnings or earning capacity to be taken into account shall not exceed twice the
            gross average industrial earnings at the date of assessment (as published in the Department of Employ­
            ment Gazette and adjusted as considered appropriate by the Board);
        (b) there shall be no element comparable to exemplary or punitive damages.
    15. Where the victim has died in consequence of the injury, no compensation other than funeral expenses will
be payable for the benefit of his estate, but the Board will be able to entertain applications from any person who
is a dependant of the victim within the meaning of section 1(3) of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (other than a
person described in section 1 (3)(b) of that Act) or who is a relative of the victim within the meaning of Schedule 1
of the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976 (other than a person described in pargraph 1 (aa) of that Schedule). For the
avoidance of doubt in Scotland "spouse"shall be construed as being the partner of a regular marriage or a marriage
established by decree of declarator in the Scottish courts. Compensation will be payable in accordance with the
other provisions of this Scheme to any such dependant or relative. Funeral expenses to an amount considered
reasonable by the Board will be paid in appropriate cases, even where the person bearing the cost of the funeral is
otherwise ineligible to claim under this Scheme. Applications may be made under this paragraph where the victim
has died from his injuries even if an award has been made to the victim in his lifetime. Such cases will be subject to
the conditions set out in paragraph 13 for the re-opening of cases and compensation payable to the applicant will be
reduced by the amount paid to the victim.
   16. Where the victim has died otherwise than in consequence of the injury, the Board may make an award to
such dependant or relative as is mentioned in paragraph 15 in respect of loss of wages, expenses and liabilities
incurred before death as a result of the injury whether or not the application for compensation in respect of the
injury has been made before the death.
   17. Compensation will be payable for loss of or damage to clothing and other personal adjuncts arising from
the injury. Personal adjuncts do not include jewellery, watches or rings lost or damaged, whether at the time of
the offence or afterwards or in the course of medical or other treatment arising from the offence. Save as afore­
said, compensation will not be payable for loss of or damage to property.
   18. The cost of private medical treatment will be payable by the Board only if the Board consider that, in all
the circumstances, both the private treatment and the cost of it are reasonable.
   19. Compensation will be reduced by the full value of any present or future entitlement to :—
        (a) UK social security benefits,
        (b) compensation awards under the Criminal Injuries (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977,
        (c) social security benefits, compensation awards or similar payments whatsoever from the funds of other
            countries, or
        (d) payments under insurance arrangements except as excluded below which may accrue, as a result of
             the injury or death, to the benefit of the person to whom the award is made.
In assessing this entitlement, account will be taken of any income tax liability likely to reduce the value of such
benefits and, in the case of an application under paragraph 15, the value of such benefits will not be reduced to
take account of prospects of remarriage. If, in the opinion of the Board, an applicant may be eligible for any such
benefits the Board may refuse to make an award until the applicant has taken such steps as the Board consider
reasonable to claim them. Subject to paragraph 18 above, the Board will disregard monies paid or payable to the
victim or his dependants as a result of or in consequence of insurance personally effected, paid for and maintained
by the personal income of the victim or, in the case of a person under the age of 18, by his parent.
    20. Where the victim is alive compensation will be reduced to take account of any pension accruing as a result
of the injury. Where the victim has died in consequence of the injury, and any pension is payable for the benefit
of the person to whom the award is made as a result of the death of the victim, the compensation will similarly be
reduced to take account of the value of that pension. Where such pensions are taxable, one-half of their value will
be deducted; where they are not taxable, eg where a lump sum payment not subject to income tax is made, they
will be deducted in full. For the purposes of this paragraph, "pension" means any payment payable as a result of
the injury or death, in pursuance of pension or other rights whatsoever connected with the victim's employment,
and includes any gratuity of that kind and similar benefits payable under insurance policies paid for by employers.
Pension rights accruing solely as a result of payments by the victim or a dependant will be disregarded.
   21. When a civil court has given judgment providing for payment of damages or a claim for damages has
been settled on terms providing for payment of money, or when payment of compensation has been ordered by
a criminal court, in respect of personal injuries, compensation by the Board in respect of the same injuries will
be reduced by the amount of any payment received under such an order or settlement. When a civil court has
assessed damages, as opposed to giving judgment for damages agreed by the parties, but the person entitled to
such damages has not yet received the full sum awarded, he will not be precluded from applying to the Board,
but the Board's assessment of compensation will not exceed the sum assessed by the court. Furthermore, a person
who is compensated by the Board will be required to undertake to repay them from any damages, settlement or
compensation he may subsequently obtain in respect of his injuries. In arriving at their assessment of compensa­
tion the Board will not be bound by any finding of contributory negligence by any court, but will be entirely
bound by the terms of the Scheme.
Procedure for determining applications
   22. Every application will be made to the Board in writing as soon as possible after the event on a form
obtainable from the Board's office. The initial decision on the amount of any compensation awarded will be
taken by one member of the Board and where an award is made the applicant will be given a breakdown of the
assessment of compensation, except where the Board consider this inappropriate, and where an award is refused
or reduced, reasons for the decision will be given. If the applicant is not satisfied with the decision, he will be
entitled to a hearing before three members of the Board other than the member who made the initial decision. An
application for a hearing must be made within three months of notification of the initial decision; however the
Board may waive this time limit where an extension is requested with good reason within the three month period,
or where it is otherwise in the interests of justice to do so. A decision by the Chairman not to waive the time limit
will be final. It will also be open to the Single Member where he considers that he cannot make a just and proper
decision himself, to refer the application to three other members of the Board for a hearing. An applicant will
have no title to an award offered until the Board have received notification in writing that he accepts it.
   23. It will be for the applicant to make out his case at the hearing, and where appropriate this will extend
to satisfying the Board that compensation should not be withheld or reduced under the terms of paragraph 6 or
paragraph 8. The applicant and a member of the Board's staff will be able to call, examine and cross-examine
witnesses. The Board will be entitled to take into account any relevant hearsay, opinion or written evidence,
whether or not the author gives oral evidence at the hearing. The Board will reach their decision solely in the light
of the evidence brought out at the hearing, and all the information and evidence made available to the Board
members will be made available to the applicant at, if not before, the hearing. While it will be open to the appli­
cant to bring a friend or legal adviser to assist him in putting his case, the Board will not pay the cost of legal
representation. They will, however, have discretion to pay the expenses of the applicant and witnesses at a
hearing. If one of the three designated members is unable to take part in a hearing, the hearing may proceed,
if the applicant consents, with two members.
    24. Procedure at hearings will be as informal as is consistent with the proper determination of applications,
and hearings will in general be in private. The Board will have discretion to permit observers, such as representa­
tives of the press, radio and television, to attend hearings provided that written undertakings are given that the
anonymity of the applicant and other parties will not in any way be infringed by subsequent reporting. The
Board will have power to publish information about its decisions in individual cases; this power will be limited
only by the need to preserve the anonymity of applicants and other parties.

Implementation
   25. The provisions of this Scheme will take effect from 1 October 1979. Applications in respect of injuries
incurred on or after 1 October 1979 will be dealt with under the terms of this Scheme. Applications in respect of
injuries incurred before that date will be dealt with under the terms of the Scheme which came into operation on
21 May 1969, except that after 31 December 1979 applications relating to injuries incurred more than three years
previously will be entertained only where the Board consider it appropriate exceptionally to waive this time limit.
Where a decision by a Single Member in respect of an injury incurred before 1 October 1979 —
        (a) is notified after that date, the time limit of three months under the terms of paragraph 22 of this
              Scheme will apply to any application for a hearing;
        (b) was notified, but not accepted, before that date, an application for a hearing will not be entertained
              after 31 December 1979 except where the Board consider there is a good reason to extend this time
               limit.
Cases in respect of injuries incurred before 1 October 1979 may be re-opened, subject to the conditions set out
in paragraphs 13 and 15 of this Scheme, for review under the terms of the Scheme which came into operation
in May 1969. A decision by the Chairman not to waive or extend the time limits referred to in this paragraph
will be final.

   HILLSBOROUGH WEST STAND STEWARDS’ COMMITTEE - SUBMISSION TO THE FSA 1EPOHT
                         TO THE INQUIRY


Background
Since the Hillsborough Football Disaster the club stewards in the west stand
used by away supporters have organised themselves into a representative
committee.
                                                                                 q c « iU c < K v c
The committee was formed because the stewards wanted to find a* awgnni~a<ft
way of expressing their concerns about matters to do with organisation at
the ground, some of which they had tried to express through the existing
chanels of communication with the club,in some cases over many years.

The stewards feel that the points have broader relevance for clubs up and down
the country, not just in Hillsborough.

The areas of the stewards1 concern broadly fall into the following categories:
1)communication/liaison between club*, police and stewards 2) security
3)ground organisation 4)recsnsitsent, training and organisation of stewards.

1. Sommunication/liajson between clu b , p o lice and stewards
   A proper consultation/liaison system needs to be recognised between the
   club#, stewards and police. Currently in Hillsborough the only ’system*
   in operation is that the stewards feed any points they want to bring up with
   the club through each stand* s chief steward. This system is not adequate and
   there is no way of checking whether matters of concern have been fed and
   picked up through the system,                                    u os.fie+e4 +•
            too S-Uaa|»v4s - -l&nyd *<■*-& ^ *«- -'-‘• f .
   It is recommended that regular liaison meetings are set up with the three
   parties in question and that matters of concern raised at such meetings             .
   are properly followed up with appropriate action. S u c A                 ■ * * * « IV1V0
            Cv»K    -+0 +*W . -Hw»         JUd      sew**.*-*.
   The stewards feel that e.g. crowd direction at the ground c o u l d have been
   better tackled had such liaison meetings been taking place regularly before
   the ill-fated match in April.
                                                     q
   Currently the stewards are treated asAcasual, unorganised workforce with
   no particular specialist knowledge to offer in the management of a ground.
   Yet they are the workers in the front line, in contact with spectators and
   have through that contact a lot of expertise and first hand observations
   to offer. It seems a great waste not to recognise the potential value &&£                                     ^__

2. Security                                              8 ^ d clt**             fvoft*               &x*‘>+>.

   There is a need for security patrolling inside the ground during matches
   - this is currently not done in Hillsborough, A private security firm ope­
  rates outside the ground area, but the stewards feel that an ’in-house* opera­
  tion by the club with a security team trained specifically to work in that one
  location would be a better solution.

3. ground organisation
   First and foremost it is felt that section pen fences - both in the terraces
   and in seats only areas must be taken down. This is the only way that a
   safe flow of spectators can be guaranteed.                           j 6r wa^ u
   Secondly singposting should be much clearer.                it should be
   possible to have signs in different colours to different parts of the ground
   with tickets of the same colour as the sign indicating the correct area.
   For the colourblind it should be possible to print on the ticket and the
   sign in writing the colour in question (N.B. This is done at the Crucible
   Theatre in Sheffield and works very well).
                                                                                                 cont..
west stand stewards cont....             - 2 -


        More stewards and at different points in the away stand are needed. This
        is particularly necessary during league and other largergames. Stewards should
        be placed at terraces and at gates to direct spectators to the correct area.
        Away supporters should be accompanied by specially trained stewards from their
        own club, this could be done by setting up a rota of experienced stewards at
        each club and the club should organise and pay for their transport to away
        games. An example of the value of ’Home Ground' stewards at an away match was
        seen at the dishaper match, when the ground was eventually being emptied of
        fans: the exit went smoothly as soon as the two Liverpool stewards present
        at the Leppings Lane end spoke to the fans in their own accent and language.

        There should also be a police officer at every decent size gate at the ground.

        Lockable 'hot line' telephones should be installed at strategic points at the
        ground. These should have a direct link to the ground office and to the police
        control. Stewards should haye a pass key to these phones as should any other
        personnel at the ground t o s t might have to resort to emergency measures to
        alert other relevant personnel.

        There should also be several first aid points at strategic placesaround the
        ground. These should be easily accessible and well equipped (see later for
        training),»*•* ' t o t m f u s f .
        There should be adequate small   change at every turnstile, currently they often
        run out of change and fans are   left waiting till more money is brought in. If
        security is the reason for not   holding much change, then security rather that
        leaving fans frustrated should   be increased at turnstiles (see also security
        above).

         Facilities at the ground for both fans and stewards should be improved. There
         is very little on offer for away fans at the moment and the stewards do not
        even have an office or Secure area where they could leave their belongings.
         Fans have difficulty in getting programmes because of the sales organisation
         being patchy - proper kiosks for programme sales should be made available.

        There should be fullest possible consultation with the stewards- and fans -
        to ensure that facilities are improved appropriately to suit the users needs.

   4.   Recruitment, training and organisation of stewards
         A proper and appropriate system of management needs to be introduced into
        the stewarding of ground. This should include proper interviewing of stewards
         prior to appointment. It should also include a longer period of 'apprentice­
         ship' as it appears was the case a few years ago. Then it was necessary for a
         new steward to observe his pears for half a season before he was allowed to
         become a fully-fledged w m bas- of staff.

        The current 'system' is based on stewards*good will, at times patronage in
        recruiting and the fact that all stewards are club fans anyway, so somehow
        in all that casually they must have the ground's interests at heart. This is
        not a good enough way to keep a very large, albeit casual, workfore going.
        Proper training, if necessary by appreticeship    with experienced stewards should
        follow proper recruitment proceduues. Training    must include first aid procedures,
        with the club covering stewards insurance cost    for such a purpose. Currently
        some have trainisjg, some don't and none of the   training is through the club -
        all those with first aid training have clearly    received it elsewhere.
        All stewards must have proper identification at all grounds and should be organised
        in smaller groups with more chief stewards. This way it would be easier to organise
        consultation with groups of stewards as well. The chief stewards should be
        representative %$*the stewards; and in any case the stewards should have the right
        to independent representation of their interests in any consultations with club
        management*

      Conclusion
      It is a sad reflection on the current situation in clubs that we as stewards may
      now finally be listened to because 95 people have lost their lives and countless others
      have been injured and psychologically scarred for life.

      Many of these points we have attemped to make over the years, it's not because
      we want an axe to grind, we are all football fans ourselves - we love the game
      but we also want to make sure that it is a safe game that can be enjoyed by all
      in the community, regardless of their age, sex, race or any other thing.

      We feel however that the only way to ensure that goal is by all those with the
      interest of the great game at heart working together. We want to start our bit here
      and now.

    IMPLEMENTATION   OF ALL-SEATED     SPECTATOR ACCOMMODATION AT
    DESIGNATED SPORTS GROUNDS OTHER THAN SOCCER STADIA
    You will recall     an exchange   of correspondence with my
    predecessor, Peter Bolton about extending the all-seating
    requirement to designated sports grounds other than football.
    In your letter of 5 July yousupported our proposal not     to
    introduce primary legislation which we intend putting to
    Ministers.

    We think the best way of resolving this matter would be by means
    of an arranged PQ. This will now have to wait until after the
    recess. However, the Rugby World Cup about to take place will
    provide an ideal opportunity to test the soundness of our
    recommendation which is contained in the enclosed submission you
    requested sight of. Do you intend putting anything similar to
    the Sports Minister?

    I look forward to receiving your comments as early as possible
    as well as to meeting you when opportunity allows.

                                              Yours sincerely

SPORTS GROUND SAFETY: ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION AT SPORTS GROUNDS
OTHER THAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS

This submission recommends Ministers not to implement the
recommendation of Lord Justice Taylor's final report into the
disaster at    Hillsborough   Stadium   to eliminate    standing
accommodation at all sports grounds designated under the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 by extending the mandatory all-seated
spectator accommodation requirements to them regardless of the
sport.
Background
2.   In his final report into the Hillsborough Disaster, Lord
Justice Taylor recommended that standing accommodation be
progressively eliminated at all sports grounds designated under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (those which accommodate
more than 10,000 spectators). The government, in its response
to the report,     indicated that it intended applying the
recommendation in the case of UEFA high risk football matches,
the 4 football league divisions and the national stadia, and that
it would consider further the application of the provision to
Scotland and the position of sports other than football.
Subsequently the Football Spectators Act 1989 empowered the Home
Secretary to impose requirements, by Order, in respect of seating
of spectators at designated football matches in England and
Wales.

3.      The response continued:
            The application of a recommendation to
            Scotland and to other sports cannot be
            achieved under the Football Spectators Act
            1989 but the Government will in any case
            wish to discuss it with the sporting
            authorities concerned.    Designated sports
            grounds under the 1975 Act include cricket,
            rugby union and rugby league grounds which
            are not all enclosed grounds and which it
            may not be practicable to deal with in this
            way ...
Any decision to extend the all-seated requirement to sports other
than football would require primary legislation.
•

    4.   We have had discussions with representatives of both rugby
    union and rugby league.      While both supported the idea of
    additional seating at rugby grounds neither sport would wish to
    have a requirement for all-seated accommodation extended to them,
    other than in the case of Twickenham, which is already well on
    the way to becoming all-seated. Cost is also a consideration.
    Football Trust funds are not available to rugby so there would
    be considerable pressure for government assistance if all seated
    requirements were to be imposed on rugby. Most cricket grounds
    already provide seats for most if not all spectators and we do
    not regard what standing there is in respect of the rather
    different atmosphere of cricket as a particular risk.
    5.   We have also written to the Association of Chief Police
    Officers who are in broad agreement that primary legislation is
    neither necessary nor desirable at present although they warn
    against complacency.

    6.   Ministers are therefore recommended to continue to encourage
    the voluntary introduction of all-seated accommodation for
    reasons of safety and comfort for spectators at all sports which
    take place at sports grounds designated under the 1975 Act,
    especially those which take place at national stadia, but to
    leave the Taylor recommendation to extend mandatory all-seating
    spectator accommodation to sports other than associated football
    unimplemented. However, the matter should be kept open in case
    it is necessary to review it at some future date. If agreed, it
    is also recommended that this decision should be publicised by
    means of an arranged PQ.

    Other matters
    7.   Tom Pendry MP has shown considerable interest in the Taylor
    recommendations and has asked a number of PQs about them. Three
    such questions asked in May were directly concerned with
    extending mandatory all-seating accommodation to sports grounds
    other than football stadia (see Annexes A and B). In response
    to the questions about which organisations and individuals had
    been consulted (Annex B), Mr Patten explained that discussions
    had been held with the Rugby League, Rugby Football Union and the
    Welsh Rugby Football Union. He also remarked that comments of
    the Association of Chief Police Officers were awaited.     In the
    course of this response, he added that another statement would
    be made in due course.
    8.   Now that comments of ACPO have been received the further
    statement is due and the answer to the arranged PQ would fulfil
    this commitment. A draft PQ and answer are at Annex C.

    9.   Colleagues at the Department of Education and Science and
    the   Education  Department  of   the  Scottish Office    with
    responsibility for sports and recreation are aware of this
    submission and support it.

        Summary

        10.    Ministers are urged:
               (i)   not to take forward the Taylor recommendation to
                     extend mandatory all-seated accommodation on sports
                     other than associated football;

               (ii) to announce this by means of an arranged PQ a draft of
                    which with suggested answer are at Annex C.

DRAFT REPLY


X would invite the hon. Member to note the answers I gave to
similar questions from the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde
which I answered on 14 May, to be found at col 75, and on 17 May,
to be found at cols 286 and 287, when this matter was under
activeconsideration.   Our consideration is now complete for the
time being. Whilewe still require football league clubs to move
towards all-seated grounds as recommended by Lord Justice Taylor
and while we actively encourage other sports with grounds
designated under the 1975 Act to provide all-seated accommodation
 for reasons of safety and comfort,, especially those such as rugby
 matches which take place at national stadia, we see no reason to
 depart from a voluntary approach or to introduce primary
 legislation at this stage. Apart from association football, the
 designation of sports grounds under the 1975 Act is confined to
 grounds used for rugby league, rugby union and cricket at which
 the number of spectators is normally much less and the nature of
 crowd behaviour quite different from those who attend association
 football matches. Additionally, neither of the rugby games enjoy
 the income which would enable them to improve spectator
    facilities to the same extent as that expected of the league
    football clubs. However, we shall not become complacent and will
    continue to keep the matter under review.

HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION - VISITS TO THE GROUND ON 4,6 & 7 JULY

4 July 1989

I visited the Ground again, with Prof Smith, and carried out a brief
examination of all the old style barriers at the Leppings Lane end which
had not been assessed previously. I noted the following:

6 July 1989

This visit was made with Dr Nicholson with a view to selecting barriers
for testing at SEL. A brief examination was made of the old style
barriers on the Spion Kop, noting the location of corroded holes only,
as follows:

Barriers corroded at both ends:

ii, 9, 23, 25, 12, 26, 14, 27, 28, 15, 29, 39, 88, 102 Total = 14

Barriers corroded at one end only:

35, 48, 70, 84, 71, 13, 51, 72, 87, 53, 75, 87, 108        Total = 13

Barriers corroded at the one end which could be inspected (new support
at the other end):

34, 37, 38, 54, 76                                         Total = 5

Grand total of barriers with holes                               = 32

Hole size varied from pinhole to 44mm max dimension

The old three span barriers on Spion Kop were examined for possible use
in laboratory load tests:

Barrier no.                          Comment

68                    Uneven support legs - not suitable

69                    New support at one end - not suitable

97                    New gusset plates, some leg bracing - possible

99                    New horizontal tube - not suitable

ii0                   New support and part new tube - not suitable

i00                   An angled barrier - not suitable

76                    An angled barrier with one new support - not suitable

63A                   Three new supports - not suitable

54                    An angled barrier with one new support - not suitable


We concluded that only barrier 97 would of use for load testing in the
laboratory.

An RLSD team consisting of Dr Nicholson, Mr [            , I          ] Mr
       Mr [         ]and I, visited the ground to remove various sections
of crush barrier from the Leppings Lane terrace. We were assisted by two
men from Sloane & Roebuck and, by agreement with Sheffield Wednesday and
West Midlands Police, part of the proceedings was filmed by YTV and
BBC camera crews.

The following items were removed and transported to SEL:

Barrier 129 - supports 1,2,3 and 4 plus the entire horizontal tube

Barrier 125 - supports 1,2 and 3 plus tube

Barrier 124A - remaining part (supports i and 2 plus tube)

On 29 June 1989 1 visited Hillsborough Football ground with Prof R
Smith, University of Sheffield. The following new observations were
made:

Perimeter fence gates, Pens 3 and 4

Two sizes of mesh (2Hx 2H and 3"x 6") had been used in the construction
of the perimeter fence. In Pen 4 the smaller size mesh had been used in
the fence on either side of the perimeter gate, and on the gate itself.
In Pen 3 however, the coarser mesh had been used in the fence on the
left hand side of the gate, viewed from inside the pen, and finer mesh
had been used elsewhere.

I found it possible to get my arm through the mesh adjacent to the
perimeter gate in Pen 3, and I was able to extend it to within 100mm of
the handle on the outside of the gate. Examination of the latch
mechanism indicated that it could be opened by finger-tip pressure
applied to the handle and it may be concluded therefore that a person
with a longer reach could possibly open this gate from inside the pen.

In Pen 3 there was a gap of approximately 100mm between the concrete
wall and the fence upright adjacent to the gate. This gap was accessible
only at a distance of -800mm below the level of the the latch. I do not
believe the latch could be reached by this route. There was also a gap,
10-12mm wide, between the gate and the fence upright adjacent to the
latch. In theory the latch could be lifted from this gap but
considerable force and a strong implement would required.

There was no evidence of any lubrication of the latch mechanism on
either gate and it was possible on closing the gate to release the latch
so that it rested adjacent to the slot rather than in the slot. Under
these conditions the gate could be pushed openreadily from the inside.

Evidence of previous gangways

There was a parallel strip of coarser concrete, -920mm wide, which
extended from the perimeter gate in pen 4 to the third step below the
top of the terrace. This strip passed within 0.3m of the wing-wall
adjacent to the entrance. The edges of this strip were quite well
defined exceptwhere barrier alterations had occurred. This strip was
approximately the right width for a gangway, by comparison with the
sunken gangways in the older part of the Kop.

Barriers examined

A cursory examination of barriers in other parts of the ground was made.
The tube on barrier 123 in Pen 2 had been perforated by corrosion at the
end nearer pen 3. The grossly deformed single-span barrier (4.5"
deflection at midspan) in the lower NW terrace was identified as barrier
159. A number of "old" barriers in the Spion Kop were observed to have
tubes which had been perforated by corrosion. The ends of barriers ii and
12, near Rate 5, were particularly badly corroded.

WALSALL FOOTBALL CLUB

You will recall that some time ago you drew to my attention an article in
the ’Today’ newspaper in which a Liverpool player in interview with the
reporter, Mr Bob Harris, said that a barrier broke at Hillsborough, as it
had at Walsall.

We have made enquiries into this alleged incident and have discovered the
following information. Mr[           ] Club Secretary, informs us that at
8.30 pm on 14 February 1984, when Liverpool played Walsall at Walsall in
the second leg of the League Cup semi-final Liverpool scored a goal, this
led to a crowd surge amongst Liverpool fans at the Railway End of the
ground. The effect of this surge was to cause a concrete wall to fal!
over. There were no crush barriers or fences in place at the time. There
were no fatalities, although there were a number of minor injuries.

I trust this information is of assistance to you.             I have copied this for
the information of MrI

Pre-meetinq cnmments from Mr Jones
Oral hearings will probably be concluded by 30 June 89.
Interim report will be produced and then further evidence will be considered in
closed session. This may last until Jan/Feb 90. Inquest will be held before
Christmas if possible. He anticipates the final report of the In~ may not
be available until April 1990.


Mr Collins stated that the barriers ~ the main priority and the wall was now
irrelevant.
Dr Nicholson distr~ copies of a document summarising HSE work so far. The
subjects referred to in this document ~are discussed.
Barriers

It was agreed that a barrier test would be useful for establishing the sequence
of events and it was accepted that the loads obtained may not be applicable to
the failure of barrier 124A. Mr Jones asked Dr Nicholson to supply a list of
questions to be put to Eastwoods. Mr Collins read Annex C of the ’Green Guide’
and initially stated that there was only one interpretation of the load test
prooedure. However, following discussion he agreed that "re-zeroing" was a
oontenticus point. Professor Maunder suggested that HSE should consult other
c~m~mmies which carry out crush barrier testing. He also asked what Professor
Smith’s role would be. Dr Nicholson explained that Professor Smith would carry
out calculations relating to the collapse of barrier 124A. Professor Maunder
said that a view of the ~mportance of the amount of bend on the tubes with
respect to the failure load would be useful. Dr Nicholson suggested that a
report on the condition of other barriers in the oentral pen oould be produced.
After the meeting, the barriers w~re viewed and Mr ~ pointed out the
significant features.
Turnstiles
Mr~explained how the tests on turnstiles A-G had been carried out and
also how the number of people passing through these turnstiles had been counted
by HSE. He em~ised that the only discrepancy with respect to the computer
figures was on turnstile G. Mr Collins concluded that it was reasonable
therefore to rely on the computer figures for turnstiles A-F. He also stated
the ~mportance of an explanation of the malfunction of turnstile G. Mr
                                         1
said this was due to a badly positiuned microswitch. Mr Oollins mentioned that
at some stage before the match a PC was required to re-position ’loose wood’ in
one of the turnstiles. He ~ that hourly rate figures for turnsile
thrc~bpfc wuuld be most helpful to the Inquiry. Professor Maunder suggested
that an ~ of the egress routes might be useful. However, Mr Oollins
did not cc~sider that this was necessary.
Perimeter qates
Mr Collins asked whether the perimeter gate in pen 3 oculd be opened by crowd
pressure. He stated that there was some witness testimony suggesting that this
had occurred. Dr Nicholson said that ~E wuuld be able to carry out load tests
on this gate, although he suspected that Eastwoods had already performed some
tests without authorisation. It was therefore necessary to obtain Eastwoods’
results before prooeeding with further tests.
Cummunicaticns

Professor Maunder asked whether the public address system in the ground would
have been audible above the noise of the cruwd. Dr Nicholson suggested that
Noise & Vibration Section oould carry out tests to ascertain this.


Dr Nicholson explained how the crowd density measurements ~ being carried
out by HSE. Mr Oollins said that statemen~on the method and the results wuuld
be required with the highest aocuracy possible.
Dr Nicholson em~hasised that counting of spectators entering the ground during
the opening of gate C was problematic. HSE need to see the police video
recorded from the south stand to ascertain whether the aocuracy of counting may
be
Human factors
Mr Oollins did not think a p~logist wuuld be much use at this stage.
Mr[          i in ormd the that a book by Pro essor on cro
psyd~logy was available at the Town Hall. Mr Collins said that corsideration
of human factors was a l~_r priority.
IGreen Guide’

Mr Oollins said that breaches of the ’Green Guide’, in connection with barrier
height and spacing etc, should be mentiuned in HSE’s initial report. Mr Taylor
stated that there ~ two versions of the guide (1973 and 1986) and he
believed that Professor Eastwood had been consulted in the preparation of the
ist version. Mr Collins drew the meeting’s attention to para 206 dealing with
radial fences.
~m~ary of immediate actions on ~E
The following actions are required within the next twD w~eks:

1     A list of questions for Eastwoods to be supplied.
2     Professor Smith to be instructed to carry out calculations.

                       Of,
       Until recently there was little gui ~dance available on the strengths ~.ud         ,

       spa=iron suitable for crush ba_~.--imrs used on football terraces. The only

       pr~bl~.m in the design of barriers was often seen as that of ensuring they

       did not collapse un£er crowd pressures. ~Tnile it is of ~arazouzt izD~r~ance

       that collapse does not occur, it is also important ~u-_t crowd pressurez

       canmot be generated so as to caus’e imjurf particularly to those spe=tatcrs

       pressed against the barrier.

       I .I The supporting evidence for the spacing and strength of crush bzrri~

       recommended in the ~/neatl-=y Report is given b~low. In brief, the

       determiuation of the pressure that can be generated on ¯ terrace is ex.~!aineS,

       a distinction being made between the levels of prossur~ that can be

       generated im "peak vie~’i.ug areas" e.~. behind penalty bones, and in "other

       viewing areas"; afigure is obtained for the pressure that can be ~enerz:ed per

       man (or alternatively per foot ~-idth of barrier per foot sp~iP~ as a

       function of slope); and measurements of the pressures that can be

       tolerated by the human body whem pressed against a bar;let are described.

       Other supporting evider~e is also mention~.

       I .2. It is assumed that only on rare occasions ~ll all the spectators

       between 2 consecutive barriers up a slope contribute s~zult~ueously to

       crowd pressures. When this "maximum pressure" does occur it causes grave

       ~iscomfort but, owing to its transient nature, is ur.likcly to cause injuzs’.

       It is a~’aned that the pressures which occur frequently will be generated

       by half of these sFectators and, for the purpose of this ~aper, this

       frequently ~ncrated ~ressure is called the "tolerable ~ressure". The
       recom%ended barrier spa~in~ is based on it, the actual ~istance recommended
                                              --\

       between barriers being the standing room required by t~ice the z~tmber of

       spactators who exert the tolerable ~rossu.~. It is also assumed that each

       spectator occupies am area of 2 square foot, standi~ on a step of 14" depth




                                                                          p

in seventy, the barriers should withstand the greatest pressure ever

 strengths are based on the "maximum press’~e" i.e. that pre_ssur~ ~’hlch

 could be generated by all the spect-.tors ~ho could be izvolved. Usir~

 -the tolerable prostates quoted iz par&gr~-h I .2, the desired ba~±er

 strengths are 340 lbf per foot width~ and 230 lbf per foot ~-idth for the

 2 levels of tolerance.             Sho"._ld the ¯barrier spz=i~g be less than the

 maxiz~am recommended, the barrier strength may be reduced prop~rtlcr-~te!Y

 provided none is less thaz 206 Ibf per foot ~-idth. (~&is ia t.he v-lme

          Measurements were made By the Home Office of the pressure that could be

          generated on the terraces durim~ a match. (reference paragra.~, 2.0).

          Thirty police cadets we~ used to simulate spectators. Two levels cf

          fo~e were defined - (a) ’lean’, correspoDdin~ to spcctatcrs bearing on

          ome another but exertimgno additional force, and (b) ’push’, as ’lear.’

           but with the crowd exerting an additional fo:~e it, order to see, but not

           ~ush~ aggressively. The cadets imvaryim£ numbers of rows were asked to

           ’push’ or ’lean’ ag~imst a well padded test barrier attached to am ezinting

           crush barrier at a football groumd. The forces were measured usimg

           Pressure gauges. The experiments were carried out on 3 slopes of 0°, 15°,

           and 23~°. It was comsidered that comAition (b) ’]~uzh’ corresponde~

            to the state of the crowd in the ,peak viewimg areas" of the terraces

                and that condition (a) ’lean’ corresponded to the other areas. Pressures

            of up to about 300 Ibf per person were tolerated ~th some discomfort

            by the cadets for a few seconds. Sigms of considerable discomfort were

            shown for longer periods of time or for ~reater pres~res-

            3.1 It was assumed that the force propagated ~o~m a slope would have

)           2 components: (i) the force measured with a slope of 0°, and (ii) a

                componemt proportiomal to the weight of the spectator amd the size of

                the slope angle. The following re~ationahi~ was found to hold for the

                force per spectator.




    v-"
          p slope    = Po + S4 sin Q

    whe-~ P slope is force in lbf per epectatcr
                                                                                 "-K_
           Q is an61e to horizontal of the .@lope

           Po is the force per spectator when Q = 0°
    and    Po (push) = 40 Ib~ and Po (lea=) = 21 ibf.
                               --q~ _ °

    However as the police cadetz were above average weight, a norzallsi=g

    factor is needed and the relatiemzhip becomez:

           P slope = Po + 73.5.sin Q

    where Po (p~sh) = 35.5 Ibf an~ Po (lean) = 18.5 Ibf.

    For example, using this relational-i-~ it cam be calculated that 9 :x,;:s

     of spectators all ~ushir~ on a 14° %erra~e will press the foremost
     s~ectator against the barrier ?,~th a force cf 480 lbf (cr 274 Ibf per

     foot width of barrier).
     3.2 The values for Q = C° were in agreement ~_th similar =eazure’’~-nts

     made in 1948 by the pj~aistry of Pab!ic Buildimgs and %;orks (reference
a

     Taregraph 2.0 (v)). The force as a functio= of slope ~’as not

     =easu.re~ on that occasion.


I    4.0 }~_.~.SUR~’TS OF CRO%~ p.W.ESSbT~ES ACTUALLY G~EPJ.TED
      Measurer-ants were made at 2 football matshes ~f the forces actually

      exerted on a barrier. The measurements using calibrated strain gauges

      were made at 2 different grounds on barriers situated behind the

      penalty box (reference z~ara~ 2.0 (iii) and (vi)),
      4.1 Match A. Barrier spacing behind the test barrier varied from

     13’ to 25’ am~ the terrace slope was 14° (I :4). Forces of 100 to

      200 Ibf per foot width of barrier were measure~ %-ith occasional

      ~eaks to 300 Ibf per foot ~dth. The forces did not exceed 200 Ibf per

      foot width for 3 or more seconds.
            F, atchB Barrier spacing varied from 13.5’ "to 26’ and the terrace

       slope was 14©¯   Forces of 100 to over 200 Ibf per foot width were

       measured with ©ccasiomal values of 300 Ibf per foot ~-idth.

                           .... ~ 4
-~   ~    4.2 Neither match was’cracial nor particularly exciting. At the

          second match there were 14 casualties includim~ a man with a

          fractured leg and a boy with concuszicn. Two ezperienced plain-

          clothes men who were stationed in the crowd stated that a~_~reher~icn

          and fear were generated~bF crowd movements and pressure, and th-~t some

          spe=tators stood back and braced themselves against the cro~’d prcz=ure

          with one foot on the barrier.




          A series of measurements were made cn men and.   wom~m to dete~ine

          the maximum pressure which could be tolerated    by a person ~fnen

         ~-~reszed against a cruzh barrier. Each person    ~.’hile standing was

          pressed against a steel tube located horizon:a!ly against v~ricus

          positions in turn on his trank. The pressure WaS applied tc hiz by

          means of a paak frame onhis back ~%th various weights w~_iah forced

          him @n te the barrier. Three subjective levels of disco--fort were

          defined and each person was asked to say when they were reached.

          In particular the third level of discomfort was defined as that which

          became intolerable after a few seconds.
          For men (42 subjects) the height ef the barrier rail at which ~mazizuz

         force cauld be tolerated was found to be 41~’, which corresponds well

          with the usual barrier height" of 42". The mean value of thin force

          for men when passive was found to be 107 ibf and when they were

          allowed to resist by pushing against the barrier was 179 Ibf (~,~th

          a range of 98 to 233 Ibf). For the passive tests the force tolerated

          was increased by a third te 140 Ibf by substit-ating a 4" wide ~lanh
          for the steel tube. The values in respect ©f women were considerably

          l~er.
          5.1 It is felt that although the above results give am order of

          magnitude of the tolerable force, the following comments could be made.
                Ci)The    m~m.imum force toleratsl ~as clearly not at the threshold

               (ii) Although the fcrce was defined as being intolerable after a o4

                      few seconds, periods of surging and F-’shing in a crowd on a

                      terrace may be°moze_-tramziemt, and for these very short

                      periods greater forces can appzremtly be tolerated.
/
              (iii)   Persons with lower levels of tolerance may well be prcte:ted

                      by their s~,tr~ger ~ompar, ions.


            6.0 }:E~SLT,~,~S 0Y BAP2,1ER STP_~IGTH AT A P00TB:’:LL GROU!’D
            A number of measurements were made of the strength of existing crash

            Barriers at a London Football Club (reference paragraph 2.0 (vii)).

             Im particular, tests were made on barriers in the same area and si=i!ar

            t@ a barrier which had collapsed during a match. Three similar

            barriers failed at pressures of 260, 290 and 300 lbf per foot width.
        >
             The distance to the nemt barrier above the collapsed barrier varie~

             from 10’ to 22’.

             6.1 The consulting engineers recommended that crush barriers should

             be designed and checked to a significantly h_i~er loading than 200 ltf
             per foot ~-idth, and that no Spacing between barriers should be greater

             than 12’ and should be less an steep terraces. They also recommended

             that for design purposes there was need to deter--~,ue the lead which

             people can exert on barriers and the maximum pressers whic!~ the human

                  IrJURY 0~CURS.

             A search in medical pa~ers for evidence ef the level of pressure at

            - which injury occurs to the human body was %undertaken by a Neme

             Office doctor (reference paragraph 2.0 (iv)).
             7.1 Among   the infommatien brought to notice by this search ~ere

             2 CaSeS @f traumatic asphyxia where the pressures (as calculated by the

extent. In the first case the pressure ~-as 1400 pounds for a ~eziod

of 15 seconds, and iz the, second ca~e 300 pounds for scze 4 to 6           -
                               o
minutes. The reason for the difference in the pressurez reported in

these cases may be due to the 1400 pounds beir~ far in e=cess of thee

minimum required to ceuse the fatality. Certairly the amount and

duration of the pressure in" the second case were similar to those
re~orted at the Bolton Wamdererc accident in 1946 where layers of 3 or

4 bodies were sufficient t¢ cause death by traumatic as=hyxia.

This evidence does indicate that if a barrier should collapse at,- pecpl~

are piled on top of each other even for ordy a short ti=e, traumat±=

asph)=ia is a dsfinite hazard.
7.2 The sear¢~h disclosed nc othsr ir~orzation about irju~,- tc the

body due to static forces, but did reveal that as far as dynamic forces

are concerned the liver can be injured by impacts of 3-5 zph. There

was also brought to notice that bone finds increased strength ~-hem

subjected to a d)~mmic as opposed to a static loading: this may be

 the reason why larger forces of a transient nature cam be tolerated,


8. RF2OTU4E~,~DED BARRIER STRENGTHS Ah"D SPACINGS

 Spectators cam be safeguarded .against injury from cro~:d press-arcs by

 the careful positioning of crush barriers o~ raitable design. The

 barriers p hould never collapse ~mdez pressure and should be spaced

 to limit the number of spectators between 2 barriers so that their

 combined pressures can never be sufficient to cause imju-~y. For

 financial reasons there is need to determine the minimum adequate

 strength and the maximum acceptable spacing of barriers for this

 purpose. The followlzg s -urJ~ary of the imfozmaticn presented earlier
 in this pa~er provides the basis for the rscommendaticns which have

 been made in this re~ard.


                                   7
8.1   The pressures whic~ can be generated by spectators when they
’learn’ cr ’push’ on a terrace have been measured (see paragraph 3)-

Fcr a 14° 81oFe the ’lean’ force per perscn was calculated to be

36 ibf (Qr 20 ibf per foot width of barrier) am~- the ’push’ to be       ,:

53 ibf (or 30 lbf per fo~--w~dth).
8.2 Pressures measured on 14° slopes during 2 matches (see paragraph 4)

were of the same order Of magnitude, being 200 ibf per foot width as

a regular occurrence for periods longer than 3 seconds, and ~th

occs ionaZ pe s oc 3oo l_b per          width. !thou h it w-s
umlikely that all spectators were invclved in ezertim£ these pre~sure~ -

the matches were mot censidered to be emcitimg - the press’ure tl-~t

could have been exerts~- by each of the persons im the 12 to 22 ro~~-

behind the barriers ranged from 17 to 9 lbf per feet width (and 27

to 14 ibf during the occasiom~.l peaks). These figures are certaiz~y

of the same order of mag’aitude as those in paragramh 8.1 ).

8.3 Further support to these figures is ~.ven by the ~educed pressure

 of 260 to 300 ibf ~er foot width at which a barrier collapsed (see

 para~aph 6). There were 9 to 19 rows of spectators behind the

barrier ana, so the 260 represents a pressure per person of 29 to

 14 ibf per foot width and the 300 a pressure of 33 to 16 lbf ~er foot

 ~Ldth.

 8.4 It ~s felt that the measurements mentioned in paragraph 8.1 are

 reasonable for calculating the maxi~uzm pressur..e that could be generated

 between 2 consecutive barriers ~p a terrace slope. Furthermore, the

 ’push’ values should be used for ’peak viewing’ areas and the ’learn’

 values for ether areas.

 8.5 The measurements by the University of Surrey of pressures

 tolerated by the human body are su~risimgly l_0w_’(see paragraph 5);
 the mean figure for men being 10V ibf when passive and 179 Ibf when

 resisting by pushing against the barrier. These figures are lower


                              8
 than the pressu~-es of 200 Ibf per foot width, with peaks to 300, which

 were recorded at a mstch (see paragraph 4); but these pressures may

 have been exerted for shorter periods, and they did generate fear (and

some injuries were in fac~ ~0rted on that occasion). The Surrey

figures are also lower than the pressures of 300 ibf per ~erson

tolerated by police cadets (see paragraph 3) but in that case the

barrier was well padded and.the cadets may have been prepared to

tolerate mcre in the company of their colleagues.

8.6. Given the supporting evidence of para~ph 8.5, it is reasonable

te use a figure ef 200 Ibf per person (or 115 lbf ~er foct width) as

the tolerable pressure for comfort and safety, ~ud a figuz’e of 300 lbf

per person (or 170 Ibf per foot width) as the tolerable ~ressurc f~r

safety only.

~.7 As mentioned in paragraphs I .2 an~ 1.3 the "tolerable pressure" is

half the "maxiz~m pressure" and so the recom=ended zimizum strengths

for barriers are 230 and 340 Ibf per foot width ~en the barriers are

s!raced for "comfort and safety" and for "s~fety only" respectively.

Should the space between 2 barriers be less th~.u the maximum

recommended, the strength of the front barrier may be reduced in

proportion provided that none is lens than 206 ibf per foot width.

             started at 10.30am. Briefed Mr ~on what we knew of the incident and of
             action taken to date. He has had experience of this field and knew of those

             tunnel to the pens and c~ecked the overall dimensions of the pen areas. They
             also measured the gaps between barriers and the positions and size of the gates
             through the pitch barrier fencing. In discussion, it was noted that some
             barriers were lower than the heights recommer~ed in the guide and that tests at
             4001bs/ft run would be less severe on the vertical stanchions. The barrier
             height was discussed with respect to pressure on the human anatmmy and Mr
             agreed to oontact a Medical Division oolleague for information on this topic.
             Whilst we were on site, Imrd Justioe Taylor visited the ground and I was
             questioned by Assistant Chief Constable J Mervyn Jones, who was assisting Lord
             Justioe Taylor. I explained our role with respect to the Local Authority

                 left a tele~one number on whichhe could be oontacted (754518).
                 Contacted CEN at Hillsbo~mx~. Gave him S. Taylor’s message. CEN asked me
                 to tele4~hone Mr l                TD3 and let him know that the police are
                 talking about going to Eastwood & Partners today. C~q would telephone
                 S. Taylor in the meantime and Mr[        ]was asked to oontact CEN at about
                 ii. 30am.
                 CEN contacted me again after being in touch with the police and asked me to
                 (i) tele4~hone Mr l       land ask him to liaise with S. Taylor to arrange
                 when he can visit Eastwoods, and for Mr ~ contact CEN if he wants to
                 take someone with him to Fastwoods, and (2) for me to find out background
                 information on Professor Maunder.
                 I contacted Mr ~ and obtained information on Professor Maunder from
                            I Libz-mry. This was fed through to Dr Nicholson.
                Message received from S. Taylor that he had pre-arranged with Mr ~to
                meet in the RiSD car park between 1.30pm and 1.45pm and then go together to
                Eastwood & Partners. He had since spoken to Dr Fastwood, who wished to
                speak to them personally but was not available until 5.00pm. S. Taylor
                asked me if I could oontact Mr~and let him know that if convenient,
                he would now meet him in the car park at 4.45pm.
                I tried to contact Mr ~ but he had already left Bootle for Sheffield.
                Message received from MrI       I, TD3 informing us that Mr ~had left
                for Sheffield and was to meet S. Taylor in the car Dark i. 30pm-l.45pm. He
                also had a message for Dr Nicholson that a Dr l        I a Cave Rescue
                Doctor at lancaster ba~ experienoe of body damage due to harnesses etc (a
                ref~ frcm Mr ~. This information was passed on to Dr Nicholson
                who informed me that if Mr~wished to join them at the Hillsborough
                ground rather than waste 3 hours during the afternoon, I should oontact him
                to make the neoessary ar~ for letting him into the ground.
                On Mr ~ arrival, he said he would prefer to use an office for work
                whilst he waited for S. Taylor to arrive. I telephoned S. Taylor to let

                 Dr Nicholson contacted me and was given the messaqe from Dr Eastwood. He
                 said that Mr~d see the drawings at the meeting and then deliver
                 them to RLSD. CH~ was also told to expect calls from S. Taylor and
                 Mr[           He said that he would try to oontact them.

                M~        ]took a telephone message from Dr Eastwood’s Secretary, informing
                 us that Dr Eastwood was now free and could see S. Taylor and MrI
                 before 5.00pm, the time arranged earlier. I tried to oontact S. Taylor on
                 Sheffield 754518 but got no reply. As it was 4.15pm and S. Taylor was due
                 to meet Mr ~ at 4.45pm, I assumed that he was on his way to RLSD.
                 Mr~ informed that as soon as S. Taylor arrived, they could set off
                 for Eastwood & Partners. Mr~en left CEN’s office to wait for
                 S. Taylor in the car park. When I left for home at 4.5513n, I was called to
                 the Gatehouse to take a tele~ call from S. Taylor. He asked me to get
                 a message to Mr ~ asking him to make his own way to Eastwood &
                 Partners and meeting S. Taylor there. I informed Mr ~f this.
             qUES[IKY, 25 APRIL 1989
                 Mrs~ informed me that a journalist, [                 had telephoned for
                 Dr Nicholson after 5.00pm on Monday evening and that Dr Jones had taken the
                 call.
                 Dr Nicholson brought into the office 5 documents given to him by hand when
                 he attended the meeting at Eastwood & Partners on the evening of 24 April.
                 I made 6 copies of each document and they were distributed as follc~s:

                Whilst CH~ was at Hillsbor~ in the morning, Mr[            ]of Sheffield
                City Council. He was ringing to check if it was Dr Nicholson who had asked
                for barrier testing results and if so, whether they shculd be sent direct
                to Dr Nicholscn or via Mr[         ]or sumeone else. I said I would pass
                the message on and ask Dr Nicholscn to contact him on Sheffield 734658.
                Dr Nicholscn reD!meal frum Hillsbozxm!gh at lunchtime when he received a
                call from Mr[           I also frum the ~ Authority. Dr Nicholson agreed
                with Mr ~ that as we were approaching Fastwood & Partners direct, we
                would not, for the time being, require the ~ Authority to provide us
                with copies of the crush barrier test data.
                In the afternoon, when Dr Nicholson was back at the Hillsbor~ ground, I
                took a telephone message from MrI             ]of Husband & Co. He was
                enquiring whether Dr Nid~olscn had c~tained copies of drawings of the
                Hillsborough ground frum Fastwood & Partners. As Husband & Co had not been
                included in the list of recipients of oopies of the documents sent cut
                earlier today, I did not mention that Dr Nicholscn already had the drawings
                but said I would pass the message on and ask Dr NiQholson to contact him on
                Sheffield 761242.

                Dr Nid~olson asked Mr            to find out names of independent
                structural engineers who could carry out a survey on the way installation
                of the barriers at Hillsborough had been carried out. Mr[         ]later
                contacted me with the following message: He had contacted PSA - the person
                he needed to speak to was not available until later today and no one else
                could help him on this matter. He then contacted a firm of solicitors he
                has reoently used on a personal matter to ask if they oould suggest or
                recommend any local firms. ~ gave him 3 firms: one, Eastwood &
                Partners, one, Husband & Co, and the other Mr Ralph Braid of Ralph Braid &
                Associates, 3 Sharrow Lane, Sheffield- Tel: Sheffield 552255.

                Dr Nic~holson contacted Mr Braid and asked me to get a message to Mr i                           i
                at the Hillsborough ground, telling him that Mr Braid, the new surveyor
                would attend the ground at 2.30pm today and Dr Nic~holson would meet them
                there at that time.
                Professor Maunder, ~e University rang. He was put through to
                Dr NiQholson during a meeting. Professor Maunder was given the HSE view
                that as long as the leppings Lane end was secure, other than the most
                northerly turnstiles 1-8 (giving aooess to the north stand), then HSE had
                no objection to the ground being re-opened. Professor Maur~_er agreed with
                this view and said he would contact Lord Justioe Taylor’s Secretary,
                Mr ~alley, to pass on his a~.
                Professor Maunder rang a second time and left a message with me to pass
                on. He said that he supported Dr NiQholson’s proposal to release the
                ground exoept for the lepping Lane area. He had spoken to Mr ~alley at
                the Home Offioe, passing on his r~oomme~dation and Mr ~alley had requested
                that he also get confirmation through Mr Dear (Chief Constable, West
                Midlands Polioe) that West Midlands Polioe are happy with this proposal.
                ~he message for Dr NiQholson was for him to ask Chief Superintendent
                Inspector Pemberton to confirm that the Polioe are agreeable to the release
                of the ground exoept the Iapping Lane area and for CSI Pemberton to ensure
                that Mr ~alley is informed of this by Mr Dear.
               I passed this message on to Dr Nicholson who asked me to find out the
               tele~ number of CSI Pemberton so that he could convey this message to
               him when he came out of his meeting at lunahtime. I tele~oned the
               incident room at Hillsborough and spoke to Inspector Davenport. He gave me
               the tel~ number of CSI Pemberton as Sheffield 727599 and also asked me
               to pass on the message to CE~ that the Se~ of SWFC would like to
               speak to him when he a~ the gr~md this afternoon.

             Dr NiQholson tele~ CSI Pemberton who agreed to the proposal and said
             he will ensure that Mr Dear informs Mr Whalley of West Midlands Polioe’s
             agreement. CSI Pemberton also asked Dr NiQholson to (i) organise a drawing
             by 3 May 1998~_ and (2) to look into making a model of the ground 8’ x 4’ on
             a board, to be prepared by 15 May 1989.
             At Dr Nic~olson’s request I oontacted Mr[         ]to find out the name of
             someone with expertise in crowd movement models from the Institute for
             Consumer Ergonomics at Loughborough University. Mr l        ~entioned that
             the Building Research Establishment, part of the Department of Environment,
             may also have someone and he would contact me with a name from Loughborough
             [hliversity. When he rang back, he had been in touch with the University
             and they had informed him that they don’t think that the work they’ve done
             is relevant. ~hey did, however, suggest contacting Peter Wood, Department
             of Psychology at Surrey University who has worked on the evacuating of
             buildings in fires. He can be contacted on 0483 571281.

             counter system. Dr Nicholson checked this with Mr Waterhouse whilst still
             on the ’~hone and CI Tope is to confirm arrangements direct to
             Mr Waterhouse.
             John Rc~n, Chief Press Officer, HSE rung following his receipt of
             Mr[        I minute dated 24 April 1989. He has noted that Dr Nicholson is
             listed as the contact for media enquiries and wishes to speak to him about
             this. He has been getting enquiries from the media and wants to come to
             some sort of agreement with CEN so that CEN doesn’t have to be involved
             with people from the media. He will contact Dr Nicholson ~rrow morning
             (~hursday, 27 April 1989).
             Dr Nicholson tele4~ from Hillsborough in the afternoon asking me to
             contact Ph~c Unit and find out if anyone could attend this
             afternoon. ~he gates had been cleared of flowers and I~hotos could be taken
             of the bent part of gate. Mr Hibbs would be there today but not tmmorrow
             so he could help with directions. Got in touch withI            ~o said
             he would be at the ground for 4pro.

             (Dr[           ~and possibly 2 others) could work over the weekend.
             Braid’s charges will be £22.50 per hour.
             ~he Sheffield Wednesday Secretary asked if he could arrange for the west
             end perimeter fence to be covered sumetime in the near future in
             preparation for a football match, as yet unspecified. ~he Polioe have
             agreed to this but only as long as it is cleared with Dr Nicholson.
             Dr Nicholson is to attend a meeting at ll.30am on ~hursday, 27 April to
             arrange for covering of the fence.
             Dr Nicholson gave CSI Pembertcn a verbal report of TD’s survey of the wall

RangI          - he is preparing notes on the current position of
his studies of the ground, barriers, access etc. with respect
to the Code. He will send me the notes and will require a copy
to be returned to him. He is obtaining data from the Institute
of Structural Engineers and is considering the possibility of
hydraulic modelling to simulate crowd flow. He will ring me on
Thursday 4 May 89.

           DCI rang me. He has contacted             lof the
Entertainments NIG; they have no internal expertise and refer
all crowd matters to the Home Office and the Police. He
offered two contacts: (i) MrI             ], who is head of
Defence and Disciplines Services NIG, does have an interest in
crowd control - investigated a grandstand collapse 5 years ago
which may be relevant. (2) Prof.             I- University of
Bradford - possible data and expertise on powder flow in
chemical engineering plant which may be useful for crowd
modelling.

I attended the opening of the Court of Inquiry at the Town Hall
under Lord Justice Taylor and the two assessors, Professor
Leonard Maunder and Chief Constable Brian Johnson. The aims of
the Inquiry were to find out what happend and why, and to make
recommendations. The Inquiry would be in two phases to cover
both these aims. The judge granted 7 of the 14 applications
made for representation at the Inquiry. After lunch I
accompanied the Court (Taylor, Maunder, Johnson and QCs and COI
staff) to Hillsborough and described the work in hand. With Mr
      land MrI     lwe demonstrated the instability of the wall
which extends from the Leppings Lane end towards the South
stand at the south-west edge of the ground. I explained my
concern that this critical evidence may have been destroyed
before being witnessed and accepted by others. Lord Justice
Taylor and Prof. Maunder returned to the Town Hall to consider
what instructions they would give to Sheffield Wednesday, i.e.
demolish, or buttress or allow a separate protecting wall to be

                              -i-
constructed. They were to contact Sheffield Wednesday direct
on Friday p.m.

During discussion with Chief Superintendent Pemberton, Prof.
Maunder and the Secretariat, it was established that HSE was
reporting to Professor Maunder but that written reports would
be sent initially to C S Pemberton who would circulate copies
to the Secretariat. Accordingly a copy of the interim report
on the wall was sent to C S Pemberton.

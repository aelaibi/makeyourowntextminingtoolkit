 CONTINGENCY FUNDS


 You asked for comments on Mr Malone-Lee's note of 4 May, in
 particular as regards the Bellwin Scheme.

 2. The first point to mention is that the Scheme is being
 replaced by a statutory provision in the Local Government and
 Housing Bill.  I attach a copy of Clause 125 which sets out the
 scope of any emergency financial assistance to local authorities.
 You will note that, as with Bellwin, the new powers relate only
 to emergency work undertaken immediately after the event.  It is
 not intended to cover any "follow-up” expenditure (such as an
 inquiry into the cause of a disaster). The Chief Secretary has
 also made it clear that authorities must not be allowed to come
 to regard Exchequer assistance, over and above their normal RSG
 and other grant payments, as something to which they are
 automatically entitled whenever some pre-set criteria are met.

 3. As to how the new powers will be exercised, briefly it is
 intended that any scheme made by DOE would specify a threshold
 (as with Bellwin) based on £s per head of population.
 Expenditure above the threshold would attract grant at a
 percentage yet to be decided (75% in the case of Bellwin). There
 is no specific provision for payments of this kind (which are
 expected to be rare) in RSG settlements. They will fall,
 presumably, on the Reserve.

  4. On a wider issue, we did raise with Treasury our concerns
  that in seeking statutory powers to make such payments DOE might
 make life difficult for us as regards special grant payments to
 the police (eg in respect of the miners strike and inner-city
  riots). There is no specific power in the 1964 Police Act for
• these grant payments and we rely on the general powers in the -
 Appropriation Acts. Treasury thought not (see letter attached)
 but I do wonder whether if we are to have a formal Scheme (with
 or without a contingency fund) to meet the costs arising from
  incidents like Hillsborough we would also be expected to have
  specific statutory power to make such payments. We decided last
 year not to seek such a power but, of course, a vehicle does
 exist in the Local Government and Housing Bill.

^ E M E R G E N C Y FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE        ' LOCAL AUTHORITIES
   Barry Potter has asked me to respond                              to     your   letter   of
   12 September to John Roberts at DOE.
   2.   You asked in particular for a Treasury view on whether the
   adoption by DOE of specific powers to make emergency financial
   assistance available to local authorities will leave your practice
   of making similar payments to the Police somewhat exposed.
   (I assume,  incidentally, that by implication you are clear that
   the DOE powers uzould not cover all emergency financial assistance
   payments to local authorities, including Police authorities.)
   3.   While accepting DOE's view that it might be better to take
   statutory powers to make emergency financial assistance payments,
   we do not feel here that specific statutory powers are essential
   for emergency payments to Police authorities, in order to meet the
   terms of the 1932 Concordat with the Public Accounts Committee.
   You.may care to look at Section K8 of the latest edition of
   Government Accounting.    That records that, the Treasury will
   continue to aim to observe the principle that, where it is desired
   that continuing functions should be exercised by a Government
   Department Jparticularly where such functions involve financial
   liabilities extending beyond a given year) It is proper that the
   powers and duties to be exercised should be defined by specific
   statute.
   4.   I do not think that the possibility of emergency payments to
   Police authorities falls clearly into this category.        It is
   normally    for    Police authorities   t<?   deal  with whatever
   circumstances arise without additional finance* from       central
   government.     The fact that the Government has on occasions made
   payments for a variety of reasons to meet differing circumstances,
   such as the coal strike and Inner city riots,does not seem to be a
   clear continuing function of the Home Office.
5.    I therefore see no reason to press you to take statutory
powers, although you may feel that it would be desirable to do so
given. DOE's view.  If that is your conclusion, there is certainly
no objection in Parliamentary Supply propriety terms.
6.   I am copying this letter to John Roberts (DOE), Colin Jones
(Welsh Office), Messrs Rosie and Jamieson (Scottish Office), Tony
Budd (Cabinet Office) and to Barry Potter here.

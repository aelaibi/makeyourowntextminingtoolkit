    Dear Mr. Mould,
  • rhe    .
          Hillsborough Inquiry - Interim Report

    I thank you for your letter dated 18th ultimo, and note its contents in respect
    of the two initial problems experienced with regard to recommendations 2 and 4
    of Chapter 24 of the above Report.

    In connection with recommendation 2, perhaps I ought to emphasise that the
    eighteen years' experience which I have had with the Liverpool and Everton
    grounds has taken full account of the spacing and strength of the crush barriers
    concerned, and I would still be happy to exceed the 54 persons per lOm^ which is
    recommended in the Green Guide. Nevertheless, I appreciate that the politics of
    the matter might dictate a firm requirement for not exceeding that figure.

    With regard to recommendation no. 4, I attach hereto an extract of my own
    comments upon this, which were contained in an appendix to my report to the City
    Council on the implementation of the Hillsborough Report's recommendations.
    This explains the problems of principle in slightly more detail, and might be
    helpful to you in your further consideration of the matter.

    One further matter which is causing concern here arises from recommendations 42
    and 43 of the Report.  I would welcome your views on these problems at an early
    date. Firstly, it seems doubtful if either of these two requirements could be
    enforced under the provisions of the existing legislation. Conditions attached
    to safety certificates can only have as their objective the securing of
    reasonable safety at the stadium. The provision of transport for persons who
    take ill or are injured at a football match, is really no different to that at
    any other venue used for public entertainment. There must be many examples of
    other such licensed entertainment where the paying public are equally at risk of
    illness or injury as they are at football matches, given that proper attention
    is paid to securing physical safety and adequate competent stewarding.

              Ambulance Authority is an emergency service w hich should be capable of
          providing ambulances required at any venue in their area when a disaster arises.
          It seems unreasonable within the context of the safety of the public to require
          them to be allocated exclusively in numbers, at football grounds, and not at all
          at those other places. This certainly seems to be a matter which requires a
          change in the legislation or the provision of an order under Section 15A of the
          1975 Act.

           You will be interested to kn ow that what I have done here for both Everton and
          Liverpool grounds, is to accept one fully-equipped ambulance provided by the
          St. John Ambulance Brigade, together with two other ambulances provided by the
          Ambulance Authority, situated near the ground. The first ambulance is part of
          the service provided to the clubs by the St. John Ambulance Brigade for many
          years now. It is paid for by the clubs, and the money received has been of
          great assistance to the St. John Ambulance Brigade in m a in t aining its
          fully-equipped ambulance, which is used at many other venues between matches.The
          attendance of the St. John Ambulance Brigade within the ground has always been a
          condition of the general safety certificate, but the provision of the ambulance
          has not been specified, and has been accepted by the clubs as part of the
         ^package.

          It has been agreed by all parties, although some friction has been obvious
          between the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the local A m bulance Authority during
          the discussions, that this ambulance satisfies the recommendation no. 42. The
         provision of the additional two ambulances raises two issues so far as the clubs
         are concerned. The first is do they have to pay for this service, and why, if
         it is not an enforceable requirement under the legislation, and included in the
         safety certificate? The second issue is whether ambulances provided at the
         ground ought to be furnished exclusively by the Ambulance Authority. It is
         currently the case that the Ambulance Authority may be contemplating industrial
         action in support of a pay claim. Therefore, if such action materialises, at
         any time, it is very probable, at best, that only genuine emergency work will be
         undertaken. That has been the case on occasions when the Fire Service has taken
         industrial action.   In those circumstances, the football programme in Liverpool
         U n d indeed throughout the whole country) could be brought to a standstill if
         the provision of such ambulances was made a condition of the safety certificate.

         I am sure this last point will be a matter of concern for your Department if it
         is proposed to amend the legislation to include the provision of ambulances
         under the general need for reasonable safety at football grounds. Does your
         Department support the provision of ambulances only by the Ambulance Service?
         Do you think that is likely to be part of any order made under Section 15A?

         Yours sincerely,




         City Building Surveyor.

Dear Mr Bush

THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - INTERIM REPORT

Thank you for your letter of 9 August about the Hillsborough
Inquiry's Interim Report.    I do realise the pressure which a
report of this sort places on those in local authority with
responsibilities for safety certification under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975.      We all appreciate the effort and
commitment which you and others are giving to the implementation
of the Report's recommendation as far as possible before the
beginning of the new football season.

Recommendation 2 of the Interim Report is, I believe, considered
an interim measure which together with other measures recommended
in the report is designed to maintain safety in the short term.
For our part we would not under any circumstances recommend a
calculation of capacity based on a density figure greater than 54
people per 10 square metres (now reduced by 15% in line with the
Interim Report). This is the maximum figure quoted in the Guide
to Safety and Sports Grounds and should be used only in the way
described in paragraph 221 of the Guide.   Any figure higher than
this would not be commensurate with the spacing and strength
specification set out in the Guide for crash barriers and, as a
result, would be liable to pose an undue risk to the safety of
spectators.

On the question of police responsibility referred to in the
Interim Report, the Guide makes clear that responsibility for the
safety   within  the  ground   lies  with  the  ground  operator.
Paragraph 204 of the Guide makes it clear that to discharge this
responsibility properly a special police presence inside the
ground may be necessary.     The relevant recommendation of the
Hillsborough Inquiry takes into account the position found to
exist at that ground on 15 April where certain functions and
responsibilities were regarded as having been taken over by the
police.  What is important here is that both the police and the
club should have a written agreement setting out the lines of
responsibility for each and in this way avoid the confusion of
which you speak.

I am copying this   to both   Liverpool   and Everton Football   Clubs
for information.

                                           Yours sincerely

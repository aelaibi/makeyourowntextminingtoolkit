      Dear Sirs,


      RE: PAUL WILLIAM CARLILE (deceased) AND OTHERS


      I write in acknowledgment of your letter of the 15 April 1992
      enclosing documentation in support of an application under
      section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for the consent of the
      Attorney General to make an application to the High Court for an
      order quashing   the   inquisitions held in respect      of  six
      individuals who died in the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


      The matter is receiving attention and I will write to you again
      as soon as possible.


      Yours faithfully,




      S. J. WOOLER

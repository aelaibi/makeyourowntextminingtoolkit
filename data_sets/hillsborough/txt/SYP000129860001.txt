              At 9 , 0 0 a.m.            < 09 00 ),     Saturday,            15th April,                1989       <150489),            I commenced

              duty      at H a m m e r t o n R o a d P o l i c e            Station.

              At 9 , 3 0 a.m.            (0930)       the      same       day,     I arrived             at H i l l s b o r o u g h        football

             flow       through          the    turnstiles            from about              1 1 . 0 0 a.m«             This        increased

              steadily           up u n t i l     3.00        p.m.    with        the    majority             of N o t t s        Forest       fans

              coming          through       these       particular            turnstiles                being        orderly         and      well

              behaved.             I saw       n o t h i ng    o f the       inside          of    the     g round         u n t i 1 af ter

             3.00       p.m.      as     I was      behind          these     turnstiles                all     of      t hi s    time.

             At      j us t    after      3.00      p.m.       I went        through          the       rear       of    the      South Stand

             with       Sergeant          Turner.             We    we re    to    go    to       the    gymnasium               to m e a l    at    this

             time.            We w a l k e d    down     the        players        tunnel          and     turned          right        along       the

             South       Stand.           At    this     time        I saw        the    game       wa s      in     progress           and    the
ground       appeared          to     be      full       to    capacity.                 As    I looked          towards           the      West

Stand    I saw        that         the     people         on    the       terraces             below were             surging

forward       to     the      fences          in the m i d d l e           section             ’CM'       and    *C S ’ in

particulary           behind          the      goal       mouth       people             were       pressed        to      the     fences

and    climbing          over       the       top.            I could          also       see       supporters             climbing

from    the     terraces            into       the       stand       above.              I could          see    officers             trying

to    contain        supporters               who    were       on    the       perimeter              track       and      s ide         line s

and more        officers            moving          into       this       area       to       try and          contain        supporters

from    ovet— s p i l l i n g        onto          the    pitch,            I carried               on w a l k i n g       a round         the

perimeter          track       and       across          the    front          of    the       Spion Kop which                   appeared

full    to    capacity             with       Notts       Forest          supporters.

Upon    arrival          at    the       gymnasium             we    were       immediately                directed           back         to

the    pitch.         As      I went          back       onto       the     peri inter          track          I saw       that       the

game    had     been       stopped            and    that       Liverpool                supporters             had     converged

around       the     goal      mouth          at    the W e s t       Stand          side,           I was       directed             to    form

part    of a       cordon          in f r o n t      of       the    Spion          K o p as        Notts       Forsts        supporters

were    beginning             to    get       aggravated             about          the       game     being       suspended               and

were    surging          towards           the      fences.           At       t h is     time       I saw a L i v e r p o o l

supporter          run     from      the       Liverpool             crowd          on    the       pitch across             the          half

way    line     and      into       the N o t t s         Forest          end.           He was        shouting            and    goading

the N o t t s      Forest          fans       and    gesturing             two       fingered             signs       at    them.           1

was    instructed             by a       senior          officer          to    get       him       off    the     pitch.             I

approached           him      as    Police          Const, ble        6 0 G o d ley            came       up    behind       him a n d

detained        him.          1'he m a n       was       about       30    years          of    age       and    wearing          a       red

obviously          drunk       as    he       smelled          very       strongly             of    dr ink.          Police

Constable          Godley          took       him    from       the       pitch          and    I was          joined       by S e r g e a n t

Turner.         As    I looked             across         the       pitch       I saw          that       more    Liverpool

supporters           were      on    the       pitch and             that       a number             of    them were             l y in g       on

the    ground,        several            of    them       looked          in o b v i o u s          pain,       it w a s     o n l y at

                                                                                                                                            R <*+14-

this       p o i nt    I realised              some        of       them       had    been       injured          and       immediately

went       to a s s i s t .         I went           to    a young             man    of    about       15 y e a r          old,       who       was

ly i n g    on     his      back       clutching               his    lower          abdomen          and     complaining                of

pain,         I loosened               his     clothes              and    saw a young                girl       in a St.             J o h n ’s

Ambulance             uniform.              I asked            her    to       get    a stretcher                to    move       the       boy.

She      never        returned          but       a man also               in a St.          J o h n ’s u n i f o r m            approached

with       a stretcher.                 Sergeant               Turner          and myself             with       two       other       officers

who      I don't           k now,      carried            the       boy    across          the    pitch          to    th e      s ide      of     the

gymnasium where                   other        injured              people       were       being       treated             by m e d i c s .

We went          directly           b a ck     with        the       stretcher             and    saw       t h at     there          were       more

injured          in the          same       area.          We       found       another          ma n who         was       semi­

conscious,                 He w a s     l aid o n the                stretcher             and    carried             by    us    to     the

gymnasium,             where        there         were         at    least       twenty          pe o p l e      laid       on    the

gymnasium             fl oo r.         As    a medic            attended             to    him we       left          the     gym with             the

s t r e t cher        to    go    back       to      the       pitch,           I overheard             c o n v e r sat ions             at      I hi s

t im e     claiming           people         had      died          in the       crowd.

It w a s      o n l y at         this       t im e    I realised                the       severity          of    the       incident.               As

I returned             to    the       pitch         for       a third          time,       I sa w      t h at        it w a s        covered

with       supporters             and       Police,            hoardings             around       the       pitch were                being

ripped        up      by    supporters               who       were       carrying          them       to     stretcher               the

injured          from       the     pitch.            I returned                to    the    same       area          with       the

stretcher             where       I saw a man                  on    the       floor       being       given          heart       massage

and      mouth        to m o u t h .         He w a s          about       35 years          of ag e          wearing            and     red a n d

white       shirt          and    of    heavy         build,.             His    face       was       blue       and       his    eyes

o pe n „                                                                                                    He

appeared           dead and            did     not        respond          to    reviving.              We       placed          him     on      the

outside        th e      g y m arid as          we    entered         with        the       deceased            on    the       stretcher

there        were     at    least         another          dozen       bodies           i nside.            A C.I.D.            officer

called        Detective             Constable          Locking          f r o m H a m m e r ton R o a d               told        one    of       us

to     stay wi th          t he     body.        This       was       done       by a n       officer           who       ha d a s s i s t e d

us,    myself         and      Sergeant          Turner          then went             b a ck     to    the      pitch.

This     t ime      at     the      West       Stand       side       there       were        no m o r e        injured           or    dead

on th e       pi tc h.         I heard          a Liverpool             fan       shouting             “Y o u    bastards,              you

fucking        killed          them."           He    was    ignored             and       ra n a c r o s s      the       pitch

towards        the       South       Stand.           I saw an          officer             I know          from      West        Bar

Police        Station.              He    stated       how       he    had       been       pulling          supporters                from

the     terraces.              He    said       that       one    man       he    had       pul led out              was     dead and

that     as    he     tried         to    revive       him,       Liverpool                fans      shouted,             "Murderer,

you     killed        him."          He    was       extremely          upset          and       I stayed with                  him     for       a

time     until        he w a s       assisted          by m e m b e r s          of    his       s eri al .

I was        directed          to    form       part       of a       cordon across                  the     centre          line,       which

I di d       with     ather         officers,          two       of w h o m       were        on m y        original            ser ia l,

and     we    thought          it    b e st     to    stay       together             at    this       time.          While        in this

lost     in the          confusion.              Then       there       were          other       fans       who      seemed

completely            unconcerned               for    the       dead and             in j u r e d .        Some      asking           why    the

th e    stadium          but      for     about       fifteen         minutes              the    cr o w d s     didn't           seem       to

dissipate.               After       about       thirty minutes                   when        the      ground         had       almost

cleared,         myself           and     two    colleagues             went          to L e p p i n g s        Lane       where        we

joined with              members          of    our    original             serial.

On     reflection,             there; w a s          a distinct             contrast             between Liverpool                      and

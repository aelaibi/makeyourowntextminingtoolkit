                   I am a single man living at the above address with my parents.                          I am a

                   member           ° ^ T
                            of the Liverpool      /
                                             FC Supporters             club (Cornwall).



                   On Saturday     15th April,      1989 (150489)      I travelled by coach to

                   Sheffield for the Liverpool -v- Nottingham Forest match.                         The coach

                   picked me up ori the A3S at Plymouth at 7.30 am (0730 hrs).

                   Approximately 40 - 43 persons travelled in the coach.



                   During the journey we stopped for breakfast at Exeter Services.                          We

                   stopped for about 45 mi/fiutes.           We experienced a slight delay on the

                   Motorway near to Nottingham and when we got to Sheffield traffic was

                   very heavy.       I car/*t give a distance but we were crawling for about

                   half an hour.      1/ can honestly        say that no one on the coach was

                                                                            SI 694

drinking.     We were worried that the Police might check the coach but

no check was made.



In Sheffield we parked on a road with other coaches.  Before we parked
                                        1 O
we had dropped off the Chairman,              who had to collect

tickets from the ground.       After    parking we, waited about ten minutes,

it was then about 2.30 pm (1430 hrs) and coaches of Liverpool

supporters were still arriving.          We all    decided to get off the coach

and walk down to the ground to meet         Ian.    When we met him we found out

that he only had the seating tickets and so a few of us ran back to

the coach to fetch the standing tickets.            We got the tickets and ran

back to the ground.



When I      got to the entrance to the g/ound there was a mass of people

trying to get through the turnstiles.         There was no order       to it and no

formal queues.     As I got into this mass         there was a   lot of pushing and

jostling with people      trying to preserve       their places and to keep away

from the Police horses and at the same time trying to avoid injuring

small    children that were   in the crowd.



Near to the turnstiles      there were     barriers forming people into lines

and to      my right I saw a young boy being       lifted out of the crowd and

over a wall.     He was   crying and obviously distressed and I think this

was done to avoid him being crushed against the wall.



Before   I reached the    turnstiles,    a gate    to my right   opened and people

started to move through it.  There w a s n ’t/any great rush just a

movement of the crowd and I went with i .%.     It was a big gate and this

gate opening relieved all the pressune.

                  to the terrace was through a tunnel         but 1 can't remember any signs.



                  In the paddock     inside the gate     I spoke to Policeman and asked him what

                  I should do with my ticket.         He said not to worry about it and

                  indicated for me to go in the general direction of the tunnel.



                  When I went into the tunnel        I was with a large number of other     people

T V M & L         and when I got ne^r to the tej^ra'ce people         in the tunnel were fairly

—            _    tightly packed ana there was no chance of getting out again.             Where

                  the tunnel     divides with a railing down the middle       people were being

                  squashed against     it.     When we got towards the far end of the tunnel

                  the crowd was moving quite slowly,         but as it opened onto the terrace

                  the pressure returned and there was no room to move.



                  As I got onto the terrace        I noticed people being lifted up into the

                  seated stand and my first thought was that they were trying to get

                  seats.    I realized later that the)',»fnust have just been trying to get

                  out of the crush.       On the tejsYace I was    in Pen 3 and the pressure of

    ''            people from behind took ja fe straight to the front,        about five peopl

                  back from the front.

                  There was no choice as to where         I could stand.    I just had to go with

                  the   crowd.   At that stage there were people showing         concern by saying

                  "Push back,     push back",    but no realisation as to how serious

                  the situation was becoming.



                  I could see a bit of the play on the pitch and when it came near to

            j£5 the West stand goal          there was a > d r g e forward as everyone tried to get

               could hardly breathe.         I was under       constant    pressupa- far about S

               minutes and I was having difficulty in ^©lathing.                  I think   I must have

               blacked out because        I then had a , ^ r s o n   behind me slapping me on the

               face.     This brought me ro^yp^Kafnd this same            person lifted me f orward

               and up towards the railings of the fence and I just started

               climbing.       This   person was    in his early 2 0 ’s, a big lad with dark hair,

               unshaven and a moustache,           he had a beige jacket on.        He probably saved

               my life. As I was        climbing the fence       I looked round and to my left saw

               a person who had no movement and no colour at all                 in his face.      I

               think he was dead whilst         standing upright.         He couldn't have fallen

               down due to the pressure around him.               He was a white male, about 24 -

               23,   I d o n ’t think very tall,      dark curly hair,       short to medium length,

               and he may have had a moustache.              I c o ul d n ’t see what he was wearing.



               As I was climbing out of the PiHi a Policeman was telling me to get

               I then saw a young boy on the pitch who had got separated from his

               Father.     He was crying and I walked him to a lady with long dark hair

               and asked her to look after him.              I then went and sat down and

               regained my senses.



               I then noticed people breaking up the hoardings to use as stretchers

               and so I went to help them.                 /

    collar    length,   he had no trousers on and his shirt was open.          He was

    unconscious.        I ca n ’t remember the other two.



    We w e r e n ’t told who to take, we just took the hoardings down to the

    end and another group were sliding the injured onto the boards.



    I left the ground at about 4.20 - 4.30 <1620 - 1630 h r s ) when I w a s n ’t

    needed any more.        I went to an estate nearby,     Queensway Superstore and

    Allied Carpets,      and they were   letting   people use their phones, and

    people    in houses were    coming out offering to let people use their

    phones.     I phoned home to say I was al^-arght.




    Before the gates were opened the Mounted Police Officers were shouting

    at   people to get back.      The horses were bucking and there were a

    number of children about.         They couldn't afford to break the crowd up

    with the horses as this would have caused injuries.            A line of

    Officers    in front    could have eased the pressure.      There w a s n ’t any

    anti-Police feeling,       just an urgency to get in for the kick-off.

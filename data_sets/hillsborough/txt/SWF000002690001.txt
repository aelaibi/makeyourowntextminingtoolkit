                                         S T A T E M E N T

I,     STUART         ROWLAND THORPE of
                 WILL SAY as FOLLOWS:


I    was        born on 1st June 1930.              I am employed as
                                                                         I have           been      a
steward          for 22 years at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club                                and
for     the       last 15 years have been Chief Steward                       for       the     West
Stand.


I     am    in overall charge of the stewards and gate                            men      at     the
West       Stand.           Mr Albert Marsh is the Assistant                 Chief         Steward
and        is normally responsible for the gate men at B and C                                  gates
and        the    stewards            who are positioned at    the       bottom            of     the
stairsleading to                     the West Stand seated area.             In     the        seated
area       there are six gangways known by the letters U, V, W, X, Y
and        Z.There is a steward                 for each gangway.       Normally,               there
are        26    staff          in total in attendance at the West                 Stand        area
excluding             the           turnstile    operators   for    whom           I      am      not
responsible.               This arrangement has remained for about the                           last
three years.


It     is normal for stewards and gate men to turn up at least two
hours       before              a    match, but for an important match it                     may be
necessary to attend four hours before the kick-off.


I     am responsible for paying the stewards and gatemen. When the
stewards          and gatemen arrive they hand over their passes and                                I
also        take a ticket from their booklet.                 I keep the jackets                   in
a     cupboard             in    the snack bar at the rear of            the        West        Stand
seated          area.           Before    the    end of a match        the        stewards        and
gatemen          hand back their jackets and I provide them with                                their
passes          and        their      payment for the match.       I    have a           radio to
enable          me to           keep in contact with Doug Lock, the Club Security
Officer.              If        there    is any crowd trouble or injuries                     in the
crowd        I would radio Doug Lock to inform him of the                              situation.
                                                -    2   -




I    would         also       obtain    the assistance of               the     nearest    Police
Officer.            If       there     are insufficient numbers of                 stewards,          I
would also contact Doug Lock by radio.


For     FA Cup matches, stewards and gatemen must be in attendance
at least four hours before the kick-off.


Before       the commencement of each season, the stewards and                                     gate
men     attend           a    meeting at      Hillsborough.              Registration           takes
place    when            the stewards and gatemen are provided with                            passes
containing              their photographs.           Briefing also takes place                     with
regard        to        evacuation       procedures, ticket              systems,        and       each
steward            or        gateman    is    issued         with   a    document        known       as
"Instructions                 for    Match Day Staff". Representatives from                         the
Fire     Brigade              and    Police   are present to             take     part     in       the
briefing.


The     evacuation              procedures     are       important        particularly             with
regard        to        any fire and we are informed as to the                      code       which
will     be        broadcasted          over the public             address      system.           This
briefing           has only occurred in recent seasons and no                            doubt       is
as a result of the Bradford fire disaster.


We     are told what to do in the event of an evacuation and                                       also
where        the        fire extinguishers are kept in the                    Ground.          I     do
brief        the stewards under my control on a regular basis                              as        to
the     positions of the fire extinguishers in the West Stand.                                        E
do     not     do this for every match, but it is done on                            a     regular
basis        and certainly before any big match.


The task of the stewards is to direct spectators to their seats
and     to assist them where possible together with complying with
the     evacuation              procedure.      The gatemen are               responsible           for
ensuring           that        the gates are manned at all times to allow                           the
Police        and        other officials access to the ground, to open                              the
gates        inthe           event of an emergency, and to                open     the     gates
shortly before the end of a match.
                                                     -   3   -




Both        the        gatemen        and        stewards        are   not   responsible               for
controlling             crowds         inside the ground or for dealing with                           any
problems          of        crowd violence or misbehaviour.                   The        Police        are
responsible for such matters.


On     match days either                            or myself picks up the                 keys        from
the     main           office        area       to check whether B           and     C     gates        are
unlocked.              Normally we find that the gates are unlocked.                                   The
caretaker              is                        and he goes round in the                morning         to
unlock the gates to the ground. I normally take up position                                              to
the right hand side of the seated area near the fire escape                                              if
of     course I am not walking around the West                               Stand       supervising
and dealing with any problems that may arise.


Before           the        match     is over, I am responsible                for       paying         the
stewards           and once the match is over I am also responsible                                     for
ensuring           that the West Stand is clear of any supporters. About
ten     minutes before the end of the match the gates are                                        opened.
It     is not normal to keep the away fans behind for a period                                           of
time        as     often happens at many other grounds.                            The West           Stand
has     for        the last few years been used only for away                               fans        and
the     access              ways     leading to the West Stand area do                      not        lead
directly           to        other     access       ways serving other              parts        of     the
ground.


I now turn to my involvement in the events which took place                                              on
15th        April 1989 at Hillsborough.                          I left work at about 10                eon,
having           worked        since        6    am doing overtime. I              walked        to     the
ground           which took about 20 minutes.                       I picked up my radio                and
made        my     way        to the West Stand.                 I was told at       the     previous
match        by Doug Lock that ten temporary stewards were                                  reporting
to     me for the FA Cup semi-final.                             He also told me that all the
stewards           had to arrive for the semi-final by 11 am and I                                     told
my stewards this at the previous match.


I     was        told by the Chief Steward in the North Stand                               by        radio
                                                       -   4   -




that    two Liverpool stewards were arriving and that 7 or 8 more
would    be        coining.             The two stewards are known                 as
                   and       attended the ground for the semi-final held                                  the
previous       year.               It    is    also common practice                for
                   to     travel         with the Liverpool             supporters             attending
away    matches,              and       they    were obviously          well       known            to     the
Liverpool           supporters.                During the 1988 semi final,
                    had        stewarded         the       terrace    with     about           6         other
Liverpool stewards.


My     intention was to do the same this year,
duly turned up and we chatted together for about 10 minutes.                                                 I
know     them           both quite well and we are on very friendly                                  terms.
After about 10 minutes another 7 or 8 Liverpool stewards joined
us.     At that time I was standing with                                             at the bottom
of     the steps nearest to C gate.                            These stewards asked if                    they
could        also steward the stand, but I explained that my stewards
had     already been allocated to the stewarding of the stand, and
that     they           (the Liverpool stewards) were needed to look                                     after
the     terraces             as      before.        I realised that all             the        LiverpooL
stewards           would have prefered to work the stands, but I eon sure
that they accepted the position and realised why I would not be
prepared to send my stewards onto the terraces.


I     arranged           for       six     of the temporary            stewards          to        take     up
position           with an experienced steward from each of the gangways
to     the     seated area.                                                 told me that a                 lot
of     fans were coming from Liverpool without tickets.                                        They also
said     that they thought there was going to be a lot of trouble.
At     the     previous year's semi-final held at                            Hillsborough,                 the
Grand        National             was held the same day               and a large             number        of
Liverpool               supporters            had   attended         that    event.           The        Grand
National was not held on the same day this year.


As     the     stewards and gate men arrived, I issued the                                     steward's
jackets.           At about 11.30 am, a police inspector, whom I know by*
sight        but        do     not       know by name, asked           me     to     assemble              the
                                                     -   5   -




stewards               from the           seated area. I do know that                  this        police
inspector               isnicknamed          Captain         Birdseye owing            to        his      big
beard.            He took the             names of the two stewards who would be                              on
the     fire           escapes. He told the stewards that if there was                                       any
trouble           they must fetch a police officer; they were not to get
involved.               He also explained that there was a different colour
ticket           to     the        seats    compared to           the      standing        area.          The
inspector showed them the two types of ticket.


I     did    mention              to the police inspector that at                      the       previous
year's           semi-final a number of police officers had stood in the
gangways              which prevented the stewards from carrying out                                   their
duties           ie.     to        keep the gangways clear.                   He     confirmed           that
police           officers would not be standing in the gangways.                                    I        did
ask                                         to stay with me on the stand because                               I
and     my own stewards had already experienced problems and                                             alot
of     abuse from the Liverpool supporters going into this                                          stand.
Until                                             started to help us the Liverpool fans
had     refused              to        let us follow our usual practice                     of     tearing
corners           off        the tickets as they enter the stands (to                              prevent
the practice of tickets being thrown down to fans below).                                                Once
                                  standing with us, we had no further problems in
persuading              the fans from allowing us to tear the corners                                    off.
This all took place at about 2.15 pm.


At     about           2.40 pm Malcolm Bain, one of the gatemen to C                                    gate,
told        me        that more Liverpool stewards were trying to come                                       in,
but     he        had        stopped them.           I said that was fair enough                        as     I
suspected              they        simply        wanted to get in to               watch     the        game.
Apart        from                                                I never      saw     any        Liverpool
stewards again after about 2.40 pm.


Everthing              went smoothly until about 2.30 pm.                           From my position
at     the rear of the seated area at that time I was able to look
down        upon        the turnstiles behind the West Stand.                              I could           see
the     build up of supporters outside.                               I went to the stewards by
the     two           sets        of     steps     leading       to     the    seated        area.           One
                                                -   6    -




complained          that there were no police nearby.                        I asked a senior
officer,        I       do    not know who, to arrange for police to                           be      in
attendance          by       these     steps.       He       arranged       for       four     police
officers       to        be positioned at the bottom of each door                              leading
to     the stairs.           At about 2.45 pm I noticed supporters climbing
over     the turnstiles.                I saw the officers at the bottom of                           the
right       hand steps (ie those nearest C gate) going over to                                       stop
the     supporters,             and they then proceeded to eject a number                              of
them through C Gate.


At     2.50     pm       C    Gate     was opened and             there    was         a     surge     of
supporters          who         gained entry through the gate.                    I        shouted     to
the     stewards at the bottom of the right hand steps to shut the
Gates        to those steps and to only let in those who showed                                      seat
tickets.            I    could see that the stewards were suffering a                                 lot
of     verbal           abuse     in    the seated area.            I     went        over     to     the
stewards           in the seated area including my two sons who were                                   in
V and W gangways.


I     then     went to the bottom of the right hand steps. It was                                      at
that     point           that     C    Gate was opened again               and        there     was     a
massive        influx           of supporters.          I do not believe               that        anyone
could        have stopped them.             I said to the stewards                     at both sets
of     steps        that        they must ensure the gates to the                          steps     were
kept    shut.             I had asked for these              gates to       be        provided some
five    to six           years ago as I explained at that time the                            problem
of     those with tickets for the standing area attempting to gain
access        to        the seated area.        The police agreed with                       the     idea
and the Club very soon afterwards installed the gates.


The     police           at the turnstiles were knocked to one side. I                                did
not     hear        any request or order for                 the gate to be opened,                   nor
did     I     see         who     opened the gate.            I    went     upstairs           to     the
stewards to make sure that they were allright.


One     police officer told me that I should tell the stewards                                         to
discard        their jackets as otherwise the stewards could expect a
                                              -    7   -




lot     of     abuse. The swearing was much worse than usual and                            the
police        officers were being subjected to a great deal of abuse.
There        were     two to three officers for each turnstile                       for    the
terraced        area       and      I   remember there      were    about       20    police
officers        in     total in position behind these turnstiles.                          This
is quite normal for a big match.


I     went     off to tell the stewards in the seated area to                          remove
their        jackets.       This was at about kick-off time.                I told         them
to     roll     up the jackets and put them in their pockets.                         Albert
Marsh        went     off to tell some of the stewards and                  gatemen          the
same.


I     remember        going back to the bottom of the right hand                       steps.
Albert        Marsh was present.            Two of the stewards said they                  were
going        to go onto the pitch as there was a lot of trouble.                              At
this stage none of us really knew what was happening.


After the game was stopped, my son came over to me and                                brought
along a Liverpool supporter.                  The Liverpool supporter said that
his brother was on the pitch.                     He was crying.          I took him down
to    the      pitch and noticed the chaos.                There     were       police       and
supporters           on     the pitch.       Some of my stewards went down                  onto
the pitch to try and help.


I     went     back to C Gate and noticed people                   being    brought          out
through        the        central       tunnel either injured        or    on    ambulance
stretchers.           Liverpool supporters were shouting and swearing as
they     made        their       way out through this tunnel.              I    went        back
upstairs to the seated area.


There        were     about seven or eight youths, about 18 -                    20        years
old,     pilfering the snack bar.                  The girls in the snack bar were
involved        in taking water onto the pitch.                I told those            youths
to    clear         off.    However, they carried on and             in the end I had
to    fetch         a police officer.         They then disappeared.             When        the
officer        went,        they came back and told me they were                 going        to
                                              -    8    -




"get    me".        I ran down the stairs and told the                     police        officer
what had happened.


The     stewards then came down from the seated area as they                                  were
very         frightened.          Some   of       the        supporters    had     taken        the
stewards'           jackets       from my cupboard in the snack bar                  which        I
discovered           later.       I went back up the stairs, but noticed that
the     gang of youths had gone.                  It was hard to see from the back
of     the        stand    what    was happening below.               There       were        still
supporters           in    the     seated area.             Many were drunk.        This       was
easy     to see as some were walking on seats and falling off.                                    I
have never seen such drunkenness or bad behaviour before.


I     have        attended 13 semi-finals and this is the worst                          I     have
seen for people being drunk.


I     took my radio back to the club control room as I was advised
to     do so by a police officer.                  The radio meant that I could be
easily        identified as being an official of Sheffield                          Wednesday
Football Club.


When     I     was        at the bottom of the right hand                  steps     and       just
before        I     took the radio back, Doug Lock had spoken to                          me     by
radio        to     check that the stewards and gatemen                    were      allright.
On     returning           from the   club control room,I went back                      to     the
seated        area        which was   more or less empty            by       then. However,
pilfering           was still taking place although by a different group
of people.


I     went        back downstairs.       I told my younger son to go home                        so
that     he        could     tell my wife that we were allright.                     By        this
stage        someone        had    heard on the radio that                there    were        five
reported           dead.      I    sent my other son home shortly                  later.            I
also     arranged           for the   temporary stewards togo                home.           About
4.50     pm I went down to            the pitch to see if I               could do anything
to help.
                                               -    9   -




It     was        still chaotic.        By this stage about               one-third             of     my
stewards           had     gone home.     I felt helpless and was                      stunned         by
what was happening around me.


The     police shortly later started to leave the ground through B
Gate.         I     asked a police officer if it was allright for me                                   to
go     home.        He told me that there was nothing that could be done
and     the       West      Stand     was empty.            I   told    all      the      remaining
stewards they could go home.


I     must     mention that at about 3.05 pm I realised                             that        people
were     starting to climb over the fences, but I did not                                   realise
how     serious the situation was.                      It has never          happened          before
that such numbers have entered through C Gate.


At     last        years        semi final, I saw Police on                the      terraces.           I
cannot        remember          how   many.        They were           underneath         the        West
stand.        I     noticed       these Police Officers as I leant                        over        the
front        of     the     seated     area.       These Police          Officers          were        in
position           well     before     kick off and indeed               were       in     position
shortly           after     the turnstiles opened at mid day.                       I     also        saw
three        or     four Police Officers at the entrance to the                             tunnel.
There        were        also    Police Officers checking fans as                        they        came
through           the     turnstiles. All the pens were open for                          the        1988
semi final.


I     witnessed the Police Officers at the entrance to the                                      tunnel
stopping           fans     from gaining access to the centre pens.                              This
occurred           at     about 2.50 pm.       The Police shut the doors to                           the
tunnel,           the     Police were then directing the fans to                         the         wing
pens     or        the South West and North West pens.                        The      doors         were
kept         closed for about 10 minutes.                       I saw the doors closed and
opened by Police.


The     Police were not letting any fans down the tunnel even when
the     doors were opened again.                   The Police at the doors went                        to
the end of the tunnel to join the rest of the officers who were
                                               -    10   -




deployed       on the terrace side of the tunnel.                     I could see          this
as     I was chatting to the gatemen on C gate.                       I also saw Police
turning       back fans who tried to go down the tunnel.                       The Police
only allowed fans back in who had been to the toilets.


I     then went on my rounds to check that all the other                             stewards
were     alright.               I did not go back again to see if             the      Police
Officers I have described were still in position.                            There were a
number        of        Police Officers by the snack bar to the South                      West
corner.            There    was no barrier to prevent access to the                        South
West     corner.           Nor     were     there        Police on   the     gate     to     the
partition          wall     which was open, but I did deploy a steward                        on
that     gate. At last years semi final there were the same number
of stewards as this years semi final.


It     is important to note that the Police accept                         responsibility
for     the        terraces.        I have never deployed Sheffield                 Wednesday
stewards           on     the     terraces     as I could not expect          any      of    my
stewards           to     run the risk of injury or the threat                of       injury
and     the        Police have made it clear that they                 are     responsible
for     the terraces.              The Police system I have described for last
years     semi           final     is     also similar to that        used     for     league
matches.            However, I have never seen Police Officers shut                          the
doors     to the tunnel.                 I know that I have seen Police              Officers
at     league matches in positions at the entrance and to the rear
of     the tunnel, as I have often chatted to them on occasion                                by
walking through the tunnel.


The     system is different in the sense that the Police                             normally
seal     off the South West pen by putting metal barriers in place
near     the        snack bar.          A number of Police Officers, about 4                  in
number,        are put in position around the barriers.                       The gate        to
the     partition           wall is kept shut, and Police Officers are                       put
behind it.              The fans are then channeled into the centre pens.


The     ground Police Inspector then tells me when he is about                                to
remove        the        barrier        to the South West pen so as to              warn     the
                                                -    11   -




stewards        in case of any rush by fans for the steps leading                               up
to     the seated area.             The Police on the entrance to the                    tunnel
and     the     gate     to the partition wall then direct fans                         to     the
South     West        pen.        Occasionally at big league games                    theSouth
West     pen        fillsup.        On those        occasions, the ground             Inspector
would     then        tell me that he was about to open the                      North        West
pen.


Very     often fans would come up to me to say they could not                                   see
from     the        South     West pen.        I would then speak to             the         ground
Inspector           to request that he open the North West pen. He would
listen        but he did not always open the gate immediately.                                Very
often     he decided to wait to see if more fans were coming                                   into
that area of the ground.


This     ground        Inspector          is   the same        Police     Officer        I     have
described with a beard.                   Normally he was positioned in the area
behind        the     turnstiles.          He has been the ground Inspector                     for
the Leppings Lane area for the last 3 seasons.


Because        of this practice I have always accepted the Police had
responsibility           for ensuring the             pens were not over crowded.                   I
should        mention that          when the          fans were channeled             into     the
centre        pens     and then perhaps to the South West pen, and                           then
onto     the        North     West pen if large numbers                 attended,        it    was
normal        for     only        the staircase nearest to B gate to                    be     left
open.         The     away        fans who had seat tickets              could        then     gain
access        through turnstiles 11-16                and those standing could                gain
access        through turnstiles A-G.                     However, the other          staircase
was     never        locked.         It    was kept shut         and     6     stewards       were
allocated           to the bottom of the staircase.                    It was necessary to
man the staircase in the event of any emergency.


I did ask the ground Inspector to open the South West and North
West     pens        depending upon the situation at a number of                             league
games.         He     would        often reply to the effect that it                    was     his
responsibility               to     make       such       decisions,     and     it     was      my
                                          -   12   -




responsibility to look after the seated area.


This     is the third season the West stand including the                          terrace
has     been allocated for away fans only.                    Before that, it was of
course allocated between home and away fans.                       Again, the Police
adopted       a     similar system of channeling fans into                 the      centre
pens,     and       when full to direct fans into the South West                    pens.
Prior to the West stand being allocated for away fans, the away
fans     gained       access    to    the centre pens and              South     West     pen
together with          about    one    third of         the    seated     area     through
turnstiles          A-G.   Turnstiles 11-16 were for home fans taking up
the     remainder of the West stand.               That system was in operation
for     something like 3 or 4 seasons and the only material change
was     the       erection of the partition wall.               This    prevented         any
mixing of home and away fans behind the West stand.


Prior     to these developments and the introduction of the                             pens,
the     West stand was an area for home and away fans where                             there
no     attempts made to segregate fans.                  However, since 1966 there
has     never       been to    my    knowledge         stewards   deployed         on     the
terraces.           The Police       have always deployed Officers                 on     the
terraces          and on the front and rear of the tunnel.                     The numbers
have of course varied.


I     must emphasise that whatever the police request me to do,                             I
do.      I    remember on 15th April that there were a                     lot     of     new
officers as normally the same faces can be recognised.                             On this
occasion I did not recognise many of the officers.


This statement is to the, best of my knowledge and belief.

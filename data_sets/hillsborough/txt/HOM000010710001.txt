*   EVIDENCE TO THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY                                    b
During our meeting on 8 M a y you suggested that there was a
precedent which would prevent the Police Federation from giving
evidence to the Taylor inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.  I
u ndertook to look into this and to let you know the outcome.

M y officials tell me that they know of no such precedent.             It must,
however, be borne in mind that Police Federation representatives at
local level are under the direction and control of the chief
constable.         There m a y well be cases wh e r e the chief constable
refused to allow the local Federation representatives to give
evidence on the grounds that this might be prejudicial to the
e v i d e n c e given on behalf of the force.

This is something which the Chief Constable of South Y orkshire
might have to consider if it is envisaged that local branches would
give evidence to the Taylor inquiry.    I can see no reason, though,
w h y the national JCC should not offer to give its views to the
inquiry if it so wishes.

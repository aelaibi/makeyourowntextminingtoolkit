15th April 1989


On Saturday 15th April 1989 I went to watch Liverpool play
Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup Semi-Final. We got on the
coach and when we set off we were talking about the match.    I
went w i t h b u t         he was on another coach. We also saw
Ian Southgate and Phil Hammond.   Back on the coach we w atched a
video about Liverpool, when I got off the coach         was
waiting for me. We started to go to the ground (this was
around lp m) . When we got to the ground        got a body search
before he gave his ticket in. He was clean   so the police let me
go as well. We gave our tickets i n . Then there was another
policeman there, he searched         then he searched me as
well, I had a comb in my back pocket and I had to show it to
him.

We got a programme off two stewards (they where the only one's
I had seen). We got a drink and then we saw the pitch. We had
to go through a tunnel then you where on the terrace. At about
this time it was 1.30pm, it was quite empty. We met Ian and
Phil so we sat down to read our programme.

At about 1.45pm the players came out to check the pitch and we
started to get going with singing and clapping.   At 2.00pm it
was getting pretty full where we were but the sides didn't have
many people in it. We also started talking to two fella's
behind us and three fella's in front of us. We started
shouting and chanting again.   Around 2.45pm you just could not
move, we had a couple of surges before disaster struck when we
got pushed forward people moved to the sides and there was a
big gap to where the barrier was.   I had my arms down by my
sides so the only way I could move my arms was to elbow some
fella in the face and my arms were all right. Then the teams
came out and there was a big surge, I grabbed hold of          t-
shirt and pulled him back.   The teams got called out and I saw
Desmond Lyman pointing to the crowd.

We could not help ourselves we had to go where the crowd was
going.

Around 2.55pm all you could hear was "let us out" at this time
I was sweating like a pig, I was taking my hat off every two
seconds to wipe my face.  All you could hear was "please let us
out, please Brucie help us". Just then there was one hell of a
big push and I saw the front row fall. I had hold of Phil's
hand and it was slipping and slipping, the next thing I could
    1




not keep hold and he fell away and that was the last time I saw
him.

The barrier collapsed and loads of people fell forward, people
who were on the pitch were shouting "push back" I pushed back
and fell over something, when I turned round there was a fella
lying there, his face was blue, he was dead, and I couldn't
help him.

When I fell over the body someone stood on my chest and my
hands, I don't know if I blacked out for a couple of seconds
but the next thing I remember was two lads picked me up and
were asking if I was alright.  I wiped my face again and
started shouting "open the ...... gates" and the police were
jsut standing there. I was shouting with this fella to open the
back doors.  At this time I did not know where Ian, Phil and
      were.

Finally the back doors were opened I started to get out, I
couldn't breathe because my chest was killing me.  I got
dragged out by one fella he said "go on mate, get out there".
I crawled out with a policeman just looking at me. When I got
out of the stand I just broke down.  I got myself back together
and ran straight back in to find the other three.  But there
was so much panic I got halfway down the tunnel, but there were
so many people there.  I pushed my way through but there were
too many bodies lying there we had to carry the dead out, and
al last the police knew there was people dying out there. When
I got to the terrace I could not see any of them. When I was
looking I saw on young lad getting pulled out on the pitch, but
I could not believe it when I saw him getting thrown back in.
I just couldn't believe what had happened.

I went to get a drink and this bloke was charging 40p, I said
that he should be giving us the drink free because of what was
happening, he replied that we were holigans.   Two other blokes
heard this and started to threaten him, but he said that he was
sorry.   I got my drinks and stood
                                     same clothes as         I
                                     wasn't          Then I saw
      |we both ran to each other and threw our arms around each
other, then made our way back to the coaches. We tried to see
if we could use some telephones, but the were packed even in
houses there were queues there. On the way back we met Ian but
there was no Phil.   By now the time was around 3.45pm.

When we got back to the coach       got back on his coach and
Ian and I went to his coach but Phil wasn't there.  I looked
around and saw a social club about 500yds away so we went to
ring my parents.

When we reached the club the queue for the telephone was
enormous, we decided to wait. We had been waiting for rot
twenty minutes, then it was our turn to dial, but we couldn't




                                                           ■■■■
get a line out. We went back down to the coaches and there was
still no sign of Phil.  Ian and I went back to the ground
hoping we could find him, but we couldn't get back on the
terraces and we couldn't find him.   I had a bad feeling that he
had gone, so we made our way back to the coaches with our
fingers crossed that he was there, but when we got back there
was no sign.  Ian made his way back to his coach I shouted if
you need me you know where I was.   I was one of the last people
to get back on the coach.   But even then the coach was only
three quarters full, I jumped off the coach just to see if I
could use any of the car phones which were in the police cars,
but I couldn't.  Then I saw         and he was alright.

When I got back on the coach everyone was just sitting there
stunned by what had happened. About 6.15pm our coach left to
go home.  I just put my hat over my face and fell asleep.     No­
body spoke all the way home.  I was hoping when I woke up that
I would find it was all a bad n ightmare, b u t it wasn't. When
the coach got back to Amberline              w as there to pick me
up and drove me home and I didn't say a word.

When I walked in the door my dad just broke down, when I was
walking down our road everyone was watching and pointing to me.
I learnt later that Ian staved behind and came back in a police
car.                                   [ learnt that Phil H ammond had
passed a w a y ____________________________________________   But that
is nothing to whats happened to the dead.               had hurt his

Just thinking I had hold of Phil's hand and I could do nothing

  STATES: I WAS ON THE MANCHESTER TO SHEFFIELD TRAIN. I GOT O H AT STOCKPORT.
  THERE WERE A LOT OF LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS ON THE TRAIN - THERE WAS A LOT OF
  DRINKING. THEY HAD CARRIER BAGS FULL, THERE WERE A LOT OF EMPTIES AROUND & YOU
  COULD BUY ALCOHOL AT THE REAR OF THE TRAIN. THERE WERE A LOT OF FANS WITHOUT
  TICKETS & I THINK THEY HAD SOME FORGED TICKETS BECAUSE I HEARD SOMEONE SAY
  THESE WILL DO FINE, SHALL WE DO THE SAME FOR LONDON. THE TRAIN ARRIVED ON TIME
  AT SHEFFIELD WHICH WAS APPROX 1320 HRS,, THERE WAS A VERY SAD ATMOSPHERE AS
  THOUGH THERE WAS GOING TC BE TROUBLE.

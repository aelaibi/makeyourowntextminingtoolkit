                  I am a single man and I live at the above address with my parents and

                  two elder brothers.



                  I am a supporter of LiverpofoX Football Club I have been a supporter of

                  the club for most of my life but I have only been attending fixtures

                  regularly for about the l&st eighteen months.   I went to the FA Cup
                     (Vrf
                  Semi-Final at Hillsborough last year as well as attending this year on

                  Saturday 15 April           1989.   (150489).



                  I travelled to .the Sheffield Wedn esday Fojylfball ground with my friend
                                                                        PAGE        2
                                                                        S3349

Both       and myself tried to obtain tickets for the game but were

unable to do so



On the morning of Saturday      April       <150489) myself and
       o v t ~             ofr&sj        n j o ~nc%c«£rr;
             travelled to Sheffiel    thout tickets for the game we were

intending to try and pure            ickets outside the ground.



We travelled by coach belonging to Sunspan T               leaving the Woodside

Hotel, Birkenhead at about       10.45am (1045)



The coach travelled direct to Sheffield and made no stops,          I can't say

which route we took.       Whe                     the motorway approaching
                      CA=r
Sheffield we were held                            c.



I cannot be sure but I                        pped by the police just

outside Sheffield,    I th                         on the coach to check for

beer.      (L A rT   COACH


I think that the odd passenger on our coach had drunk cans of beer

during the journey but not many were, myself and               never took any

beer with us.



After getting directions from the police our coach driver went and

parked our coach in a side street by a lot of other coaches,          the

driver parked the coach at sometime between 1.15pm (1315) and 1.30pm

(1330).   I ca n’t say the name of the street the coach parked in all           I

can say is that it was about fifteen minutes walk to the ground.



Myself a n d w a l k e d     down from the coach park area to the ground we

never received any police directions or escort we just followed the
                                                                                             PAGE           4

               about.



               At about 2.40pm (1440) myself and                            stood by the bridge in
5 0 ^
               Leppings Ln just outside the e               :e to the ground.       At this time
  t-~ U
               there were no queues at the^Cur                       l
                                                                     ^ a g ^ a s s of people spreading

               back from the turnstiles and                    e outer gates towards the road.
& =R A O G i
               The only police I saw w e r | ^ i Q mounted police stuck in amongst the

               mass approaching the              race turnstiles   in the area inside the outer

               gates



               The police on horses were trying to organise people telling them to

               get back but their efforts weren't having any effect on the crowd.                       I

               would have thought it would have been impossible for two mounted

               police to have any effect on a crowd of that s i z e .



               I could see people climbing up over the walls and onto the turnstile

               roofs.



               It appeared to me that between about 2.30pm <1430) and 2.50pm                 (1450)

               the crowds heading towards the terrace turnstiles had increased in

               numbe r by a huge a m o u n t .     The build up i q^frGmbe rs suggested that a

               lot of people were arriving at the a b o u n d       late.



               By just before 2.50pm <1450)           it was apparent to me that the people        in

               the crowds by the terrace turnstiles were in difficulty,               obviously

               being crushed.



               Myself and          were still standing by the bridge.



               I had seen a large concertina type gate situated to the right hand
                                                                                    PAGE     3
                                                                                    S3349

          crowd,    there were a large number of supporters      (Liverpool) walking to

          the ground.



          During our walk to the ground,      I saw          lads drinking froffi cans of

          beer,    I only saw one fan who I           say was drunk and he was just

          shouting,    I never saw any fighting or disorder



                  and I arrived at the Leppings Ln entrance to the ground at some

          time between 1.30pm (1330) and 1.45pm (1345).
                                       \


         When we first arrived outside the turnstiles there were a lot of

          people in the area of Leppings Ln and a few people queuing at the

          turnstiles.



         After getting to the ground myself and              walked up and down

          Leppings Ln asking people if they had any spare tickets for sale



          We saw one fan buying a          et off a youth I would describe as a white

          male aged about 1 6 1m    17 y e a r s , about 5ft 6ins tall,   slim build,   he

c/rf     /had short dark Hair,     this youth was wearing a black jogging type suit,

          When we saw the one fan buying a ticket off this youth we also
•TC7UT
          approached h i m .   I did not see how much^roney the other fan handed

          the youth.      This youth had four jj^f ive ti ckets in his hand.

          offered the youth twenty pot^wtTs for a ticket,       but by this time there

          were six or seven of us fathered around the youth,          I think he must

          have got worried about drawing attention to himself because he walked

          away before we could discuss buying any tickets.



          We kept on going forwards and backwards along the Leppings Ln trying

          to buy tickets but there didn't seem to be that many spare tickets
                                                                                         PAGE    5
                                                                                         S3349

            side of the terrace turnstiles as you look from Leppings Ln being

            opened on I think two occasions between 2 « 4 0 pm (1440) and just before

            2 . 5 0 pm (1450) .   I think it was steward*, who were opening the gate.

            As far as I can remember there wejpi policeman standing on the ground

            side of this gate.        On the tw#* occasions I saw the gate opened

            between      2.40pm (1440) and/just before 2.50pm <1450)         I saw between 20

            and thirty people al lowejdf to enter through this gate,         I saw the

            stewards by the gates/exami ni ng the tickets of the people they allowed

            to enter.



            At about 2.50pm (1450)       I saw this c o n c e r t ^ i type gate to the right

            hand side of the terrace turnstiles             now fully open,    I never saw
OrTTfe
            who opened it.

            There was a     large   group ofy^eople entering the ground through this

            open gate,    entering at jf pace I would describe as a ’slow j o g ’



            When we saw this            and I went and joined onto the stream of people

            entering throu           is gate,   the next thing I knew we were    inside the

            ground nobody            me to produce a ticket,      I don't think it would

            have been practical for the police or stewards to try and check for

            tickets because of the volume of people entering through this gate.



            Once   inside the ground            an   wer# still together and we just

            followed the crowd down ~-mr- the      --- yfnnel.
                                                        7 ----   I cannot recall seeing any-

            signs di recting fans y r t h e standing area,       I never saw any police j>r

            stewards by the ei         ice to the tunnel.


                      C - A ’T
            We had free passage along the tunnel
                                                                                     PAGE      6
                                                                                     S3349

I would estimate we entered the tunnel at about 2.52pm (1452),                       once we       _

got to the end of the tunnel the terraces were full,                   because of the

pressure of people behind us we were pushed forwards ?and down into pen

number 4 to a position,     I have marked as number               1 (one) on the

separate grid plan which I produce          (Ex No               ) (Ref No     1).



The push forward to position number one was a gra^y^fl push I would

estimate both         and I got to position one                   tbaut S.55pm (1455),

the players were on the pitch having theijr kick about.



Just after getting to position 1 I felt a supQe and we were moved

further forwards down the pen towards pos/ftion number S.                    After this

surge which took place at about 2 . 5 6 pfXr 11456) there was a gradual

increase   in pressure and I was m o v e / about             in the pen.



Just before the game kicked off I had been moved forwards to a

position I have marked as number 2 (two) on the separate grid plan.

Both       land I were still together at position number 2 and the

crushing pressure I was experiencing was very excessive I was having

difficulty breathing,    I was having to use my arms to try and push

against the people in front of me to give me sufficient space to

breath.



I can remember the game kicking off and up until the time BEARDSLEY

hit the cross bar the pressure was gradually increasing.

Whe n BEARDSLEY hit the cross bar I fjrft another surge forwards but

   ause we were so tightly packejA'uogether in the pen my position

nev e r real ly al te red to any_-^xtent.

                                                                                          S3349

            During the time between the kick off and the game being stopped I can

            remember people in front of me shouting at the police on the track by

            the perimeter fence to ’open the gates'.              So it was obvious     people at

            the front of pen number 4 were in difficulty.



            I can remember the policeman running ori the pitch and the game being

            stopped,    I can remember seeing the players leaving the field.



            After the game was stopped it was chaos in pen number 4.                 I could hear „

            people screaming for help.         The police who were by the perimeter fence

            were shouting at people to move back but nobody in the pen could move

            at that time.


ON/J
T O         People started to try to climb over^fctfte perimeter fence at/first the
v-i e h /
            police on the other side were pyfChing them back into the pen.
Ca   t

            c o m k & vit
^           This   chaos went on for at least five minutes,           then the police must

            have realised what was going on and started to help by leaning over to

            pull   people up over the perimeter fence.



            At about 3.15pm (1515)             and myself were f u p k f m r   down the pen about

            ■10 feet away from the perimeter fence.


                                                     y
            I could see I would estimate about seven or eight bodies piled up

            lying by the front wall b e l ^      the perimeter fence.           People were
                                          /'
            trampling on the bodies wfiilst they were trying to climb out over the
                                      /
            perimeter fence.      I pnly glanced briefly at the sight of these

            bodies,    they were lying motionless and I presume they must have been

            dead people.      I could not describe the scene or the bodies any

            further.
                                                                                           PAGE         S
                                                                                           S3349



               At about this time          had gone to the front perimeter fence and was

               together with other fans trying to pull the fence back up to allow

               people to climb through it onto the pitch.           There were policemen on

               the pitch side of the fence helping the fans.             Eventually they

               managed to pull up arid backwards into the pen a section of the

               perimeter fencing.      I cannot be sure but I think the section of

               fe nc i ng      and the others pulled up was quite close to the gate in

               pen number 4.


CAT
               Myse 1f ,       and a lot of            climbed out through the hole in the

f - t M C <i   perimeter fence and            onto the pitch.



               At first we just wandered about on the pitch, we were both in a state

               of shock,    I could feel my heart pounding.



               We wandered over to the south stand by the Leppings Ln end and stood

               talking to some Notts Forest supporters who were in the south stand.



               At a time I would say was between 3.25pm         (1525) and 3.30pm (1530) we

               had managed to collect our thoughts and I saw a group of fans standing

               around a man who was lying on an advertisement hoarding.             They were

               positioned on the pitch just behind the goal         line on the south stand

               side of the Leppings Ln end goal.



DCt TOf£- Myself and              ran over and helped this group of fans lift up this
                                                                    /'
               hoarding.     The man lying on the hoarding w a ^ a white male aged about

CC?/sJS»       30/35 y e a r s , about 5ft 7 ins (5’7) tall^     was stockily built.       He had

               a chubby face and I think a rrioustai            His face was white,    I think

       |q      his eyes were closed he was motiyfiless and I thought he was dead,                  He
        was wearing I think jeans and a light coljxfred open necked shirt.

        can remember the shirt was pulled            >f his jeans and I could see the

        man had a,pot belly.                  /
c^rr

                  //vJCf
        We/ran with the hoarding a/ross the pitch and in between the north
       J7stand and the Spiori Kap where we placed the hoarding on the ground at

        the back of the s t a n d s .   There were a lot of other stretchers/

        hoardings with/bodies on them in this location.



        We put the hoarding down and then ran back down to the Leppings Ln end

        of the ground.



        When we got down to the Leppings Ln end we saw some more fans running

        across the pitch with a body on a hoarding myself and            joined them

        taking hold of the hoarding.         I cannot describe the person who was on

        this hoarding I cannot say if they were male,       female or dead or alive

        I cannot recall where we ran to with this hoarding other than the

        Spion Hop end of the ground.



        We eventually left the ground at about 4.30pm (1630) after hearing a

        laud speaker announcement asking people to leave.



        During my time in the terraces I did not witness any signs of

        disorder,   I did not see the barrier break in pen number three.



        I was not injured myself during my experiences at the game,



        I did not witness anything during that day which I would consider to

        be a criminal offence.

         On that day I was wearing a                                   sweat shirt, with        „

                                              the sleeves and

         on the body.        On the front there is a white panel

         pr i nted                                     I was wearing blue denim jeans.

         I would describe myself as a white male,           I am 19 years of age I am 6

         feet    <6*0) tall,   slim to medium build,      I have shortish light brown

         hair,    straight, with a centre parting.         I am clean shaven.



         The only views I have about the way the incident was handled after the

         match was stopped is that I considt£— %tttr pal ice were slow to realise

         The only other point I would rajHSfe is that I do not think there were

             Further to my original statement dated 30th August 1989 (300^89),                               I

             would j f i k e    to add that today I have been shown i-ar iniis phy t n'1|l'3/^ t:— ^nd
 \ 'f          idjep   tapes of the Hi 11sborough disaster by                           and                      of
             ithe West Midlands Police.                In my original      statement   I refer to .a 35 yr

             old man whom I a ssisted to carry across the pitch on a hog^ding b o a r d .

               I am adile to identify this man as being the deceased Patrick John

             THOMPSON          (49) from a clothing            ograph ref no            (Exhibi t

             No         ) and from a mortuary cmotograph ref no 49 (Exhibit No                           )   .
             Together with others I picked THOMPSON up from a point by the penalty

             area and car r ied him on a hoarding board placing him down outside the

             gymnas^j,
                  as4j/ftf.      I have marked on a pJran by means of a dot the spot where I

             first came into contact with THOMPSON and can produce this plan as ref

             no         (Exhibit No            )   .

      <n>(2Gs/ jA,
Thank you for your letter of 16 December. I will of course ensure that Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith sees it and Mr McCombieâ€™s further statement.

I need hardly say that we entirely understand the other points you have made in your letter. I
was wondering if you would have any objection to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith quoting from it in
his report to the Home Secretary, if he thinks it right to do so. (I have in mind the second half
of the second page, and perhaps the top of page three). The Home Secretary does of course
plan to publish the report.

Please let me know.

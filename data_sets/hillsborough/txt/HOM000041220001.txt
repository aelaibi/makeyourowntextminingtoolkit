“ In answer to question six, I believe the majority o f the Liverpool fans that I saw immediately after
the incident were aggressive.

7.   I saw little or no sign o f any stewards in the ground.

8.   I saw or became aware that there was a lack o f radio direction from control.

9.   I did not handle any bodies in the ground or out.

10. My single most strongest observation that I would make was that for a significant period o f time
there appeared to be a lack o f radio guidance from control.. My fears were those o f any person
involved in a similar situation, those o f concern for innocents caught up in the turmoil, my colleagues
and myself. I hope I never have to go through a similar situation again.” (P. 161)

                          No rth s t a n d .

                          I became aware         that    closer       to 3pm      (1500)        various     radio messages about

c y
                     /    to be of an urgent            sounding       nature.           I believe       they   came from some

                          officer     in a u t h o r it y L ep pings Lane          end.

                          As 3pm    (1500)      a p p r o a c h e d the volume      of supporters            increased to

                          extremely heavy          level.        Some obv io us ly the worse                for wear    for drink.

                          A number of a ll e ga t io n s made about                the     lack of control        at Leppings

                    continue       on his way.

                ,   At 3.05pm       (1505)   on the outbreak       of trouble           I heard a radio message

    Qpf             "All officers        to a ss emble    on pitch".       W it h PC Roe at this stage and

                    a tt e mp t ed to    cut thro ug h N or th stand      from upper           concourse to ground.

                    We    quickly    realised      this was   impossible as abuse and threats from

                    Liverpool       s upporters was so fierce we            had to retreat          to upper

                    concourse       level    from N orth stand.

^                   We then a s se mb le d on Kop end of N o rt h stand on ground floor with

                    Police Dogs,         horses,     man y other   officers.        I thought we had a pitch

                    invasion at this          time    on our hands.

                    An officer       in charge       then directed my group onto the                pitch and we

                    were told to line up facing North stand on the                         pitch.     Whilst

                    standing       facing the N or th stand        I saw s omethings            being thrown from

                    the    crowd    in our direction,         possibly     coins.

                    At this stage         lots of threats and abusive              shouts       from the   crowd who

                    were     pointing     in dir ec ti on of L ep pings Lane            end.

                    I still     believed we were         dealing with a pitch invasion at this

      ■             stage.     I could see m any supporters             who a pp ea r ed tohave spilled ontc

                    pitch.     Some      of them were     laying   on   the ground          near to the goal mouth

                    Some    supporters jumped         from the N or th stand        infront       of me      and took      j

                    advertising         boards w h i ch they carried towards              the area where the

                    trouble seemed to be.

                    Almost     immediately      one    of these    groups     of   supporters       returned with a

                    supporter       laying    on the stretcher        whose    body was twisted and

                    ap peared to me to be ob vi ou sl y dead.               It was not until          this    point   in

time that the gravity of the                 incident        came   home   to me and I began to

realise    that we       had a serious        incident        on our    hands.

I remember      thinking       there was,      for     some    reason,     little   radio

direction from         control     and so as      I a p p e a r e d to be doing       nothing more

than a g gr av at in g   the    crowd by my       presence w it h a few other officers

facing    the N or th stand,          I deci de d to move           into the area where      people

were    lying down       injured and offered assistance.

The    first   person     I helped was a y o u t h a ge d about             18 years who said h<

could not move         one   leg and one arm.            As    I spoke with him a stretcher

a pp e a re d beside     him and w i t h the help of another                officer    I assisted

the    injured man onto the stretcher.                      W it h the help of some supporter-

we    carried this       person off the         pitch,       and placed him down near to thi

gym where a large            number    of    casualties       had now a pp eared to have been

put.

I returned to the            pitch and a ss is te d w it h the          removal     of two other

injured supporters.             And was then d ir ec te d by a s up er visory officer

wit h a group of other           officers       to go to the Leppings Lane              end of the

outside    of the ground.

On arrival       at that      point    I saw a p pr o xi m a t e l y   14 bodies     laid at the

side of some       fencing,      a numbe r of Police            officers were alr eady near

to these       bodies.       The bodies were          s ec t io n ed off by a stretch of crowi

control    barriers.

On    route to this       location       I saw 2 or 3 firemen with oxygen equipment

working a pp ar e nt l y without            success    to    revive a supporter        laid near ti

the    rear of the       control      hut,    but outside       of the ground.

Whilst    standing       near to the         14 bodies,       I together with other         officer'

was    insulted by Liver pool            supporters         as they left the ground showing

open hostility towards             us.       Someone    s h ou te d that was all we were fit

for,    standing around.

An Irish doctor          from the H a ll am sh ir e Hospital            put the keys of his        ca

                                                                                                                       R304

                    in my hand telling me where                it was      in case       it needed moving as he was

                    busy tending to the             injured.

                    A police       officer      scuffled w ith a L i ve rp oo l          supporter       in my viewing

                    and a further           group of Liverpool          s u pp o r t e r s m ov ed   in the direction of

                    the officer           but an ambulance       drove     sl ow ly    b e tw ee n the group and it

                    dispersed.            The   crowd continued to         leave      the L ep pings Lane       end.

                    I then returned to the g ym nasium and                      I recall     going to a de-briefing

                    in the N or th stand.

                    After     that    I took up a point of duty at                 the P en istone Road entrance 1

                    Throughout        the night       I was on duty at this              gate    point    preventing

        if          oress    from entering          and meeting     relatives         from Liverpool who were

                    8.      I saw or became aware that there was a lack of radio direction

                     from c o n t r o l .

                    9.      I did not handle          any bodies     in the       ground or out.

                    for a significant              period of time there a pp ea re d to be a lack of radic

                     guidance       from control.        My fears were           those    of any person         involved ir

                    a similar        situation,       those    of concern for          innocents       caught   up in the

                     turmoil,       my colleagues and myself.                I hope      I never have to go through

                    a similar        situation again.

            An officer             in charge then d i r e c t e d m y            g r o up onto the       pitch and we

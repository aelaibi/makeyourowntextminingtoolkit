tickets       from        the      Football            Ground           at A n f i e l d .        Both      of      our    tickets            were

v a l u e d at     six      pounds          each and             were        for    the    terraces            at    the L a p p i n g s

Lane    end       of    the      ground.

On    the    morning          of    the       match         I worked           until       12.30pm                     uas     off       on

that    day       but     he m e t       me      at    work          at a b o u t     1p m .      From      the      works         we    both

used    a    company          car       and                drove        us    both     to S h e f f i e l d         City Centre.                   We

arrived       in H i l l s b o r o u g h          at       about        -1.35pm a n d          parked       the      car     in a        side

street       some       distance            from       the       ground        it se l f.         During         our      journey         to

the    g r o u n d we       had     not       experienced                any       delays       nor    did       I witness              any

untoward          incidents.

After       parking         the      car we           both walked              along       s o me     si d e     streets           u n ti l

joining       the       Penistone             Road.             We    began        to w a l k     along        Pennistone               Road

towards       the       ground.             I saw          l a r ge     numbers        of S u p p o r t e r s        sitting            on a

grassed       embankment                which adjoins                   the    road,       I think          they were              mixed

fans    both Liverpool                   and Nottingham                      Forest       Supporters.                  These

Supporters             were      in g o o d       spirits             and     generally/wey y behavt^ although                                     I

did    notice          that      most       of    them were              d r i n k.i n g yfce 6*/yf r\om y ck n s .            On e      thing

I do    recall          from       walking            past       these        fans     <li&% tl\at J J>r&re w e r e e m p t y

beer    cans       everywhere               and were             strewn        about       the       grassed         a r ea.        I got          the

impression             that      they       had       been       sitting           there       for    some       time.

There       was    a    steady          flow      of       people        walking          along       Penistone            R o a d a n d we

passed       groups         of     f an s     just         standing           about.         We      crossed         over      a

traffic       Island          at    the       end      of P e n i s t o n e         Road and walked                  into L e p p i n g s

Lane,       I saw       larger          numbers            of    supporters            standing            about       in L e p p i n g s

Lane,       they       d i d n ’t a p p e a r         to    h a ve      any    purpose          and    just         stood about               in

groups.           Once      in     Leppings Lane                 I was        approached             on    dozens         of   occasions

by    fans    who were             standing around                    and asked           if    I    wanted         to sell          my

ticket.           I think          if    I ha d a          hundred           tickets       for       the m a t c h        then          I could

have    sold       t h e m a ll .           The       f an s     who     were       touting          for    tickets          were

     with    a      *s c o u s e ’ a c c e n t         which        tended          to     indicate           to me       t h at    they        had

     travelled             from Liverpool                   without           a ticket.

           continued along                      Leppings           Lane       and arrived               outside         the     turnstiles                at

     the    West       Stand          at a b o u t         1. 45 p m.         At    t hi s     time      there        were      very         fe w

     people         about        outside             the    turnstiles              and       I saw      no    queuing.             I saw           no

     g round        staff        o u t s i de        the    ground           but    there       were      Police          Of f i cers         on     f oo t

     standing          directly             outside           the       turnstile             blocks,         they were            searching

     people         who     were       entering             the     ground,

     We    received          no       directions              as    to w h e r e         we    should         enter       the      ground and

     we    made      our     way       to       the    larger           block       of     turnstiles              marked       1-16.          Both

     myself         and               entered          through           one       of    the    central            turnstiles            in this

     block       and       I handed             my     ticket           to    the       operator        on g o i n g    through.                I

     received          a    portion             of     my    ticket           back.

     Once     inside         the       ground          and       in the        enclosure           at      the      rear      of    the       stand

     we    decided          to     look         for    a    programme              seller.         There           w a s n ’t m a n y        people

     in    the      enclosure              at    this       time,        j us t     a few       small         groups       standing             about.

     We    purchased a                programme             and     then       stood          reading         it    in the         enclosure

     for    10 m i n u t e s          or    so.        During           the    period          I stood         in the         enclosure              I

     entering          through             the       turnstiles              was    steady.             I c a n ’t r e ca l l           seeing           any

     of    the m a i n       gates          opened          for     any       reason.

     From     the      enclosure                we    moved        to    the       central/tuj^riel                beneath         the       stand,

an     hour      to    go        before       kick          off we       had      difficulty              in j o i n i n g         the     people

in the         pens         as    the    crowd was                so    d e ns e .

with          difficulty and moved                           to a Cfrfis ^t i^ja^S'n the                 terrace            near     to the

we     stood        in t h i s         position             I became          very        uncomfortable                and     the       crowd

around         me     became           tightly          pa c k e d .         I w o u l d n ’t s a y          t h at    I had        particular

Ground         us     became           packed          tightly          together.               At    a b o u t g . 4 5 pro t h e r e          wa s      a

everyone            in t h a t         centre          block          moved     down and             towards          the     fencing          at

the     bottom.              I c o u l d n ’t see w h a t                was      happening             at      the    bottom         of    the

surge            in the       crowd after                 the      one      which        took        p l ac e    when       I was          in P e n 4.

    It w a s      obvious          to me          though          t ha t    people           were     going          to    be    seriously

    i n j u r e d as     a    result          of       the     overcrowding                  and     I couldn't             understand                why

more         of    the       Liverpool             supporters               couldn't           have       been        directed             into       the

    fill     as    a    result          of    t he      overspill              of    people          climbing             out    of    the        centre

    pens.Shortly              after          kick       off       the      game      was      abandoned              because          of    the

    problems           in the       pens          a n d at        t h at    time        me    and               decided          to m o v e        down

    to     the    front       of    the       pens        to      get      on t o    the      pitch.            We    climbed          b ac k      o v er

    th e    steel       barrier          and       into        the w a l k w a y         between          the        two    pens.            I'd

already            lost       sight          of    th e      man       I had        described           earlier,            everywhere

a r o u n d me w a s           in       chaos          and     people          were      panicking.                  To    be    honest          at

    that     t im e     I was       concerned                for m y        own safety and                    I only wanted                 to     get

    o ut    of    the     pens      all       together.

Upon         reaching          the       bottom           of      the w a l k w a y          I saw      that         the    gate       was       open

which            affords       access             to    the       pitch.            Just      before          leaving           the w a l k w a y

    through        the       gate       J. r e m e m b e r        helping           a man      who      was      climbing             over        the

    barrier        from       pen 4.              He w a s        dazed        and      in s o m e      distress.                Both myself

    there        and    both       left       through             thfe

    I would        describe             this       man       as    being        a white            m a l e,     in his          early

    twenties,           of m e d i u m        build.              He     was    about         3*9"      tall         and    had       dark       c ol l a r

    length        hair.        I can't             recall          what        he wore .

When         we    got       onto       the       pitch        I saw        people           lying      on      the       playing          surface

and         dozens       of    people             rushing          about.            It w a s       only        at    this       stage          t h at     I

fully appreciated                        what          was     happening             and      the     severity             of    the       incident.

People            were       administrating                    first        aid      on the         pitch        to       injured          p e rs o ns ,

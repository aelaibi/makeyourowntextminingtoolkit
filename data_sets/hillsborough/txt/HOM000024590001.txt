                                        FINANCE           FOR      FOOTBALL


                                                A discussion paper




 Introduction


 This paper has been prepared for the consideration of Members o f Parliam ent
 and o th e r in terested           individuals as a contribution                 to the cu rre n t debate on
 football's financial needs.                   It considers the case for a Football Levy Board,
 and re la te d aspects.


Previous rep orts and recommendations


In the       last      18 years     two official bodies have recommended a levy on the
turnover of football pools.                    The first, in 1968, was the C o m m itte e on Football
chaired      by Sir       Norman        Chester,       which recommended               a levy unaccompanied
by any reduction in pool betting duty (then imposed at the ra te of 25 per
cent).         Ten       years       la te r    the       Royal    Commission           on        Gambling,     under
Lord Rothschild's chairmanship, proposed in its final report th e establishm ent
o f a Football Board funded by the                          proceeds of a 3 per c e n t reduction in
pool      b ettin g     duty,        which by then           had     risen    to       40    per     cent.       This
recom m endation was contrary to th at contained in their interim report.


The      Royal      Commission’s recommendations                   for   a Football          Board      were    quite
detailed,        and    th a t      section of their report         is   reproduced          as       Appendix     A.
The      report       also proposed        th a t   the    Football Grounds Improvem ent Trust (in
1977-78 still          in its      infancy) be wound up or absorbed by the                            new Football
Board:       this was a consequence of their recommendation th a t                                    all Spotting-
the-Ball com petitions (including th a t run by the Pool P rom o ters Association)
be made illegal.


From tim e to tim e o th e r organisations and individuals, including the Football
Association,          have       supported       the   establishm ent        of    a    football       levy    board,
generally for one or more of the following reasons:
1.     Because        football as a whole is tre a te d less favourably than horseracing,
which     enjoys an exclusive source of revenue through the H orserace B etting
Levy B o a rd
2.     Because      the Government "takes out of football" enormous sums in pool
b e ttin g levy.                                                                                       _
3.     Because the pools "make vast                   profits" and put "almost nothing back into
football".
4.     Because        football     is     the   British   national   game,     and   th e re fo re   deserves
special help, not least because clubs are desperately short of money.


1.     A parallel with horseracing?


In the most recent year, th e H orserace Betting Levy Board received income
of £21 million from the levy on bookmakers.                               Since 1980 the total is £96
million.       It is generally acknowledged th at the Board does a good job for
racing,    and has been responsible for providing prize money and for funding
extensive programmes of modernisation and improvement at many of Britain’s
racecourses.           Its chairm an            and two    members    are    appointed      by the         Home
S ecretary, the Jockey Club nominates three, and the membership is completed
by the chairmen of the T otalisato r Board, and of the Bookmakers' C om m ittee.
The board reports to the Home Secretary, and thus to Parliam en t.                                   It should
be     appreciated th a t betting duty               is only 10 per cent, and b ettin g turnover
to ta ls £4 billion per annum.                    It is thus a vastly larger business than the
football     pools,    whose       turnover       in 1984-85 was £520 million,            and which paid
£221 million in pool betting duty.


Rothschild         clearly       had      the    racing    levy   board     much     in    mind      when    he
recom m ended a Football Board.                      But th at report        was published eight years
ago and much has happened since.


First,     the Football Grounds Improvement Trust has become                              an indispensable
m eans of assisting League clubs in England, Scotland and Wales comply with
th e     Safety     of Sports           Grounds A ct      1975,   and to    undertake      program m es to
improve sp ectato r          am enities.          Grants paid out         for safety      alone since 1975
e x ceed £20 million in total.


Secondly, payments made by the pools companies to the various leagues and
associations whose m atches appear on the weekly coupons have risen steadily,
p articularly       since    the        com m encem ent     of the new c o n tra ct       agreed     with    the
Football League at the end of 1984.                         The Football League and the Scottish
League      to g ether        receive     £5.2     million    annually,      the      Football      Association
£382,000         and     others     £107,000        making     a     total   of       £5,689,000.        These
arrangem ents also cost the PPA £853,000 in VAT.


Thirdly, pool betting duty has again been increased - to 42i per cent - and
as we have shown produces for the Exchequer £221 million annually.


And     fourthly,       the    Football    Trust     has     been    established       with   a constitution
and     term s    of referen ce         similar    to those recommended by Rothschild for a
Football Board, but with significantly higher levels of funding.


I return to these four points later.


2.    The Governm ent’s "take" from football


It is frequently claimed th a t the Government takes J ar more from the game
than it puts in.              L k e r a U y ^ p e aking, this is undoubtedly ^tru e.             As a branch
of the en terta in m e n t        industry,       football   makes a substantial net contribution
in VAT payments, some clubs (a minority) pay corporation tax on their profits,
all pay PAYE tax and DHSS contributions in respect of their employees, and
local    authority       rates,    and    nearly all contribute         something       for   the      cost of
policing their grounds.


But none of these payments is unique to football;                        what is more usually meant
in this context is the duty paid by the pools companies - or more accurately,
their clients,         as it comes        out of winnings - on their coupon competitions.
Much of the football industry clearly regards this as "their money", and pool
betting duty           is thus a "tax on football".                 The present G overnment, and its
predecessors, see the situation differently.                        They have      regarded it as a tax
on gambling,           analogous to       licence fees for am usem ent machines or                      casinos
(and no-one is suggesting th a t the revenue raised from them should go back
into those industries.)


The pool companies them selves take the same view, and would expect their
clients to be the primary beneficiaries of any reduction in pool betting duty,
although the           1984 copyright       agreem ent       does provide       for     two   fifths of the
revenue     gained       from a 2 i per cent reduction                 in duty to be given              to the
                                                            -    4   -




Football League as an additional payment.


However,           should        a Chancellor of tlT6 Exchequer                          wish to give         more money
to football through the device of reducing pool b e ttin g duty, th a t would clearly
be a m a tte r for him, and football would not refuse it.


The PPA also pays VAT on Spotting-the-Ball,                                        the annual to ta l being around
£4i    million.             If    the    com petition were relieved                      of   this    burden,    the pools
might well be persuaded to increase the £8 million or so which they currently
pass to the Football Trust by the whole amount of the relief.


3.    The pools1 "v ast profits"


Out of the £520m. taken in stakes on the pools coupons by the three PPA
members in th e year up to 31 July 1985, £2 2 lm, as we have seen, went to
the G overnm ent               in pool betting duty.                      Of the remaining £299m, the total
returned to winners was £140m.                            £142.2m. went in expenses, leaving a profit
of £16.8m, of which £13.4m. was earned during the British football seasoru


The figure of £13.4m. m atches closely the amount which th e pools put into
British football over the same period.                               The cost to the PPA of the copyright
agreem ent to use British m atches on the coupons was (including VAT) £6.5m.
and the        pay m en ts        from Spotting-the-Ball                      to the Trusts just exceeded £7m.
in the year ending 31 July 1985.


4.    Foo tb all's need for additional help


British football's financial requirements are hard to quantify, and it is difficult
to obtain          a g re e m e n t     from     the     interested            parties   on    just    what     is needed.
Perhaps        the      best      sta rtin g     point    is to set             down some        assertions on which
there is likely to be reasonably broad agreement:


a.     D espite        a num ber of alarms                 and close-run calls, none of the 92 clubs
in the        English        Football         League     has gone out               of   business      since Accrington
Stanley       in     1961.        This        despite constantly               falling   attendances,      higher   police
charges,       interrup tion s           in    the     payment           of    television     broadcasting      fees,   and
the    loss     of      sponsorship           and other         income caused             by a variety          of reasons
including the            1985 controls on alcohol, sp ectato r violence and the exclusion
of English club s from European competitions.
                                                          5   -




    b.    Despite causing considerable initial inconvenience at a number of grounds,
    th e extension of ttesignations under the 1975 S afety of Sports Grounds Act
    does not appear to be driving sm aller clubs out of business:                          the majority
    appear able        to   find the      25 per     cent         balance of the cost of s afety   works
    (a fte r FGIT's 75 per c e n t grants), albeit accepting the imposition o f reduced
    crowd cap acities in many cases.


    c.    Im m ediately below the Football League th ere exists a t least a score of
    apparently        well-run and profitable clubs able to take places in the English
    Fourth Division, should vacancies occur, with little or no overall weakening
    o f the competition.
•
    d.    The tra n s fe r m arket        for British players appears to have stabilised, with
    some clubs still able           to    find colossal       fees for a small number of players,
    but     without    reaching   th e     very high levels of 3-4 years ago (which caused
    offen ce    to    sections of        the   British   public).       There   are   however a number
    of players and managers who continue to be paid enormous wages, despite
    the apparent poverty of many clubs.                       Football League figures indicate that
    32 first division players are receiving over £60,000 a year, and another 50
    over £40,000.


    e.    The crowd behaviour record in 1985-86 is greatly improved com pared with
    the previous season.            The number of a rre sts was 51 per c e n t down in the
    English first division in the 1985-86 season compared with 1984-85.


    f.    The Football Trust has been                able to find the funds necessary to           assist
    all clubs in the top two English and Scottish prem ier divisions with 100 per
    cen t grants to install closed circuit television.


    g.    The Football Grounds Improvement Trust appears to have no im m ediate
    need to call upon the additional £1 million made available to it by the Football
    Trust    in 1985 to assist with the              additional safety burdens imposed on          clubs
    following the events of April and May 1985.


    However, th e re are those in football who would make the following points:


    a.    Whilst the FGIT may have adequate funds to cope with em ergency safety
work,     designation                under          the     Act      is    lpavinfj       m ?ny ■ ffrnuruis            with     woefullv
inadequate          s tr u c tures,          so u n a ttra c tiv e         as to discourage erstw hile supporters
from returning.


b.      There            is      insufficient              money          immediately               available         for     significant
program m es             of ground improvements                           (e.g. covering             of terracing, installation
of more seating, new refreshm ent facilities, decent lavatories, and so on).


c.     Football           needs           a number (perhaps as many as                                12) "showpiece"            football
stadia, built specially or expensively rebuilt to provide 21st century amenities.


d.      None        of        the         four     home      countries       has         an    adequate          national       stadium :
Wales does not have one at all, Scotland's has little covered accommodation
and insufficient seating, Northern Ireland's ground has its old main grandstand
condemned            for         fire safety              reasons,        and even Wembley                    is showing         its    age
(and does not belong to football, anyway).


e.     Closed c irc u it television should be installed at clubs in the lower divisions,
but th ere are no plans to find the funds for this.


f.     With         more         money,            the    Football Trust could extend                       its programm es              of
help     for        grassro ots             football.          Many schemes fail                    to   go       ahead because of
the difficulty                in raising the 50 per                       cent share which the Trust insists upon
in many areas.


Undoubtedly th e re                   is some truth in                    each of these assertions.                         But w hether
any     of     them            c arrie s         sufficient       force     to     justify      large       im m ediate        increases
in     funding       is        more         debatable.             Given         time,        and     the     continuation of           the
existing Trust                 arrangem ents, it should be possible for the two Trusts to get
 around        to    most            of     this     work      in due        course.            Within          the    list    there    are
 problems           of        priorities:             should      showpiece           clubs          or national            stadia     take
 precedence over an expansion of grassroots activity, for example?


An equally               d ifficult         dilemma for government is having to choose                                         to divert
 resources          to        help        football,       rather than other sports,                      like     Rugby League or
 hockey,       which have                   no grant-giving               trusts to help them ,                   and no reason to
 be linked to                 the     football pools.                And why sport, ra th e r than the arts, or
 schools, or the health service?
Establishing a Football Board


The only serious a tte m p t                       to describe how a Football               Board      might work       is
in      the     final        report        of    the     Royal         Commission     on   Gambling.        Rothschild
proposed          th a t     the funds would come from                         a 3 per cent        reduction in pool
b ettin g       duty (currently                 worth     about £15.5 million a year).                 Assuming that
his     recommendation                 th a t     Spotting-the-Ball            be   abolished    rem ains   rejected     -
no one has put this forward seriously since 1978 - football could get funds
 from         th ree     different          pools       sources:        from    Spotting-the-Ball      to   the    Trusts
(this     year         running        at        £8m.), from            copyright    paym ents for      use of fixtures
 (£5.689m.), and from the reduction in pool betting duty (or from sources of
 taxation, including                  VAT), with the amount at this stage unknown.


 The next question                     th a t needs to be answered is how the responsibilities                         and
 are as of activity                  of the Football Board would differ from those of the                             two
 Trusts,        assuming         that           they     remained        in   existence.        R othschild's     thoughts
 on the Board's term s of reference were contained in paragraph 11.114.


 We      see       immediately              th at      th ere     is    an     enormous    overlap     betw een      what    /
 Rothschild said a                    Football Board could do, and what the Football Trust                             and       .
 th e    FGIT          are    already           doing.     His         suggestions on the         B oard's composition )
 (para 11.120) also bear                        more than a passing resem blance to the                     membership (
 of the Football Trust,                         except th a t      the la tte r is ra th e r m ore representative,           ]
     _______
 in th a t it contains individuals nominated by the Association of Chief Police
 O fficers,        the       local    authority associations and indeed the M inister for Sport.
 Whilst         the     present       minister           and his two predecessors have                all nominated a
' civil servant) to represent him, th ere would be nothing to stop the Minister
 appointing himself if he wished.                               A copy of the Trust Deed is annexed.


 One area where the Football Trust has gone against R othschild's recommendations
 is in administration.                          It has not appointed a full-tim e c h ie f executive with
 a support staff, but preferred instead to rely on the ex p ertise and regional
 organisation of those bodies which assist it with administering grant aid schemes,
 of which the Sports Councils for England, Scotland and Wales are the most
 im portant as far as the grassroots of football are c o n c e rn e d                                       (The e n tire
 adm inistration costs of the Football Trust are well under 2 per cent of the
 moneys th at it receives).
Inevitably one is bound to ask what would be the point of having a Football
Board alongside the two Trusts.                             It would of course be possible to wind up
the    Trusts        and convert            the     existing voluntary                 contributions         from      Spotting-
the-Ball into statu tory levies, and provide e x tra funding directly to the Football
Board from the Exchequer or from reducing pool betting duty.                                                           But what
would this achieve?                  It would be bound to destroy the goodwill of the PPA,
who would see such a move not only as a breach of faith, but as a direct
a tta c k on their com m ercial activities.                           The consequent e f f e c t on employment
                                                                        - •~                                            ___
could be significant.


An     alternative         would be          for     the    Football Trust effectively to become the
Board,        with     the     existing            voluntary         Spotting-the-Ball             contributions           being
increased,      if     it was        felt        football      needed        them,       either    by additional           funds
from     the    Exchequer,            or    by      abolishing VAT on the pools'                        Spotting-the-Ball
competition,          and agreeing               with    the PPA            th a t    the proceeds          of    around £4^m.
per annum be added to th e £8 million currently being made available,                                                         ^


Conclusion


Leaving the existing Trust arrangem ents as they are, with the PPA 's Spotting-
the-Ball competition remaining                          the sole source of funding, is without doubt
the    best     solution.            We     have        seen    that        it       would be possible            to    increase
ministerial involvement in its activities, and certainly a new Government keen
to impress its wishes on football would find the Football Trust always willing                                                          ^
to consider its ideas, as have the Pool Prom oters. If it is felt th at football
needs     more        money         than     it    is currently         receiving,           the   elimination          of VAT
on Spotting-the-Ball or a reduction in pool betting duty of 2 \ per c en t could,
as we have seen, be w orth £ 4 i million and £5 million respectively.                                                    If both
concessions          were     made,         and c u rrent           Trust        arrangem ents        and paym ents               for
the use of the fixtures                    on the coupons continued at the sam e level (together
worth about £14 million this year) the pools would be contributing over £22
million to football - roughly the same amount as the H orserace B etting Levy
Board receives from bookmakers each year.                                         With the arrangem ents in force
and working well,              based        on      the goodwill and voluntary co-operation of all
the     interests      concerned,           it     would       be     perverse          to   put     these       long-standing
relationships         at     risk     through           imposing       on         football     and     on        the    pools       a
bureaucratic sta te body, th e te rm s of referen ce for whose existence are amply
covered in the Deed establishing the Football Trust.

                                                  A discussion paper




 Introduction


 This p ap er has been prepared for the consideration of Members of Parliam ent
 and     o th e r in terested        individuals as a contribution                  to the      c u rre n t debate on
 foo tball's financial needs.                  It considers the case for a Football Levy Board,
 and re la te d aspects.


Previous reports and recom m endations


In th e     last      18 years       two official bodies have recom m ended a levy on the
turnover of football pools.                    The first, in 1968, was the C o m m itte e on Football
chaired by Sir           Norman C hester,               which recommended                a levy unaccompanied
by any         reduction inpool betting duty (then imposed a t                               the r a te of 25 per
cent).             Ten       years la te r      the     Royal         Commission           on    Gambling,         under
Lord Rothschild's chairmanship, proposed in its final rep ort th e establishm ent
of a Football Board funded by the proceeds of a 3                                        per c e n t reduction in
pool     b e ttin g      duty,      which by          then      had    risen    to    40         per cent.          This
recom m endation was contrary to th at contained in their interim report.


The      Royal Commission's             recommendations                for a Football           Board     were      quite
detailed,      and       th a t     section of        th eir    report   is    reproduced        as Appendix          A.
The      re p o rt also proposed         th a t    the       Football Grounds Im provem ent Trust (in
1977-78 still         in its        infancy)      be           wound up        or absorbed by th e new Football
Board:      this was a              consequence of their recom m endation                       th a t all Spotting-
the-B all com petitions (including that run by the Pool P ro m o te rs Association)
be made illegal.


From tim e to tim e o th e r organisations and individuals, including th e Football
A ssociation,         have        supported       the     establishm ent       of    a     football      levy     board,
generally for one or more of the following reasons:
1.      Because               football as a whole is                  tre a te d less favourably than horseracing,
which     enjoys an exclusive source of revenue through the H orserace B etting
Levy Board.

2.    Because the Government "takes out of football" enormous sums in pool
bettin g levy.                                                                                              _
3.    Because the pools "make vast                     profits" and put "almost nothing back into
football".
4.    Because         football      is    the    British   national      game,      and   th e re fo re   deserves
special help, not least because clubs a re desperately short of money.


1.    A parallel w ith horseracing?


In th e most recen t year, th e H orserace Betting Levy Board received income
o f £21    million from the levy on bookmakers.                                Since 1980 the to ta l is £96
million.       It is generally             acknowledged that the Board does a good job for
racing,    and has been responsible                   for providing prize money and for funding
extensive programm es of modernisation and improvement at many of Britain's
racecourses.            Its   chairm an          and two       members     are     appointed     by the         Home
S ecretary , the Jockey Club nominates three, and the membership is completed
by the chairm en of the T otalisator Board, and of the Bookmakers' C om m ittee.
The board reports to the Home Secretary, and thus to P arliam ent.                                        It should
be    appreciated that           b ettin g duty is only 10 per cent, and bettin g turnover
to ta ls £4 billion per annum.                     It is thus a vastly larger business than the
football     pools,    whose        turnover       in 1984-85 was £520 million,                and which paid
£221 million in pool betting duty.


Rothschild        clearly        had       the    racing       levy    board     much     in    mind      when    he
recom m ended a Football Board.                       But that report             was published eight years
ago and much has happened since.


First,     the Football Grounds Improvement Trust has become                                   an indispensable
 means of assisting League clubs in England, Scotland and Wales comply with
the      Safety    of Sports Grounds A ct                  1975, and to undertake               programm es to
improve sp ec ta to r am enities.                  G rants paid out            for safety      alone since 1975
exceed £20 million in total.


Secondly, payments made by the pools companies to the various leagues and
 associations whose m atches appear on the weekly coupons have risen steadily,
 particularly      since      the        com m encem ent        of the new co n tra ct         agreed     with the
 Football League at the end of 1984.                               The Football League and th e Scottish
                                                       -    3   -




League     to g eth er      receive     £5.2      million            annually,         the     Football        Association
£382,000     and      others       £107,000       making              a     to ta l     of     £5,689,000.          These
arrangem ents also cost the PPA £853,000 in VAT.


Thirdly, pool betting duty has again been increased - to 42£ per cen t - and
as we have shown produces for the Exchequer £221 million annually.


And     fourthly,    the     Football     Trust        has          been    established            with     a constitution
and term s     of    referen ce       sim ilar    to       those recom m ended                 by Rothschild for a
Football Board, but with significantly higher levels of funding.


I retu rn to these four points later.


2.    The G overnm ent's "take" from football


It is frequently claimed th a t the Government takes f ar more from the game
than it puts in.            Literaj^y^speajcing, this is undoubtedly^true.                                   As a branch
of the e n tertainm en t          industry,      football           makes a substantial net contribution
in VAT payments, some clubs (a minority) pay corporation tax on their profits,
all pay PAYE tax and DHSS contributions in respect of their employees, and
local   authority        rates,   and    nearly        all contribute             something           for     the cost of
policing their grounds.


But none of these payments               is unique to football;                       what is more usually meant
in this context is the duty              paid by the pools companies - or more accurately,
th eir clients,     as it comes          out of            winnings - on their coupon                        competitions.
Much of the football industry clearly regards this as "their money", and pool
betting duty        is thus a "tax on football".                          The present G overnm ent, and its
predecessors, see the situation differently.                              They have           regarded it as a tax
on gambling,        analogous to         licence           fees for am usem ent                    machines or casinos
(and no-one is suggesting th a t the revenue raised from them should go back
into those industries.)


The pool companies them selves take the same view, and would expect their
clients to be the primary beneficiaries of any reduction in pool betting duty,
although    the     1984 copyright         agreem ent               does provide             for    two     fifths of the
revenue    gained        from a 2£ per cent reduction in duty to be given to the
Football League as an additional payment.


However,           should        a     Chancellor of tilt Exchequer                   wish to give        more     money
to football through the device of reducing pool b e ttin g duty, th a t would clearly
be a m a tte r for him, and football would not refuse it.


The PPA also pays VAT on Spotting-the-Ball,                                    the annual to ta l being around
£4^    million.             If       the    com petition were relieved                of   this burden,      the     pools
might well be persuaded to increase the £8 million or so which they currently
pass to th e Football Trust by the whole amount of the relief.


3.    The pools' "vast profits"


Out of the £520m. taken in stakes on the pools coupons by the three PPA
members in th e year up to 31 July 1985, £ 2 2 lm , as we have seen, went to
the G overnm ent               in pool betting duty.                     Of the remaining £299m, the total
returned to winners was £140m.                                £I42.2m. went in expenses, leaving a profit
of £16.8m, o f which £13.4m. was earned during the British football season.


The figure of £13.4m. m atches closely the amount which the pools put into
British football over the same period.                               The cost to th e PPA of              the copyright
agreem ent to use British m atches on the coupons was (including VAT) £6.5m.
and the        p ay m en ts          from Spotting-the-Ball               to the Trusts just exceeded £7m.
in the year ending 31 July 1985.


4.    F o o tb all's need for additional help


British fo o tball’s financial requirements are hard to quantify, and it is difficult
to obtain          a g re e m e n t        from      the    interested     p arties   on    just   what     is needed.
Perhaps        the      best         s tartin g     point    is to set      down some         assertions on which
there is likely to be reasonably broad agreement:


a.    D espite        a num ber of alarms and                        close-run calls,       none of       the 92 clubs
in the        English        Football            League      has gone out of business              since Accrington
Stanley       in     1961.           This        despite    constantly     falling    atten dan ces,   higher police
charges,       in terru p tio n s           in    the      payment   of    television      broadcasting      fees,    and
the    loss     of      sponsorship              and other income caused               by a v ariety       of reasons
including the            1985 controls on alcohol, sp ectator violence and the exclusion
of English clubs from European competitions.
b.    Despite causing considerable initial inconvenience at b num ber of grounds,
th e extension of designations under the 1975 S afety of Sports Grounds Act
does not appear         to be driving sm aller clubs out of business:            the majority
ap pear able       to find the        25 per cen t balance of th e cost      of s afety works
(a fte r FGlT's 75 per cent grants), albeit accepting th e imposition of reduced
crow d cap acities in many cases.


c.    Im m ediately below the Football League th e re exists a t least a score of
apparently well-run and profitable clubs able to ta k e places in th e English
Fourth Division, should vacancies               occur, w ith little or no overall weakening
o f th e competition.


d.    The tra n s fe r m arket        for British players appears to have stabilised, with
some clubs still able              to find colossal fees for a small num ber of players,
but     without    reaching    th e    very high levels of 3-4 years ago (which caused
offence     to    sections    of    the   British public).   There   are   however a number
o f players and m anagers who continue to be paid enormous wages, despite
th e apparent      poverty of many clubs.             Football League figures indicate that
32 first division players a re receiving over £60,000 a year, and another 50
over £40,000.


e.    The crowd behaviour reco rd in 1985-86 is greatly improved com pared with
th e previous season.              The number of a rre sts was 51 per c e n t down in the
English first division in the 1985-86 season com pared with 1984-85.


f.    The Football Trust            has been able to find the funds necessary to assist
all clubs in the top two English and Scottish prem ier divisions with 100 per
cent grants to install closed circuit television.


g.    The Football Grounds Improvement Trust appears to have no immediate
need to call upon the additional £1 million made available to it by the Football
Trust    in 1985 to assist with the additional safety burdens imposed on clubs
following th e events of April and May 1985.


However, th ere are those in football who would make the following points:


a.    Whilst th e FGIT may have adequate funds to cope with em ergency safety
work,     designation                under          the     A ct     is    i^ v in p     fpanv          pounds        with     woefully
inadequate           stru c tu re s,         so u n attractiv e            as to discourage erstw hile supporters
from returning.


b.      There            is      insufficient              money          immediately             available          for     significant
program m es             of     ground improvements (e.g.                          covering of terracing,                    installation
of more seating, new refreshm ent facilities, decent lavatories, and so on).


c.     Football           needs           a number (perhaps as many as                              12) "showpiece" football
stadia, built specially or expensively rebuilt to provide 21st century amenities.


d.      None         of       the      four        home      countries        has      an    adequ ate           national       stadium :
Wales does not have one at all, Scotland's has little covered accom m odation
and insufficient seating, Northern Ireland's ground has its old main grandstand
condemned             for       fire       safety         reasons,        and even Wembley                     is showing its         age
(and does not belong to football, anyway).


e.     Closed circ u it television should be installed at clubs in th e lower divisions,
but th e re are no plans to find the funds for this.


f.      With        more        money,             the    Football Trust           could extend its program m es                        of
help     for        grassroots             football.          Many         schemes fail           to     go      ahead        because of
the difficulty in raising the 50 per cent share which the Trust insists upon
in many areas.


Undoubtedly th e re                   is some truth in each of these assertions.                                           But w hether
any     of     them            carrie s       sufficient           force    to     justify     large          im m ediate      increases
in     funding        is       more         debatable.              Given        time,      and     the        continuation of         the
existing Trust                 arrangem ents, it should be possible for the two Trusts to get
around         to     most           of     this     work      in due        course.           Within          the    list    there    are
 problems           of        priorities:            should        showpiece           clubs       or     national         stadia     take
 precedence over an expansion of grassroots activity, for example?


An equally               difficult          dilemma for government is having to choose                                         to divert
 resources          to        help        football,       ra th e r than o th er sports,                like     Rugby League or
 hockey,        which have                  no grant-giving               trusts    to help them ,               and no reason to
 be linked to                 the     football pools.                 And why sport, ra th e r than the arts, or
 schools, or th e health service?
Establishing a Football Board


The only serious a tte m p t                      to describe how a Football Board                      might work is
in     the     final        report         of    the     Royal         Commission     on   Gambling.           Rothschild
proposed         that       the     funds would come from                      a 3 per c en t      reduction in pool
b e ttin g     duty (currently                  worth     about £15.5          million a year).         Assuming that
his     recom m endation               th at      Spotting-the-Ball            be   abolished    rem ains      re je cted   -
no one has put this forward seriously since 1978 - football could get funds
from         th ree     d ifferent          pools       sources:        from    Spotting-the-B all      to     the   Trusts
(this    y ear        running        at     £8m.),        from     copyright        payments     for   use   of fixtures
(£5.689m.), and from the reduction in pool betting duty (or from sources of
 taxation, including VAT), with the amount a t this stage unknown.


 The next question th a t needs to be answered is how the responsibilities and
 are as of activity of the Football Board would d iffer from those of the two
 Trusts,       assuming           th a t        they     remained        in   existence.       R othschild's     thoughts
 on the Board's term s of reference were contained in paragraph 11.114.


 We      see      imm ediately              th a t     th ere     is    an     enormous    overlap      betw een       what     /
 Rothschild said a Football Board could do, and what the Football Trust and
 the     FGIT         are    already            doing.      His suggestions on             the   B oard's    composition        )
 (para       11.120) also bear more than a passing resem blance to the membership (
 of the Football Trust, except th a t the la tte r is ra th e r m ore represen tative,                                          ]
 in th a t it contains individuals nominated by the Association of Chief Police
 O fficers,       the       local    authority associations and indeed the M inister for Sport.
 Whilst        the     present        m inister and his two predecessors have                          all nominated a
T civil servant) to represent him, th e re would be nothing to stop the Minister
 appointing himself if he wished.                               A copy of the Trust Deed is annexed.


 One area where the Football Trust has gone against R othschild's recommendations
 is in administration.                          It has not appointed a full-tim e ch ie f executive with
 a support staff, but preferred instead to rely on th e e x p e rtise and regional
 organisation of those bodies which assist it with administering g rant aid schemes,
 o f which the Sports Councils for England, Scotland and Wales are the most
 im portant           as far as the grassroots of football are concerned.                                      (The e n tire
 adm inistration costs of the Football Trust are well under 2 per cent of the
 moneys th a t it receives).
Inevitably one is bound to ask what would be the point of having a Football
Board alongside the two Trusts.                          It would of course be possible to wind up
the    Trusts        and     convert        the    existing voluntary              contributions         from    Spotting-
the-Ball into statu tory levies, and provide e x tra funding directly to the Football
Board from the Exchequer or from reducing pool betting duty.                                                     But what
would this achieve?                 It would be bound to d e stroy the goodwill of th e PPA,
who would see such a move not only as a breach^Df fa ith , but as a direct
a tta c k on their com m ercial activities.                       The consequent e f f e c t on employment
could be significant.


An     alternative          would be         for    the Football Trust e ffectively                  to become the
Board,        with     the      existing           voluntary      Spotting-the-Ball            contributions              being
increased,      if     it    was    fe lt     football       needed        them,    either     by    additional           funds
from     the    Exchequer,          or      by abolishing VAT on the                      pools'    Spotting-the-Ball
competition,          and agreeing            with     the PPA         th a t    the proceeds            of around £ 4 im .
per annum be added to th e £8 million currently being made available.                                                 ~     ^
                                                                                                                  ^         \

Conclusion


Leaving the existing T rust arrangem ents as they are, with the PPA's Spotting-
the-Ball competition rem aining the sole source of funding, is without doubt
the    best     solution.           We      have      seen     that    it       would be possible           to    increase
ministerial involvement in its activities, and certainly a new Government keen
to impress its wishes on football would find the Football T rust always willing ^
to consider its ideas, as have th e Pool Prom oters. If it is felt th a t football
needs     more        money than            it     is currently       receiving,         the elim ination of VAT
on Spotting-the-Ball or a reduction in pool betting duty of 2£ per cen t could,
as we have seen, be worth £ 4 i million and £5 million respectively.                                                  If both
concessions          were     made,         and     cu rre n t Trust        arrangem ents          and payments             for
the use of the fixtures                  on the coupons continued a t the sam e level (together
worth about £14 million this year) the pools would be contributing over £22
million to football - roughly th e same amount as the H orserace B etting Levy
Board receives from bookmakers each year.                                    With the arrangem ents in force
and working well,              based        on     the goodwill and voluntary co-operation of all
the     interests      concerned,           it     would     be   perverse          to   put    these      long-standing
relationships         at     risk    through          imposing        on     football     and       on     the    pools         a
b u reaucratic s ta te body, th e te rm s of reference for whose existence are amply
covered in the Deed establishing the Football Trust.

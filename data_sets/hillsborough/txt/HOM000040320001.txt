were     entering                 the        ground       via       the       turnstiles.

During        the           afternoor^reading                       up       to    kick-off                time       at    about          2.15    p.m.          r

noticed            that        the / r o w d         appeared                to    be       slow          in                               the

turnstiles..                   f am          not    sure       of    the          size          of       the    cj^owd      but       believe          it       to

be    25,000            and       30,000.

At    2.40         p.m.        that          same     date       I checked                  with          the    camera          which          covers

the    Penistone                  Road        area     and       noticed               that          there       were       very       few       people

in    the     streets,                  and    on     checking               the       computer,                it    was    showing             19,000

plus,        and        when           each    area       of     the         ground             gets       near       to    capacity             the

totals            start        to       pulsate,          the       total          capacity                for.that- a r e a               of    the

ground        being            21,000,             which       told          me    that          nearly          all       the    Nottingham

supporters                  were        in    the     ground          and         it    was          near       to    full       capacity.

I then            switched              to    the     camera          that         was          covering             the    Leppings             Lane       end

of    the         ground          and        noticed        that         there          was          a    large       gathering             of    fans          in

that     area.               I co^ild          see     that         the       fans          were          spread       from       the       turnstile

entrance             right'back                into       Leppings                Lane,          fully          blocking          the       road.           I

would        estimate                  that    there        would            be    between                3.000       and    5,000          fans.           I

made     a        check        of       the     computer            and       saw       that ^ h e              figures          for       the    West

Lane     figures               were          showing        in      excess             of       7,000,          which       would          be    near       to

capacity            and        the          computer        w o u l d >6e a t               a    point          ready       to    start

pulsating.                   The        figures        on      the       computer                start          to    pulsate          when       the

capacities                  get        to    within       15%       of       the       total.              It    was       obvious          that

looking            at       the        crowd       freJm o u t s i d e            trying             to    get       in.that          there       would

the    scene            I    could           see    the     crowd            getting             larger          and       many       at    the    back

turnstiles.                     From           that       point           I    could          also       see        Police           Officers           trying

to       get    the       crowd               into       some        sort       of       order          but       they        were        being     pushed

to       one    side        out           of    the       way.            I saw          several             missiles               being       thrown

towards           the       Police.                  A    large           contingent                of       the        fans'were              climbing

onto       the       backs         of          others          and        climbing             the       walls               over    the top       of       the

turnstiles;                 they           were          landing              onto       the       asbestos                  roofs      on the     inside

of       the    ground           and           jumping             onto        people          who       were           on    the       inside      of      the

ground          to     break              their          fall        as       they       landed.

On       the    South           Stand           of       this        area       I       saw    a    mounted                  Policeman           being

pushed          on     his       horse              down       towards              a    large          double              door     which       leads          into

D u r i ng      all       this            I    could          hear        several             officers               yficluding

At       this     point           I       noticed             that        the       large          door        situated              on    the    South

side       of     Leppings                    Lans       open,          and     there          was       a     surge           of    about        1,000         fans

run       into       the        ground.                  Within           a    minute          of       this           happening           I noticed

again          about        1,000              fans       run        into       the          ground.               I        could    tell       from       the

noises          on     the        radios             from          the        officers             in    that               area that       the

Liverpool              fans           were          very        boisterousand                      excited             and          appeared         to      be

heavily           intoxicated                       with        drink.

I then          turned            to          the    camera that                    was       inside            tij)£ g r o u n d         and     covered

                          During           the        incident               I was           trying            to    concentrate                on    messages          being

Continuation of statement of ........................................ .........................................................................................................
 On Saturday, 15 J^ril 1989, I was on .duty for the Sard. Final between Liverpool
  and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10.00,a.m. that date.
  At about 12.45 p.m. after the turnstiles were open I switched all video
  recorders on to record all the fans as .they were entering the ground yia.
    the turnstiles.
  During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about,2.15 p.m. I noticed
    that the crowd appeared to be slow i n _arriving at the turnstiles.. ,1 am. not
    sure of the size qf the crowd, but: believe it t o b e ; betoken 25,0.00 and.30,000.
    At 2.40 p.m. that same.date. I checked with the camera which covers .the
    Penistone Road area and npticed that there were very few people in the streets,
    and on checking the computer it was shewing 19,000 plus, and. when each.area,
    qf the ground .gets; near to capacity .the totals start to pulsate,, the total,
    capacity for that area of the ground being 21 ,00.0 , which told me. .that nearly
    all the^ Nottingharn supporters^ ware in the ground and it .was near to .full.
    capacity.               A ......................................... .....................
    I then switched to the camera that w a s .covering the .Leppings. Lane end.of the
    ground and noticed that there was a large, gathering of fans. in. that .area..
    I could see that the .fans were spread from the turnstile entrance right back
    into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.                                                             I would estimate that .there,
    would be between 3,000 and 5,000 .fans.                                                    I made a check of.the computer.and.
    saw that the figures.for the West Stand were pulsating and.showing near.to.
    capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures v^re showing in excess of 7,000,
    which would be near to capacity and the .computer would be at. a point ready,
    to start pulsating.                            The figures, on the computer start to. pulsate .when the.
    capacities get to within 15% of the total.............. ■
    It was obvious, .that looking at. the crowd from outside trying, to .get .in, .that
    there would not be sufficient, room for all to. be. accqnxnqdated. . As I looked,
    at the scene I .could .see the. crowd getting larger and .many, at the back.of.
    the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the. turnstiles ......
    From .that point I could also see Police Officers, .trying to. get the. crowd,
    into .some sort, of order but. they, were being, pushed .to one. side, out of .the.way.
    I saw several missiles being, thrown towards the Police...A. large .contingent,
    of the fans were climbing onto the .backs.of others .and.climbing, 'the .walls
    over the top of the turnstiles.;.. they .were.landing onto.the. asbestos roofs .

 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being pushed on
 his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of the
 West Stand.
 During         1 this I could hear several.officers including Superintendent

 to be opened in order to let fans,into.the cpround to.save a major incident .

    HAROLD GUEST, Police Constable 1421, South Yorkshire Police.



    I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present

    stationed at Deepcar.



    During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

    Hillsborough Football Ground.



    My duties consist of working in the video roan in company with the

    Chief Security Officer, Mr. LOCK.



    The video room is situated near to the Players' Entrance on the

    South Stand of the ground.



    In this room there are 20 T.V. monitors which are covered by

    cameras which are strategically placed around the ground to cover

    all 95 turnstiles.   There is also a T.V. monitor which can De

    operated by a switch which will operate and show any view by the

    cameras from the main Police control point situated between the

    West and South Stands.   There is also a computer which shows all

    95 turnstiles and can tell at anytime during a match how many

    persons have passed through     each turnstile at any given point.

    Each section of the ground for exanple the Spion Kop it will give

    a figure showing the exact number of people in that area of the

    ground.   These figures for that section of the ground are then

    added up to give a grand total at the end.     The computer scans all

    the turnstiles and takes approximately 2 \ seconds.



    On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the Semi Final between

    Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10.00 a.m.




                                    71
that date.    At ebcut 12.45 p.m. after the turnstiles were open

I switched all video recorders on to record all the fans as they

were entering the ground via the turnstiles.



During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 p.m.

I noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the

turnstiles.    I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it

to be between 25,000 and 30,000.



At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera which covers

the Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people

in the streets, and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000

plus, and when each area of the ground gets near to capacity the

totals start to pulsate, the total capacity for that area of the

ground being 21,000, which told me that nearly all the Nottingham

supporters were in the ground and it was near to full capacity.



I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane

end of the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of

fans in that area.     I could see that the fans were spread from the

turnstile entrance right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking

the road.     I would estimate that there would be between 3,000 and

5,000 fans.     I made a check of the computer and saw that the

figures for the West Stand were pulsating and showing near to

capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of

7,000, which would be near to capacity and the computer would be at

point ready to start pulsating.     The figures on the computer start

to pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

It was obvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to get
in that there would not be sufficient room for all to be

accommodated.   As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd

getting larger and many at the back of the crowd were surging

forward pushing violently towards the turnstiles.   From that point

I could also see Police Officers trying to get the crowd into some

sort of order but they were being pushed to one side out of the

way.   I saw several missiles being thrown towards the Police.     A

large contingent of the fans were climbing onto the backs of others

and climbing the walls over the top of the turnstiles;     they were

landing onto the asbestos roofs on the inside of the ground and

jumping onto people who were on the inside of the ground to break

their fall as they landed.



On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being

pushed on his horse down towards a large double door which leads

into the rear of the West Stand.



During all this I could hear several officers including Superinten­

dent Marshall requesting further assistance in that area, for the double

doors to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a

major incident outside, also for the match to be delayed for a

further 15 minutes.



At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South

side of Leppings Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000

fans run into the ground.    Within a minute of this happening I

noticed that the large doors of the North side of Leppings Lane

open and again about 1,000 fans run into the ground.     I could tell

from the noises on the radios from the officers in that area that the
Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited,'and appeared

to be heavily intoxicated with drink.



I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered

the area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation

was getting out of hand and people were being pushed up against the

fencing on the perimeter of the ground.



I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area

of the ground to assist with the injured and dying.



By this time injured persons were being brought to the Players’

Entrance area of the ground and I assisted in treating people in

that area and arranging for ambulances to be directed in that area

to ferry the injured to hospital.



I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the

Police personal radios were working very well, but during the day

there appeared to be some distortion, and some messages could not

be read clearly.



I would only like to add that in my opinion that the ms in cause of

this major incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at

the match too late and being under the influence of drink and trying

to enter the ground without tickets.    It was obvious that looking

at the crowd outside the ground prior to kick off there were several

thousands that were attempting to enter without tickets at all cost

I am a Police Officer iri the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Decpcar.

During the last four years 1 have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in the video room in company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the.ground regulations in respcct of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with .the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

about to enter, to make sure that no more persons ape allowed into that

area than the regulations set.             If there are to inform control to arrange

for turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to be

moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

are not known in advance.

On a ticket- match this rolE be’comes a watching brief with the main,

concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

The video room is situated near to the players entrance on the South

Stands        My duties are to liaise with the club and the Police.           Any

problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock

.and' and involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

to the control room.

In this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras

which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 99

turnstiles.          There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a

switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras froa the main

           ***** •       *


 Police control point situated between the- West and South Stands-             There- is

 also a computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time
                     I                                                  \
 during a match how' many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

 Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

 a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

 through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

 for that area of the ground.

 There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

 there is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.              The

 computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

 On Saturday 15 April 1989> I was on duty for the semi-final between

 Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

 date.     At about 12.^5pm after the turnstiles were open I switched all

 video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

 via the turnstiles.

 During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

 noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.

 X am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 2 5 , 0 0 0 and

 30,000.

 At 2.40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

 Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in th^
                                                         *** K ,        k ty * .   Wf.,
 streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 plus.* When

 each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

 the total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me

 that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

 near to full capacity,      v*

 I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

 the ground and noticed U m t there was a large gathering of Tans in that
area.     I could see that the fans wore spread from the turnstile entrance

risht back into L^pings Lane, fully blocking the road.       I would estimate

that there would be between 3.000 and 5,000 fans.      1 made a check of the

computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating.      The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.     From that point I   could also see Police Officers trying to

get the crowd     into some sortof order but they were being pushed to one

side out of the way.     I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

Police.     A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

the ground to break their fall as they landed.

On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

the West Stand.

During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

outside, also     for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

At this point     I noticed shat a large door situated on the South Side of

Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

the ground.     I could tell from the noises on the radios from th« officers

in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.
     [ then turnyd to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the

    area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting

    out of hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the

    perimeter of the ground.                                                            ,   l
        K u fx -w A                     i f * * «?,*<! *u«.y t              s » ./v 4           .
    At fcWe -po4a^ 1 tried to usfe my personal radio-in.order to contact Police

    Control that further Police assistance was required urgently at the

    Leppings Lane end of the ground                  but each time 1 tried to use the radio I

(' vas blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try further to

    •use it.

    I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

    Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged and could not get

    through.          ‘At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to •

    organise some safety measures with the security personel.
                                                                       O
    Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

    he is the person           who installed all the videos        and computer system.

    As he could also           see what was taking place he also left the room in.order

    to assist in any           way he could.,

    I could see that           all available officers were being sent to this area of
/
    the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

    By this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

    the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging

    for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to
/
    hospital.

    I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

y personal radios were working very well but during the day there appeared

    to be some distortion and some messages could not be read clearly.

    I would like to add that in my opinion, the main cause of this major

    incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late
/
    and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground
without rickcls.       It was obvious that looking at the crowd'outside the

ground prior to kick-oIT there were several thousands that were attempting
                   9

to enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of otfie.r Liverpool

supporters inside the ground.

During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages beingreceived

on the Policc radio network but did not listen to what was being

transmitted on the back to back radio system owned by the club, as X knew

Mr Lock would deal with any situation that had developed.

After the incident I made a note of all the people that had entered      the

ground as shown on the computer and they are as follows

Spion   Kop                            19,906

North   Stand                           8,109

South   Stand Covered                   **,740
                                                        P
South Stand Uncovered                   3,255

Leppings Lane                           7,038

West Stand                              5,618

                   TOTAL               48,666

These numbers would not give a true reading of the exact amount of persons

entering the ground due to the gates being opened and several hundreds

entering the ground without tickets and trying to gain access, by any

means, t

                   (Morning Session)



             BRIAN LEONARD MOLE Recalled
           Examined by MR. COLLINS     (cont.)

Mr. Mole, before we progress in your evidence I would just
like to deal with one matter that was covered yesterday.
- A. Yes sir.

I don't know whether you have read any of the reports of
your evidence about the allocation of the ends at
Hillsborough? - A. No, I have not sir.

Well if you had I think you would have been rather surprised
by them because they don't accurately reflect what you said.

      As I understand your evidence, and I think as every­
one in this room understood your evidence, it was to this
effect, was it not, that you made it crystal clear to the
P.A. and indeed to the Club that the only basis upon which
you would agree to the game being held at Hillsborough was
on the basis of Liverpool having the ends they had and
Nottingham the other end? - A. That is  correct sir, yes.

And that if they wished therefore to hold the event at
Hillsborough that was the basis upon which they should hold
it? - A. That too is correct sir.

But if they did not like that arrangement then obviously
they had the opportunity to find another ground at which
they could hold the event? - A. I presume that would be
the course of action that they would take.

      MR. WOODWARD:  Sir, I am grateful to learned Counsel
for the Inquiry for making that point because we were
rather concerned with the coverage in the media both broad ­
cast and printed concerning the evidence that Mr. Mole
had given and that not only the appearance that 'people
may have heard things which they wished to hear rather
than listen to what was said, but also slanted that which
they wished to hear.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I don't know, Mr. Woodward,
it is put right now anyway.

      MR. COLLINS:   Now Mr. Mole again before I come on
to inside, inevitably overnight there are one or two matters
that I think I ought to ask you to deal with.

      Now the first is as I understand it the plan that
was adopted for 1989 was essentially the same as that
initiated in 1987? - A. That is correct, sir.
|vl/



                                             B.L. MOLE


       Q. That was a plan devised by you.    Is that right? - A. It
          was sir, yes.

       Q.   Obviously with consultation with other Officers? -   A. Yes.

       Q.    So far as the ultimate approval of that plan for each year
            was concerned, was that you or someone else? - A. I would
            prepare the plan in consultation with my Officers and
            sign that plan and forward it to Headquarters as a copy
            for information sir.

       Q. By "Headquarters" you mean? - A. The Assistant Chief Constable
          of Operations would receive a copy of the order.

       Q.   Mr. Jackson? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

       Q.   Did Mr. Jackson have the ultimate decision whether or not
            to approve? - A. If in fact he had any fault with the order
            then he would have that sanctioned to rectify that matter
            and refer it back to me sir.

       Q. So it was his ultimate decision as to whether that plan
          should go ahead or be modified? - A. That is correct sir.

       Q. Did he have any comments can you recall in relation to the
          plan on any of the years 1987, 1988, 1989? - A. No sir.
          In brief during the arrangements I am often in consultation
          with Mr. Jackson as well as my subordinate Officers so most
          of the matters are resolved before I put pen to paper with
          the final plan, but certainly there were no particular
          comments which would require modification or rectification
          once I submitted that order for the seal of approval sir.

       Q. The next thing I would like just to ask you about is horses.
          Clearly the use of mounted Officers is something which is
          recognised as being invaluable in crowd control? - A. I
          find it invaluable sir, yes.

       Q. Indeed if one looks at what we have as Document 11 which
          is the South Yorkshire Standing Instructions for Policing
          of Football Matches.  If you would turn to page 5 of that
          document, paragraph 7.6? - A. Yes sir.

       Q. Incidentally I assume you are well aware of this document
          which emanates from Mr. Jackson and is dated March 1986?
          - A. I am indeed sir, yes.

       Q. It is a memo from Mr. Jackson to effectively those concerned
          dealing with already updating the Yorkshire Instructions
          following  the Popplewell Report.  That is right, is it?
          - A. That is correct sir, yes.

       Q. 7.6 one sees Police horses are dealt with and their role
          is set out as thus:

                  "They should be used to escort visiting supporters
                  to and from the ground in the segregation
                                 Q.L. MOLE


      of opposing fans, regulating queues at turn­
      stiles and clearing the playing area in the
      event of serious crowd invasion".

A. Yes sir.

Now it was part of your Operational Order that there should
be a number of mounted Officers available? - A. That is
correct sir, yes.

Again to see that can we go to Document 14 which is the
'F' Divisional Operational Order, the relevant one.  Turn
to top right-hand corner 4, para. 3.9.1:

      "Members of the mounted section will be
      employed outside the ground to maintain
      order, segregate supporters and escort them
      from and to their transport".

A. Yes sir.

It does not there say anything about helping to form queues
as part of the duties of the mounted section? - A. In point
of fact sir that is correct, it does not there, but
certainly the briefing by Mr. Hans-Davies would certainly
concern that aspect, particularly in relation to Penistone
Road.  Those Officers are regularly used on that function
and are aware of the action they take and in Leppings Lane
sir.

Now in Leppings Lane the ability of the mounted Officers
to help in queue form is limited by the geography of the
entrance, is it not? - A. It is very difficult to operate
certainly within the perimeter fence because of the
confines of application, but certainly they cah operate
in Leppings Lane keeping the crowd in a queue form
on the footpath and not on the highway and that is the kind
of action they undertake sir.

That is their major role surely is to prevent a crush
on the perimeter fence as it were? - A. Public safety
sir is the major role  that they form in that locality.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  What is the sort of queue you
have in mind looking at Composite 1, 20A, it is South
Yorkshire Police Volume 1.  If you look at that it looks
as though the Of ficers there are operating both mounted
and otherwise to keep the stream coming down that pavement?
- A. That is right sir.

I don't know, because what we don't know is what happens
when it just goes off the photograph to the right, but is
that what you meant? - A. That is the kind of operation
they would carry out sir.

      MR. COLLINS:  I think one sees that even more
clearly on 22A where the Officer in question is obviously
directing people to go to his right? - A. Yes.
                                  B.L. MOLE



      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  But that really amounts to
keeping the stream on the pavement.  It is not quite the
same as producing a queue towards the turnstile, is it?
- A. I think the difficulty is as I described the perimeter
fence is difficult to operate inside that actual area.

      MR. COLLINS:  Which means that the ability of mounted
Officers to help control crowding inside the perimeter
fence is somewhat limited? - A. That is right, sir.  My
experience is of a limited flow which usually occurs and
which this action has facilitated in the past to bring
them to the turnstiles and then once they get into the
perimeter fence area they approach their various turnstile
positions.

Indeed.  Would it be fair to say if you get overcrowding
in front of the turnstiles,that is inside the perimeter
fence, Police horses can be somewhat dangerous because
it is a confined space with a lot of people about? - A.
My experience is that the horses are very experienced
and can operate in those situations and regularly do so.
To put them inside the pens in a very confined area could
be difficult, but I think they are very used to this
operation and in fact operate very well in that kind of
a situation.

As I understand it you have never had to, or you have never
had experience of this sort of situation before.  Is that
right? - A. At a football match?

Yes? - A. I have   not had the large swell and appearance
 in numbers that   were seen on this occasion.

Who was in ultimate control of the   mounted section? - A.
Inspector Hans-Davies.

He was not answerable to any Superintendent? - A. He is
answerable to the Officer in charge of the operation which
would be myself, but his deployment of horses rests on
him because of his expertise and knowledge in deploying
those horses in the past.

So effectively he has an independent command? - A. He has
that command with my knowledge and with my consultation
and approval.

So that means that for example Superintendent Marshall has
no direct responsibility or control over the mounted Officers.
Equally Superintendent Greenwood in the ground doesn't?
- The mounted section is a support service but because of
the command structure within the Police Service, Mr. Marshall
would have the authority to direct Mr. Hans-Davies but  the
actual deployment at the time is down to that Officer as it
is to other sub-sector Commanders in the various areas of
their responsibility.

Now apart from horses the other aid that certainly was in
use in 1988 was a spotter plane,wasn't it? - A. That
is correct sir.

Was that for traffic purposes or also to monitor crowd
arrival and position of fans and so on? - A. It was for
traffic.  Because of our experiences in 1987 when in fact
we had a build up on the motorways it was intended to
pick up if those same problems were arising in 1988.

Did you have a spotter plane in use in 1989? - A. No sir.

Why not? - A. The need for it in 1988 was very minimal.
It had no purpose that was of beneficial value at that
time and the need to utilise it again on this occasion
was felt not to be necessary.

Of course it can be used, can it not, to monitor as I have
said the position of fans and to see how many are approaching
the ground and from what quarter? - A. It could be sir
but that situation had not arisen in 1988 and the need for
the spotter planewas not perceived.




                       /Q. Was the question
                          6



                                                B.L. MOLE




Q.   Was the question asked?   -   A. It was   indeed.

Q.   Whether it would have a use over and above a traffic use?
        A. It was discussed and felt that because of what had
     been experienced the need was not, as  I say, perceived.

Q.    Can I, before we leave outside, refer you to one or two
     matters in the Standing Instructions, document 11.   Can I
     ask you first to look at page 7 of that document.   - A.
     Y es sir.

Q. Paragraph 9.1 under a heading "Traffic Flow":

               "The five main football stadia in South
               Yorkshire were purposely constructed in
               residential areas to cater for mass
               spectator attendance. "

     I'm not quite sure that that is entirely accurate because I
     think in this case the residential area grew up around
     Hillsborough, but no matter, they are in fact in
     residential areas:

               "That situation was no doubt satisfactory
               at the time but the advent of modern
               transport in current times resulted in
               serious congestion and conflict between
               pedestrian/vehicular m o v e m e n t . "

     and then they deal with controlled parking and then this,
     9.3:

               "There must be an acceptance by persons
               attending a football match, whether on
               foot or otherwise, that delay and con­
               gestion will arise and must be endured
               when in close proximity to a ground.    It
               is our duty however to make every effort
               to minimise delay and congestion by w h a t ­
               ever means possible."

     That is a clear identification of the potential problem of
     congestion, and an indication that there must be thought
     given to every possible means to avoid it.  - A. Yes sir.

Q. And that means, does it not, adequate policing arrangements
   on the approach to the ground?  - A. Yes sir.

Q. And then thre is an indication in 9.4 of the usual practice
   of spectators staggering their arrival, then 9.5:

               "At this time previous intelligence
               enquiries will have been of assistance
                                          B.L. MOLE




          to determine the number of visiting
          supporters expected and their mode of
          travel.          Once known and identified
          arrangements should be made for their
          routing and arrival at designated parking
          areas at a time shortly preceding kick-off.
          the strategy of delayed arrival of visitors
          reduces the time for pre-match disorder
          p r o b l e m s ."

That suggests an approach to encourage rather late arrival
does it not?  - A. I think the intention of that is the
staggering of arriving supporters, and one has to refer
back to my comments yesterday regarding the trains and the
coaches, and efforts are made for the trains to arrive at
staggered times where you can control that.  I believe the
purpose of that is for that reason.

But that last sentence, "The strategy of delayed arrival of
visitors reduces the time for pre-match disorder problems"
does that not suggest that certainly the thinking behind
this document was an encouragement of fans arriving close
enough to the game not to have time to hang around or drink
in pubs or whatever?  - A. I think that there is an element
of that.  The main thrust of this document was based upon
the findings of the Popplewell Inquiry which was the result
of considerable public disorder, and the aim was to prevent
public disorder, and clearly as you say there is a
possibility of bringing them later to the stadium but the
intention has always been to get them in sufficient time to
get in, whether that later be half past two as opposed to
three o'clock.

May I just go on again, I think to point out something you
have covered but I just would see it in black and white,
page 24 of this document, Appendix F.  The last two pa r a ­
graphs on that page they talk about pre-match:

          "The most useful instrument available to
          the Police in their responsibility  for
          crowd control within the stadium is the
          tannoy or public address system which
          should at all times be available to the
          Police, should be proved effective through­
          out the ground and thoroughly tested before
          each fixture."

Now your experience in 1988 - and I appreciate you were not
there in 1989 and I am not asking you about it, but your
experience in 1988 in relation to the tannoy, what do you
say about its effectiveness?  - A. I found the tannoy to
be effective.   I didn't have occasion to use it for a
problem.  We do have occasion to use the tannoy as we do.
                                             B.L. MOLE




We had the over-ride facility in the Police control room
and it is tested pre-match to ensure that those areas are
all covered by the tannoy system.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose testing it pre-match
is testing it against silence.  - A.     That is correct,
sir.  It is merely a test to see that it is operating, but
during a match we do test and ask for responses from
Officers in all the localities that they can hear it, but
there is some difficulty, one has to appreciate, at
particularly loud times of the crowd that it is not as
distinctive as others.

     MR. COLLINS:   Do you have any systems at Hillsborough
whereby there is a means of attracting a crowd's attention
to an important announcement, on for example safety or
control of crowd?  - A. I have only in the past utilised
the public address system.

What I am getting at is I think in some grounds they have
some sort of a bleep or that dreadful ding-dong noise one
hears on railway stations sometimes, some sound which
attracts attention and makes it clear that this is an
announcement that ought to be listened to?  - A. No we
have not used that facility.

Is that something that was considered?   -   A. No sir.

What about the use of the electronic scoreboard?  - A. I
have never considered utilising the electronic scoreboard.
I must say I have no knowledge as to who activates that and
I have always used the public address system and not found
a need for the electronic scoreboard.

Was that ever considered or simply not considered as a
possible means of crowd information? - A. Not considered
by me as a means because its location is immediately
adjacent to the Police Box and I think there are some
limited restricted access to it although I have not tested
that and clearly I have not utilised the thought of using
that scoreboard.  I have been satisfied with the public
address system.

Clearly for the future if there is difficulty making people
hear there is a lot to be said for having something they
can see from any part of the ground.  - A. That is right
sir.  I think one of the difficulties would be attracting
their attention to see it.  The public address system at
least doss address all areas and one can draw people's
attention by hearing, but certainly to draw their attention
to look at the sign is not quite as easy and I cannot
guarantee that they would have looked and seen.

                                                      B.L. MOLE



    Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Incidentally there are public address
         speakers are there at all the turnstiles?  - A. There are
         public address certainly on the Leppings Lanes and they
         certainly come to the outside.  Yes sir.  I am just
         thinking it out.  Yes sir they do.

    Q. There is presumably no way of isolating those?    That is to
       say you can't make an announcement specifically to people
       outside Leppings Lane which isn't heard all over the
       ground, or am I wrong about that?  - A. I couldn't answer
       that.  I hava utilised the public address system mainly for
       messages - personally this is - mainly for messages inside
       the stadium and used all tannoy aspects.   Certainly we have
       used them readily for the Lappings Lane visitors, to advise
       them of what we are going to do after match, ie. take them
       back to the coaches, trains and whatever, but that has gone
       out, been broadcast right across the stadium.    As far as I
       am aware, and the technical aspect I couldn't, I have never
       had need to use it on one area.

    Q. But it is something which could arise and indeed did   arise
       on this occasion.  - A. Apparently so sir.

    Q. Can I go back to page 24 and just go   to the bottom
       paragraph of that page where it says   this:

                  "The crucial period for disorder is in the
                  half hour immediately preceding the game
                  and maximum Police strength should be
                  available at that time.  The use of enter­
                  tainment during this period if valuable
                  in turning the attention of supporters away
                  from disorder and clubs should be encouraged
                  to make the necessary provision."

           A. Yes sir.

    Q. Did you in fact have any input in '87 and '88 on this
       aspect of entertainment?  - A. I have mentioned many times
       to the club that I feel that entertainment is of value,
       that it does fall in line with the Popplewell Report and on
       occasions they have introduced it.   I can recall having
       youth football before the match.   In fact I mentioned that
       yesterday and I have confirmed since that we did have youth
       fo ot b a l l .

    Q. You did.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you tell me what happened?
         You had some youth football before the game in '88 - A.
         That is right sir.

    Q. When did it start and - it would be a full match would it?
                                              B.L. MOLE




   A. No it was a competition type of thing.   I am trying
to recall the details.  It was something like who can keep
the ball in the air longest.  Young boys.  They were judged
by Ian Knight, one of the players.  As I recall they came
on the pitch about 2 pm and stayed on there for half an
hour, forty minutes, clearing the pitch twenty to, quarter
to, before the players came out for the first warm-up.
That was viewed by the spectators in the stadium.   On this
occasion I know that I had mentioned about entertainment
and often it has rested on music as opposed to physical
entertainment, but there have been occasions when there has
been entertainment on the pitch in the form of marching
bands and in the form of keep fit enthusiasts.

     MR. COLLINS:    Entertainment really involves a
spectacle of some sort.   I mean muzak through the tannoy
system really doesn't count does it?      A. I think I said
yesterday that it counts.   On a personal note I would like
to see more entertainment on the pitch which draws
attention, but it does count and if it encourages community
singing involvement then that does have some effect, but
clearly I think some actual physical thing to see has
greater benefit.

     the g a t e s at the b a ck of t h o s e t e r r a c e s .

Q.   That is m o r e t h e o r e t i c a l t han p r a c t i c a l , is it not,

     t he n the fill is a s t e a d y flow, that r e c o g n i t i o n is there,
     t h e r e is no s e n s e of u r g e n c y to find a p l a c e and my
     e x p e r i e n c e is t ha t the v a st m a j o r i t y , as I say, f irst of
     all h e a d for t o i l e t s or food f a c i l i t i e s and t h en find

     big as t hat a r e a from w h i c h t h ey h a v e come.

Q.   Be th at as it may, S u p e r i n t e n d e n t , the fact is that
     the s i g n - p o s t i n g at t h is end is g r o s s l y d e f e c t i v e , is
     it n ot?        A.        I t h i n k it c o u l d be i m p r o v e d , sir.

             MR.    COLLINS:           I see.

Q.    In any even t, you did not c o n s i d e r it n e c e s s a r y t ha t it

Q. Of course, the problem of that is it tends to create a surge.
   If people come at the last minute altogether they will come in
   probably to one part and create a problem in that part, won't
   they? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. And so you must have been aware that there was a potential
   problem if there was a late arrival of a large number of fans?
   - A. As I said previously, there was no anticipated late
   a r r i v a l , but y e s .

Q. I know.  You say "no anticipated".  It is something you have
   to bear in mind as a possibility, surely, in case of forming a
   plan? - A. Yes.

Q. And then they refer over the page,   page 2, the paragraph in
   the middle of the page:

          "Mr. Herold has already referred to the late arrival of a
          large number of spectators still waiting to enter
          Leppings Lane when the match started.  The flash point
          occurred when Tottenham scored after only 3 minutes.   The
          spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was
          happening and caused a crush which resulted in the
          injuries".

     Then there was reference to two or three minor fights at the
     same t i m e :

          "This had resulted in the order from Mr. Gosling”

     who was the Assistant Chief Constable at the time,   I think?
     - A. He was, sir, yes.

Q.          "To open the gates at the front of Leppings Lane in
            order to release some spectators on to the pitch
            surround".

     There is, of course, a similarity, is there not, between that
     and what happened here? - A. The scenario does seem similar,
     sir, yes.

Q. Can I also refer to one other matter.  This is document 5,
   which is the letter or copy of the letter from I think.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Before you go on, at that time
     there were no radial fences? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Was there then a computer or computers at the Leppings Lane
   turnstiles showing how many had gone through? - A. No, sir, at
   that time as I recall they were on the click system, the
   numbers on each turnstile, but that was not linked to a
   computer where you could have an overview.  You would have to
   collect all the various numbers from the turnstiles.

Q. So that would only used for afterwards and not during? - A.
   That is correct, sir.

                                                           B.L. MOLE


       Q.   When was the computer installed? - A. I could not be sure of
            the date, but it was in the last three or four years.

       Q.   The effect of the computer is only to tell you or warn you    of
            when you come within a percentage of the total capacity of    the
            terrace as a whole? - A. That is right, sir.

       Q. There is no means of checking the individual pens? - A. I
          believe it is 15% short of capacity it starts to pulsate,
          which then gives us an indication we are reaching that l e v e l .

       Q.   What I was going to ask you is this. I believe  there may be
            some grounds where tickets for the terraces are issued
            specifically for particular pens? - A. I am not aware of that,
            but clearly that would be very useful, sir.

       Q.   It would be useful? - A. It would indeed,   sir.

       Q.    Is there any practical reason why it should not be done here?
            - A. I think the limitation possibility of the turnstile
            entrances might be difficult to segregate even greater.   The
            areas we have described is a very confined area, and in queue
            terms that may well be difficult to split out 1,000 and 1,200
            and another 1,000 and 3,700 in the north-west terrace, but I
            think there is merit in that avenue being p u r s u e d .

       Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Yes.  Just leading on from all that.  Of
            course, in relation to the sudden surge created by late
            arrivals, your thesis that they milled around and went and got
            refreshment, etc., simply would not hold water there, would
            it? - A. I think that is correct, sir, yes.

       Q. Clearly defective signing, if there was defective signing,
          would exacerbate any problem which was in any event going to
          be created by late arrivals? - A. It would cause confusion,
          yes, sir.

       Q. Can I ask you to look at document 5, please, which as I
          understand is a copy of a letter from the Assistant Chief
          Constable to the Chairman or the then Chairman of Sheffield
          Wednesday Football Club.  He may still be Chairman.  I am not
          sure. - A. Yes, he is.

       Q. Can I ask you to look at the second paragraph of that:

                 ’’The letters of complaint you received and those both
                 complementary and otherwise which I have received have
                 established beyond doubt that the Police action in
                 letting spectators on to the track was not only necessary
                 but was vital to avoid further serious injuries and
                 possibly save life.   In this respect my only criticism of
                 my senior Officers is for not opening the gates earlier,
                 thus avoiding the emergency measure of allowing and
                 helping spectators to climb over the fence.   This type of
                 decision, however, is often necessary in operational
                 situations, and although it may look untidy the needs of
                 the occasion demand instant action irrespective of how it

         may appear to the onlooker".

   I am sorry to read it rather haltingly,      but it   is not easy to
   read in ray copy. - A. Mine is the same.

Q. Now, it would appear that on that occasion there was a
   difficulty in Police reaction to the emergency that developed?
   - A. Reading that, sir, it would, yes.

Q. Are you aware of that?  Is that the matter you discussed? - A.
   Yes, I am conscious of that aspect.

Q. Because it was essential, was it not, to ensure that perimeter
   Officers were fully alive to the distinction between a pitch
   invasion on the one hand and a problem arising which needed or
   led to people trying to escape because of conditions inside
   the pens? - A. That is correct, sir, and that problem has been
   addressed in many w a y s . One of the main areas is the same
   Officers are used regularly on the perimeter track.     I
   introduced a policy at the ground of what I called community
   policing which utilises the same Officers in the same areas so
   they can recognise not only individuals and infiltrators who
   are liable to cause public disorder, but also respond to
   incidents because they recognise it.     The difficulty so far as
   the recognition of a pitch invasion is one which is apparent,
   and in fact my own    experience last year showed signs very
   similar to the end    of the match to what we saw at the start of
   this problem.  From the footage I have seen here the signs
   were very similar from what happened at the end of the
   Liverpool-Notts Forest match last year, with people climbing
   the fences when they in fact invaded the pitch, and there is
   clearly a matter to be determined which is taking place.

Q. Of course.  The fact that someone climbs out is equivocal on
   the face of it.  It could mean a pitch invasion.  It could be
   because he is trying to escape something inside? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. But one has to use    a little common sense and surely at the
   beginning of a match, particularly when your side has started
   quite well, is a singularly improbable time for a pitch
    invasion, is not it? - A. I think that is not true, sir.
    There is often the occasion when I have seen spectators climb
    the fences, even at the beginning or during the match, for
   various reasons.   I think it is unfair to say the Officers'
   reaction is not such.   they have to assess the situation, and
    I am quite confident that the O f f i c e r s ’ knowledge and ability
   on that perimeter has been first class and is still the same,
    and they address that situation with what is being faced by
    them.
  1
Q. It is fair to say the Operational Order emphasises their
   duties in relation to stopping people getting on to the pitch?
    - A. I think that is correct, sir.       One of our main functions
  Iunder all the aspects of policing football is the maintenance
    of public order, and it is a sad fact of life with football
  • that people want to disrupt that and create disorder.
                                                        B.L. MOLE



Q. But surely safety, even safety of those in the pens, is more
   important than preventing a possible pitch invasion, is it
   not? - A. I am absolutely confident that the preservation of
   life is one of our prime functions, and safety comes into that
   aspect, y e s .

Q. All I am getting at is wondering, looking at your Operational
   Order, the emphasis was not too much on prevention of climbing
   over rather than on looking to see the cause of the climbing
   over? - A. I don't think so, sir.

Q. Can I take you back to document again.       The Standing
   Instructions, page 37. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. This, of course, was a document produced as we have seen by
   Mr. Jackson, and related specifically to the five grounds, I
think, in .... - A. In South Yorkshire.

Q.Yes, in South Yorkshire.   And if you   look at No. 6on page             37
    of this document. - A. Mine starts at 7 on page 37.

Q.   I beg your pardon.   Mine is   a very poor copy.

          "8. Communications available within the ground.           This
          should include:

          (a) Police communications

          (b) Club communications, i.e. radios and/or telephones
           with information on the systems employed.

          (c) Methods of communication with the public to include
          where the Police have access to them; ie. (1)   Tannoy (2)
          Electronic display boards.  (3) Loud hailers.  (4)
          Banners".

     So it appears it certainly was contemplated by Mr. Jackson
     that there might be Police use of electronic display boards? -
     A. There is the consideration, and I felt that at Sheffield
     Wednesday was not practical, and have used the facilities that
     are available to me, that is the public address system which
     has been extremely functional and useful for my operations.

Q. What about loud hailers? - A. Loud hailers are always
   available at the ground.

Q. Where? -A. In the Police control,      and in the Police room which
   is the other side of the stadium.

Q. How many? - A. On most occasions when I operated, and I don't
   know what was on this occasion, certainly I would have two
   loud hailers there and two at the Police room.   I also travel
   in the Landrover which has a loud hailer system facilitated on
   the top of it with 4 speakers, and a hand held facility for my
   use within the Landrover.

                                                    B.L. MOLE


Q. Was one handed out    to the Sergeant in charge of the perimeter
   serial as a matter    of routine? - A. No, sir.

Q. Would it not have been useful? -A. The communications link
   between the Police room and the Sergeant at the    perimeter isa
   matter of a couple of minutes at the most to get to him, and
   they have that equipment on hand there.

Q. Because one of the things that appears from the shambles on
   this occasion after the event was that there was very little
   use of loud hailers to try to get the crowd to go back in the
   pens? - A. My understand of it there was quite a bit of use of
   loud hailers and in particular the public address system, but
   as I have said, that is what I have learned subsequently as
   opposed t o ....

Q. I appreciate you were not there and you can't deal with it
   directly.  You told us yesterday why you did not, as part of
   your Operational Order, have deployment of Police on the
   terraces themselves. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. As I understand it it was really a question of them being too
   full? - A. No, sir, I think the question was they serve little
   function and operationally are not useful when you are dealing
   with a packed situation.  I can deploy from the tunnels.   I
   can deploy from the perimeter track, but if I have them
   trapped into the area at the back of the terrace they are of
   very little use to me in deployment terms for public order.

Q.   Can I ask you to look at page 42 of   document 11, which is   one
     of the appendices.  This deals with   specific duties of
     stewards, 7(a). - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   Where it talks about the first specific duty   is:

          "(a) Preventing overcrowding;     ensuring that crowd limits
          in various parts of the ground are complied with and that
          gangways and exits are kept c l e a r " .

     - A. Yes,   sir.

Q. And then:

          "Preventing as far as possible standing on seats and the
          climbing of fences and other structures and so on".

     - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, you would accept, I imagine, that preventing overcrowding
   and ensuring that crowd limits in various parts are complied
   with would include the crowd limits in the individual pens? -
   A. I would say it is, sir.

Q. Did you inn 1988 liaise with the club in relation to
   stewarding of the terracing to ensure there was even
   distribution? - A. The club are fully aware of the conditions
   for stewards.  They are briefed by them and by the Police and
                                                B.L. MOLE


Fire Service at various times in and out of season.        The
stewards are briefed by the Inspectors on sector duties and
would give them that briefing on each match.        The deployment
of stewards is a matter for the club, and I would not
specifically brief them on that aspect.        They have
communications through the chief steward of which we have a
link into in our Police c o n t r o l . We have one of their radios
so they can communicate with Police control direct in addition
to our own facilities.




                             /Q.   I think from that.

                                           B.L. MOLE


     Q. I think from that the answer to m y question is no, there
        was no liaison specifically in 1988 in relation to the
        stewarding of the terraces at Leppings Lane? - A. As I have
        said we allowed that to fill and that no doubt was the
        same understanding with the stewards.

     Q.    Do you know or did you know in 1988 whether there was any
          steward control either at the back of the terracing or, and
          I think one can extend it, to the tunnel giving access to
          that part? - A. My recollection of 1988 is that the stewards
          were operating in the area behind the terraces, that is the
          open area in the concourse and the stands.

     Q.   But not on the terraces? - A. Correct sir.

     Q.    And that I imagine would not surprise you altogether because
          I suspect that Sheffield Wednesday stewards would not be
          over eager to put themselves on the Liverpool terraces? -
          A. I think not only Sheffield Wednesday stewards but probably
          stewards in general, sir.

     Q. Did that not mean that it was the more important that there
        should be a Police presence to ensure that there was even
        distribution? - A. I think that is not a function of the
        Police.   If there was a public order situation we would
        have reacted.   My resources were available to react and
        are deployed at all phases to react to that situation should
        it arise.

     Q. So you are saying that you don't believe it is a Police
        function to ensure even distribution along the terraces?
        - a . If we are talking about the full capacity crowd then
        as I have said the decision has been and worked on two
        previous occasions to find its level. If we are talking
        about an expected crowd at a league match, which is limited,
        then there is liaison and assistance between the Club and
        the Stewards regarding which sectors would be utilised and
        therefore there is some control of the filling of those
        terraces.

     Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Does there come a point, you
          have said several times that you rely upon the filling
          to find its level, but does there come a point at which
          Police surveillance would have to judge whether that had
          been successful or whether a dangerous situation was
          arising? - A. I think sir that is absolutely right.

     Q .‘
        ‘ I s there any specific order to that effect? - A. No sir.
          The control box is situated in such a position that it
          can see very clearly all aspects of the ground.   In
          addition the cameras are generally on that particular
          area because it is usually the visitors' area and we
        * watch that, but ifthat problem was seen, and as I can
          say from ray experience it has not arisen, but had it
          arisen then I would as Commander or Mr. Murray as the
        ; Controlling Operator would have reacted to it.

MR. COLLINS:
Forgive me, Mr. Mole, and I appreciate that we must be
careful not to approach this with hindsight, but I would
have thought that it was obviously foreseeable that if
you took no steps whether by stewarding or by Police action
to control the distribution of those pens, you might get
overcrowding in the central pens particularly as you have
agreed that people tend to like to go behind the goals?
- A. That has happened before sir.  It has been my
experience I have not had the problem.  I cannot comment
further than that.

Well did you not think about it? - A. Of course, but I
have not had the problem and I would have reacted to it
had the problem arisen.

So what you are saying is because the problem had not
arisen you did not take any steps to counter it in case
it did arise? - A. I think that is not correct, sir.
What I have said is I have Officers available for deploy­
ment.   The flexibility of the plan caters for that and they
•can be deployed if I perceive a problem.

Can I ask you to look at page 20 of Document 11 please.
To put this in context this is Appendix C which deals
with the duties of Officers at the ground.  Perhaps we
should start, just to put in context on page 19. You
see this is an Appendix headed "Individual Briefing" -
A. Yes sir.

And deals with what individual Officers should be told
in various posts, points on the ground? - A. Yes.

(b) at the bottom of page 19 is dealing with Officers
other than on the playing area track.  Do you see that?
- A. Yes sir.

Can I ask you to go over the page and look at vii towards
the bottom.  It says this:

      "Officers engaged on duties in the stands
      and terraced areas will take up positions
      at the rear of the crowds using any raised
      or otherwise advantageous positions which
      might be provided or available.  Passageways
      in these areas will be kept clear and the
      the necessary advice and support given to
      stewards".

A. Yes sir.

Now that surely presupposes that there will be an Officer
present at the back of the terraces to help direct fans
to the right parts? - A. As I have said, sir, I interpret
that Officers available in the tunnels which they are
deployed to within the orders sir.

                                             B.L. MOLE



       Q. But there weren't any Officers deployed on your order to
          the tunnel? - A. At Phase 2 sir.

       Q. No,   not Phase 2, Phase 1 which is when people are coming
          in?   - A. The Officers on those serials are at the back of
          the   terraces at the turnstiles, that is on the inside of
          the   turnstiles and that is where they are deployed.

       Q. I see.  But what is your understanding of vii, Mr. Mole,
          which on the face of it would appear to indicate that you
          ought to post Officers at the back of the terraces to
          help the Stewards to direct, inter alia to direct people
          to fill up the terraces evenly because that is one of the
          steward's duties? - A. My understanding of that is the
          Officers are deployed to the rear of those areas and in
          fact do direct as a matter of course people to the various
          locations but they are not actually stood on the terraces.
          That is my understanding of that paragraph.

       Q. "Officers engaged on duties in the stands and terraced
          areas will take up positions at the rear of the crowds
          using any raised or otherwise advantageous positions
          which might be provided or available". - A. That is
          correct sir, and when they are deployed to those terraces
          that is the position they take up, but in Phase 1 of
          the order their duties is at the turnstiles for public
          order searching and property and advising and directing.
          When Phase 2 operates at the match they take up advan­
          tageous points at the rear of the terraces.

       Q. But of course unlike the league matches, as we have
          indicated, there were no Officers deployed on any duty
          in relation to filling of the terraces, were there? - A.
          I think I have made that point sir.

       Q. One small thing I ought just to have elicited.    The 1987
          final was on a Sunday? - A. It was sir, yes.

       Q. In fact kick-off was due at 12 but delayed till 12.15?
          - a . That is correct, sir.

       Q. That, I suppose, avoided to some extent the drink problem?
          - A. It did sir.

       Q. Because of course the pubs don't open till 12 and I think
          even now it is slightly more difficult, well can you get
          off licence drinks on a Sunday morning? - A. No, same
          licensing hours.

       Q. Same licensing hours as pubs? - A. Yes.

       Q. I think that is really all I need ask you about the
          planning because I appreciate you were not involved
          directly with the events of the 15th of April last.

                You told us that you were transferred on the 27th
          of March and therefore of course you were aware that your

              successor, Chief Superintendent Duckinfield was going to
              have to take over the policing of this event? - A. That is
              correct sir, yes.

           Q. And although things had gone in your view well in 1988
              there was always a potential problem with a full house
              and large numbers of supporters coming in from far afield
              from outside Sheffield? - A. I think whenever you have
              54,000 people congregating together there is always
              p o t ent ia l.

           Q. In effect Mr. Duckinfield was being thrown in at the deep
              end, was he not? - A. I think his experience of policing
              football is wide.  Certainly I think he had not policed
              a semi-final but certainly policed crowds in large numbers.

           Q. Had he policed Hillsborough before? - A. He had policed
              Hillsborough when he was there in a different rank sir.

           Q. What rank? - A. I believe my recollection is as Chief
              Inspector and Inspector.

           Q. So he had never been in the position of having as it were
              a overview of the operation? - A. I would be guessing if
              I said he had or h a d not but I don't think he had ever
              been in command of the operation at Hillsborough but
              certainly Sheffield United he had and at other major
              events in the town sir.

           Q. And you no doubt then briefed him in some detail about
              the problems that he might anticipate? - A. I did sir, yes.

           Q. Did you go around the ground with him? - A. No sir,
              Mr. Duckinfield has a knowledge of the ground having
              worked there in the past, as I have said.

           Q. So there   was no as it were   walk round which you considered
              necessary? - A. No sir, in     fact I called him to a meeting
              prior to my departure with     the rest of the people involved
              in the planning and he was     present  at that prior to his
              promotion.

           Q. That was a meeting on the 22nd of March? - A. That is
              correct sir.

           Q. This was a meeting with as it were your sub-Commanders?
              - A. Yes    and other interested parties. I received noti­
              fication of the match on the 20th of March and conscious
              of my move on the 27th I called an urgent meeting for
              the 22nd which involved all the sector Commanders that
              I selected to support Mr. Duckinfield together with
              people like the transport, British Rail; Officers in the
              Central Division who would be affected by the influx of
              people and the Traffic Division etc.

Q. That was your last direct concern I think with the planning
   of this operation? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. You then handed over completely to Mr. Duckinfield? - A.
   I did sir.

Q. Were you responsible for the decision about manpower levels
   or was that Mr. Duckinfield? - A. Manpower levels I
   addressed before I left and asked Mr. Murray, Chief Inspector
   Beale and Inspector Sewell who are in fact the Planning
   Team, to look at the manpower levels bearing in mind my
   comments of yesterday that some Officers were underemployed
   to see if there was any need for any increases or reductions
   and to determine the manpower level commensurate with what
   was anticipated on the intelligence that was to be available.

Q. Yes, but who decided on the actual levels, you or
   Mr. Duckinfield? - A. The final number would be decided
   by Mr. Duckinfield when he arrived but I put them into
   the plan to ask the questions.

Q. What I am getting at is this:   did your plan before you
   left include as it were your view of the right numbers,
   of course leaving it to Mr. Duckinfield if he wanted, or
   did you leave it to Mr. Duckinfield to fill in the figures
   as he thought right? - A. In fact it was   left to the team
   to look at the, the Planning Team that I have referred to,
   bearing in mind my plan and the experience of under­
   employment last year and Mr. Duckinfield   then made the
   final decision so far as manpower was concerned.

Q. Did you discuss directly with Mr. Duckinfield the manpower
   position? - A. No sir, it was probably commented on at my
   meeting of the 22nd when he was present.

Q. So effectively you left it to your subordinates to fill
   Mr. Duckinfield in, as it were? - A. Yes, the same Planning
   Team was used in 1988 and the Planning Team was again used
   in 1989.

Q.   Now I want to come now to purely factual matters,   your
     involvement on the day in question.

           I think you had no role to play in the operation
     and were doing or policing your own Division in Barnsley
     on that Saturday? - A. I was indeed sir, yes.

Q.    You were on duty were you that afternoon? - A.I was       on
     well 24 hour cover on the Saturday, yes.

Q. I think you were first aware of problems by hearing a
   message or hearing a broadcast on the local radio at
   about about half-past-3 when you were on the motorway?
   - A. Yes, I was on the Ml and I heard thele was a pitch
   invasion delaying  the progress of the match.

     Q. As you continued to listen and drove on did it become
        apparent it was more serious than had first been supposed?
        - a . That is right. I was surprised in point of fact
        because the first message was clearly a mere delay and
        pitch invasion which was a nuisance value.  That was the
        message coming over, but it gradually drew the picture
         of being a more serious problem.

     Q. I think eventually when you realised there were possible
        deaths and appeals being made for doctors and so on, for
        Police Officers to respond, you yourself I believe went
        to the Hammerton Road Police Station and arrived there
        about 20-past-4? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

     Q. Did you go to the ground or just to the Police Station?
        - A. I went to the Police Station and immediately contacted
        Mr. Duckinfield in the Control Box to see if there was
        any assistance I could give him at that time.   I spoke
        to him and obtainedcertain action he wanted doing and I
        then spoke to and deployed a number of Officers who had
        responded to Hammerton Road Police Station and deployed
        them into the area around the Sheffield Wednesday Football
        Club.

     Q. And effectively you did all you could to be of assistance
        to Mr. Duckinfield at that stage? - A. I did sir and then
        I went to the ground arriving in Leppings Lane.

     Q. What time did you get to the ground? - A. My perception
        of time is somewhat difficult.  I know for a fact I was
        there by 5 o'clock.  Whether it was five or ten minutes
        before that I could not be certain.




                          /Q. By this time
                         27

r                                           B.L. MOLE




    Q. And by this time most of the supporters I imagine had left
       the ground.     A. I was surprised to find large numbers in
       Leppings Lane who were clearly somewhat aggressive towards
       the Police for whatever reason, and I must say at that
       stage I didn't know the enormity of the situation.  I had
       been told there had been a few deaths, and it wasn't until
       I turned into the south lane at the back of Leppngs Lane
       leading down to the South Stand I found the bodies of
       eleven people in a pen at that location and was told there
       were a further seventy plus in the gymnasium.

    Q. This is something which is going to crop up in a number of
       Police Officers' statements.  You talked about hostility of
       the fans towards the Police.  It was clear, was it not,
       that there was a general attitude of blaming the Police for
       what had happened?  - A. There was sir, yes.

    Q.   I am not sayng it was justified or not, simply that it
         existed.  - A. Certainly there was agression towards me
         and other Officers in the area and I wasn't at that time
         aware of the reasons or feelings of the individuals that
         was being expressed.

    Q. Of course.  I think you found when you got into the ground
       that it was obvious that Superintendents Marshall and
       Murray were very distressed.  - A.   They were extremely
       distressed.

    Q. Was Mr. Jackson still there?   -   A. Mr. Jackson, Mr.
       Duckinfield, together with Mr. Murray and Mr. Marshall and
       the controllers were in the control box and they were
       having a conversation at that time, but there was a lot of
       traffic on the air, disorder, fighting taking place in and
       around the stadium, and in fact Mr. Jackson, Mr.
       Duckinfield and Mr. Marshall left at about 5.15 and I was
       asked to take over operations at the location.

    Q. And you I think effectively went round your men to see what
       the position was and to if as necessary organise the
       mortuary and so on.  - A. That is correct.    All the action
       had been taken by Mr. Duckinfield and Mr. Jackson that
       needed to be implemented at that stage.    They went to
       update the Chief Constable.  I immediately sought Sector
       Commanders' update reports to see what the situation in
       public order terms was outside the ground.   There were
       clearly some problems which would persist and I ensured
       that Tango Units remained on duty together with horses and
       other Officers in strategic locations to maintain public
       order.  The stadium had cleared and I went to the gymnasium
       to see that the mortuary facilities were in hand.

    Q. There was inevitably some degree of confusion still was
       there not?  - A.   There was sir yes.
                    28                   B.L. MOLE




Q. At one stage I think you spoke to Mr. Mackrell the Club
   Secretary.  - A.   Yes.  I had done the rounds.  I had been
   over to the Police side, seen the Police Officers, many of
   whom were distressed, went to the Club and found many of
   the Club Members who were distressed and clearly ball boys
   in particular had been badly affectd.  I spoke to Mr.
   Mackrell and advised him that he might need medical
   attention and counselling for his staff.  He thanked me for
   that and said he would put that in hand.

Q. I think he told you that the computer print-outs regarding
   the turnstile figures at three o'clock had been put in a
   safe place.  - A. Yes.   I can't remember whether it was
   'safe' or 'drawer' but he had got it somewhere to show what
   the figure was at the three o'clock time.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Because that really wouldn't
     relate to all those who came in through the gate.  - A.
     All that would show sir was those who had passed through
     the turnstile.

          MR. COLLINS:   Sir we have those figures, as you
     probably appreciate but that is not for this Officer to
     deal with that:

Q. I don't think it really will help this Inquiry to take you
   through the rest of your statement dealing with what
   happened thereafter.  We have all got it in front of us and
   if anyone does consider something that needs to be brought
   out of course it can be done.  - A. Thank you.

          MR. GLASGOW:   Sir most of my friends have asked that
     I go out of order on this occasion.   There is a particular
     reason for it.  We have prepared a bundle of documents
     during the course of yesterday, and I think out of courtesy
     to those who have not had the opportunity of seeing them it
     would be better if they were introduced to this Officer by
     me so that they don't take them by surprise.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I am quite prepared to follow
     any course you agree.

          MR. GLASGOW:   Sir we took the liberty, of course with
     my friends' permission of letting Chief Superintendent Mole
     have those documents overnight.    I hope that was all
     right, because many of them are his letters and it seemed
     more courteous to allow him to read them at his own home
     rather than be shown them for the first time today.
     Could I provide you with copies.   (P r o d u c e d ) If I could
     just explain what we have done, sir.     We have been through
     the files, the entirety of them at the Club and we have
     extracted all those letters and documents which haven't
     found their way into somebody else's bundle, and we have
                          29



                                                  B.L. MOLE




     put them all together as the Club's bundle.  Most of them
     will not need to be referred to but we thought it more
     helpful if they were put in as one collection with an index
     at the front so you can have an idea of what they refer to,
     although I hasten to add that the vast majority of them are
     matters of record such as the entirety of the minutes and
     the stewards' tickets which appear at the back, and we
     certainly won't need to refer to them.

                   Cross-examined by MR. G L A S G O W ;

Q. Chief Superintendent Mole I think you have had an
   opportunity of seeing the bundle we provided last night.
   A. I looked through it last night sir, yes.

Q. And you obviously know that there are differences between
   the Club and the Police as to what may have been breakdowns
   of communications on the day in question.     A. I under­
   stand that is probably the case.

Q. Before we get to those differences which I would like to
   face with you Mr. Mole, the officers of the Club have asked
   me publicly to express their gratitude to you personally
   for what they had believed was your very efficient and
   helpful way in which you co-operated with them over many
   years when you were responsible.  - A. Thank you sir.

Q. And I would like it to be understood by you and by
   everybody else that the criticisms that we do feel we have
   to make do not in any way detract from the sincerity of
   that gratitude to you personally.  -   A. Thank you sir.

Q.   Is it true to say Chief Superintendent that your view is
     that the key to proper policing in the situation that we are
     talking about lies in communication and understanding
     between the Club and the Force.  - A. I think that is a
     very important aspect sir, yes.

Q. And by proper policing you, as the Officer who was
   responsible until very recently, were attempting to strike a
   balance between containment and control on the one hand and
   freedom of movement and means of escape on the other.  - A.
   Yes sir.

Q. And it is fair to say from the outset is it not that those
   two concepts are at first glance fundamentally inconsistent
   with one another.  - A. I think there is an overlap yes.

Q. And facing it bluntly,  whenever there is violence and
   pitch invasions there tends to be criticism from well
   meaning and other quarters that the Police and/or the Club
   have allowed people to escape.  - A. Yes sir.

                                                B.L. MOLE


Q. You    have experience of that?   -   A. Yes sir.

Q. And whenever somebody gets hurt or tragically killed as a
   result of being contained for too long, there is equally
   vociferous criticism in precisely the opposite direction.
      A. Yes.

Q. Can I first attempt to break it down into the number of
   areas.  I would like first to deal if I may with your
   liaison over the years with the Club - if I can use that
   horrible word.  -  A. Yes.

Q. You liaised with the three recent Secretaries of the Club,
   Mr.  England, Mr Chester and Mr.    Mackrell. A. I did sir,
   yes.

Q. And would it be fair to say of all those      three men,
   including the two who have retired, that      you found them
   throughout your time to be co-operative,      professional and
   reliable.  - A. I think that would be a       fair assessment
   sir, yes.

Q.   It happens to be the case I think that you got on with
     them all personally.  - A. I think on a personal vein I
     got on with them all and particularly in recent times with
     Mr. Mackrell.

Q. But that personal goodwill did not prevent you on both
   sides of the fence so to speak, from expressing your views
   when you thought things were going wrong?  - A. That is
   correct sir.

Q. And let me deal specifically with Mr. Mackrell unless the
   history takes me to somebody else.  On the occasions when he
   believed that something had gone wrong with Police tactics
   and Police control he told you so very bluntly?  - A.   I
   respected that and appreciated it.

Q. And when you thought there was something that the Club could
   or should have done you told Mr. Mackrell.  - A. Yes sir.

Q. Could we look at an example of that in the bundle that you
   have got.   Would you go to page 16 first of all.  - A.
   Yes sir.

Q. This was in fact one of the historical occasions on which
   Mr. Chester had written to you about an incident which had
   occurred in 1986.  - A. Yes sir.

Q. And the letter is very short.  He said that following the
   West Ham/United fixture, which had been on the 12th of
   March about which he had telephoned you, he would be
   obliged if you could arrange that there would be no future
                                        B.L. MOLE




repeat of the situations concerning your Officers relevant
to the closing of the elevated standing area of Leppings
Lane.  - A. Yes sir.

And a minor matter concerning some problem with the
cameraman.  -  A. Yes.

And what had happened was that your Officers had, until a
late stage, closed off that area of the terracing in the
belief that the crowd could be better policed if they were
contained in a slightly smaller area of the terracing.
A. That is correct sir, yes.

And despite the fact that this had been discussed amicably
over the telephone the Club Secretary, in accordance with
the practice that had then developed and was afterwards
continued, recorded the matter in writing so that you could
both see what was done.  - A. That is correct sir, yes.

And you replied both promptly and courteously on page 17,
on the 26th March, setting out in the second paragraph of
your letter personally addressed to Mr. Chester what had
led to the confusion and the reasons why what had been done
was done.  - A. Yes sir.

Perhaps we should look at it in its entirety,   just that
paragraph Mr. Mole.  You said:

          "In dealing with the situation regarding
          the elevated standing area on Leppings
          Lane I can only repeat my earlier comments


that refers to the telephone conversation I think.     -    A.
Yes.

          "That there was confusion regarding the
          use of this area on that occasion and
          that the Ground Commander saw fit not to
          open it initially but subsequently on my
          instruction did so.  I can only add that
          it is not my intention to regularly close
          the elevated standing area and that as
          agreed in the past either I or John Freeman
          would discuss the position prior to a match
          and if there was such an intention then you
          would be informed accordingly."

   A. Yes, that is right.

May I extract the following points from that, and I use
that just as an example.  If you were going to control
movement on the terraces you would invariably personally
                             32



                                               B.L. MOLE




     discuss that with the Club Secretary before the match at
     the time when you were considering your decision?  - A.
     That is right, sir.  That harps back to what I said earlier,
     that there are occasions when I only utilise part of the
     terrace and I would tell them of that intention.

Q. But whatever your intentions may have been, and however much
   it might have been discussed, that in no way detracted from
   the right of the Ground Commander to vary the decision if
   the need arose.  - A. That is right sir, yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Does this mean that really you
     saw it as being the responsibility of the Police as to
     which part of the terracing was being used?  - A. This
     stems back to use of the ground at league matches when in
     fact to maintain segregation between those individuals in
     the West Stand and the home supporters in the North it is
     good practice to keep sterile the area of the elevated
     section, and when we are expecting a large crowd on a match
     then to take the corner on the plan there and keep it empty
     provides a natural barrier to stop stone-throwing and
     aggression between the North and the South.

Q.   I quite understand the rationale, but I'm only asking about
     division of responsibility between Police and Club.  You
     saw it as being the Police decision as to whether you as
     you say render an area sterile or not.  - A. I would put
     that to the Club as my intention to police that safely and
     free from public disorder.

Q. And if there was a disagreement?      -   A. There has not been,
   sir.

Q. No but if there    were, would you give or would they?  - A.
   I think I would    probably have to give unless I felt that I
   had to refer to    legislation with a view to seeking a ban on
   the match going    forward because I could not maintain public
   order.

Q.        MR. GLASGOW:   And as you understood the matter Mr.
     Mole that was something which was done not only in
     accordance with the wishes of, but as controlled by, the
     local authority.  - A. Yes.

Q. That when you had advised the installation of radial fences
   the local authority had agreed to that installation
   provided that the gates in them were under Police control.
      A. The gates at the front of the perimeter track.

Q. And at the back.     -   A. I am not aware of that point sir.

Q. We will come to it in the documentation.  I wonder whether
   that pre-dated’.your involvement. - A. Probably sir.
                                          B.L. MOLE




But it is in fact right isn't it that the gates along the
back which enable spread if people behave  sensibly, those
gates are in fact locked back at the start of matches.
A. They are sir, yes.

And the Police have the keys.    -   A. The Police have keys
and stewards have keys.

And the Officer responsible for that section of the ground
will always walk through there and ensure that they are
locked back before the match starts.  - A. One of the
Inspector's duties is to do that and I think on this
occasion Inspector White carried out that function.

And lest there is any confusion about it perhaps we should
look.at the photographs together.   Would you mind taking
composite 2 which is one of the little blue bundles without
a label on the outside.   If you look at the very first
photograph there was understandable doubt expressed
yesterday as to whether or not the gate under the word
"timber" was open or closed.  I don't know whether you
heard that or not.     A. I didn't sir.

But if you go through the bundle with me, approximately
half way through to photograph PR17A I think we see a
clearer view of that gate which, to be fair to Chief
Inspector White, it is quite clear that it was locked open.
   A. It was sir.

I should say   that it is clear it is open, we can't   see the
lock.  - A.    Yes.

And returning to your letter at page 17 you were there
referring to the discussions which you had as to your
reasons for wanting to preserve a sterile area firstly.
A. Yes sir.

Secondly the reasons why despite apparent confusion the
Ground Commander had saw fit to change that on the day.
A. Yes sir.

And thirdly, your right which I accept as the Commanding
Officer, to over-ride his decision.  - A. That is right
sir.

On the ground.   -   A. Yes.

And it is right is it not, and indeed it was your
experience, that the Commanding Officer on the ground
should have a direct control over what was being done by
his Officers as to the use of areas of the ground.  - A.
Yes. sir.
                                          B.L. MOLE




Could we look at another example, and again I won't go
through them all of course but I would like to see that
that wasn't an isolated occasion.  Go on to page 29 would
you?  By now we have come to Mr. Mackrell's period of
office.  This is the 11th February 1987 and again in wholly
courteous and co-operative terms you had written to him
making a suggestion about the use of the West Stand by
season ticket holders.  - A. I had sir, yes.

And in keeping consistent with your desire to keep that
area for visitors what you were saying to him, very c o ­
operatively, was "Will you see to it that effectivly home
people are moved out of that and relocated elsewhere"?
A. Yes.  I think I commented yesterday a lot of ticket
holders were allocated annual tickets for that area and
persisted in that which created segregation problems for
us.
And again within the week you got a one sentence courteous
compliance with that from Mr. Mackrell.  -   A. I did sir.

          "Dear Brian, I acknowledge and agree with
          what you s a y . "

It is on the next page.  As usual your requirement would be
putting it too high, but your suggestion as to ground
allocation was immediately complied with. -  A. It was sir,
yes.

Could I next ask your   help with   the question of the
training of stewards,   because that too is an area where you
have co-operated over   the years   very closely with the Club
and the stewards.  -    A. Yes.

At the beginning of every season you have had Officers at
the ground to assist with a full training session of
stewards.  - A. Yes sir.   My fifth Inspector, as I
referred to earlier, Mr. Sewell was on the planning team or
in fact Mr. Cowler prior to him regularly attended and
assisted with the training sessions.

And there was nothing vague or casual about this.  This was
set up very formally at high level in advance of the
meeting.   - A. It was sir, yes.

The Secretaries, all three of them in turn, had the
practice of writing to you, telling you what they wanted to
do on that evening, you would reply, the meeting would be
set up and then you would have a debriefing afterwards.
A. That is correct sir.

Perhaps again we could look at one example, page 23 of this
bundle.  This was again Mr. Chester writing to you I think
                                              B.L. MOLE




- I'm sorry it is you writing to Mr. Chester.  Is it your
signature at the bottom?  - A. It is sir, yes.

This is the 3rd July 1986 and what you were there saying,
as appears from the letter, is that you were referring to
the visit that he had made with the proposal for the
meeting at the start of the new season and setting out a
series of matters, nine in all, of what was going to be
discussed.  - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Q.   Have you seen the video? - A .   I have,   sir, yes.

Q.   Have you seen the whole lot or have you just seen the
     compilation? - A. I have seen the compilation which has been
     prepared by this Inquiry, sir.

Q. You are aware then that at 2.47 or 2.48 there was an
   accidental, if I may call it that, entry? - A. I think that
   was an ejection, as I understand it.

Q. It started as an ejection,     but it led to an unfortunate rush?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And coincidentally, it actually corresponded in time almost
   precisely with Mr. Marshall's request for the gate to be
   opened. - A. I see, sir, yes.

Q.   You have seen that, I call it a rush, the first entry of
     people, certainly less controlled than what occurred 5 minutes
     later? - A. Yes.   As I recall I think the mounted men retook
     the situation.

Q. Clearly what I am calling accidental and not an unintended
   inrush of people? - A. Yes.

Q.   That is something that has to be avoided if at all possible,
     though? - A. I would agree, sir.

Q.   Again, it is a matter to be regretted that somebody          chose to
     override the Standing Orders for ejection.   Is that         not the
     case? - A. If that is the case, sir, yes.

Q. Well, Chief Superintendent, you are very loyal, but we know
   perfectly well it was the case, don't we, because Standing
   Orders specifically require there should be no ejection
   without proper processing? - A. I am not sure this was without
   proper processing.  It would depend where he was taking him
   to.  That is a comment I am making.  I don't know he was
   ejecting him and leaving him or did he take him with him.   I
   am not aware of that information.

Q. If, as we understand the position to be, that people were
   simply - I don't use the word emotively - thrown out as
   distinct from taken out through that gate, that was in clear
   breach of the Standing Order that anybody to be ejected should
   be taken to the Police room and processed and then ejected
   formally through the gate at the far end? - A. Not knowing the
   circumstances of this I may w e l l , having looked at this with
   hindsight, have taken the same decision, because one of the
   problems of dealing with ejections or arrest is that you lose
   Officers, and probably in the circumstances they were facing
   we could not afford to lose Officers.      When I say "lose them",
   I mean taking them with a prisoner, escorting them to the
   Police room, processing them, and as an Officer commanding I
   would have said, in your words, sir, "Throw him out", and have
   taken the consequences, to maintain my Officers in the
   situation I n e e d e d .

                                                         B.L. MOLE



    Q. But Chief Superintendent, throw him out through a gate
       against which there were hundreds of crowd pressing on the
       outside which Officers could not control? - A. Yes, sir.
       I don't mean that, sir.  What I am saying I was addressing
       the problem of failing to comply with Standing Orders and
       dealing with the ejection.  I would merely say there would
       be occasion when I would do t h a t . I think the gate we are
       talking about was not under pressure at that time, but
       probably with hindsight it was not a good gate in any case
       to utilise for that matter.

    Q.   It must have been under pressure because you yourself have
         seen what happened when it was opened? - A. C gate?

    Q. Yes. - A. My recollection is that C gate was not under
       pressure, that B gate was under pressure, and that the fans
       who ran round or took advantage of the opening of C gate would
       come from the back of those turnstiles between the perimeter
       and A-G gates, sir.  That is my viewing of the tape.   I was
       not there.

    Q. But did you not see on the tape that at 2.47 or 2.48 what
       happens is that the Police attempt to push one man out and in
       fact scores of people, if not hundreds, push in? - A. That is
       correct.  I don't think the gate was under pressure in my
       recollection.  I would have to look at the video again.

    Q. We can deal with that on the film then.  Thank you for your
       help.  Can we now move on to the terraces.  The position is
       that on league matches the filling of the pens is something
       which is physically controlled by Police Officers in those
       pens? - A. The agreement to utilise certain sections and pens
       is a decision we take, yes.

    Q.   I am sorry.    Does that vary from what I said?       What I put  to
         you simply was that the filling of the pens is physically
         controlled by Police Officers in those pens? - A. Insofar as
         we don't in fact put people separately into an area, we would
         determine which pens were to be utilised, bearing mind
         intelligence of how many were coming.          It is difficult to
         allow the whole terrace to be used if you are only going to
         have 200 su p p o r t e r s . So we would probably say we would use
         the centre pen only, lock the gates and Officers would direct
         people to the centre pen.

    Q. And you entirely accept in your experience it is the Officers
       who do the directing? - A. In those circumstances, yes.

    Q. Because without being rude or offensive to anybody, the people
       who are heading for the terraces are very unlikely to pay much
       regard to stewards attempting to show them where to go, are
       they? - A. I think they pay very little regard to the
       stewards.

    Q. The realities of the position are that the stewards have
       enough difficulty getting people to allocated seats, and it
                             45

                                                    B.L. MOLE


     \ would be quite impossible for them to direct people into
       standing areas? - A. I think when you say "impossible", if we
       were to address the quality of stewards is another aspect, but
       in general terms with what is available on the day they do
       have considerable difficulty, and I doubt whether that
     .individual or those individuals would take notice, and they do
       have difficulty even to get them to sit in the stands.

Q. What I have difficulty with and what I frankly do not
   understand, Chief Superintendent, is why is it any different
   on a Semi-Final day from a league game? - A. Because I think I
   expressed earlier this morning that we have no control of the
   area we are using for segregation. It is merely a   matter of
   saying the whole area because it is a ticket sell out is to be
   utilised and will find its own level.

Q. It is almost like turning the terrace, on its stand and filling
   it with water and let it overflow as it goes along.    Is that
   what you are saying? - A. The general attitude is they head
   for the middle one first to get the best position. Once that
   is full they ease out to the sides, yes.

Q.     And they simply ease through, I think there are two metre
      gates at the back? - A. I think many go round the north and
      south tunnels as it were to the locations they are heading
      for.       They don't all enter, or my experience is they don't all
      enter by the centre t u n n e l . There are a lot of honest to
      goodness common sense people who approach it in that manner
      and know that they are going to go to the north or south
      t u n n e l , and I think you can see that on some of the video
      where people are drifting either side as well as central.

Q. We were told by one experienced football supporter that the
   design of having access round the sides of the stand for the
   ends of the terraces was something that was quite normal and
   to be expected.   Would you agree with that? - A. I would
   accept that, yes.

Q.     Despite the fact that the signs for it at this ground at this
      time were nothing like as clear as the signs for the tunnel? -
      A. That is right, sir.

Q. But you do accept, do you not, particularly on this day, it
   would have been wholly unreasonable to expect any Sheffield
   Wednesday steward to be on that terrace attempting to control
   those fans? - A. I would think that is fair comment, sir.

Q.    And whether between the two  of us we have worked out the right
      solution or whether we are to be criticised, the fact remains
      that on this day there was nobody there controlling it? - A. I
      am alleged to believe so, sir.   I was not there.

Q. I know you were not, but you are the most senior person of
   experience I have to ask the question. - A. Quite.

Q.    And if that is the position   we have to face candidly the    fact
      that it was unsatisfactory,   do we not? - A. I think with
                          46


                                                 B.L. MOLE


   hindsight of what has happened that is a question we will have
   to address, and I agree with what you say.

Q. Forgive me.  Is it really only hindsight?  Even if you had
   seen that situation from the Police control box on that day
   you would have regarded it as unsatisfactory, would you not? -
   A. I think if I had seen something which activated my mind on
   that day, and I can only say if it activated my mind, that
   there was something to do with the terraces that required
   attention, I would have hopefully reacted to i t . I would have
   had to see the problem first of all.

Q. But you did say, Mr. Mole, that in the past the crowd had
   simply found its own level? - A. In the last two years that
   they did exactly the same, and I had no difficulty.

Q. But bluntly, that is simply not right, because taking the 1988
   game alone the crowd did not find its own level.  It filled to
   the point of capacity and the Police closed the tunnel under
   your, very rightly. - A. I have no recollection of closing the
   tunnel in 1988.

Q. Do you have a recollection of a serial going into the back of
   that stand in order to control it? - A. A serial going into
   the tunnel?

Q. Yes? - A. A serial 14 or 15 are deployed to that location?

Q. Again, we will produce anything that helps.       What we have done
   is to go through all the photographs we had of the 1988 Semi-
   Final . I wonder if you would at one you might be able to help
   us with.  (Photograph p rod u c e d ) I am sure no dispute will
   arise upon it but we can prove it if necessary. - A. None at
   all.

Q. This is a photograph of the Semi-Final in 1988.  We see at the
   back - please just accept that from me at the moment - we see
   the tunnel at the back with what we can see of the Policemen's
   helmets.   As you can see three heads away, or in racing terms
   3-and-a-half heads away in the right-hand margin, we see the
   senior Officer's peak cap? - A. I can see a peak cap of an
   Officer.  I presume it is an Inspector in charge of that
   serial.

Q. At some time during the progress of that game which we can
   actually see being played, what looks like a serial has come
   down through the tunnel? - A. Serial 14 would normally be
   deployed at phase 2 to take up that position.  Serial 15 would
   take up a similar position in the north tunnel, and the
   reserve serial would take up a similar position in the south
   entrance to the pen.

Q. Is it reasonable to assume, if you don't have any direct
   knowledge of what happened in 1988, that those men until they
   came to that position had been the serial which had closed the
   tunnel from the top? - A. My enquiries, and I have made many,
   I have seen photographs of the Inquiry, and I have no
                            47


                                                   B.L. MOLE


     information of anyone putting a serial or barrier across that
     tunnel.  I certainly did not give instructions in 1988 for it
     as far as I recall, but that serial would, before moving to
     the tunnel, be activating at the rear of the turnstiles in the
     enclosure at the back.    If they had gone to that location
     ready to go down the tunnel at some phase that could have
     been interpreted as a s e r i a l , but I have no direct knowledge
     of a specific instruction.

Q. Would they be by and large the same Officers as were used for
   policing league games? - A. Generally, yes.

Q. And is there a possibility for confusion here that those who
   had policed league games would know that that particular
   serial would be involved in actually filling pens in
   accordance with c o n t r o l ’s instructions? - A. The section of
   the Officer in charge of the area there is important, and I
   made the same selection there this year as last year, and it
   is he really who deploys 13, 14 and 15 for the duties in that
   location, and would be normally the same man at league matches
   as w e l l .

Q. Could we have a look at one example of an operational order
   for a league match.  Page 87 is the one we have managed to
   find for the Sheffield W e d n e s d ay -Q uee n's Park Rangers game,
   2nd May, 1987.  It is right to say it was your practice to let
   Mr. Mackrell to have a copy of the operational order so he
   knew what was going on? - A. Yes.

Q. Would you agree it is rather a good idea the club should have
   the operational order, not so they would interfere but so they
   would know the way in which the policing is being controlled?
   - A. I believe that is the correct way.

Q.   Is it within your knowledge they were not given the
     operational order this year for the first time? - A. That is
     not within my knowledge.

Q. Could we go specifically to the details for each section and
   just go to page 98.  I hope it is just clear at the bottom
   right-hand corner.  You see the way in which the detail that
   polices phase 1 at a league game behaves.  Serial 6, this is.
   We don't have the Officer's name on the left-hand side.  Their
   functions before the match are, in the terms of the order:

          "To maintain order, to ensure pens are filled in
          accordance with instructions from control;  occupancy of
          pens by away-home fans will be given at briefing".

     - A. Yes.  This is when the end was used by both home and
     visiting supporters.

Q. So during the filling up process at least one serial of 11 men
   in all is physically in the pen controlling their filling? -
   A. They are filling the pen for segregation to that pen which
   has been selected, and at page 1 it says they will be in the
   south pen on Leppings Lane terrace and part of the West S t a n d .
                                                     \

                           48


                                                   B.L. MOLE


     So they fill the south pen.

Q. Is there any conceivable reason why the same process should
   not be controlled by the Police during a Semi-Final? - A. In
   1987 and 1988 I found the same practice was followed, that it
   filled and maintained its level and spread out, and I did not
   find any need to alter that system.

Q. If that is right, Chief Superintendent, it is an alarming fact
   alone that you are hearing for the first time today that that
   did not happen because somebody, your Officers were among
   them, had to close the tunnel without you even knowing that
   had been necessary? - A. I don't accept that, sir.        I don't
   think that is c o r r e c t . The enquiries I have made suggest that
   is not c o r r e c t .

Q. I see.  What you are disputing is the accuracy of people's
   recollection of seeing Police involved in closing the tunnel?

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You are saying nobody closed off
     the tunnel in 1988? - A. I am aware of that suggestion, and I
     have made enquiries and can find no conformation of that.   I
     certainly have no recollection, and those Officers who were
     present have no recollection of it.

Q.        MR. GLASGOW:   Again, I am sorry, I have to put it on the
     hypothetical basis, and I accept that you dispute the basis of
     fact upon which the question is put.  The fact remains if that
     evidence is reliable and acceptable and that Police did close
     the tunnel, it does, putting it bluntly, make a nonsense of
     the suggestion that the pens filled themselves and found their
     level without supervision, does not it? - A. It does, if that
     is correct.

    Q. Your own experience had been of previous years that in
       your words "people don't directly head for the tunnel"
       when they come through the turnstile, they have time
       to walk around and find their own way in? - A. That is
       correct sir, yes.

    Q. Of course you would accept that they certainly do head
        directly for the tunnel if Gate C is opened under pressure?
        - A. I think if Gate C is opened under pressure that is
      i the first thing they see.

    Q. And it is  for that reason that it is essential that
       people inside know when that gate is going to be opened?
       - A. I would think that is a course of action which should
       be followed sir.

    Q. Those were the matters I wanted your help with on terracing,
       Chief Superintendent, thank you.  Just a few matters on the
       general relationship.

               In addition to all the other material that you get
         in advance of a game, when there is a semi-final do you
         actually get a copy of the F.A. arrangements for that
         game? - A. Not usually, no.   I think I have received
         subsequently from Graham Mackrell a copy, or seen a letter
         by him.   In fact there is something in this file which
         reminds me.   They do a leaflet.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What do mean by the "F.A.
         arrangements"?

               MR. GLASGOW:   Could we go to page 125.

               THE WITNESS:  If that is in real terras a blue leaflet
         I have seen that document.

    Q.         MR. GLASGOW:  Do they let you have it in advance
         of the game? - A. No.

    Q. Again simply as a matter for the future, would it be helpful
       if the F.A. did let the Police responsible for policing the
      ground have their own arrangements for semi-finals? - A. I
       am sorry, sir, could you repeat that?

    Q. Would it be helpful in the future if the F.A. were to send
       the Police a copy of their own match arrangements? - A.
       I think any information that is available to us is useful,
       yes.

    Q. What I wanted to know particularly, since much has been made
       of entertainment, whether you knew that in fact there was
       a plan to have the usual and I think successful Super Skills
       Competition on the field on this day? - A. I did not know
       that but I know that I spoke to Graham Mackrell and said
       were we having some entertainment because I find it most
       important.
                                   B.L. MOLE



You satisfied yourself there was going to be pre-match
entertainment? - A. I had posed the question and that was
the answer that was given to me but whether it happened
I don't know.

We find it on page 128, if you want it from the booklet,
that the Soccer Star Team, where they are there saying
in the pre-arranged publicity the Press Department of
the Football Association is going to contact the Staging
Club separately regarding Soccer Star demonstration prior
to the match? - A. Yes sir.

All you are able   to say is that you knew there had been
entertainment of   this kind laid on in previous years? -
A. Yes indeed in   1988 and I recall mentioning to Graham
Mackrell that it   is useful to have entertainment to
encourage people   into the stadium in good time.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am sorry, Mr. Glasgow, are
you saying that there was or there was not entertainment
this year pre-match?

      MR. GLASGOW:  It was programmed and advertised but
unfortunately not held.  That is I think one of the issues
between the Football Association and ourselves.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I suppose from the point of
view of people turning up for it the fact that it was not
held would not matter.

      MR. GLASGOW:  That is precisely the matter, sir, that
it was advertised as being there and discussed, as we know,
but regrettably it was cancelled after the publicity.

       The reason for raising it, sir, is that you perfectly
understandefeAyasked a question of one witness:   "Was there
any when you got there?" and not surprisingly the indignant
answer was "No, there" was just the records".   There should
have been.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you very much.

      MR. GLASGOW:  There is one other matter I think,
Mr. Mole, on previous occasions you have had to delay a
kick-off I think only once? - A. Only once  sir, yes.

I don't know whether it is a fair question and if it isn't
then you will simply have to say so, but knowing what you
now know of the problems that were being experienced at
about quarter-to-3 on this day, would you have postponed
this kick-off? - A. I must say I have addressed this question
to myself.  Without being in the position of having an over­
view of what was taking place not onlyoutside the ground but
also in the ground, I cannot give you a definitive answer.
All I can say is it would be a serious consideration in my
mind and my mind would be affected as much by what was taking

          place inside; the fact that I had a tremendous amount of
          people already inside who themselves would be disappointed
          and might cause public disorder inside as a consequence
          of my decision, and really and truly I would have to be
          stood facing the question for me to give an answer as to
          whether or not it would be delayed, but I would seriously
          have to consider it.

     Q. It is of course a Police decision, isn't it, nobody else
        could interfere with it? - A. It is indeed.

     Q. And similarly if there is any question of changing kick-
        off time in advance of the match, that too is a matter
        for Police? - A. It is a matter we would raise, yes.

     Q. And on occasions in the past when you have suggested that
        the kick-off be advanced for any reason, quite often till
        12 o'clock, the Club has always accepted your judgment on
        that and advanced the kick-off time? - A. We may have had
        argument and discussion but in general they have always
        accepted my advice on that footing.

                MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much, Chief Superintendent.

                THE WITNESS:   Thank you, sir.


                          Cross-Examined by MR. K I N G :

     Q.    Chief Superintendent on the decision as to postponing the
          kick-off which you have just mentioned, it should not
          depend on the reason why the people have arrived outside
          in such huge numbers, the decision whether or not to
          postpone, should it? - A. I don't think so sir, no.

     Q.   That is quite irrelevant? - A. I think that is the case,     yes
          sir.

     Q. Had you in fact had any predetermined arrangements as to
        the circumstances in which a kick-off would be delayed?
        - A. In general this would be a matter of discussion
        between me and my Sector Commanders sometime prior to
        any major event on policy decisions and really it would
        have to be on the circumstances facing me at the time both
        inside and outside the stadium and down to my decision,
        not one of my Sector Commanders, it is purely a policy
        decision for me to make at that time.

     Q. But the mere fact that you in that position formed a tfiew
        that the reason for these people arriving was their own
        decision and it was their own fault for arriving late,
        that could not possibly be a reason for saying:   "Well
        I am not going to postpone the kick-off"? - A. It is not
        a final reason, it is a consideration of attitude but
        clearly it is not one that would stop me delaying the match.

                                          B.L. MOLE



    Q. In fact you would be quite wrong to if there was a dangerous
       situation outside wouldn't it to let that affect your mind?
       - A. As in isolation I would, yes.

    Q. Now can I turn to the considerations given to the flow at
       the turnstiles? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. Were you yourself aware of the particular capacities of
       the different sections of the ground? - A. I was sir, yes.

    Q.   You would know therefore that the Leppings Lane had 10,100
         for terraces? - A. Yes.

    Q. And you were only allowing, if you only allow A-G, some
       seven turnstiles? - A. The allocation of turnstiles is a
       matter for the Club sir. I don't allow the turnstiles.

    Q.   But you would be informed of that? - A.   I was aware of it.

    Q. Would you have an opportunity to comment on it? - A. I
       think there was little alternative to that arrangement.

    Q. But having acquired that knowledge, seven turnstiles for
       10,100 people, what conclusions were you able to draw as
       to the need for fans to arrive at any particular time prior
       to the match? - A. I think the consideration would be I
       would want people to come as early as possible and therefore
       plan for the opening of turnstiles at 12 o'clock which gives
       a three hour rate before kick-off to encourage people through
       the media to come because in the last hour on reasonable
       assessment I could expect to accommodate something like
       7,000.

    Q. It would not only be a good thing for them to arrive early,
       it would be crucial on those figures, wouldn't it? - A.
       They should arrive early and in fact that was the case the
       previous year and the year before that.

    Q. Just let me put these matters to you and see if you agree
       with me.

               If you took your optimum figure, which is   far greater
         than the Green Code, of 1,000 per hour, that is 500 per
         turnstile in the last half-hour? -. A. On those figures, yes.

    Q. That means that the most, on an optimum situation which
       those turnstiles could cope with, A-G in thelast half-hour
       would be some 3,500 fans? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. That means that even if you had a perfect situation because
       1,000 really requires quite good conditions, doesn't it?
       - A. Well that is the advice given by the Club sir and I
       respond to it.

    Q. You  have got to have well over a half having arrived before
       2.30 if you are going to cope with the remainder? - A.
       And usually that is the case, sir.
                            53

                                        B.L. MOLE



Q. But that is what you need,     isn't it? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Isn't it unrealistic to expect in every game that over
   half will have arrived by 2.30? - A. I think you cannot
   compare this type of game with every game because the
   crowd is so different in size.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  On this type of game? - A.
     On this type of game I think it is realistic to expect
     them to arrive and they have done so and shown that
     willingness in the past.

Q.           MR. KING:  But they are advised on their ticket^ we
     know,   to arrive when? - A. I now know.  I was told yesterday.

Q.Did you not know? - A. I didn't.

Q. Had you ever looked at the ticket before the game? - A. No
   sir.

Qj. Would you accept that advice to arrive 15 minutes before
    was wholly unhelpful? - A. I don't think that is helpful
    at all, sir.

Q. Par from that it would be quite a burden, it would be
   impossible if everyone took that advice, wouldn't it?
   - A. On those figures absolutely right.

Q. It must also be the case that if you don't get 500 per hour
   of course the situation is even worse? - A. Obviously,
   500 per half-hour.

Q. 500 per half-hour, yes.  If one took the Green Code figures
   of 750 per hour that is a mere 375 per half-hour, that
   means that you could get in no more than2625 people in
   the last half-hour? - A. I accept those figures, sir.

Q. Which makes the situation even worse.   You have got to
   have about 75% of the fans having arrived by 2.30.   Now
   did you have any contingency plans available for the
   possibility that that huge majority of people did not
   arrive by 2.30? - A. Yes, the plans are made that if in
   fact you are left with a large number you have that one
   facility we have talked about of delay.   You also have
   the question of those without tickets which we have
   had addressed to me here, and there were contingency
   plans to deal with those after kick-off.

Q. What I am really referring to is the contingency that
   people quite legitimately with tickets arriving perhaps
   in accordance with the back of the ticket, arriving say
   at 2.30.  What were those contingency plans to deal with
   the possibility that you could not possibly get all those
   people through in the half-hour? - A. The contingency
   plan is if you are faced with that situation you would

                                             B.L. MOLE



           have to consider a delay and give them time to enter the
           stadium if disorder was to be avoided.

      Q. Is that the sole plan? - A. Yes sir.

      Q. Are you aware of the Green Code in paragraph 4 6 which says
         this and I read it to you;

                 "Contingency plans should be made to deal with
                 situations where the available entrances at a
                 ground have proved insufficient to stop unduly
                 large crowds from gathering outside".

           A. That is a direction to the Club,   I   think sir.

      Q.   Are you     aware of it? - A. Yes.

      Q. Were you aware whether the Club had such contingency plans?
         - A. No sir, I think as I have given in my evidence I
         offer the facility and they have to satisfy the F.A. that
         they can stage it.

      Q.   Have you got it in front of you? -     A. Page 20, yes.

      Q.   Could Ijust read to you the whole   of that paragraph, well
           not the whole but the next sentence on.

                 "Contingency plans should be made to deal with
                 situations where the available entrances at
                 a ground have proved insufficient to stop unduly
                 large crowds from gathering outside.  This may
                 for example include opening additional entrances
                 of local knowledge of the ground, crowd patterns
                 and advice from the Police should be taken into
                 account in drawing up contingency plans".

           Do you see that paragraph? - A. Yes,      just read it, yes.

      Q. As far as you are aware had the Club drawn up any contingency
         plans to deal with the possibility that with only half-an-
         hour to go the huge majority of fans had not arrived? -
         A. Not that I am aware of sir.




                                          /Q. Can I ask this
                           55


                                              B.L. MOLE




Q. Can I ask this point now please.  You have your serials
   outside, whose duty it is to help filter that crowd
   through the turnstiles.  -  A. Yes.

Q. You told us yesterday that they were under the control not
   of Inspector Marshall but of Mr. Grievson who was inside
   the ground.  - A. Superintendent Greenwood is a
   Ground Commander, Superintendent Marshall the outside
   Commander.  Those Serials, 16, 17, 18 and 19 form part of
   the Ground Command Serials.

Q. So they would be under the control of who?     -   A. Mr.
   Grenwood.

Q. How would they communicate with Mr. Greenwood outside the
   ground?  - A. By radio sir.

Q.   Do they all have radios?    - A. The two Inspectors, Sykes
     and Purdy and the four serial sergeants would all have
     radios.

Q. And what about the foot Police Officers.  - A. No sir,
   except those Officers who are in normal day life Community
   Constables who in fact have a personal issue of a radio who
   would have that with them, but in match terms they would not
   be issued with a radio except down to Sergeant level.

Q. Would their instructions be that if in difficulty they
   would communicate therefore with Superintendent Greenwood
   inside the ground?  - A. No,   Ground Control sir.

Q.   And where is that?   - A. That is the Police Box in the
     corner where he is showing now.

Q. And Police Control would then receive that communication
   and deal with it as they thought fit?  - A. Yes, but the
   method of operation is on talk-through facility so both Mr.
   Greenwood and Mr. Marshall, and in fact Mr. Chapman the
   other Sector Commander would also hear that communication.

Q.   If there was to be a communication from say Superintendent
     Marshall to inside the ground about a decision to open up
     gates how would he go about making that communication?
     A. He could make that direct to Ground Control or he could
     have talk-through facility, which as I understand was on in
     any case, which is the normal system of operation through
     to Mr. Greenwood.

Q. So there would be no problem about that communication?
   A. Providing radio facilities were correct.

                                             B.L. MOLE




Q. What, as far as you are aware, are the facilities of the
   Control Box to communicate with the Ground Officers who are
   employed by the Club.  In other words the stewards and the
   Club officials?  - A. They have their own personal radio
   system of which a piece of their equipment, ie. the radio
   transmitter, is in Police control.

Q. So would there be any difficulty in a communication passing
   from the Police to the Club officials as to the imminent
   opening of a gate for example?  - A. Subject to airspace
   there should be no difficulty, airspace not being used at
   the time by someone else.

Q. Can I ask you about the capacity of the individual pens and
   the consideration given to the filling of those.  - A. Yes
   sir.

Q.   If I understand your evidence, your evidence is that you
     didn't regard that as a Police function at all.  - A. In
     general terms it is a function of the stewards employed by
     the Club to fill the pens.  It is not a Police function.
     If we recognise a potential disorder situation through that
     filling we would have to take some action.

Q. Were you aware ....

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am not following this because
     as I understood it you were saying that the filling of the
     pens at a league game was a police responsibility, that a
     filling of the pens at a semi-final in your experience was
     a self-filling exercise which nobody was responsible as I
     understand it except on the fans themselves.  - A. I think
     the dilemma we face, sir, is that so far as Sheffield
     Wednesday is concerned, because of the use of that end by
     mixed supporters we have taken on the role of segregation
     which has been determining a pen to utilise and have fed
     them physically into that pen so that I can maintain
     segregation.  So in that role we have taken on the role of
     stewarding to achieve segregation.  In the semi-final
     situation the whole terrace is available and my experience
     is we have had no function in filling it except to observe
     it if there is a danger of public disorder.

Q.   As I understand it you are also saying the stewards don't
     either.  - A.    And they have not - they operate on the
     entrances outside to point people but not actually
     physically packing them.

          MR. KING:   Sir I don't know whether this bundle of
     photographs, which I have marked ’South Yorkshire Police
     Document 1' is before everybody.  It is a helpful bundle:

Q. would you turn to photograph 28 please.    -   A. Yes sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is not a composite album.

         MR. KING:    That is not a composite album sir.

          MR. WOODWARD:   Sir it should have accompanied the
     background material and it is Document 1.  It is referred
     to in the index.

Q.        MR. KING:   Photograph 28 shows pens 3 and 4 and it
     shows the tunnel in the middle.  - A. Yes.

Q. And it shows that boundary wall which is on your right hand
   side as you enter the tunnel if you were going into pen 3,
   at the top of the picture.  - A. Oh yes.

Q. The gate that you say people would naturally flow through
   is at the very back of pen 3 isn't it.  - A. The one at
   the top of the   fence, yes.

Q. When you enter   you in fact don't enter level with the back
   of the pen, you enter a good few steps down the pen don't
   you.  - A. Yes you do, sir.

Q. So in order to filter through that gate, if you know it
   exists, you have got to make a positive decision to make a
   sharp turn to go to the back.  - A. That is correct.

Q. As an experienced Officer I welcome your view on this.
   Would you really say that that was an easy method without
   any other help for fans to realise they could filter
   through that way?  - A. I think the vast majority of fans
   attend on a regular basis and know this is a similar system
   across the country and they react to that accordingly.

Q. Why are you entitled - you may be, but why are you entitled
   to make that assumption?   - A. I don't make an assumption,
   sir, I believe from people  I have spoken to concerning that
   kind of facility that that is a similar situation.

Q. The fans naturally want to congregate in the area behind
   the goal don't they?  - A. Generally yes.

Q. We can see from a lot of the other photographs which we
   have seen that it is not a long time before even the back
   of the pen is filled up.  - A. That is right sir, yes.

Q. And that is the very passageway along which you are
   expecting and assuming people will filter.     A. I know
   people do do it sir.

Q. Through a crowded pathway.  - A. It depends on the density
   of the crowd.  If they can't get then they know the pen is
   full.

                                                 B.L. MOLE




Q.   They know which pen is full?      -   A. The one they are trying
     to get into, sir.

Q. I don't want to labour an obvious point, I just want to make
   sure I understand you.  You are saying that if in fact the
   fans who enter down that tunnel found they couldn't make
   their way across pen 3 towards pen 2 the reason for that
   would be they would know that pen 2 was full.  - A. No
   sir.  What I am saying is you are saying if people come to
   the tunnel end and can't achieve a move to the right then
   clearly the pen must be full.

Q.   How do they get into pen 2?       -   A. Go back out, sir.

Q.   Go back where? -   A. Out, sir.

Q.   Down the tunnel.   -   A. Back to the tunnel.

Q. What if they have got lots of people behind them?  -               A. If
   that is the situation they are facing then they have
   difficulty.

Q. What is the correct and easy way to get into pen 2?            -     A.
   By the side, the South tunnel.

Q. By the South tunnel?  - A.   It is not a tunnel it is the
   side of a building, side of the West.

Q. You gave evidence before that you thought the signing was
   unsatisfactory.  - A. Yes I did sir.

Q. It goes a bit beyond that doesn't if Officer?  When you
   enter gates A and G you can see obviously standing over the
   tunnel in huge letters can't you?  - A. Yes sir.

Q.   Is there any signing at all to direct you first to the left
     through that gate in the wall?  - A. Not that I can recall
     sir.

Q.   It isn't there that the signing is unsatisfactory, there is
     no signing at all.  - A. What I have said this morning I
     can only repeat again.  I have not found a difficulty with
     it.  With hindsight I think you are right, it is not
     satisfactory.

Q. Let us not deal with hindsight at the moment Officer, deal
   with somebody who is looking at an empty ground, with
   commonsense, you would expect commonsense would dictate a
   sign directing you to the left wouldn't you?     A. I can't
   change my viewpoint, sir.  What I have said is it has not
   activated my mind before, and having now looked at it I
   agree with you.

    Q.   It isn't simply unsatisfactory, it is highly dangerous
         isn't it?  - A. You are not going to put words in my
         mouth, sir, that is the answer I can give.

    Q. So be it.  Let me deal with another matter.  The filling of
       those individual pens is obviously of importance isn't it
       in crowd control, whether they are full to capacity or not?
          A. You are talking about the semi-final match?

    Q. Any match.    -   A. Yes, the filling of the pens, yes.

    Q.   It is not simply a matter for the Club, the Police also
         need to be aware, don't they, as to whether or not one
         particular part of the ground is becoming dangerously ov e r ­
         full.  - A. I would expect that the Officer in command and
         the Ground Commander would be looking at that on a regular
         basis.

    Q. You have agreed with me that apart from that little gate
       between pens 4 and 5 or 3 and 2 really they are self-
       contained pens aren't they?  - A. Yes sir.

    Q. Are you personally aware, were you aware, of the individual
       capacity of those pens?  - A. I know that the two pens we
       are looking at there's a thousand and twelve hundred.

    Q. Do you know what that bears to the total capacity of the
       Leppings Lane terrace?   - A. 10,100 is the total capacity
       and you are just putting twelve hundred in there yes.
       There's 3,70 0 in the elevated section.

    Q.   The central pens contain no more than about just        over
         twenty per cent of the total capacity?  - A. If         that is
         the percentage sir, yes I agree with you.

    Q.   It is not a difficult calculation.  Those are the areas to
         which naturally fans direct themselves.  - A.   Yes sir, in
         the first instance.

    Q.   In the first instance.  It contains a very small proportion,
         just over a tenth of the total capacity of the terrace.
         The figures speak for themselves.  - A. Yes sir.

              MR. COLLINS:    One fifth.

    Q.         MR. KING:   A fifth, I beg your pardon.    -      A. As I
         say we are talking about twenty per cent.

    Q.   Did it not turn your mind to the need to ensure close
         observation of the filling of the individual pens?    Did
         that cross your mind?   - A. I do, when I have operated
         there, watch the pens.   I do walk on the perimeter track

             and look at the pens and if I perceived a problem I would
             react to it.

        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If you saw that the middle two
             pens were very crowded and that the two wedges in the
             corner were fairly lightly populated, what would you do?
             Open the gates and move some out or what?  - A.
             Operationally - I have not faced the situation but ....

        Q.   I mean pre-match.  - A. Facing what you say I would do
             what was suggested earlier this morning.  I may well have
             closed the tunnel with our serial Officers and I may then
             direct to the wings.

        Q.        MR. KING:   I am interested in the planning stage
             because again just looking at those pens one surely can
             foresee the danger that the two central pens may fill much
             more quickly than the outer pens.   That must be
             foreseeable without even having any match experience.
             A. They do fill before the others, yes.

        Q. There may not have been any but what system existed, as far
           as you are aware, for the acquisition of knowledge as to
           how full those central pens were becoming?   - A. The
           actual centre pens knowledge is not known in real figure
           terms.   The only figure I have, and I used to have access
           to by visiting Mr. Mackrell's office on a regular basis, is
           the number of people overall on the terraces which would
           tell me, and commonsense would dictate if that overall
           figure was five thousand and it was all in the centre, I
           would know that I had got five thousand in the centre
           roughly.

        Q. But apart from that observation thre was no system as far
           as you are aware of the acquiring precise knowledge as to
           how full the central pens were becoming?  - A. No sir.

        Q.jlt wouldn't be very difficult would it to have for example
          |Police Officers on duty within the terraces to keep an eye
            on the numbers?   - A. I don't think that would achieve
          i anything sir.   The Police Box is in a position to observe
          \ that number and they can see and react to any developing
            situation.

        Q. Are you saying that the Police Box in your view is in as
           good a position as someone on the terraces to assess
           whether or not the central pens were becoming over-full?
           A. A better position.

        Q. May I just ask you about one aspect of the terraces.   If
           you look at photograph 27 in the same bundle I referred to
           you before, the South Yorkshire Police Document 1.   Do you

   see that area, perhaps it is a no man's area, between 4 and
   5.  - A. Yes sir.

Q. There is a relatively narrow pathway.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           4 and 6.

        MR. KING:       4 and 6 yes:

Q. You see that?    -    A. Yes sir.

   to be aware of all these matters.  It may be personally you
   are not aware.  If we look at Tab 4 we see the minutes for the
   debriefing of the FA Cup Semi-Final between Tottenham Hotspur
   and Wolverhampton Wanderers? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Before we look at it in detail we will have before us
   minutes of dozens of meetings.  We have letters passing
   between the club, the FA and yourselves, but is it right to
   say that never once have there been any discussions between
   representatives of the 54,000 who were eventually going to
   go into Hillsborough some 8 years later? - A. In what
   format, sir?

Q. In 1981 there was an incident which led to the crushing of
   people at the Leppings Lane end.  We will hear about
   recommendations, some followed, some not,
   disagreements.  We will hear about discussions that
   went on between the Police and very many people. At
   the end of the day 95 people were crushed to death
   in pens that nobody was stewarding.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Was that a question?  I am sorry,
     Mr. Jackson.  It is not a question.  Would you mind putting a
     question.

Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Is it right at no time have there been any
     discussions with anybody representing the customer? - A. I
     have had no discussions with the people you are referring to.

Q. And at the end of the day, 8 years after the first crushing at
   Hillsborough, 95 people were crushed to death, were they not,
   simply by overcrowding, not by wilful disobedience of Police
   Officers, stewards or the crowd themselves, simply by
   overcrowding? - A. I cannot agree with that statement, sir.

Q. Would you like to give me any other reason other than
   overcrowding? - A. I am not in possession of all the facts.
   It would be wrong of me to say that the outcome of this
   Inquiry was the fact that overcrowding caused those deaths.          I
   have not got that information to hand, sir.

Q. If it were overcrowding would you not feel it is a very
   unfortunate situation that these pens were packed - I use that
   in a loading sense - by the fans the m s e l v e s , and no-one seemed
   to be supervising the loading of these two pens? - A. I think
   there is always, as I have tried to explain this morning, a
   monitoring of that aspect.  It did work well last year and the
   year before.  I am unable to comment further than what I have
   already said, sir.

Q. Chief Superintendent, forgive me if I don't leave it there.
   As I understand it in answer to my Lord's questions, you
   agreed that neither the Police nor the Sheffield Wednesday
   stewards were involved in the loading of those two pens? - A .
   I did, sir.

Q.   I therefore suggest again it is very unfortunate that people
     were crushed in pens that no-one supervised the packing? - A.
     I think I have responded to that, sir.

Q. May I go back to 1981,      the minutes of the meeting,   Tab 4,
   third paragraph:

             "Mr. Gosling said it was his decision toremove
             spectators from the Leppings Lane  end of the ground to
             the other side in order to ease a dangerous situation
             where series injuries or even fatalities were a real
             possibility.  He then read a letter of complaint ;which
             contained an allegation that the Police herded more and
             more people into the Leppings Lane enclosure when it was
             obvious that it was full".

     An allegation, as it were, not against the Police in 1989 but
     that it did happen, the same problem? - A. That is how that
     reads, yes.

Q. Next paragraph:

          "The chairman invited views on this point.
          Superintendent Chapman said that the entrances to
          Leppings Lane were controlled to ensure an even
          distribution of fans.  However, as the ground filled up
          the usual packing problems o c c u r r e d " .

     Not a    new phenomenon.  "The usual packing problems", which 8
     years    later were left to the fans to solve.  Is that fair,
     Chief    Superintendent? - A. It does not actually say who was
     doing    the packing, sir, or if anyone was doing the packing,
     and I    am not aware of that matter in 1981.

Q. I don't mind whether the Police were, Sheffield Wednesday
   were, or no-one was, that a problem with packing occurred in
   1981 is quite evident, is not it? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q.           "There was space in the centre enclosure, but fans
             refused to move over and fill it.  Police Officers were
             placed into the crowd to ensure the best use was made of
             the available space".

     - A. Yes, sir.

Q. That is exactly the situation you say now could not happen? -
   A. No, sir, I said if we had perceived a problem, and my
   information is a problem was not p e r c e i v e d , then we would
   take action.  You are recognising the fact a problem was
   perceived, and I have no evidence of that, sir.

Q.             "Chief Superintendent Herold pointed out that the
               problem was exacerbated by a series of incidents which
               culminated in the late arrival of a large number of
               fans".

                                                     B.L. MOLE


     It does not seem time has changed very much between 1981 and
     1989, does it, Chief Superintendent?   Fans late, no packing,
     crowd problems? - A. On those examples, sir, I would agree.

Q. May I go further and perhaps in more detail.        The bottom of
   page 2:

          "The discussion progressed to the construction of the
          Leppings Lane enclosure.  Mr. Gosling felt it was
          inadequate and required more divisions so that spectators
          are not in such a solid mass.  He also felt that the
          limit of 10,100 was too high, although Superintendent
          Chapman disagreed with this".

     It would appear, would it not, that there was a body of
     opinion in 1981 that thought 10,100 was too high? - a. From
     that report, sir, yes.

Q.   If we move on, I turn to Tab 5, 5th June, 1981,s a letter
     addressed to Mr. McGee, the Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday,
     under the heading:  "Our analysis of what" - I can't read the
     next w o r d :

          "The Leppings Lane end is not constructed to give maximum
          aid to the packing and control of the crowd and the
          accepted crowd capacity is such that there is no safety
          margin".

     - A. Yes,   sir.

Q.   1981, packing mentioned again, but in 1989 it was thought fit
     to let the crowds pack themselves? - A. The results of 1981
     was the introduction of the radial f e n c e s .

Q. Oh, yes, I am turning to that, a matter that would
   considerably, you may think, hamper the c r o w d ’s ability to
   pack itself.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     You mean,   to even itself out?

          MR. JACKSON:   Indeed:

Q. We can see documents if necessary.  When the radial fences
   were introduced there was a good deal of discussion, was there
   not, as to how high they should be, because at first it was
   considered the initial suggestions would lead to a fence that
   people could easily climb over? - A. There were those
   discussions, I would accept that.

Q. Am I right in saying this, that one of the scourges of the
   football world in the 1970s and 1980s has been the wholly
   unacceptable element of hooliganism? - A. I think that is fair
   comment, sir.

Q. It has had such an effect that the clubs are banned from
   Europe, we are now considering identification cards, a
   football fan is almost a term of abuse, and because of that,
                                  72


                                                       B.L. MOLE


     quite properly and understandably, pens have been introduced.
     It is also right, is it not, that those pens are meant to
     control? - A. I would agree, sir.

Q. And therefore the effect of putting the pens, the central pens
   in particular, into the Sheffield Wednesday, Leppings Lane
   t e r r a c e s , was to reduce the ability of the crowds to move
   about? - A. One of the experiences I understand from 1981 was
   the difficulty with the sway, and that was introduced into
   considerations as to why radial fences should be i n t r oduc ed.

Q. Chief Superintendent, may I totally accept that proper
   consideration was given to that and the resulting radial
   fences served a very important purpose? - A. Yes.

Q. But that purpose was crowd control, and had nothing to do
   with crowd safety, in that when the central pens became too
   crowded those fences made it more difficult to move to the
   side? - A. It does hamper the movement to the side, sir.

Q. Would you turn,      please,   to Tab 6.   First of all,   the
   4th paragraph:

          "I have informed Mr. England that our consensus view is
          that 10,100 crowd figure specified in the safety
          certificate is too high".

     Moving down,   next paragraph:

          "Mr. England has been acquainted with our view that the
          Leppings Lane terracing should be sectioned vertically
          front to back to produce pens to produce more accurate
          crowd control and prevent sideways movement".

     - A. Yes,   sir.

Q. Specifically designed to prevent the sideways movement that
   would now allow the more safer packing? - A. No, sir, to
   prevent the sideways movement of sway creating pressure.

Q. It would appear, therefore, that solving one problem, the
   swaying of the side, has created, we   now know, another?        -A.
   Very probably, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That was not thought to be a
     problem at the Kop end, was it? - A.   No, sir. We never
     experienced that with a wide mass on  the Kop end in the    same
     way that the confined narrowness, the sway created pressure
     against the fence.

Q. You mean the narrowness from back to front? - A. The
   narrowness from back to front.

Q.       MR. JACKSON:   May I now move forward in time to Tab 8.
     This again is a South Yorkshire Police document:

          "Subject:     Education of club stewards.
                                      73


                                                           B.L. MOLE



           You are both aware of my feelings that club stewards at
           Hillsborough often do less than they should, and are at
           times not aware of our function and operation of our
           respective roles.   I have cross swords with them
           personally once or twice last season.   In an effort to
           set things right in the coming season I have arranged
           those meetings.   They should be told very bluntly that
           each of them should be aware of the location of their
           respective fire points",

     and then other m a t t e r s .

           "We should stress to the stewards that the admission of
           spectators and the packing of those spectators at bigger
           games on to the terracing is primarily their function
           and not a Police o n e " .

     It would appear, would it not, Chief Superintendent, that the
     packing of the terraces was a problem that was well known to
     the authorities, it was merely a question of who should act
     upon it? - A. I think in following the Green Guide which was
     then in existence and followed by the one in 1986, that
     responsibility was fairly laid at the stewards.

Q. As I have indicated before, I am not seeking to blame
   Sheffield Wednesday stewards or the Officers under your
   control or you.  I am merely pointing out that it is quite
   clear that the packing of terraces was a problem well known to
   the authorities? - A. I would agree, sir.

Q. There was a dispute as to who should try and solve it? - A. As
   I have said, there should not be a dispute, and the
   resolving and the requirement is where it has l e d .

Q. By "dispute", I mean you had one view, it may be the proper
   view, but the effect at the end of the day, no-one applied
   their minds to it in 1989? - A. I think in the manner which I
   have described and the method of dealing with the situation is
   as I outlined, that if we had seen a problem the reaction to
   that would have been as I described earlier.

Q.   I thought you had passed it fairly and squarely and properly
     on to the club? - A. I think you will recall, sir, we were
     asked how I would deploy Officers if I had perceived a problem
     which suggested there was overcrowding in the pen, and I
     reacted to that a n s w e r .

Q. May I now move forward to Tab No. 9.              It is a minute of a
   meeting.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            Can we do this at 2 o'clock?

Control Assistant                  (0930 - 1800 hours - 15.04.89)




             took a call from the Police asking to speak to the Control
Superintendent.     Mr. Clarke was the Duty Superintendent and he took the
call.    The Police were asking for a fleet of ambulances to be despatched to
Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.


Within minutes of the first call, a second call was received from the
Police and I think the content of the call was along the lines of "people
crushed, bodies everywhere at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground".


At this moment in time, the control room was split and the incident was
taken over onto the ERC channel in the Major Incident Room.     Mr. Clarke
told              to restart an incident log.   She then went into the Major
Incident Room with Mr. Clarke.


                and             were in control at the time visiting and he
                and I began answering the calls.
                                               went into the Control
Superintendents Office to begin calling in control officers and assistants.


I rang                for Mr. Clarke and she was informed that press calls
were coming in very fast with regard an incident at Hillsborough.


The telephones went crazy then, the press were on very fast, the Control
Room was extremely busy - the volume of press calls was very heavy.

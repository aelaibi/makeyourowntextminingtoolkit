                       On Saturday              151h A p r i l         1989         < i5 0 4 8 9 )    I was       at    h o me     on m y    o w n at

                      approx.          1500         hrs,        I knew         the     football            match       had    started        due        to    the

                       cheers      of       the      crowd.          Shortly           after         the    kick       off    I heard        a     statement

                       over      the      loudspeaker,                 I knew          something            was    wrong          because        they        don't

                       of      road and         see       what      wa s      happening,,             We    walked                                      anto

                       Leppings          LN,        we    stood      at       the    barrier          where       three       Policemen            were

                       entrance,              I would           describe            this     c r o w d as       being        “m o b    hysteria"             they

                       were     all      yelling,            screaming              etc.

           I. a l s o    saw     a Policeman              on    a    horse        who       was    “trapped"          in    the    middle             of

           this     crowd.

           At    this     stage       I d i d n ’t w a i t           to     see      anymore         so    I returned         to       my    home

           where        I stood       in    the      passage          and       fans        started        to   flood       down       the       road,

           and    1 then         realised         what         was    happening.                  These     fans      asked       me    if       they

           could        use    my    phone      which          I allowed             them     to     do.

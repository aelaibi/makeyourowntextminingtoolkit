               At this      time     it was      very busy and                lots of supporters were                       carrying

        We    p revented them going any further with                       the drink and        instructed them

        to threw         it away or to drink          it before       proceeding any further.

        T hey all        elected       to drink up.        All were    in good jovial          mood       but some

        of them drank 2 or 3 cans                  in a very short          time    before moving         on.

        There      is a public          house at    the junction we were at               (name   not      known).

        All      the windows were          boarded up but       people were          being a d m i t t e d    via

        the      back    door.        (I was    told it was    one    pound for admittance.)                 At 2.

        5 0 pm    (1450)      there was a pi nor d isturbance               in this     pub but on officers

        g aining        entry    it was all       over.

        A t 3.05pm        (1505)      my serial     started    to walk       to C laywheels       for                       j


        refreshment            but    instructions    came over       the    radio    for all     serials        to

        parade Leppings Ln end of the ground.                         An    Inspector      took   charge and we             |

        made      our way to that          end and paraded       in serial          order.     The    Inspector             j


        reported our            position then       instructed my serial             to go    into    the g r o u n d       j

        and a ss i st         in any way we       could.     The outer       gate    on L ep pings Ln were

        open a nd on going              inside we    saw that    there were about             12 bodies         laid

        on the floor            outside and at the          side of the       tunnel.        Police Officers

        were      gjt.ving m outh to m outh artificial               respir at io n to some          of these,

        others were            covered by coats.           There were       some    onlookers     shouting and

        s wearing        at the Police Officers             and blaming       them for       this,    some were

        the worse         for drink       but o bviously were         in shock.         We tried to          pacify

        these.          At this time       other    jaodies were      being    carried from the

        tunnel      a nd stood near            the entrance.     Some       bodies were       carried        to the

        en trance        so there       could be    removed without a mbulances               coming       into the

        g round.

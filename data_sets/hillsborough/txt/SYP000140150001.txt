Dear Dr Nicholson

Hillsborough

Further to our meeting with you and your colleagues in January in the
company of Deputy Chief Constable Mervyn Jones the Coroners Officer
and his assistant Detective Inspector Perkins, I now take pleasure in
providing the information which was promised.

As indicated to you, whilst I accept the reasons for the appointment
of my practice related to the Third Party litigation, it was stressed
that we were eager to obtain the truth.  As a result a huge amount of
primary research work had been undertaken including the removal of
the remains of barrier 124a to laboratories in West Bromwich where it
had undergone extensive testing under the aegis of the "Experts” by
SGS Inspection Services Limited.  A copy of their report dated 4th
July 1990 has been provided at no cost and should have by now arrived
with you.

It is completely understood that the Coroner’s primary interest is
how 95 people died at Hillsborough.  Whilst there were a number of
other points which were pertinent to the case which the meeting was
intended as a forum to discuss, there were two main points

a        the number of people in pen 3 at the time of the disaster

b        the collapse load of barrier 124a

The Third Parties in the civil action were of course the South
Yorkshire Police under whose solicitors instruction my own practice
has been acting, the Club whose solicitors Davies Arnold & Cooper
instructed Dr J Weaver BSc(Eng),PhD, DIC, FICE, FIHT and his
colleagues at Sir William Halcrow & Partners.  A copy of Dr Weaver’s
two volumes of Report dated 22nd August 1990 are understood to have
been obtained already.  The remaining Third Party was Eastwood &

                                                                         £




Partners whose representative at the forum of Experts was a
m e t a l l u r g i s t S h e f f i e l d       University Metals
Advisory Centre.  The Engineering input was to some extent provided
by                              A copy of his Report may be
avaiIabIe.

The majority of the work undertaken by my practice has in addition to
my own regular staff of Engineers been undertaken and checked by Dr
                            |of Imperial College and Dr             of
Manchester University.

In respect of the number of people in pen 3 you showed us the A1
enlargement of the Police photograph taken at 15.03 recorded by the
stand clock 15.02 real time.  One corner of the pen was missing but
by the use of computer drafting to digitise all faces that would
clearly be seen and the application of a similar density for the
missing area had been undertaken.

The site of pen 3 had then been divided into four strips based on the
three rows of fences. The rear three rows taken as extending across
the whole width of the pen 14.355m had a front to back dimension of
2.5m for the rear row, 3.5m for the third row, 3.5m for the second
row and 3.6m for the front row, an overall dimension of 13.1m and a
total area of 188.050 square metres, the front strip being 51.678

             second strip     50.242

             third strip      50.242

             rear strip       35.887

This makes no allowance for cross hatched areas, areas behind the
wing wall at the tunnel entrance, any area in the tunnel itself.  No
a Ilowance in respect of any of the terrace hardware.

Using your densities of 7.5, 7.6, 8.1 and 10 persons per square metre
would give occupancy levels of 269, 381, 406, 516 for each of the
four strips and a gross total of 1572.

Modification of the occupancy level of the front strip to 8.1 would
reduce the total by 100.

You also were kind enough to show us a further photograph taken from
the north stand at 1452 from a similar angle to that at 1459 in Lord
Justice Taylor’s Report.  That photograph carries the same problems
as the one which we used in terms of the numbers of persons obscured.


                                  2
Your figure for pen 3 on the basis of the 1452 photograph   is 678.

That compares with our own evaluation as reported in Appendix C of
969, both figures being heavily dependent upon estimates of those
h idden.

Our own evaluation of the occupancy of pen 4 is for an appreciably
greater number of people at 1214 in an area which is 3m2 larger.

In short I am prepared to accept that the figure of actual occupancy
of pen 3 at the time of the col lapse of the barrier of 124a was
appreciably higher.  However, after further detailed consideration
the figure of 1400 and an average occupancy of 7.7 per square metre
for 1503 is a preferred figure.   This compares with the Green Guide
density of 5.4 per square metre.

Another way of looking at it is. that there were at least 400 people
more in their pen than there should have been without any allowance
being made for gangways or cross hatched areas.

For the record our own evaluation of the videos   is that barrier 124a
actually collapsed at between 1505 and 1506.

As promised I have sent to you a copy of the British Standards
Institution book on Ergonomic Standards and Guidelines from which has
been provided the information contained at page 26 of our Report,
chapter 3 relating to Green Guide paragraph 89.

That arrives at a density of 67.5 substantially framed men per 10m2 .
That is an area of occupancy for each individual of .148m2 . The
ellipse of the actual hip area is actually .1m2 and with allowances
for clothing arms and the partial spaces between individuals the area
which can be attributed to each substantially framed man is .148m2 .

If we look at the same effective figures for a fifth percentile of
women as distinct from the ninety fifth percentile of men, the
dimensions for the el Iipse are 310mm and 210mm, the area of the
actual ellipse .051m2 . Allowing forspaces, arms and clothing gives
us .076m2 per small woman and a maximum packing density of 13.16 per
square metre.

For the sake of completeness, if we take the fiftieth percentile of
men, the ellipse dimensions are 465mm x 250mm, an ellipse of .091m2
with the allowance for clothing, arms and spaces, an area of .135m2
and an occupancy of 7.4 per square metre.




                                  3
Ninety fifth percentile men without any allowance for clothing or
arms would occupy rows of el Iipses on a half drop pattern the centre
lines of the rows being 247.9mm apart and a spacing of 510mm giving a
density of only 7.9 per square metre.

The section in my Report dealing with this aspect was primarily to
consider the potential in terms of loading of the barriers.  In terms
of robust substantially framed men the figure of 6.75 per square
metre is completely valid.

We next addressed the question of escape routes as identified in our
Appendix M and in respect of the Green Guide requirement at section
96 addressed on pages    27 to 29 of our Report. The figure of 12m
comes directly from BS 5588 whichis the standard work in provision
of proper escape routes.

29.1# of those in pen   3 are beyond 12m from the exit tunnel, the vast
majority being in the   front strip of pen 3 and the remainder in the
southern end of the second strip.

In addition there are a further 4% of the occupants who are more than
12m from the tunnel, but who are less than 12m from the gate in the
radial fence marking the southern perimeter of pen 3, since this is
not a vaI id emergency ex it .

At the Third Party trial there was considerable discussion in respect
of this aspect which leads to the fundamental conclusion that there
simply were not enough exit gates and there were no proper exit gates
onto the pitch.  In order to comply with the 12m rule there would
have had to have been at least two full size gates onto the pitch
which could be opened by would be escapers and which were suitably
marked.

Leading on from that the Green Guide at chapter 16 addresses the
estimation of safe ground capacity and at clause 220 gives three
methods of evaluating those who can be safely accommodated.

Method A is the capacity of 5.4 persons per 10m2 which, as we have
already seen, gives an absolute gross figure of 1,015.

Method B relates tothe numbers who can leave by the normal exit
route in 8 minutes.   As we have indicated at page 51 of our Report
the assessment through a normal exit route is simple to make from
clause 234. This is on the basis of 60 persons per minute per unit
of exit width of 0.55m.  The tunnel represents 2.7 units of exit
width giving an 8 minute evacuation of 1,334 spectators.


                                   4
Method C is the number who can leave in an emergency within a time to
be assessed which should not exceed 2g minutes.  At page 52 we have
evaluated the number who can exit in 2k minutes on the basis of 60
per .55m exit width, which means that the tunnel can take only 417
people.

If we take into account the gate in the rear of the radial fence,
this adds another 300 people, a total of 717.

The theoretical capacity   of pitch gate 3, although it was incapable
of being opened by those   who would wish to exit, having a width
of .81m or 1.47 units of   exit width gives a maximum theoretical
capacity of pitch gate 3   as 220.

The maximum capacity figure under chapter 16 therefore is 717 with an
absolute top limit of 937.

Turning now to the failure of barrier 124a, the SGS Materials Report
gives tensile strengths of 499 N/mm2 for the low carbon steel rail 1
to 2, 375 N/mm2 for the wrought iron rail 2 to 3 and 405 N/mm2 for
the wrought iron rail 3 to 4. These are in fact somewhat higher than
the figures which you had already obtained for rail 3 to 4 of 365
N/mm2 . However, in order to avoid confusion, we have used your
figures throughout in analysing load.

Elastic analysis of the rail 3 to 4 indicates that it would deflect
34.8mm under a load of 6kN/m and that would exceed the elastic limit
for the raiI.

The SGS photographs of support 3 end of rai I 3 to 4 figure 1.17 and
support 3 end of handrail 2 to 3 figure 1.14 shows that there was
failure of the rail over support 3 which would result in the rail at
3 to 4 become technically simply supported although it would still
remain connected.  Please note that figure 1.14 was originally
erroneously typed as being fractured at support 2 and I trust your
copy has been correct Iy amended.

The rail 3 to 4 under the same loading of 6kN/m run, but now
effectively simply supported, would deflect an increasing amount as
it was already beyond the elastic limit. This deflection would
reduce the bow string dimension to less than the distance apart of
the clips on the top of support 3 and 4, such that

a    There would be a permanent deflection of approximately the
     180mm shown to actually be the case in SGS figure 1.15 and


                                    5
b     The already corroded support end of rail 3 to 4 would exhibit a
      fracture on a part of the rail and the remainder would pull out
      of the strap on support 4. The detail of this end is seen in
      figure 1.18 of the SGS Report.

During this process of bending before pulling out there would be a
twisting action on the clip to support 4 which would cause lateral
forces to be exerted and cause support 4 to fail at the lower end of
the rear leg where it had been previously repaired against corrosion,
and at the upper end of the front leg which is the primary point of
vulnerability demonstrated by the on-site testing programmes.

Once the support 4 end of raiI 3 to 4 was no longer provided with
adequate support, the portion of tube previously engaged below the
strap on support 4 was bent laterally as the continuing load of
approximately 6kN/m moves the handrail even further forward.

Since the material at support 4 was unable to sustain the loading,   it
deformed and released itself from support 4. At that instant the
total load on support 3 would be

      approximately half the loading on the span 3 to 2 and

      virtually all the loading which had previously been on the span
      3 to 4

Supports 2 and 3 were 2.265m apart and supports 3 to 4 were 2.2m
apart.   In a continuously supported situation there is an attraction
of load to the intermediate support as a result of the continuity.
In a two span configuration this attraction of load can be as much as
24%. The effect on the intermediate support 3 is that it would carry
appreciably more than half the load on the adjoining spans.   With a
load of 6kN/m the half share would be six times 1.1325 plus 1.1, or
13.4kN. As a result of the continuity this could be increased to
16.6kN and with the pulling out of the remote end of rail 34 from
support 4 would rise    instantaneously to 20kN.

Such a force is more   than sufficient to cause total and collapse
loading on support 3   such as to fold it to the ground in the position
in which it was found, but all of which had originated only from a
maximum load on the rail of 6kN/m.

The testing of the barriers is covered comprehensively in Annexe C of
the Green Guide which is addressed in pages 57 onwards of my Report.
The 6kN/m run load was applied via the Eastwood test rig to barrier


                                   6
 124a specifically in June 1983 and on 19th July 1988.

The load is intended to be applied in ten equal increments and a
record of any deformation during loading, maintained loading or
recovery period is required to be retained. There is at clause 4 a
requirement for the force to be applied and maintained for five
minutes in each of three consecutive periods.

What actually happened in the tests was that the load was applied in
one single increment, held for a notional five minutes and then
removed, the deflections of rails centrepoint only being measured.

In our own testing using both the Eastwood rig and the SGS rig the
load was applied in increments and deflections were measured both at
mid span and the supports.    The objective was to measure the
deflection of the support and the additional deflection of the rail
in relation to the support.    However, even in this incremental
application of load the deflection dial gauges were still rotating at
the end of five minutes.    In other words, the real deflection was not
a I I completed despite the passage of time as a result of the
incremental application of load and the time taken to measure a
considerable series of dial gauges.    In other words, we do not
believe that the 1983 and 1988 measurements of deflection were
accurate. They were optimistic.

We have also discussed at length the fact that each of the three
periods was treated as a separate test and the dial gauges were re­
zeroed each time rather than being measured continuously.   The
consequent ratchet effect is discussed at page 60 of our Report
showing that the real permanent deflection achieved by the tests
under less than 6kN/m was substantially greater than that perceived
by the Eastwood technicians.  Had they perceived the test in the way
that we believe is appropriate, the barrier would have been failed
and replaced.  Dr Eastwood is the only one Engineer of whom I am
aware, despite enquiry from a considerable body of technical opinion,
who feels that his technician’s interpretation was appropriate.

Even with the shortcomings of interpretation, there were actual
failures of uprights achieved by the 1983 and 1988 tests.   141
particularly had failed and been repaired at the centre support.   The
repair plates can be seen at photograph 7 of Appendix F page 31 of
volume 2 of our Report.  The photograph also shows how, with a load
of 6kN/m run, the rear leg failed again by a tension necking failure
on the forward flange.  This photograph also shows the compression
failure of the front leg caused by bowing of both legs of the angle
on the front part of the support.

Barrier 123 also shows an identical failure at the first rivet hole
on the rear leg at photograph 3 page FI7 of our Report. The loading
again was 6kN/m under the Eastwood rig.

One of the difficulties in attempting to correlate the various
testing is that there is clearly a wide disparity in the quality of
materials actually in the barriers themselves.  We have already seen
the disparity between the material characteristies in handrail ] to
2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4 on 124a from the SGS tests.

In reality there was a preference for the SGS rig as a means of
applying actual loading but regrettably there was confusion on site
because of the load cell calibration certificate.  I have pleasure in
attaching hereto a replacement Appendix G for our Report with the
corrected calibrations.  From this you will be able to see

      Barrier 124 had a centre support rear leg failure at around
      6kN/m and with a permanent deflection of the support of 35mm
      after holding 7kN/m for five minutes.

      128a failed at the centre support of the rear leg at less than
      7kN/m.

      132 was the new barrier used for correlation purposes and shows
      very satisfactory recovery.

      The uprights of 138 were tested individually to see what they
      were capable of carrying and we concluded that an actual load
      of 16kN would cause failure.

I have already indicated the reservations that we have concerning the
Eastwood & Partners test rig particularly where the bolts which are
supposed to act as pin joints are tightened up. There is in fact
substantial horizontal load induced by the configuration.  Indeed,
during one of the tests the whole rig physically moved laterally with
a violent react io n .

We have reanalysed 124a using the CADS analyse programme.  We have
made allowances for a reduction in thickness from 4mm nominal to 3.5
nominal for corrosion and imposed a load of IkN/m to rails with a
factor of 1 to 7 to allow for a range of loadings.

We conclude for a load of 5kN/m the maximum support moment of
2.519kNm the elastic stress in the tube would be 305N/mm2. For a
yield stress of 294N/mm2 this would give a UDL for yield of only


                                  8
4.82kN/m.

We have looked at the reactions on support 3 under 6kN/m run and if
the rail was continuous the loading on support 3 would be 14.856 kN,
but in a non-continuous situation 11.814 kN. The instantaneous
reaction at support 3 with the rail having parted from support 4 at 6
kN/m run the reaction at the support 3 would be 26.418 kN assuming
full continuity still, but in the position of a crack having occurred
in the uphill face of the rail there could well be a reduction to
20.676 kN. This validates the point made in our Report that the
combined stress would create a yield in the rear leg of the handrail
of 124a at a rail loading of 5.25 kN/m run.

Yours sincerely

REPORT
MICHAEL JOHN CRAIGHILL       POLICE CONSTABLE 1790     'B' GROUP

ATTERCLIFFE POLICE STATION



At 8.00am on Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at Attercliffe Police

Station, for the semi final between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham

Forest Football Club, to be held at Hillsborough, Sheffield.

From Attercliffe Police Station we went to West Bar Police Station for briefing

at 9.00am.     At 10.00am I commenced duties at the Midland Railway Station,

supervising Liverpool supporters arriving by train onto awaiting PSVs.

At 1.30pm, in company with Police Constable 492 Tranter, I escorted Liverpool

fans on a PSV to the ground, disembarking at the Leppings Lane end, to go into

the ground.     From there I went to the rear of the North Stand within the ground

to stand by and await the arrival of my supervisor, Police Sergeant 840 Wright.

There we were on standby until approximately 2.40pm, when a radio message was

received from ground control, informing us that there was trouble outside the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.     We were directed to attend there.

We approached the Leppings Lane area via the rear North Stand passageway.

Having exited from the passageway into the area of Gate A, I could see that

there was a large crowd outside the turnstiles and the gate, causing the gate

to buckle and bend under the pressure of the people outside.       It was decided

not to open this gate, because it was thought the people at the front would be

trampled on.    We then went to the rear of the West Stand to the turnstiles,

numbers 1 - 1 6 .   We could see several people climbing over the turnstile

roofing from outside the ground, gaining access into the ground, assisted by a

Police Inspector, who was standing on top of the turnstile roof.

The area behind the turnstile was not very busy and it was obvious that people

were having difficulty in getting through the turnstiles.     I could see through

the turnstiles and realised that there were several hundred outside the ground

trying to get in.    Each turnstile was blocked, people were being pushed up

against the turnstile gate, making it inoperative.     Seme people got through and




Cont/.
were obviously injured and in a great deal of pain.     I helped them to one side

and tried to free one of the turnstiles, which was jammed.     People were

screaming and shouting for help, requesting the gates to be opened.

In an effort to get outside the ground, I followed Police Sergeant Wright

towards Gate C, which was open.     I lost sight of him and my other colleagues

and returned to the rear of Gate B, which was closed.     There I helped a man who

had some abdominal injury, moving him to a safe place where he was left sat

down.     I looked towards the centre tunnel, which gives access to the Leppings

Lane terracing.     I could see there was a large crowd in an arc around the

entrance trying to get through the tunnel.     I never saw any police officers or

stewards in that area.

I looked towards Gate C and saw a steady stream of people entering the ground,

moving into the area behind the West Stand.     Most walked straight forward

towards the tunnel.     An Inspector, who was stood near Gate C and the turnstiles

adjacent to that gate, indicated and shouted an order to open Gate B, which I

was next to.     A steward was on the gate and refused to open it.   Another man, I

believe to be a steward came up, was given the keys to the gate and unlocked

it.     With the assistance of Police Constable 2236 Brown and Police Constable

1632 Smith, I pulled one side of the gate open, allowing fans through into the

ground.     The gate had been buckling under the pressure of the people outside

and I realised there were a lot of people about to come through.      I therefore

pushed against the crowd to slow the entry down, preventing anyone from falling

down and being pushed.     Several people lost their footwear, which was placed to

one side and left.     In the region of 100 people entered the ground through this

gate which was open for between 30 seconds and one minute, to the best of my

recollection. Mast of the people who entered the ground either went to the

programme seller's van nearby or towards the entrance to the Leppings Lane

terracing by the North Stand.     Access could not be gained to the central

terracing this way unless people climbed over the barriers and the walls.      Once

the gate was closed I went to find Police Sergeant Wright, who was outside the




Cont/.
turnstiles.

At approximately 3.05pm a radio message was received frcm the ground control

directing all personnel onto the pitch in front of the Leppings Lane terracing.

I was unsure as to why they directed us there.     Our serial   regrouped and

followed Police Sergeant Wright to the right of the Leppings Lane terracing

towards the South Stand.     We went through a gate under the police control box

and went through a passageway in the West Stand.      Frcm there we went onto the

perimeter track towards the front of the Leppings Lane terrace.      As we did, our

passage was blocked by Liverpool supporters, who were angry and trying to

prevent me frcm getting onto the pitch. I pushed them aside and followed Police

Sergeant Wright.

Once on the pitch I saw several people climbing over the perimeter fencing at

the centre of the Leppings Lane terracing and I could see alot of people being

crushed up against the fence within the centre pen.      Due to this I followed

Police Sergeant Wright through Gate 2 of the perimeter fencing, entering into

the Leppings Lane terracing, South pen.     As we did our access was again blocked

by fans desperate to get out.     Once inside I made iny way to the back of the

terracing, where there is a gate in the fencing which divides the two pens.

There were several supporters stood there blocking the pen making no attempt to

leave the Centre South pen into the South pen, which was nowhere near as

congested as the Centre pen.     I shouted to them to move into the South pen,

most of the supporters refused point blank, others moved in slowly either by me

pushing them or of their own free will.     Whilst I was there several fans came

up to me.     They were obviously drunk and shouting obscenities regarding the

police and criticising the police for putting them in the smaller end of the

ground.     A drunken youth came towards me shouting "It's your fault you

bastards".     He then hit me with his fist on the right side of iny face.   He was

above me and I was being pushed by other supporters.     I therefore hit him on

his left arm with iny police truncheon.    At this he stumbled into the crowd and

I lost sight of him.




Cont/.
My attention was drawn to a young girl who was crying.        She had obviously ccme

frcm the centre of the Centre South pen and was very distressed.        I escorted

her through the gate and left her in the South pen.    The supporters around me

did not help at all and would not move through the gate.       By this time the gate

had once again been locked and the supporters would not listen to me.          I could

see several people climbing into the West Stand seating area above.          I tried to

stop them, because they were falling and injuring people below.        I was pushed

away and had no option but to leave them.    A   man came up to me, stated he                wasa

Merseyside police officer.    He took over from me   trying to tell the        crowd to

pass through the gate into the South pen.    The fans were still insistent on

stopping in the Centre pen, ignoring both the requests of myself and this other

man.     I noticed numerous persons within the crowd were drunk, seme had

difficulty standing, either through intoxicants or because of the fact they had

been involved in the crush below.

I then went down the terracing towards the centre of the Centre South pen.               I

stopped when I reached a number of bodies on     the floor.     I saw that     within the

pile of bodies a barrier had fallen over and     had been 'uprooted from       the

concrete.    There were a large number of bodies, mostly lying on top of each

other.    I saw people climbing on top of the bodies trying to climb over the

perimeter fence.     I looked down towards the fence and saw several officers

assisting injured people by the fence.     I saw three or four officers stood at

the front of the bodies and realised that there were a large number of bodies

on top of each other.    I therefore concentrated on the people immediately at my

feet.

The crowd behind me were shouting abuse at me and the police in general,

complaining about being in the small end of the ground.        I told them to be

quiet and help me, but several just stood and watched.        I saw one person lying

on the floor who was aged about 15/16 years.     He wasn't breathing at all so I

tried to revive him using mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart massage.            I

was constantly being pushed by people who were in a panic, trying to get to the




Cont/.
' front.    Several fans were assisting with the injured and the dead by taking

 them towards the side fence and the front perimeter fence.      Three fans assisted

 me and took the youth who I had been trying to revive to a break in the fence.

 I returned to the bodies and saw one youth lying in amongst them who had a lot

 of colour to his face and looked as though he was still alive.      I pulled him

 free and checked for a pulse.     I then gave mouth to mouth resuscitation.

                      I turned him onto his side and asked people to assist me to

 carry him out.     I did not get an immediate response and whilst waiting for

 scmeone to help me the youth lapsed into unconsciousness and stopped breathing.

 There was nowhere to put him down so, with the help of two men, I carried him

 out to a break in the fence.     I returned to the bodies to find one lying on his

 side.     He was not breathing and I turned him onto his back

                                   I                  attempted to get a clear

 airway.     I then gave mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart massage.

                                         I turned him over onto his front and

 together with two fans I carried him to the front.     As I did a fan who was

 blind drunk grabbed hold of me, causing me to lose iny balance.     He then began

 pushing me and swearing at me, shouting various obscenities.      I tried to ignore

 him and continued to the fence with the injured youth.     Once at the fence I

 carried him through the fence and onto the pitch, where again I cleared his

 airway.    He had stopped breathing and I again gave mouth to mouth

 resuscitation.    He never regained consciousness and after five minutes of no

 response, no heart beat, no pulse, he was covered up.    A man who stated he was

 a doctor pulled me away and said "give it up".    He agreed that he was dead.

 I left him covered up with my police anorak and then returned to the fence,

 which I had entered onto the pitch by.    With the assistance of officers and

 fans I kicked a hole in the fencing, making a large gap of about six feet,

 enabling us to receive bodies frcm inside the terracing.    There I stood on the

 wall, taking hold of the bodies being brought to me by the fans and passed the

 bodies to people behind, mainly police personnel and ambulancemen.

 About 20 or so were passed out, of which only two were definitely alive.



 Cont/.
Another officer, whom I recognised as a West Bar officer, stood on the wall

with me and helped me to carry the bodies over the wall.     The flow of bodies

began to slow down, a youth who looked alive, was passed to me.       I stayed with

him going onto the pitch, where I gave mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart

massage.    There was no response whatsoever.   An ambulanceman took him away

towards an ambulance with the assistance of two Liverpool fans.       He was

obviously dead.    I then remained on the pitch assisting with the removal of

bodies from the Leppings Lane end to the Spion Kop and North Stand corner.

During this period, I was abused and pushed by several supporters, even when I

was helping injured people.    This mostly took place whilst I was on the

terraces.     I do not remember of any particular incident whichoccurred       on the

pitch whilst I was assisting the injured.

Whilst on the terracing it was clearly obvious that a large proportion of the

Liverpool supporters were either drunk or had been drinking.     There was a heavy

smell of vcmit, both at the top of the terracing and in the centre where the

people had died.     I would not be able to recognise any of the deceased who I

tried to help.     I can only remember one of them being 15/16years    with dark

hair, the others were what I would describe as       'youths'.

On the pitch there were several incidents where Liverpool supporters tried to

argue with police officers about the allocation of tickets, putting them in the

smaller end of the ground.

At approximately 5.00pm or when the fans were let out of the ground, we

received an order to go to Penistone Road North and supervise the Liverpool

supporters.    I had to find articles of my uniform, therefore I was delayed and

made my way up Penistone Road North by myself.     As I did I stopped a fight

involving several Liverpool fans and two Sheffield boys who were simply walking

through the crowd asking the score.    Once on Penistone Road North I met up with

Police Sergeant Wright at the PSVs, where we waited to escort the Liverpool

fans back to the Midland Station.     I was not required, so I returned to the

ground, where I saw Police Sergeant Gutcher, the other serial Sergeant.         I

reported to him the events which I had seen and been involved with.     From there

I returned to West Bar to eventually go off duty at Attercliffe Police Station

at 7.15pm that day.

Throughout the day I did not have possession of a police issue radio.    Also, I

cannot ccmment on the actions of any stewards, since I did not pay any

particular attention to them, except the one involved in the incident at Gate B.

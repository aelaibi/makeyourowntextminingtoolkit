At 8.00 a.m. on Saturday the 15th of April 1989, I came on duty at Rawmarsh Police

Station, along with other 'C2' Officers in preparation for the Hillsborough FA Cup

Semi-Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.




We were then conveyed by bus to Hillsborough Football Ground where we had the preÂ­

match briefing and I was informed that my serial was Serial Number 43 and my Serial

Sergeant was P.S.     1253 Graham.       Our duties were to be positioned on the Halifax

Road area and to observe the arrival of fans, that is Liverpool fans who would be

arriving at that location by coach and private vehicles.




At approximately      11.15 a.m. we were all in position on Halifax Road awaiting the

arrival    of the   travelling   Liverpool     fans.       There were already several vehicles

arriving at Halifax Road,        containing Liverpool fans, who began to make their way

into the town.        We had been instructed to remain in the Halifax Road area from

that time until approximately 3-00 p.m. where we were then supposed to make our way

down to the Claywheels Traffic Depot in order to take our meal.                  After only a short

time   the number and density of Liverpool fans arriving began to increase and by

midday there    was   a' constant   stream of both         traffic    arriving   and Liverpool      fans

walking by foot towards the town.          However, it became apparent by the condition of

some of the Liverpool fans getting out of private vehicles, that they had obviously

been drinking on their journey towards Sheffield, and whilst walking up and down

Halifax Road, I noticed in both several vehicles, namely cars and                  light     Vans that

there were numerous empty bottles and beer cans.                It did seem though that most of

the    travelling   Liverpool    fans   were   in   high    spirits    and   anticipating    what       was

expected to be a classic football match.


                                                                                      continued..../

At approximately 1.00 p.m. that date, I was directed with other Officers to attend

a disturbance off Kilner Way, which is a short distance further down Halifax Road

and    travelling towards the Hillsborough Ground.                 On my arrival at Kilner Way,                  I

could see that it was a shotting complex with large grassed lawned areas                                  facing

directly onto the road.            I could see several hundred Liverpool fans gathered in the

area who were either standing or lying on the ground and the vast majority of these

were drinking out of cans.              There were dozens of empty cans strewn all over the

grassed area and several fans were emerging from the supermarket at that location

carrying    packs    of    canned    beer.     There    appeared   to   be    no    real    problem      at   that

location and we resumed back to our duties on Halifax Road.




At approximately 3-00 p.m.           that date, our serial was directed to go to Claywheels

Lane   Depot     to have    our meal break.       As we walked down Halifax Road towards                      the

Hillsborough Ground there were still fans arriving by private vehicles and large

groups    of youths running down to the ground,                 obviously aware that          the match was

commencing.       I could see that many of these youths who were running down the road

towards the ground were worse the wear for drink and were shouting loudly, chinting

football slogans,         etc.     I could see that several youths running down towards the

ground were still carrying cans of beer in their hands.




At approximately 3-15 p.m. that date, we arrived as a serial at Claywheels Lane and

we were immediately met by a Police Inspector who ran from the building towards us

and instructed us to immediately go to the ground as there was a large scale Public

Order situation.          We were conveyed immediately by Police Transit and arrived just

outside    the    ground    a    few moments   later,    near    to the      Leppings      Lane   end.         On




                                                                                            continued..../

arrival at the Leppings Lane entrance of the ground, I could see large numbers of

uniformed Officers              stood outside       the main gates.                Our       serial      then made     its way

towards         the    Consetina    gates     at     the    Leppings         Lane    end       behind      the     West   Stand

enclosure area.           As we moved towards the Consetina Gates I could                                see     an   ambulance

ahead of us with               the doors    open and a gentleman being attended to by ambulance

personnel.            I could also see several people sat down on the floor rested against

the walls adjacent to the Consetina Gates who appeared to be very badly shaken and

several of whom were bleeding.                     At this stage,            I still presumed there had been a

large scale Public Order disturbance and that people had been fighting.                                               As I made

my way through the open Consetina Gate,                       I walked into the enclosure area directly

behind the West Stand.              I was confronted by large groups of Liverpool fans running

out   of    the       enclosure    area     into    Leppings       Lane      who    were       screaming       and     shouting

obscenities at us, such as:                  "IT'S YOUR FUCKING FAULT YOU'VE KILLED EM."                                I could

see dozens of people lying on the floor being attended to by ambulance personnel,

Police     Officers       and    other     Liverpool       fans.        On    looking        to    the    floor,      I saw   an

elderly gentleman who I would estimate was between 50 and 60 years of age, lying on

his   back,       face   up.      Without     even    having       to    check      the man,           I realised      only by

looking at him that he was in fact dead.                      At this stage I still had no idea of what

had actually occurred,              but made my way          through the enclosure area to the centre

tunnel which           leads    directly onto        the   terraced area.                There were         dozens of fans

running out of this tunnel towards us who were still shouting obscenities at us,

but for what reason I just did not know at that time.                               As I entered the tunnel, the

smell      in    the   air was     one     of what     I could only describe                      as   'Death'.       It smelt

putrid, a mixture of vomit, alcohol and dead bodies.                                As I went through the tunnel,

I could see people being carried out in semi-conscious and conscious states, but I

continued to make my way            towards the front hoping that I could assist with what

ever was happening.          On entering the terraced area, I could see straight onto the

pitch   and   realised     that   the   match   had    been    abandoned.      There   were    hundreds       of

people, Liverpool fans, Ambulance men and Police Officers all over the grassed area

and the perimeter track.            Fans   in the terraced area were still running past me,

through into the tunnel and were still shouting obscenities and people continually

shouted at me:        "IT'S YOUR FAULT, YOU'VE KILLED EM."                  As I made my way through

these   people    towards     the    front    perimeter       fence   of   that    terraced    area     I    was

confronted by a pile of tangled bodies.               The bodies were some five to six people in

depth covering the whole inner perimiter fence of that terrace.                         The body which I

saw on the top was a young man who I would say was between 25 and 30 years of age.

He was lying with his back down onto this pile of bodies facing upwards and again

without even having to touch the man or try to assist him, I knew he was dead.                               At

this stage the only thought that came into my mind was that I knew that there must

be at least 50 to 100 dead people and that if he was dead at the top the people

underneath him would be dead as well.              My only thought at that time was to try and

get   to the bottom to try and assist anybody who might still be alive underneath.

Together with other Officers who were also in attendance in the terraced area,                                 I

began   frantically      removing    the bodies    trying      to find anybody who was              alive.     I

could   see   there   were   numerous      personal    belongings     strewn      all over    the    terraced

area, rings,     cash,    shoes all over the place.            The smell in the air was absolutely

disgusting, but all I could think was,                'get to the people underneath'.               I removed

about a dozen and a half bodies, but none of them were alive.                        I did manage to get

one youth out who had been trapped in the centre,                     almost like a totem pole from

his waist down and when I eventually released him from the pile of bodies, he was

unable to move his legs.            Together with other Officers, we had formed a chain to

pass the bodies out through the only gate in the perimeter fence at that terraced
Continuation of statement of:                     Marcus Stanley SMITH                  Police Constable 2515




area and out         onto      the pitch where           they were being attended to by the emergency

services.         As I removed the bodies, several times I felt sharp pains on my back and

was aware that coins were being thrown at us from the Liverpool fans in the stands

above who were continually shouting obscenities towards us.                                 Once the bodies from

the terrace had been removed, we made our way onto the perimeter of the pitch and

then onto the pitch itself.                    The situation was one of total chaos.                     Together with

other Officers and Liverpool fans I then began to remove the hoardings from around

the pitch and began placing the dead and injured onto these hoardings,                                           who were

then     conveyed        across       the   pitch      to   the     other   end    of the   ground,        towards      the

Nottingham Forest fans.                At one stage an Inspector did come towards me and asked me

to    make    the    Liverpool         fans     return      back    into     the   terraced    area,       but    in    the

circumstances        that was         totally    impossible         and    totally unreasonable.               After   some

time, I heard it announced over the tanoy system that the match had been abandoned

and that it would be replayed at a later date.                               The ground then emptied in what

appeared      to be       only a matter a minutes.                  I do     recall prior to the announcement

coming over         the    tanoy      system    that     together with other          Officers,      I    had formed a

cordon across the centre of the pitch'to keep the two sections of rival fans apart.

The    situation         was   very    frightening          to   say the     least, because     at       that     stage   I

anticipated that the Liverpool fans in the .stands above would invade the pitch and

attack       us    and    I    realised        that    we    were    heavily       out-numbered,         but    once    the

announcement came over the tanoy system that the match would be abandoned the crowd

seemed to leave with little or no trouble and after a few minutes the ground was

empty.       With the other Officers in my serial, I then went to the other end of the

ground to await further instructions.




I would estimate that this time it was approximately 4.30 to 5-00 p.m.                                         After some



                                                                                                         continue

time    we   were   instructed      to return back       to our position          on Halifax       Road    and we

walked back from       the ground to our previous positions.




As we walked up        Halifax Road, dozens and dozens of fans approached us asking what

had happened and       what to do regarding friends and relatives who were missing.                              All

we   could do was      instruct      them   to return     to their coaches and await               any further

information     which       we    might   receive.      Several     times       angry   fans     approached       us

continually     blaming      us    for what     had   happened.     As    I walked up Halifax             Road,    I

remember     passing    a    Transit      Van   which   had   the   back    doors       open.      Inside       were

approximately a dozen youths who had a table which was inside the van.                               I couldn't

believe it, but all these youths were sat drinking cans of beer and were obviously

now very drunk.        In fact, if I remember correctly these youths were in fact playing

cards and drinking.              I couldn't believe that after what had happened that people

could be so callous, but at that stage there were so many emotions going through my

mind I couldn't really think about anything anyway.                        Eventually we arrived at our

pre-match     positions      and    basically     controlled      the    flow   of   traffic,      that    is    the

Liverpool fans as they made their way along Halifax Road and back towards the motor

way and home.




At approximately 6.00 p.m.            that date,      the bulk of the liverpool fans had left the

Sheffield area and we began to walk back down towards Claywheels Lane.




At approximately 6.30 p.m.             that date, we were stood down.                We were then conveyed

again   by   coach   to Rawmarsh Police           Station     and at 7*30 p.m.          that     date,    we were

dismissed from duty.

                                                                                                continued..../

 In his response to a question from Frank Field yesterday, the Home Secretary
 appeared to give an undertaking that copies of documentary material already made
 public would be placed in Liverpool library, if this had not already been done.

 2. In his statement to the House in February, the Home Secretary undertook to
 make public the material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in the course of
 his scrutiny, other than that already in the public domain,by placing copies in the
 House library. This has been done, with copies of the police statements also being
 sent to the Family Support Group in Liverpool. This may have led to a
 misunderstanding over where copies have been sent.

3. We no longer hold the documentation, which remains the property of the
South Yorkshire Police archive, to where the originals have been returned. To
recall and make further copies of this documentation will be a large and time-
consuming task (and we have no budget to cover the considerable cost of the
photocopying).

4. Before we contact the South Yorkshire Police and request that they submit all
the documentation to us again, I should be grateful if you would confirm whether
the Home Secretary intended going beyond his original undertaking given to the
House in February, and that he does indeed wish us to copy all the material to the
central library in Liverpool.

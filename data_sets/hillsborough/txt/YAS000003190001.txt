                  7 September 1993


                  Information for Mr Andrew Callaghan
                  Dibb, Lupton, Broomhead



                  Total number of staff attending at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989
                  (SYMAPS staff only, not including Control and Liaison staff) was 74.

                  We are aware staff have had sick leave for reasons of stress and
                  associated illnesses since the disaster, but we are unable to directly
                  attribute this to the disaster itself.

                  Many staff have been unwilling to admit that a problem exists and
                  certain staff have only recently realised they have a problem which
                  could be attributed to the disaster.

                  Almost all the above staff, plus a number from Control, were counselled
                  for stress after the event.

                   Unfortunately, Occupational Health do not have any record of the staff
                   who attended for counselling. We have contacted them and have been told
                   this.

                   This therapy was on a purely voluntary basis and staff attended as they
                   wished; any follow up treatment was from other agencies, ie own GP or
                   referral to hospital outpatient department.

                   1 enclose, for your information, a full listing of names of all staff
                   involved in the disaster.

               Dear Don

               Judicial Review of

               Michel Kallipetis has amended the draft affidavit and I enclose a
               copy.   You will see that there are four places in paragraph 18
               where numbers need to be inserted and I should be grateful if, as
               a matter of urgency you could let me know what those numbers are.

               I hope to be in a position to arrange for you to swear the
               affidavit at the end of next week and I should be grateful if you
               could let me know if there is likely to be any difficulty
               concerning your availability.

               Yours sincerely

          I,      Albert Page of                         , Rotherham,     make oath and say as
          follows:
          1.        I am   the   Chief   Executive of        South    Yorkshire           Metropolitan
™                  Ambulance and Paramedic Service which was granted NHS Trust
G                  status on 1 April 1992.        Prior to that I had, since 1982, been
                   the Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for South Yorkshire
                   Metropolitan Ambulance Service (which was then part of Trent
                   Regional Health Authority).


          2.       X swear this affidavit in opposition to the applications for
                   Judicial Review of the inquests of six of the victims of the
                   Hillsborough    Disaster     which      took   place      on     15    April        1989.
                   Except where otherwise appears,             this affidavit is based on
                   matters within my own knowledge, information and belief.



                                                                  r :\WP\CAI.LAOHA\STRINQ01 -KFF\01.09. 93\EM\V4

 I am a Justice of the Peace, a Fellow of the Ambulance Service
 Institute, and a member of the Association of Chief Ambulance
Officers.      Since    1986,   I have       been     an    instructor           at     the
National Health Service Training establishment at Harrogate on
courses for senior ambulance officer development,                          I recently
acted as chairman of the inquiry into the failure of a newly
installed computer system at the London Ambulance Service.


I have read the memorial and supporting documents that are
exhibited to the affidavit of                                     There are some
matters in the memorial which, due to the fact that they have
been paraphrased,       are not completely accurate;                  I am anxious
that any incorrect impression be rectified.                         X restrict my
comments to matters which I consider to be relevant to t h e ^
ambulance service; these comments largely relate to the claims
concerning the involvement of the ambulance service, a lack of
care and the cut-off point of 3.15 pm which are referred to in
paragraph 5 of the memorial.
                               if        ■


In paragraph 9 of the memorial, it is suggested that, in his
inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor'recognised that a quicker response
to the emergency by the police to ensure the attendance of the
emergency services might have saved at least some lives, and
that these findings raised the further question of whether the
crush injuries had been aggravated by a lack of care.                                      1
presume that the memorial is referring to paragraph 252 of L o r d ^
Justice Taylor’s Interim Report (which I refer to below).                             This
question was very fully canvassed before Lord Justice Taylor's
Inquiry.    Arguments were submitted to the Inquiry by Leading
Counsel    for SYMAS,    and by Leading Counsel                 for the police.
Witnesses were cross examined on this point at length,                                 and
after hearing all the evidence and all the submissions. Lord
Justice    Taylor   concluded    that        "it    is     unlikely          that      the
emergency services (ambulance and fire) could have saved lives
if they had been called more promptly, but it is possible".
This conclusion followed that in paragraph 251 as to the effect
if any that an earlier call for doctors and nurses in the crowd


                                 2             f :\VP\CALLAflHA\3TRING01. AFFAOl..09.93\EM\V4
might have had, namely that "probably there was little that
could have been achieved ... but there were marginal cases
where earlier attention might have made a difference."                                                      Both
these conclusions are to be read in the context of Lord Justice
Taylor's finding that the disaster occurred,                                   and the fatal
injuries had been suffered by 15,06 when the police recognised
the fact and stopped the match.


There is now produced and shown to me marked "API" a true copy
of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report.                         I wish to refer to

                       promptly,      that it brought                                  appropriate
                       equipment          and       that               their                 personnel

                       nature and extent of the crushing, the
                       time the police rescue began and the
                       pathetically          short                period                  for            which
                       those unable to breathe could survive,
                       it is improbable that quicker recourse
                       to    the emergency                 services                     would have
                       saved more lives.

Thfl-BMJ A rticle of 30 November 1991


                               3            F i \W T \C W .tA C H A \3 T R lN G 0 1 . A F F \ 0 1 . 0 9 . 9 3 \E H \V 4
  Paragraph 10 of the memorial refers to the B m j article of 30
  November 1991*    I saw that article in early 1992 and I wrote
  to the editor of the BMJ in relation to factual inaccuracies.
 There is now produced and shown to me marked "AP2" a true copy
 of my letter to the editor of the British Medical Journal dated
 29 January 1992.


 The BMJ article shows that no one who suffered a cardiac arrest
 and was taken to hospital actually survived.                           Of the 14 victims
 who suffered a cardiac arrest and were taken to hospital, five
 were dead on arrival, resuscitation was attempted but failed
 on   seven of them,   and two were resuscitated                                   and            taken to
 intensive care but then died.      The article does not support the
 conclusion that the Applicants seek to draw.


 The BMJ article    also points out    that most                       of         the           seriously
 injured arrived at the hospital within the first 30 minutes.
 I believe that this not only shows the rapid response of the
ambulance service, but also indicates that the ambulance crews
were selecting the more seriously injured victims and taking
them to hospital first.


The suggestion that a jury might take a different view of the
two doctors' evidence gives me some disquiet.                               The two doctors
gave interviews to the press at the time and subsequently.
They were the only two eyewitnesses to make any criticism ofm
the work done by the emergency services at the ground.                                                      These®
criticisms   were   aired   fully   before        Lord               Justice                      Taylor's
Inquiry and found to be groundless.          In particular. Dr Ashton
had stood and watched the scenes on the pitch but made no
attempt to go and assist, although he apparently appreciated
there were many injured and dying persons in need of aid, until
the tannoy announcement at just before 15.30.                           Moreover he told
Lord Justice Taylor that he could not say that any lives would
have been saved if the emergency services had arrived earlier.

 Both of these doctors' criticisms were found to be without any
 factual basis when the detailed evidence was examined.                                                                   It may
 be, and certainly Dr Ashton conceded this in terms, that what
 they said at the time was merely their impressions gained from
 a limited vantage point.              They both conceded however when faced
with the facts as recorded on film and the SYMAS records, that
their criticisms were based upon limited information.                                                              What use
to a jury their evidence could now be must be questionable.
If     their evidence          is   the       same as         it was                    to          Lord Justice
Taylor’s inquiry,             it has already been shown to be based on
incomplete and inaccurate information.                                    If their evidence is
to     be    different    the       jury will       be           faced                with              conflicting
evidence from the same witness,                     and as the court well knows
that is not conducive to arriving at the truth,                                                   in order that
this Honourable Court may judge the strength of the criticisms
now being advanced by the two Liverpool doctors I shall deal
with each in turn. ^


     Phillips                                   #

Paragraph 12 ofthe memorial refers to the evidence of Dr Glyn
Phillips*        There        is now produced and shown tome marked "AP3"
a true copy of the transcript of the evidence that Dr Phillips
gave to the Taylor inquiry which Counsel will refer to in more
detail at the hearing of the applications for Judicial Review.
As far as the specific claims made in the memorial in relation
to Dr Phillips' evidence are concerned:
12.1        Neither   his      statement         nor         the             transcript                             of           his
            evidence demonstrate that lives could have been saved
            by what the memorial refers to as                                     "proper emergency
            help".    In fact the opposite is the case and I would
            draw attention to the                following                      extracts                         from               Dr
            Phillips’ statement:-
            Page 9       "I    could      not    find           anybody                      seriously                           ill
                       needing help.             Just dead or seemingly minor
                       injuries and shaken people."
            Page 11    "Remembering the fan we had                                         resuscitated I
                       gave a policeman my name and address.                                                           I felt


                                          5            F i \W P \ C A L L A G H » \ 3 T R I K 0 0 1 . » F F \ 0 1 . 0 9 . 9 3 \ E H \ V 4
                        it very unlikely that he would have survived
                        and reconciled myself by the fact that if he
                        had he would have been brain damaged."
 12.2   His statement makes no reference to his asking for a
        ventilator.          It does, however, refer to his asking for
        a defibrillator.              Lord Justice Taylor’s Interim Report
         (at     paragraph           298)      states             "I           am             satisfied                            on
        overwhelming           evidence            that       to          attempt                       to            use              a
        defibrillator on the pitch with people milling about
        would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk of
        injury from the electric charge”.
12.3    I gave evidence to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry,                                                                          as
        did     some    of      my      officers,          as           to           the             effects                       of
        attempting        to    use      a     defibrillator                          in          crowded                       and^l
        confused conditions.                 In particular, we had in mind the
        situation at Hillsborough as shown on the video film.
        In     short    our        evidence          was          that                the              use              of            a
        defibrillator was discouraged unless the operator had
        a clear working area wi£h no risk of contact between
        the     patient      and      any      other        person,                      and             where                 the
        operator could with confidence diagnose an arrythmic
        beat.       The      use      o£' a        defibrillator                            in          the             wrong
        circumstances could-easily kill the patient,                                                                a more
        detailed argument against the use of a defibrillator
        appears in paragraph 13 below.
12.4    Dr Phillips claimed to have been given an empty o x y g e n ^
        cylinder.       This is dealt with in paragraphs 14 to 16 of
        Appendix       6 of Lord Justice Taylor's                                        Interim                     Report
        which concludes that Dr Phillips may have been mistaken
        as to the cylinder of which he complains being empty.
12.5    The last sentence of paragraph 12 of the Memorial is
        not     borne     out      by        the    evidence.                             There                  was              no
        significant lack of equipment, let alone such as would
        have contributed to the deaths of some of the deceased.


There is now produced and shown to me marked "AF4" an extract
from the submissions made to Lord Justice Taylor on behalf of

the ambulance service.         They respond to criticisms made by Dr
Ashton     ("Dr A ” ) and Dr Phillips           ("Dr P").                              The            detailed
response      to    Dr   Phillips'       complaint           about                 a         lack              of           a
defibrillator appears on pages 4 to 6 of AP4.


Dr Ashtpn
The memorial's account of Dr Ashton's evidence is misleading
and fails to take account of what he said in giving evidence
to the Taylor Inquiry.         It also fails to take account of the
findings of Lord Justice Taylor.             The memorial claims that by
3.35 pm only one ambulance had arrived at Leppings Lane.  In
cross examination Dr Ashton accepted that the video evidence
showed that by 3.30 pm at least four ambulances had attended
at the back of Leppings Lane. There is now produced and shown
to me marked "APS" a true copy of the transcript of Dr Ashton's
evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and I would refer to the page
numbered 121.       I would refer to the first four pages of exhibit
AP4 which deals with each of Dr Ashton's complaints.
                               a*■/

In paragraph 296 of the Interim Report,                           Lord Justice Taylor
stated - "The only attack on SYMAS came from two Liverpool
doctors.    One claimed that ambulances did not arrive swiftly
or with sufficient equipment and that there was a lack of
triage.     He was proved to be wrong in all three respects.
Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April
when he said more lives could have been saved if staff and
equipment had arrived earlier.             Apart from being proved wrong
in fact as to the times of arrival of ambulances, he conceded
in evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives could
have   been        saved.     His        comments           on            television                              were
irresponsible".


In the circumstances,         it is clearly wrong to conclude,                                                           as
paragraph 13(h) of the memorial does, that Dr Ashton's evidence
raises the issue that lives might have been saved by a more
timely response.

         17.    Paragraph 14 of the memorial refers to Mr Eccleston's evidence.
                Mr Eccleston's statement suggests that he treated only one
                patient who had suffered a cardiac arrest but he did                                              not
                survive.    Nothing in his evidence suggests that any more lives
                would have been saved if matters had been handled differently.
                His claims of lack of equipment are refuted by the Taylor
                Interim    Report,      and   his   comment        about         the      "Major          Medical
                Disaster Team" are dealt with on page 2 of exhibit "AP4".

        18.     It is clear that, with the possible exception of one point, to
                which I refer in paragraph 24 below, Dr Phillips, Dr Ashton and
                Mr Eccleston      are not       able     to   give evidence                 that        directly
               relates to the deaths of any of the six victims whose inquests
               are the subject of these proceedings.                       Whilst I do u n d e r s t a n d ®
               the feelings of the families of the six victims,                                     I am also
               concerned    for       the welfare       of    my    officers           and       men.           This
               Honourable court ought to be aware that the events of that day
               had a considerable effect upon the ambulance men and women who
               attended the ground.           Trained §nd experienced in all sorts of
               emergencies as they are, what they had to endure that day took
               a toll     upon    their      physical     and      mental        welfare            that       bare
               statistics hardly begin to describe.                     Out of a total of [                            ]
               ambulance men and women who attended this disaster,                                  [      ] have
               had periods       of   sick    leave in excess of                   [             ] days          for
               illnesses directly connected with the Hillsborough disaster.
                [     ] have received some form of therapy.                               Great care w a s *
               taken to help those who were called to give evidence and thus
               had to relive the events in detail.                     I do not want to labour
                                                                             t
               this point because I do sympathise with the families, and I do
               understand their desire to find out what happened.                                    The awful
               fact, however, is that where there is no direct eye witness to
               any particular person’s death, much will remain a matter of
               inference and speculation.               To hold the equivalent of another
               Inquiry will not reveal to the Applicants any more than what
               is already known, but it will have a devastating effect upon
               those who may be called to give evidence again some five years
               later (by the time another Inquest could be arranged).                                          If I

         believed that some useful purpose could be served,   1 would
         support such a course of action.   But I do not believe that
         another investigation would serve any purpose, and certainly
         not on the basis of the ill informed criticisms which were
         fully canvassed before Lord Justice Taylor.


19*      Paragraph 15(ii).      There is no evidence at all, and certainly
         none advanced by the Applicants in their Memorial,                                             that the
         emergency services were slow to respond to the plight of the
         injured.    SYMAS received the call for their services at 15.07,
         and the first ambulance was at the stadium at the Leppings Lane
         Entrance at 15.17, and another at the Penistone Road entrance
         at 15.17.     The only basis for the allegation in this paragraph
         is that of Dr Ashton, and his observations were refuted by the
         logs produced by SYMAS to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.                                                      The
         other wide ranging criticisms in this paragraph also emanate
         from the same witness, and were found to be unsustainable when
         the evidence of the video films and the other witnesses was
         considered.


20   *   In paragraphs 18 to 22, the ’memorial gives some detail of the
         evidence    relating   to the deaths       of       the          six victims                            whose
         inquests are     the subject of      the   applications                           for           Judicial
         Review.     I shall comment on each in turn.


         Paul Carlisle
21 .     The Applicants     have   produced   a     report            of         Dr West                     of         the
         Department of Forensic Medicine of Gu y ’s Hospital.                                                 In his
         report Dr West refers       to two different                   types of traumatic
         asphyxia.     The first type is "classic" traumatic asphyxia.                                                     He
         doesn’t give a label to the second type.


22.      Dr West states that most of the individuals who suffer from the
         classic form of traumatic asphyxia do not survive if they are
         severely affected and not rescued rapidly.




                                        9            F : \W F \ « a W 0 H A \ S T X I K G 0 1 . A F f \ 0 1 . 0 9 . 9 3 \E M \V 4
23.   Dr West’s report indicates that Paul Carlisle suffered from
      "classic"    traumatic asphyxia.    Even if he was alive after
      3.15pm it seems highly unlikely that he could have survived.


24.   The evidence indicates that Paul Carlisle was taken to the
      Leppings Lane area, perhaps about 10 minutes or so before Dr
      Ashton arrived in that area.       It does, however,             seem likely
      that Dr Ashton saw Paul Carlisle and decided that he was dead
      and that there was therefore no point in him being placed in
      an ambulance or taken to hospital.


      Ian Glover
25.   I can see nothing in the information contained in the memorial
      and its supporting documents that justifies the suggestion that^H
      Ian Glover might have survived had there been a "more timely"
      attempt at resuscitation.


      Michael Kelly                  •q fi -
26.   I can see nothing in the information contained in the memorial
      and its supporting documents that Justifies the suggestion that
      Michael Kelly's death was preventable and that he died because
      of some shortcomings in the care he received after he was
      handed over to the St John's Ambulance Service.


      Kevin Williams
27.   Dr West puts Kevin Williams        in   the category of              "classic” ^
      traumatic asphyxia, and even if he was alive after 3.15pm, it
      seems highly unlikely that he could have survived*


      Richard Jones
28.   Dr West indicates that Richard Jones suffered from 11classic"
      traumatic asphyxia, and there is nothing to indicate that he
      was alive after 3.15pm.   In the light of Dr West’s expert view,
      even if Richard Jones was alive after 3.15pm, it seems highly
      unlikely that he could have survived.




                                   10          r :VWPSCALLAGHAVSTRIHGOl..AFF\01.09. 93\EM\V4
 ES-tSH-.TQQ.tle
 The memorial does not suggest that there is any evidence that
 Mr Tootle was alive after 3.15pm.                  Furthermore, Dr West accepts
 that the evidence given to the inquest was consistent with a
 degree of "classic" traumatic asphyxia.


 Paragraph 23 (ii).             In this paragraph, the applicants repeat
 their earlier assertions but in more positive terms.                                                        There is
 no evidence to support these allegations and I respectfully ask
 the Court to reject them as a basis for granting the Applicants
 the relief they seek.                 While it is true that Lord Justice
 Taylor found that the police might have called SYMAS earlier
 if they had appreciated the true nature of the difficulties
 behind     the    goal   at     the    Leppings          Lane             end,             there               was           no
 suggestion ever made that once called,                                   SYMAS were slow to
respond*      I do not understand the basis for the assertion on
oath that "the evidence was very strong that there had been
shortcomings        in    the    response ^>f           the          emergency                        services."
Furthermore I do not understand the basis for asserting that
such shortcomings played any part at all in the causation of
any    of   the     deaths      of     the     Applicantsf                    relatives.                                More
particularly, there is no evidence to suggest that any of these
six lives         could   have       been     saved       by         more              prompt                 medical
attention.


Paragraphs 23(iii) and (iv).                  There is no evidence to support
the assertions in these paragraphs that there may have been
"some failure in medical attention" nor that the deaths were
preventable "by suitable emergency response".


Paragraph     24(i).         There       is    no     evidence                     to          support                    the
suggestion that the response of the emergency services was not
adequate,     and    thus there is no               basis            for an                  inquiry into
whether the deaths of any of the Applicants' relatives might
have   been   prevented         by     "more    prompt            and           adequate                      medical
intervention".        It is a fairly safe assumption that if SYMAS
had been summoned earlier then its ambulance men and women


                                        11            F : \W P \C A L L A G H A \S T R I H G 0 1 . A m o i ■ 0 9 . 9 3 \ E M \ V 4
 would have started their rescue work earlier than they were
 able.     It is arguable that they may have saved more lives had
 they been on the scene earlier, but there is no evidence at all
 to   support any suggestion that         SYMAS was                         dilatory                        in          its
 response to the emergency call:          on the contrary the facts
 demonstrate    the   swiftness    of    their            response.                                 In           those
 circumstances    I   respectfully      submit            that              the             Applicants'
 argument rests solely upon the allegations made by Dr Ashton
 and Dr Phillips.

 Mr Eccleston
 He is described by Lord Justice Taylor^ as an impressive witness
 [Appendix 6 paragraph 8 ].   Unlike Dr Ashton, Mr Eccleston went
 to lend assistance as soon as he realised that people w e r e ®
hurt.    This was when the match was stopped, namely 15.05.                                                           His
description of what he found when he arrived at the area behind
the goal was consistent with all the other evidence from the
video films and the other witnesses who gave evidence.                                                         There
is now produced to me and marked "AP6 " what 1 am informed and
believe to be a true copy of the transcript of the evidence Mr
Eccleston gave to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.                                           It is clear
that his recollection at the time when he made his statement
quite understandably was not entirely accurate as to the time
at which certain events had taken place.                   He makes no criticism
at all of the response by SYMAS.           His references to lack of
equipment are references to St John Ambulance at an early stage ^
in the proceedings, and his reference to lack of leadership are
a reference to the police actions after the match had been
stopped.      in my   respectful    submission                  the            effect                    of          his
evidence was fully considered by Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry,
and does no-t support the Applicants' case that the lives of
their relatives may have been saved.


It seems to me that the expectations of the memorialists are
unrealistic.     I can understand that each would want the best
care for members of their families.          The Taylor Interim Report
states   that   the   ambulance    service         responded                           quickly                       and


                              12           f : \ W P \C A L I A 0 H A \3 T R I t f C 1 0 1 . » F F \ 0 1 . 0 9 . 9 3 \ 2 M \W<4
       efficiently and 1 think it appropriate that                                               I quote                     from
       paragraphs 297 and 298 of that report:
         297. X find that all three of the emergency services named
              above       responded     promptly        when              alerted,                        that               they
              brought appropriate equipment and that their personnel
              operated efficiently.
         298. It       would be     unreasonable      to         expect,                    at          any           sports
              stadium, medical facilities capable of dealing with a
             major disaster such as occurred.                           To have in advance at
              the ground,         oxygen,    resuscitators, stretchers,                                                  other
             equipment and medical               staff sufficient to deal with
             over 100 casualties is not practicable. "


35.   The memorial refers to examples of "successful resuscitation"
      but the memorial puts           forward no evidence                             that anyone who
      suffered     a    cardiac    arrest    subsequently                    survived.                             On          the
      contrary, the BMJ article states that no one who arrived at
      hospital,        having     suffered   a    cardiac                  arrest,                      ultimately
                                                  ■

      survived.

              I just wanted to write a short note to say how pleased I was that the
              Hillsborough Report was so favourable with respect to SYMAS.   I know you and
              your colleagues took a good deal of criticism just after the event and I hope
              that you take some comfort from the findings, although that is difficult after
              such a terrible event.

              I do hope you and your colleagues have now come to terms with the situation
              and look forward to the future with confidence.

              Yours sincerely,




              Chairman

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - 15TH APRIL 1989




 1.   Two Liaison Officers of Station Officer rank were based inside
      Hillsborough with radio communications well before the kick off.      It
      is our normal policy to have one or both Liaison Officers at every
      match, and both attend every major game.     The Liaison Officers were
      stationed at pitch level as for major matches the Club does not
      supply the tickets for the south stand which we normally receive.        In
      addition there was a fully equipped emergency ambulance with two crew
      members at the ground and another as back up at Middlewood Ambulance
      Station, a little under one mile away.     Both ambulances were
      specifically assigned to this match; that is our usual procedure for
      major football matches at Hillsborough.


2.    The first notification received by SYMAS of any need for our
      involvement came at 1508 hours from Police Headquarters when a fleet
      of ambulances was requested to attend at the Leppings Lane entrance
      to the ground; no notification of the nature of the incident was
      received.


3.    Within 15 minutes eleven SYMAS ambulances had reached Hillsborough.
      In total forty two ambulances attended, of which thirty one were
      SYMAS vehicles and eleven came from outside areas.    Most of these
      vehicles made several trips between the ground and the Sheffield
      hospitals.   In addition further vehicles were brought in from outside
      SYMAS and were put on stand by.


4.    A Divisional Superintendent arrived on the scene before 1515 hours,
      the Deputy Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer and the Senior Duty
      Officer arrived at Hillsborough at 1523 hours and the Assistant Chief
      Metropolitan Ambulance Officer (Operations) before 1600 hours.
5.    At 1519 hours SYMAS was informed by the Police that they had told the
      Royal Hallamshire and the Northern General Hospital of the incident
      at Hillsborough.     At 1520 hours, SYMAS informed Barnsley and
      Rotherham District General Hospitals that the incident had escalated
      and at 1523 hours a Charge Nurse at the Northern General Hospital was
      verbally informed by a Leading Ambulanceman that a major incident had
      been declared.


 6.   At 1536 hours the Royal Hallamshire were asked to supply a medical
      team.   At 1538 hours the same request was made of the Northern
      General and at 1540 hours of the Barnsley District General Hospital.
      The medical teams from each of the Northern General and the Barnsley
      District General were taken to the ground by ambulance.


 7.   The major incident vehicle arrived at the ground at 1540 hours.


 8.   One hundred and seventy two casualties were taken to hospital by
      ambulance, initially to the Northern General and then to the Royal
      Hallamshire.     Two patients were taken to Barnsley District General
      Hospital.


 9.   All casualties had been removed from Hillsborough by 1620 hours.


10.   Ninety four fatalities were taken to the Medico Legal Centre in
      Sheffield, some after having been returned from the Northern General
      and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals.     The last of the fatalities left
      Hillsborough at 0528 hours on Sunday 16th April 1989.


The incident was closed at 0530 hours on Sunday 16th April 1989.

  Dear Member

  Hillsborough Disaster: Saturday 15th Aori1, 1989

  The disaster at Hillsborough was one of the most serious incidents ever
  tackled by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service. We are in
  the process of extensive debriefing and will of course co-operate fully in
  Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry.

  In the meantime, during the course of last week we thought it important for
  SYMAS to place on record some factual aspects of their involvement.
  Attached for your information is a copy of the Press Statement in question.

  I attach a copy of a letter Sir Michael has received from the Chairman of
  the Merseyside Regional Health Authority, the contents of which are self-
  explanatory. Attached also is a copy of a Press Release just issued by
  both Regional Health Authorities regarding the setting up of a joint
  conference.

  An up-to-date progress report will be made at the next meeting of the
  Authority on 8th May, 1989.

  Yours sincerely




  Regional General Manager

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989



The events at Hillsborough last Saturday were one of the most serious

disasters ever faced by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

They will be the subject of a major public enquiry.     This must limit

immediate comment.     Nevertheless, it is important for SYMAS to put the

record straight concerning some factual aspects of their involvement.



In accordance with standard procedures one SYMAS ambulance and its crew

plus two liaison officers were at the ground before the kick off.     Another

SYMAS ambulance and its crew were on stand by in the vicinity.    SYMAS

control at Rotherham were notified of the incident at 3.08 pm.    Ten further

ambulances were immediately despatched.    Two senior officers, including the

Deputy Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer, had arrived by 3.23 pm.       By

3.25 pm 12 vehicles and their crews were operational at the ground.       As

off-duty staff reported in, further vehicles were despatched and within one

hour of the incident 40 fully equipped emergency ambulances from South

Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and West Yorkshire were

operationally involved.     In this connection, SYMAS would like to place on

record its thanks for the assistance rendered by neighbouring ambulance

authorities and their crews.    The officers deployed by SYMAS included fully

trained para-medics.



The stadium was cleared of all live casualties within 75 minutes of the

initial alert.
SYMAS and its staff did everything in their power to support life after

this terrible event.   It believes its response was both speedy and

efficient.   Its officers at Hillsborough worked hard and with determination

to relieve the injured and to convey them to hospital.   It deeply regrets

the loss of life that took place and offers its sincere condolences to the

bereaved.



The Service has issued this statement to record the basic framework of the

facts concerning its response.   It will co-operate fully with Lord Justice

Taylor’s Enquiry and make available its records and staff as need be.

The tragic events of Hillsborough on Saturday have reached
out into so many peoples' lives in Merseyside, all of whom
I know will be deeply appreciative of the splendid work
carried out by the medical and ambulance services on that
distressing afternoon in Sheffield.    The dedication of the
hospital staff and the commitment of the ambulance service
has been quite outstanding.    You will know that throughout
yesterday and today the closest possible links have been
established by your colleagues and staff with Health Service
and Social Services Departments of Merseyside to provide
support and relief whenever possible to the bereaved families
and those who were injured in this very sad event.     I know
you are with us in our deep sympathy with all those who
h&ve been affected by this event.

Will you please convey to those involved the deep appreciation
of all the people of Liverpool and from the Mersey Region
of the dedication and commitment of so many people.     This,
I am sure, shows the excellence of the co-operation between
all arms and sections of the NHS.
DRAFT


JOINT STATEMENT


MERSEY AND TRENT REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES


After the recent tragic events at Hillsborough the two Regional Health

Authorities have considered how best to show respect for the bereaved.

They have determined to set up a joint conference to consider current

knowledge about the management of psychological stress after major

disasters.   It is hoped that this conference will identify ways of

improving our ability to help people traumatised by such incidents.

Senior Managers and Doctors from both Authorities will be working out

the best ways of carrying this forward.

                       Hillsborough - Inquest

                       I attended a pre-inquest review last week with my colleague,
                               I enclose a copy of     s note of the review.

                       You will see that the inquests are to resume, in a limited form,
                       on 18th April.    I have agreed with John Evans that I should
                       attend on the first day, largely to see what the format of the
                       inquests will be but that I will probably not attend thereafter
                       unless there is anything in the case summaries which suggest that
                       we ought to be present, or unless any SYMAS personnel are called
                       to give evidence.

                       I should be grateful if you could let me know if any SYMAS
                       personnel are requested to attend the inquest.

                       Yours sincerely

Police Force


The Coroner introduced Mervyn Jones who is the Assistant Chief
Constable of the West Midlands Police. He is to act as Coroner's
Officer.

The Coroner explained that the purpose of this meeting was to
explain to all interested parties his proposals in relation to
resuming the inquests and to get confirmation from the legal
representatives of the various interested parties that what he
was proposing was an acceptable way forward.

The Coroner said that he had had preliminary discussions with Mr
Fraser and Hammond Suddards about this matter and that the
meeting indicated that they thought it would be helpful to resume
the inquests.

The Coroner stressed that the fact that the meeting was being
held and that he was thinking of resuming the inquests did not
mean that the DPP had informed him of any decisions or indeed,
taken any decisions.    He e m p h a s i s e d that the DPP has not
notified him of any decision that he might be taking in this
matter.
He said that the Coroner's Officer had in fact advised him that
the DPP was not yet able to take a decision as all the paperwork
had not yet been delivered to him such that he was not yet in a
position to consider the evidence.

The Coroner said that subject to any representations that may be
made at the meeting, it was his intention to resume the inquests
shortly after Easter.  He said there was no magic in the timing.
It was just a convenient time to resume.         He said that the
present time schedule for the submission of papers to the DPP was
such that if the inquests were resumed after Easter, the papers
would not yet have been submitted in full to the DPP.             He said
that he was stressing this because he did not want people to
think that something was going on which he was not letting on.
This is not the case.   He said that his reason for revising his
opinion as to the possibility of resuming the inquests was
because he had received a letter from Miss Steel of the Steering
Committee and also a letter from Hammond Suddards.          In view of
those letters, he c o n s i d e r e d that it was a p p r o p r i a t e to
reconsider his earlier decision not to deal with the inquests
until the DPP had made a decision. He said that there were clear
advantages to the bereaved families in resuming the hearing.

The Coroner said that there were three possible scenarios for
dealing with the inquests

1.   Having considered all the paperwork and the evidence, the
     DPP decides to bring a prosecution for a major offence which
     falls under Section 16 of the Coroner’s Act.    He said that
     the only offence relevant under Section 16 is corporate
     manslaughter.

     If the DPP d e c i d e s to b r i n g such a charge, then the
     procedure under Section 16 of the Coroner's Act requires him
     to adjourn the inquests sine die pending the outcome of the
     p r o c e e d i n g s b r o u g h t by the DPP. At the end of the
     proceedings, he would then have an option to resume the
     inquests.          He said that he has in practice never resumed an
     i n q u e s t which has been adjourned under Section 16 and
     therefore, it is quite possible that at the end of the day
     he would not do so in this case.

2.   Having considered all    the paperwork and the evidence, the
      DPP decides to bring no prosecution but one or more persons
      decide to bring private prosecutions. The Coroner said that
      if that occurred, Section 16 of the Coroner's Act would
      apply with the same consequences as in 1 . (above).

3.   Having considered all the paperwork and the evidence, the
      DPP decides to bring no prosecution and no third party wants
      to take proceedings.   The result would be that the inquests
      would be resumed and completed within the ambit that the
      Coroner considered appropriate to the circumstances.
The Coroner said that if he were to resume the inquests before
the DPP had made any decision and if a Section 16 situation were
th e n to a r i s e at a s u b s e q u e n t time, as s o o n as possible
thereafter, the inquests would be resumed but purely to comply
with Section 16. The inquests would then purely be a formality.

The Coroner said that following his reconsideration of his
earlier decision not to resume the inquests until the outcome of
the DPP's investigations, he had contacted the DPP to see if he
would agree to the inquests being resumed on a limited basis.
The Coroner said that he proposed that the inquests be resumed
only for the purposes of medical evidence (ie to ascertain the
alcohol levels of the deceased) and to find out where the various
individuals were at various stages and if possible, how the
individuals got to the stadium.

The Coroner emphasised that if the inquests were resumed, what he
would not do would be to decide how and why the deceased died and
who was to blame.   He said that so far as blame was concerned,
this in any event fell outside his jurisdiction.     The Coroner
said that he certainly did not want to deal with controversial
matters because

1.   The DPP would not agree to the inquests being resumed if
     controversial matters were dealt with or if any person/
     anybody were thereby attacked/criticised.

2.   It was not in the interests of justice to deal with matters
      which would impede the DPP’s investigations or the scope of
      action which the DPP might want to take.

3.   He did not wish     to prejudice the outcome of any criminal
      proceedings which may be taken.   In any event, the bereaved
      families would not wish him to do this.

The Coroner then once again emphasised that if the inquests were
resumed, they would be of a limited nature.     He said that the
resumed inquests would be designed to be non adversarial and the
object would be to present factual evidence and not to decide how
the deaths had occurred and who was to blame.

The Coroner then went on to deal with the way that he intended to
present the evidence if the inquests were resumed.

He said that the first thing that would be dealt with was the
post mortems.  He said that he had originally intended to call a
pathologist to each of the individual inquests but he said that
there may be some individual cases where the post mortem finding
could be dealt with by way of documentary evidence.

He said that they would then deal with the alcohol level of the
various deceased. He said that all except one of the ninety five
deceased had had their alcohol levels investigated. He said that
Dr Forester who carried out the alcohol level investigations
would be present on day 1 of the resumed inquests to formally
prove his evidence for all of the ninety four deceased. However,
he said that if there was any individual case where the alcohol
level was controversial, he may then also be called at a later
date when that individual case was heard to prove his evidence.

He said that a mini inquest would be held for each of the ninety
five individuals who had died.

The West Midlands Police Force were preparing folders for each of
the deceased.   These were not yet complete because when the
disaster occurred, the first priority was to deal with the
deceased as individual human beings and allow their families to
take them away to bury them etc.   Then, Lord Justice Taylor was
appointed to carry out the enquiry and wanted to start quickly.
Therefore, a major effort was undertaken to service that public
enquiry.  At that stage, the Coroner said that he had said that
he would want all the necessary information before him in due
course but he did not insist that the information that he
required was put together first.    After the publication of the
interim report, the matter was then referred to the DPP and the
Coroner instructed all available manpower to assist the DPP.   He
had realised that the preparation of the documentation that he
required would have to come later.

He said that the folder for each of the individuals would contain
a summary by one of the officers of the West Midlands Police
which will summarise factually the evidence of the various
witnesses.   He said that it was his intention to present that
summary to the court and to read the files for each individual.
He said that he intended to circulate the summaries before the
inquests so that the various legal representatives would have
copies and they would then be able to let him know if anything
contained in the summaries was not clear or needed elaboration.
Then, if necessary, the police officer who had prepared that
summary could be called or indeed the appropriate witness to read
the whole or part of his statement on that point.

The Coroner emphasised that under no circumstances, would any
officer of the South Yorkshire Police be called.  He said that
this was impossible bearing in mind the limitations he had
outlined.

He said that the officers of the West Midlands Force would
explain the identification procedures and would make use of plans
for the purposes of establishing where any particular person was
at a given moment.   He said that in view of legal difficulties,
it had been decided not to use video or photo/video stills.

Mr Fraser of the Steering Committee then assked the Coroner about
the timing of the issuing of the summaries.     He explained that
the solicitors representing the various families would want to go
through the summaries with their clients and will need time to
notify Mr Jones' officers of any questions that they have.
The Coroner said that he was well aware that the earlier the
summaries were released, the easier it would be.      However, he
asked Mr Fraser to bear in mind that he would need to read all of
the summaries first.   However, he assured Mr Fraser that the
summaries would be released as soon as possible.     He said that
that was the best that he could do.   He also asked Mr Fraser to
bear in mind the limitations he had previously outlined.       He
again emphasised that the summaries were designed purely to
present factual evidence.

Mr Fraser asked the Coroner how far in terms of time did he
anticipate that the summaries would go.

The Coroner said that the summaries would at least go up to the
point where the bodies were taken to the temporary mortuary but
probably up to the point of identification.     He said that the
objective of the summaries was to trace the whereabouts of each
individual from the time when he or she left home on that day to
the time when he or she was taken to the temporary mortuary.

The Coroner said that documents called Anacapes would be produced
at the inquests.   He said that these were in effect charts.   He
said that copies of these would be available at the inquests
although he did not expect that they would be able to circulate
them to the various legal representatives.

The Coroner again said that it would be unreasonable to expect Dr
Forester (who had carried out the alcohol level investigations)
to sit throughout the whole of the inquests.       Therefore, he
intended Dr Forester to attend on day 1 and formally prove his
evidence to the various legal representatives.

He said that Inspector Leyton and other officers of the West
Midlands Force would also be available on day 1 to explain the
codings that they had used on charts etc so that those present
would be able to understand the conventions used during the
inquests.

The Coroner said that he was also considering asking Professor
Usher to give an overview of the type of injury that occurred at
Hillsborough on day 1 so that if a pathologist was not then
present at an individual inquest, there had been a general
explanation of the injuries suffered by that individual.

The Coroner said that he was aiming to carry out eight individual
inquests per day.    He said that he did not wish to rush the
inquests because he did not wish that individual deceased's
family to think that the inquest of their family member was not
being dealt with properly.  However, he said that he also had to
bear in mind that the jury would have to sit through the whole of
the inquests and this would undoubtedly place them under great
stress.
He said that so far as the order of the inquests was concerned,
this would not be done on a numerical nor alphabetical order. He
sa i d th a t it w ould be carried out in pathologists' order.
However, he said that if more than one person had died in a
family unit, he would ensure that the inquests for the various
members of that family would be dealt with on the same day.

So far as the jury was concerned, he said that it had been his
initial intention to resume the limited inquests without a jury.
However, he said that he had reconsidered this and despite the
fact that at this stage, the jury will not have a lot do other
than to sit and listen, he thought that he had to have a jury
present.         He pointed out that an inquest is not an adversarial
p r o c e d u r e and that the function of the jury is to reach a
decision on the evidence which they hear in court.

The Coroner said that subject to representations, he intended to
hold the resumed inquests at the Medico Legal centre.    He said
that the proceedings would be transcribed but transcripts would
not necessarily be available on an next morning basis.   He said
that a fee would be payable for transcripts.

The Coroner then asked whether any person present at the meeting
objected to the inquests being resumed.  There were no objections
and Mr Fraser of the Steering Committee congratulated the Coroner
(on behalf of the families) for having reconsidered his earlier
decision.

The C o r o n e r said that he therefore intended to resume the
inquests on 18 April 1990 at 10.30 a.m..        Thereafter, the
inquests would start on each day at 9.30 a.m. with an hour for
lunch from 1.00 until 2.00 and then continuing until the inquests
had been completed for that day.    He said that he was aiming to
complete the inquests by 4 May 1990. However, he said that a few
days would be available from 21 May 1990 onwards if the inquests
needed to be resumed.

The Coroner pointed out that the press would be entitled to be
present at the resumed hearings.

AJC then asked the Coroner whether a formal application needed to
be made for representation.             He said that he w o u l d grant
representation to all the interested parties present at the
meeting.   He said that he had hesitated slightly as regards
granting representation to Trent RHA/SYMAS but took the view that
if AJC's clients thought that they were interested parties, he
h a d n o d i f f i c u l t y w i t h that, a n d t h e r e f o r e g r a n t e d
representation.

       Dear Mr Webster




       IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL REPORT INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH
       STADIUM DISASTER


       Thank you for your letter of 22 February about the Final
       Report of the Hillsborough Inquiry. I am sorry I have not
       replied sooner.

       The recommendations in the Final Report on all seated
       accommodation are not confined to football grounds (paragraphs
       86-89 of the Final Report refer). The provisions of the
       Football Spectators Act 1989 (the 1989 Act) to require the
       introduction of all seated accommodation cannot, however, be
       extended to grounds used for sports other than association
       football. Further primary legislation would be necessary to
       achieve this and we shall first discuss this issue with the
       relevant representative sporting organisations.

       We have noted the position of Owlerton Stadium. Paragraphs 86
       and 237 of the Final report in relation to the use of
       greyhound stadia would appear relevant here.

       The intention is to bring in the commencement of the relevant
       sections of Part I of the 1989 Act and set up the Football
       Licensing Authority as quickly as possible.  In the meantime
       we take the view that football clubs should, in anticipatiSft
       of statutory direction, make plans for and, wherever possible,
       introduce all seated accommodation at grounds.

       The Report s recommendations on the provision of exits in
       perimeter fencing stems from paragraph 22 of Appendix 3 of the
       Report. All pitch perimeter fences should contain exit gates
       to the pitch. Where their installation poses difficulty of
       the sort your describe the solution is a matter for local
decision after balancing the competing requirements for crowd
sarety and the measures needed to secure the orderly conduct
of spectators.  I will however write to you again should I be
able to offer more constructive advice on this issue.

                                       Yours sincerely

                Dear Sirs,

                Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 (As Amended)
                Sheffield United Football Club - First Aid Facilities

                I refer to your letter of 5 March 1990, and note in the correspondence from
                Messrs. Eastwood and Partners, the difficulties in extending the present

                the first aid room facilities could be accommodated.

                The temporary/mobile accommodation would be acceptable so long as there was
                an undertaking to provide permanent accommodation.   The correspondence from
                Eastwood's also asks for a suitable location where the temporary/mobile
                accommodation could be sited, and I would suggest that this is a matter for
                the Advisory Group, in consultation with the club.

                It seems to me that it is proper to refer to paragraph 299 of the Final
                Report by Lord Justice Taylor in that this area requires expert evaluation
                and advice which, unfortunately, I am unable to offer.

                Yours faithfully,

                 _____________ A____________________

                   OWLERTON STADIUM, SHEFFIELD
                   PLAN NOS. 12269/1/2/3/4 - GREYHOUND TERRACE

                   I would make the following observations, given that the only sport to take
                   place at the stadium is greyhound racing.

                   1*0   PLAN NO. 12269/1

                   1.1   The capacity calculation of the terrace appears to have been calculated
                         on arbitary sections of the terrace. Some sections do not appear to be
                         included in the calculation. I would like clarification of the
                         parameters set by the consulting engineer before acceptance of the
                         proposed capacity.

                   1.2   Accepting the present use of the premises and that spectators need a
                         degree of freedom of movement, I would question the adequacy of the
                         present crush barriers.

                   1.3   There is no means indicated on the plan showing how the management of
                         the stadium will be able to control access to this part of the ground
                         and prevent the agreed capacity being exceeded.


                   2.0   PLAN NO. 12269/2

                   2.1   There is a restriction in the exit walkway where the track perimeter
                         wall deflects towards the base of the proposed steps.

                   2.2   The land at the rear of the Greyhound Bar and adjacent to the proposed
                         tarmacadam walkway to gate *G * is shown as being open. This land
                         contains, or has contained, machinery and has in the past been
                         overgrown. Similarly, the building adjacent to gate *G ' (partly shown
                         on the plan) is derelict.   Obviously, if the Greyhound Stand is to be
                         open to the public, then access to this land is readily available and
                         there is a need to protect the public from any dangers caused by the
                         misuse or dilapidation of the land and buildings.

                   2.3   As this is a designated sports ground, the recommendations of the Report
                         by Lord Justice Taylor will probably apply. I would like to raise with
                         the advisory group the complication of the 10? reduction in terrace
                         capacity per year which should be based on the existing standing
                         capacity.


                   3.0   GENERAL

                   3.1   The lighting to the new pathway to gate *G * is not indicated given the
                          new proposed layout of the exit route. I trust that details of lighting
                          to this route will be submitted.

    Dear




    IMPLEMENTATION OP THE FINAL REPORT INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH
    STADIUM DISASTER


    Thank you for your letter of 22 February about the Final
    Report of the Hillsborough Inquiry. I am sorry I have not
    replied sooner.

    The recommendations in the Final Report on all seated
    accommodation are not confined to football grounds (paragraphs
    86-89 of the Final Report refer). The provisions of the
    Football Spectators Act 1989 (the 1989 Act) to require the
    introduction of all seated accommodation cannot, however, be
    extended to grounds used for sports other than association
    football. Further primary legislation would be necessary to
    achieve this and we shall first discuss this issue with the
    relevant representative sporting organisations.

    We have noted the position of Owlerton Stadium. Paragraphs 86
    and 237 of the Final report in relation to the use of
    greyhound stadia would appear relevant here.

    The intention is to bring in the commencement of the relevant
    sections of Part I of the 1989 Act and set up the Football
    Licensing Authority as quickly as possible.  In the meantime
    we take the view that football clubs should, in anticipation
    of statutory direction, make plans for and, wherever possible,
    introduce all seated accommodation at grounds.

    The Report's recommendations on the provision of exits in
    perimeter fencing stems from paragraph 22 of Appendix 3 of the
    Report. All pitch perimeter fences should contain exit gates
    to the pitch. Where their installation poses difficulty of
    the sort your describe the solution is a matter for local
decision after balancing the competing requirements for crowd
safety and the measures needed to secure the orderly conduct
of spectators.  I will however write to you again should I be
able to offer more constructive advice on this issue.

                                       Yours sincerely

Dear I
HILLSBOROUGH PROPOSED SEMINAR
You will be aware from our recent conversations that it is proposed to hold a
One-Day Seminar on Hillsborough to be attended by a small number of people
from Mersey and Trent RHAs.
I hope shortly to be in a position to provide you with more details but I
understand that you would like to give a presentation at this event and I am
sure that can be arranged. At the moment it is envisaged that an A & E
consultant and a GP would also give a presentation.
Dr Alderslade has asked me to confirm that you are happy with the attached
paper which will be circulated to all participants prior to the seminar. I
should be grateful for your confirmation and comments as soon as possible.
Yours sincerely

               Justice Taylor; Final Report. January 1990

INTRODUCTION
1      Bearing in mind the comprehensive nature of Reference 'A' and taking
       account of the number of issues which are pending between the Police,
       Local Authority, Hillsborough Football club and members of the public,
       it is considered advisable to confine this report to those issues
       which have a direct bearing on Health Service emergency planning.
       That being so the report concentrates on facilitating recommendations
       from both reference 'A' and reference 1B 1.
2      On 15 April 1989 a football match to decide a semi-final round of the
       FA Cup competition was to be played between the Liverpool and
       Nottingham Forest Clubs. The neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
       Football Stadium, Sheffield Wednesday's ground. Approximately six
       minutes into the game, play was stopped when it was realised that
       spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal had been severely
       crushed. In the result, 95 died and over 400 received hospital
       treatment.
3      It is a depressing and chastening fact that mine (Reference 'A') is
       the ninth official report covering crowd safety and control, at
       football grounds. After eight previous reports and three editions of
       the Green Guide, it seems astoundi-ng that 95 people could die from
       overcrowding before the very eyes of those controlling the event. In
       January 1986, Mr Justice Popplewell, whose report following the
       Bradford Disaster was the eighth in the series, summarised those of
       his seven predecessors. The Shortt Report of 1924 following disorder
       at the Cup Final of 1923. The Moelwyn Hughes Report of 1946 followed
       the disaster at Bolton Wanderers ground when overcrowding caused 33
       deaths. In 1966 the Government commissioned the Chester Report on
       "The State of Association Football". The Harrington Report of 1968
       drew attention to problems of crowd behaviour and led to the Lang •
       Report of 1969 on the same subject. In 1972, Lord Wheatley's Report
       on Crowd Saftey at Sports Grounds followed the disaster at Ibrox Park
       where 66 spectators died. The McElhone Report of 1977 on Football
       Crowd Behaviour of Scottish supporters was commissioned by the
       Secretary of State for Scotland. In 1984 an Official Working Group on
       Football Spectator Violence was set up by the Department of
       Environment presented a further report.
4      As a result of the Wheatley Report, the first edition of the Green
       Guide was issued in 1973, and Parliament passed the Safety of sports
       Grounds Act 1975. A second edition of the Green Guide was issued in
       1976 and a third edition in 1986 incorporated recommendations made by
       Mr Justice Popplewell.
5     Introducing his excellent and concise summary of the previous reports,
      Mr Justice Popplewell said,
      "almost all the matters Into which I have been asked to inquire and
      almost all the solutions I have proposed, have been previously
      considered 1n detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period of
      60 years'1.
EXTRACT FROM FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF REFERENCE 'A'
6     CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES
      6.1     The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain
               through senior nominated officers regular liaison concerning
               crowd safety at each designated sports ground.
       6.2    Before each match at a designated sports ground the police
               should ensure that the fire service and ambulance service are
               given full details about the event, including its venue, its
               timing, the number of spectators expected, their likely routes
               of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential
               difficulties concerning the control or movement of the crowd.
               Such details should be readily available in the control room
               of each of the emergency services.
       6.3    Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from
               the police control room to the local headquarters of all
               emergency services should be maintained at all times so that
               emergency calls can be made instantly.
       6.4    Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated sports
               ground of emergency vehicles from all three services should be
               reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous
               points, and accessibility within the ground itself.
       6.5    Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should
               be briefed as to the contingency plans for the arrival of
               emergency services and should be informed when such services
               are called as to where and why they are required.
7      FIRST AID, MEDICAL FACILITIES AND AMBULANCES
       7.1    There should be at each sports ground at each match at least
               one trained first aider per 1000 spectators. The club should
               have the responsibility for securing such attendance.
       7.2    There should be at each designated sports ground one or more
               first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the equipment
               to be maintained within them should be specified by the local
               authority after taking professional medical advice and should
               be made a requirement of every Safety Certificate.
       7.3    At every match where the number of spectators is expected to
               exceed 2,000, the club should employ a medical practitioner to
               be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at
               the ground. He should be trained and competent in advance
               first aid. He should be present at the ground at least an
               hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour
               after the end of the match. His whereabouts should be known
              to those in the police control room and he should be
              immediately contactable.
      7.4     At any match where the number of spectators is not expected to
               exceed 2,000, the club should make arrangements to enable a
              medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with
               any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and
               competent in advanced first aid. The arrangements made should
               be known to those in the police control room.
      7.5     At least one fully equipped ambulance from or approved by the
               appropriate ambulance authority should be in attendance at all
               matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.
      7.6     The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where
               larger crowds are expected should be specified by the local
               authority after consultation with the ambulance service and
               should be made a requirement of the Safety Certificate.
      7.7     A "major incident equipment vehicle", designed and equipped to
               deal with up to 50 casualties, should be deployed in addition
               to other ambulance attendance at a match where a crowd in
               excess of 25,000 is expected.
      7.8     The Scottish ambulance service has developed a "major incident
               equipment vehicle" designed and equipped to deal with up to 50
               casualties. It is packed with 50 stretchers, blankets, and
               medical supplies and 1s 1n effect a travelling storehouse for
               such equipment. A vehicle of that type 1s deployed in
               addition to other ambulance attendance at matches with crowds
               over 25,000. This provision goes a long way towards meeting
               the criticism raised after Hillsborough and I recommend that
               1t be adopted elsewhere.
      7.9     I repeat the Interim Recommendations I made under this heading
               subject to two variations. First, it has been sensibly
               urged that it is unreasonable to required a medical
               practitioner to be present throughout a match where attendance
               is very small. At such a match it is suggested that to have a
               medical practitioner on call would be sufficient. I agree
               with this and recommend that the full-time presence of a
               doctor should not be required where there 1s no reasonable
               expectation of more than 2,000 spectators attending.
      7.10    Secondly, some clubs have told me that they can secure private
               ambulance services more economically than those from the
               appropriate ambulance authority. They accordingly wish to
               have freedom to choose. I modify my Interim Recommendation
               1n deference to this argument by requiring at least one fully
               equipped ambulance from, or approved by, the appropriate
               ambulance authority should be in attendance at all matches
               with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.
RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED IN REFERENCE 'B'
8      Reference 1B 1 is intended to form a "Code of Good Practice" which
       identifies the procedural arrangements for dealing with major
       accidents. It is intended to provide basic guidance and to serve as a
       universal reference within the Trent Regional Health Authority,
Clearly there is a need for uniformity in NHS emergency planning in
terms of:
9.1    Clarification of response requirements
9.2    The elimination of different perceptions in expectations and
       capabilities.
9.3    The mind clearing process of committing matters to writing.
9.4    A means to communicate requirements in a comprehensive
       manner.
What follows is an extract only from reference 1B * which seeks to
highlight the NHS lessons learnt from recent major disasters and more
appropriately those most applicable to Hillsborough.
ALERTING PROCEDURES
10.1  There should be a dedicated TELEPHONE in hospitals through
      which the Ambulance Service notify a Major Accident. In large
      Accident and Emergency Departments these telephones should be
      sited in the A & E Department where Senior Nursing or
^     Reception Staff are long-serving and experienced in receiving
  - ^ urgent 'blue light' calls from the Ambulance Service and
fy\j/ initiating appropriate action, rather than in the main
    X switchboard where telephonists are now often inexperienced,
      under pressure or agency/locum staff. However it is accepted
      that at some hospitals local experience may consider that it
      is more appropriate to site these telephones in the
      switchboard. In this event local procedures should ensure
      that the A & E department is informed immediately.
ALERTING MESSAGE
10.2   The phraseology used to declare a major accident and activate
       the NHS response should be simple and made clear to everyone
       concerned.
10.3   There should be an agreed ALERTING MESSAGE which is used
       consistently by all Ambulance Officers, which is simple,
       direct and avoids jargon.
10.4   The following terms are recommended:
        MAJOR ACCIDENT DECLARED : FULL response required of hospital
        MAJOR ACCIDENT WARNING : response by hospital may be FULL or
                                 PRELIMINARY and PARTIAL according to
                                 local procedure
        MAJOR ACCIDENT STAND-DOWN : no further casualties expected
10.5   Other terms - red alert, yellow alert, standby etc should be
        abandoned.
10.6    From the above it follows that the Police and Fire services
        should alert the Ambulance Service Control and not the
        hospitals direct.
10.7    If appropriate the Ambulance Service will deploy a Mobile
         Communications Support Unit (MCSU) to the scene to provide the
         necessary communications links for support and management.
         This should include the availability of hand held
         communications equipment for key ambulance officers (Ambulance
         Incident Officer etc) to cope with the situation where the
         site is required to be reconnoitred or controlled away from
         the MCSU.
10.8    The Hospital Major Incident Plan will designate who should act
         as Site Medical Officer (SMO). Senior clinicians with
         appropriate experience and training should undertake this
         role. They should be transported to the site by the Ambulance
         Service. The SMO will have overall responsibility for
         deployment of medical and nursing personnel at the site.
10.9    In collaboration with the Ambulance Incident Officer the Site
         Medical Officer is responsible for:
        10.9.1    Triage and formulating a casualty evacuation plan.
        10.9.2    Arranging for the attendance of further medical and
                   nursing teams if required eg to deal with trapped
                   casualties etc.
        10.9.3    Organising treatment and co-ordinating medical
                   teams.
        10.9.4    Ensuring that the receiving hospital(s) is regularly
                   updated on numbers and type of casualties they can
                   expect.
        10.9.5    Monitoring the status of the hospitals to continue
                  to receive casualties.
10.10   Mobile Medical Teams. Where transport is to be provided by
        the Ambulance Service, the arrangements must be agreedbetween
        the hospital and the Ambulance Service and clearly identified
        in both Ambulance Service and Hospital plans.
HOSPITAL OPERATIONAL CONTROL
10.11   A hospital operational control room should be identified for
         use in a major accident. It should have appropriate internal
         and external communication- facilities, under the direction of
         a senior manager, senior nurse and a medical controller (as
         appropriate locally). Together they should have the authority
         to:
        10.11.1  permit the evacuation of wards,
        10.11.2  implement action, both planned and unplanned
        10.11.3 involve other hospitals/agencies as necessary
        10.11.4 take charge of all the beds in the hospital
        10.11.5 direct the cancellation of outpatient appointments
        10.11.6 direct the cancellation/postponement of booked
                 admissions
        10.11.7 request additional assistance from the Police
           11.8 issue press statements



                                  CoXtA
        10.11.9   permit the progressive stand-down of the plan
10.12   Ex Directory Lines must be available in A & E and Hospital
        Operational Control for priority and emergency use of staff
        seeking advice or information during a major accident,
        particularly for communication between key staff where more
        than one hospital is involved. It is strongly recommended
        that all hospital controls and A & E departments should have
        an appropriate number of ex-directory lines which should be
        known to other hospital controls, A & E departments and other
        NHS key staff for use in emergency.
10.13   Police Documentation Team. The accommodation earmarked for
        the use of the police documentation team should be equipped
        with both telephones (up to 4) and a facsimile machine to
        facilitate the transmission of information to the central
        Police Casualty Bureau.
10.14   Relatives Information Service. Recent experience has proved
        the need to establish a room with up to four telephones which
        could be staffed by hospital social workers or volunteers to
        answer inquiries from relatives and friends. This room should
        be near to the room provided for the Police documentation team
        since there may be a need to exchange information particularly
        if identification of casualties is a problem. Standard      '
        inquiry forms which closely follow the format of the police
        casualty bureau forms should be used to record details.
10.15   Hospitals should ensure that local plans identify the
        Principal or Senior Social Worker to be contacted in the
        initial stages of a Major Accident. The decision regarding
        follow-up action would rest with this individual and take
        account of locally agreed policy and planning arrangements.
10.16   Local arrangements should ensure that the Hospital Chaplain is
        identified and included in the first stage call out of Key
        Officers to be notified. The role of the Hospital chaplain
        will be to assess the requirements and to co-ordinate
        chaplaincy services for all religions. He will act as the
        point of contact between the many chaplains who will
        undoubtedly offer their services and if required will call out
        other chaplains as necessary.
10.17   Psychological Problems after Disaster. A comprehensive
        section dealing with this subject has been included in the
        Code of Good Practice.
AFTERMATH
10.18   Hospital departments should include plans for coping with the
        aftermath of the accident with particular emphasis on:
        10.18.1   Continuing demands on staff with special expertise.
        10.18.2   Requirements for specialised equipment and
                  consumables.
10.18.3   Ability to maintain routine services eg possible
          postponement of list surgery and some clinics and
          other planned activity.
10.18.4   Debriefing of staff, patients and relatives.

    Introduction                                                                        <t T
    The Final Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secretary
    following the disaster at the Hillsborough football ground was
    published on 29 January. A copy of the Report is attached.

    2.   The purpose of this circular is first, to apprise recipients
    of the Report's recommendations and the Government's response to
    them; and second to give guidance to local authorities with
    safety certification responsibilities on compliance with the
    recommendations.

    The Report

    3.   The Report contains 76 recommendations, 43 of which are
    repeated in substance (see also paragraph 6 below) from the
    Interim Report circulated with HOC 68/1989. Attached at Annex A
    is a copy of the Home Secretary's oral statement to the House
    of Commons on 29 January responding to the final Report.     At
    Annex B is a copy of the schedule referred to in the statement
    setting out the Government's initial response to the individual
    recommendations in the report.

    4.   Local authorities may wish to note, in particular, the
    response to recommendations 1-4 (all seated accommodation) and
    recommendation 6 (National Review Body). The intention is to
    bring into force the relevant sections of Part I of the Football
    Spectators Act 1989 in order to implement these recommendations
E.R.
   as regards football grounds as soon as practicable.             Safety
   certificates should not be amended for this purpose.

   Scope

   5.   Paragraphs 238-239 of the Report indicate that in directing
   the recommendations "essentially" to sports grounds designated
   under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 the flexibility of
   approach referred to in paragraph 5 of the Guide to Safety at
   Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) should apply. Paragraph 14 of
   the Report makes clear that its-emphasis is on football, with its
   special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour, which
   are not experienced to the same extent elsewhere.      The Report
   states that "crowd problems are directly related to the nature
   of the event and the numbers attending it". It would therefore
   be consistent with the Report's findings for local authorities
   to take proper account of these factors when applying the
   recommendations to individual grounds: for example a careful
   appraisal of the value of such matters as the installation of
   sophisticated communications systems and CCTV may be necessary
   where spectator attendances are numbered in hundreds rather than
   thousands and where the police presence at the ground is minimal.

   Interim Report Recommendations Adjusted

   6.   The   attention    of  local   authorities   is  drawn   to
   recommendations 8 , 11, 12(b), 19, 20, 31, 33, 58, 66 and 67 all
   of which were contained in the Interim Report but have been
   modified as follows:

           recommendation 8 -   revised maximum figure

           recommendation 11 - "agreement" between club and police is
                               replaced by "statement of intent"

           recommendation 12 - qualification introduced by 12 (b)

           recommendation 19 - discretion-as regards opening of pitch
                               perimeter gates

           recommendation 20 - manning by police or steward

           recommendation 31 - revised   composition   of   the   Advisory
                               Group

           recommendation 33 - reference to 1975 Act provision

           recommendation 58 - hand-signals not recommended

           recommendation 66 - recommended threshold figure of 2000

           recommendation 67 - ambulance may be approved          by. the
                               ambulance authorities.
E.R.
   New Safety Recommendations

   7.   New   recommendations are summarised below and            local
   authorities are urged to take the action indicated             where
   appropriate.

         Turnstiles (recommendation 10) - to note the revised
       - maximum flow-rate to be used in place of the figure of
         750 quoted in the Green Guide which will be amended as
         soon as possible;

        Gangways (recommendation 13) - to include appropriate
        conditions in safety certificates;

        Perimeter Fences (recommendations 14, 15, 17) - to
        secure   action  by  clubs  to   comply with    these
        recommendations and to amend safety certificates,, as
        necessary;

        Safety Certificates (recommendations 24, 25, 26) - to
        consider   any   necessary   adjustment   to   safety
        certificates and note Home Office intention to
        implement recommendation 24;

        Duties of Clubs (recommendations 39, 40, 42, 43) - to
        consider appropriate amendment to safety certificates,
        as necessary;

        Police Planning (recommendations 47, 48, 50, 52, 53),
        Communications (55^ and Co-ordination (61) - to note
        the recommendations and the Government's response;

        First Aid (recommendation 69) and Offences/Penalties
        (recommendations  70-73)  - to    note  Government's
        response;

        Green. Guide (recommendations 74-76 and Appendix 3) -
        to note the Government response and to adopt the
        revised criteria/requirements which will be included
        in a revised guide as soon as possible.

   Resource Implications

   8.   Action to consider, revise and enforce the provisions of
   safety certificates in the light of the Report may have short
   term resource implications but is not expected to give rise to
   significant long-term resource implications above existing
   commitments.

                                                                   conclusion was that the majority had not and that the

impact o f closed circuit television on the hooligan
problem. It also m en tions other measures taken by the
Government, such as the restriction on the sale o f alcohol
and the power given to the courts to make orders
excluding convicted h o oligan s from grounds.
    Lord Justice T aylor also recognises the great potential
value o f the police national football intelligence unit in
dealing with football-related crime and with hooligans
travelling to matches abroad.
    A s I have said. Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
better facilities and better treatment o f fans will bring
better behaviour. B eyon d that, the report recom m ends the
creation o f three new specific offences to apply at
designated sports grou nd s— throwing a missile: chanting
obscene or racialist abuse: and g oin g on to the pitch
w ithout reasonable excuse. It also asks for consideration
to be given to exten d in g the courts' powers to impose
attendance centre orders and for the use o f electronic
tagging in the case o f offenders' convicted o f football-
related offences. T he specific new offences suggested seem,
to som e extent, to duplicate offences which are alreadv
available in the Public Order A ct 1986, but 1 shall look
carefully and quickly at all these suggestions.
    I now com e to the prop osed football membership
scheme. Lord Justice T aylor exam ined the invitation to
tender for a schem e w hich was issued by ^ c o n s u l t a n t s
em p loyed by the fo o tb a ll authorities. H e cam e to the
conclusion that he c o u ld not support a schem e o f that kind
because he could n ot believe that the tech n olog y would
work well en ou gh to a v o id the danger o f congestion and
disorder. H e was a lso concerned abou t the call on police
resources. Instead, he proposes the measures to which I
have referred.
    In the light o f this advice, the G o v ern m en t have decided
not to proceed with the estab lish m ent o f a football
membership authority, but part I o f the A ct will remain on
the statute book . W o rk will co n tin u e to see h ow the
shortcom ings identified by Lord Justice T aylor could be

should the problem o f h o olig a n ism n ot be defeated by the
alternative strategy p ro p o sed in the report.
    Let no o n e im agine that this m ean s that there will be
any let-up in the fight against h o o ligan ism . T h ose who.
unlike the G o v e rn m en t, have for so lo n g shrugged o f f their
responsibilities will n o w have to face up to them.
    T he G overn m en t intend to proceed as quickly as
possible to the estab lish m en t o f a football licensing
authority and. subject to co n su ltatio n , section 11 o f the
F ootball Spectators A c t will be used to direct the Football

INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM INQUIRY


Initial response by the Government to the recommendations in the
final report of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry into the
Hillsborough stadium diaster.


In his statement on 29 January, the Home Secretary indicated that
he would place in the Library a schedule setting out the
Government's initial response to the recommendations of Lord
Justice Taylor's final report. The schedule is annexed.




29 January 1990
•Initial response by the Government to recommendations contained
in the Taylor report.


ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION (Recommendation 1-4)

1.     General recommendation in respect of all sports grounds
     ' designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

2.     To apply to all UEFA "high risk" matches from Autumn 1993.

3.     To apply by 20% stages between now and Autumn 1994 to
             Football league, Divisions 1 and 2
            Scottish football league, Premier Division
            National stadia.

4.     To apply by 10% stages between now and Autumn 1999 to all
        other matches played at designated grounds.

The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and
expects to apply it in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the
4 Divisions of the football league, and the national stadia as
recommended.


The application of the recommendation to Scotland and to other
sports cannot be achieved under the Football Spectators Act 1989
but the Government will in-any case wish to discuss it with the
sporting authorities concerned. Designated sports grounds under
the 1975 Act include cricket, rugby union and rugby league
grounds which are not all enclosed grounds and which it may not
be practicable to deal with in this way.



ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL (Recommendation 5)

The Government supports Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation
that the football league and Football Association should
establish an Advisory Design Council on stadium design.




NATIONAL INSPECTORATE AND REVIEW BODY (Recommendation 6)

        (a)   The Football Licensing Authority should be created to
              review the discharge of functions by local authorities.

        (b)   The powers of the Authority should be extended to other
              sports and other sports venues.

The   Government ■’ supports the   recommendation   that   safety
certification of designated grounds should be centrally reviewed
and proposes to bring into force relevant provisions of Part I
of the Football Spectators Act to create and empower the Football
Licensing Authority to carry out these responsibilities in
England and Wales in relation to grounds used by football league
clubs and the international football grounds. Consideration will
be given to introduction of legislation extending the role of the
new authority to Scotland and in relation to other sports grounds
and sporting venues after consultation with the representative
sporting organisations, the local authority associations and
other interested bodies.    Consideration will also be given to
extending the Authority’s responsibilities in the meantime on a
voluntary basis.

MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES (Recommendations 7-10)

7.    Safety certificates to specify maximum number of spectators
      in pens or areas (interim recommendation 1).

8.    Calculations of crowd density:    revised figures   (interim
      recommendation 2, revised).

9.    Arrangements to prevent further access    to pens   (interim
      recommendation 3).

10.   Turnstile flow rates.

The Government supports these recommendations. Local authorities
with responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(the 1975 Act) have already been urged to review and amend safety
certificates to reflect reductions in terrace capacities
recommended in the Interim Report.      The adjusted figures in
recommendations 8 and 10 will be drawn to local authorities'
attention.   The next edition of the 'Green Guide' will reflect
the new figures.

FILLING AND MONITORING OF TERRACES (Recommendations 11-12)

11.   Statements of intent (interim recommendation 4, revised.

12.   Stewarding or policing of pens (interim recommendation 5).

The Government have already urged police and clubs to enter into
non-contractual statements of intent with the aim of ensuring
that no doubt exists as to the respective responsibilities of
each; and to provide monitoring of terraces accordingly.       The
relaxation in recommendation 12 (b) will be drawn to the attention
of local authorities and clubs.

GANGWAYS (Recommendation 13)

Local authorities will be urged to include in safety certificates
terms and conditions to give effect to this recommendation.

FENCES AND GATES (Recommendations 14-21)

14.   Removal of spikes.

15.   Reduction in height.

16.   Training of stewards (interim recommendation 6).
17.   Emergency gates din perimeter fences.

18.   Harking of emergency gates (interim recommendation 7).

19.   Gates normally to be kept open during matches. (interim
      recommendation 8, revised).

20.   Manning    of    emergency    . gates      (replaces     interim
      recommendation 9).

21.   Cutting equipment (interim recommendation 10).

The Government supports the recommendations on perimeter fencing.
Local authorities will be urged .to amend safety certificates to
include requirements so as.to implement recommendations 14, 15,
17.. and to note recommendation       19 which varies     interim
recommendation 8 , The revised recommendations on closure and
manning of gates in perimeter fences at football grounds will be
drawn to the attention of local authorities, clubs and police.

CRUSH BARRIERS (Recommendations 22, 23)

22.   Inspection (interim recommendation 11).

23.   Review of layout (interim recommendation 12).

been commended to local authorities.

SAFETY CERTIFICATES (Recommendations 24-31)

24.   Mandatory conditions in safety certificates.

25.   Variation from terms of safety certificates.

26.   Terms of safety certificates.

27.   Review of safety certificates (interim recommendation 13).

      certificates (interim recommendation 15).

30.   Review of arrangements for issuing certificates          (interim
      recommendation 16).

31.   Local authority advisory groups (interim recommendation 17,
      revised).

The Government agrees with the aims of these recommendations.
An order under S.15A of the 1975 Act will be made to implement
recommendation 24. Consideration will also be given to including
within the scope of such an iDrder'provisions which will require
terms and conditions addressing other aspects of safety to be
included in safety certificates.
Local authorities will be urged to ensure the terms/conditions
in safety certificates are clear and unequivocal: they will be
reminded of the need to have an effective review system, the
desirability of a properly constituted team approach to
certification and the desirability of consulting club and
supporters association representatives.

Annual review o f safety certificates already exists in effect
because annual inspections of designated grounds in connection
with safety certificates is already required by law.       The
Government will consider whether any change in the law should
be made to make annual renewal of certificates compulsory.

DUTIES OF FOOTBALL CLUBS (Recommendations 32-43)

32.   Measurement of turnstile flow (interim recommendation 18).

33.   Correlation of turnstile      flow   and   capacity   (interim
      recommendation 19).

are supported by the Government.       Where appropriate, local
authorities will be asked to amend safety certificates to enforce
these recommendations.

POLICE PLANNING (Recommendations 44-53)

44.   Nomination of a Chief      Officer   for    liaison   (interim
      recommendation 26).

45.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 27).

46.   Operational orders (interim recommendation 28).

52.    Training of senior officers.

53.    Charges for police services.

These recommendations, some of which are repeated from the
Interim Report are directed primarily to Chief Police Officers
and police authorities. The Government supports the proposal for
senior^ officer    training  and   the   objective    to  improve
effectiveness of policing at football matches.     The Government
agrees that the cost of policing inside grounds should be met in
full by clubs and will consider providing guidance to police
authorities after consultation with relevant representative
associations, to ensure consistency of practice.

additional/■••discrete channel of communications for police match
commanders.

59.    Co-ordination (interim recommendation 35).

60.    Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 36).

61.    Communication with emergency services.

62.    Arrival of emergency vehicles (interim recommendation 37).

63.    Briefing of police officers (interim recommendation 38).

These recommendations are intended to ensure full co-ordination
and co-operation of the emergency services and are substantially
those covered in the Interim Report which the Government has
already endorsed. The Government will urge all those concerned
to comply with the further recommendation devised to ensure
immediate summons of emergency services.

    Dear Sir/Madam

    HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 11/1990
    FINAL REPORT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

    Introduction

    The Final Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secretary
    following the disaster at the Hillsborough football ground was
    published on 29 January. A copy of the Report is attached.

    2.   The purpose of this circular is first, to apprise recipients
    of the Report's recommendations and the Government's response to
    them; and second to give guidance to local authorities with
    safety certification responsibilities on compliance with the
    recommendations.

    The Report

    3.   The Report contains 76 recommendations, 43 of which are
    repeated in substance (see also paragraph 6 below) from the
    Interim Report circulated with HOC 68/1989. Attached at Annex A
    is a copy of the Home Secretary's oral statement to the House
    of Commons on 29 January responding to the final Report.     At
    Annex B is a copy of the schedule referred to in the statement
    setting out the Government's initial response to the individual
    recommendations in the report.

    4.   Local authorities may wish to note, in particular, the
    response to recommendations 1-4 (all seated accommodation) and
    recommendation 6 (National Review Body). The intention is to
    bring into force the relevant sections of Part I of the Football
    Spectators Act 1989 in order to implement these recommendations
E.R
      as regards football grounds as soon as practicable.               Safety
      certificates should not be amended for this purpose.

      Scope

      5.   Paragraphs 238-239 of the Report indicate that in directing
      the recommendations "essentially" to sports grounds designated
      under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 the flexibility of
      approach referred to in paragraph 5 of the Guide to Safety at
      Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) should apply. Paragraph 14 of
      the Report makes clear that its emphasis is on football, with its
      special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour, which
      are not experienced to the same extent elsewhere.      The Report
      states that "crowd problems are directly related to the nature
      of the event and the numbers attending it". It would therefore
      be consistent with the Report's findings for local authorities
      to take proper account of these factors when applying the
      recommendations to individual grounds:     for example a careful
      appraisal of the value of such matters as the installation of
      sophisticated communications systems and GCTV may be necessary
      where spectator attendances are numbered in hundreds rather than
      thousands and where the police presence at the ground is minimal.

      Interim Report Recommendations Adjusted

  6.   The   attention  of   local   authorities   is  drawn   to
  recommendations 8, 11, 12(b), 19, 20, 31, 33, 58, 66 and 67 all
  of which were contained in the Interim Report but have been

              recommendation 12 - qualification introduced by 12(b)

              recommendation 19 - discretion as regards opening of pitch
                                  perimeter gates

              recommendat ion 20 - mannincr bv Dolice or steward

              recommendat ion 31 - revised   composition   of   the   Advisory

              recommendation 67 - ambulance may be approved           by   the
                                  ambulance authorities.
E.R.
   New Safety Recommendations

   7.   New recommendations are summarised below and                local
   authorities are urged to take the action indicated               where
   appropriate.

           Turnstiles (recommendation 10) - to note the revised
           maximum flow-rate to be used in place of the figure of
           750 quoted in the Green Guide which will be amended as
           soon as possible;

           Gangways (recommendation 13) - to include appropriate
           conditions in safety certificates;

           Perimeter Fences (recommendations 14, 15, 17) - to
           secure   action  by  clubs  to   comply with   these
           recommendations and to amend safety certificates, as
           necessary;

           Safety Certificates (recommendations 24, 25, 26) - to
           consider   any   necessary   adjustment   to   safety
           certificates and note Home Office intention to
           implement recommendation 24;

           Duties of Clubs (recommendations 39, 40, 42, 43) - to
           consider appropriate amendment to safety certificates,
           as necessary;

           Police Planning (recommendations 47, 48, 50, 52, 53),
           Communications (55) and Co-ordination (61) - to note
           the recommendations and the Government's response;

           First Aid (recommendation 69) and Offences/Penalties
           (recommendations  70-73)  - to note     Government's
           response;

           Green Guide (recommendations 74-76 and Appendix 3) -
           to note the Government response and to adopt the
           revised criteria/requirements which will be included
           in a revised guide as soon as possible.

   Resource Implications

   8.   Action to consider, revise and enforce the provisions of
   safety certificates in the light of the Report may have short
   term resource implications but is not expected to give rise to
   significant long-term resource implications above existing
   commitments.

   Other

   9.    Copies of this circular, annexes and enclosures are sent
   to Fire and Civil Defence Authorities, Police Authorities,
   Regional Managers Health Authorities, Chief Officers of Police,
   Chief    Fire  Officers  and   Chief  Ambulance   Officers   for
   information. Copies have also been sent to all football league
   clubs and the representative organisations on the attached list.

                                      (Fire and Emergency
                                      Planning Department)
Initial response by the Government to recommendations contained
in the Taylor report.


ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION (Recommendation 1-4)

1.   General recommendation in respect of all sports grounds
     designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

2.   To apply to all UEFA "high risk" matches from Autumn 1993.

3.   To apply by 20% stages between now and Autumn 1994 to
          Football league, Divisions 1 and 2
          Scottish football league, Premier Division
          National stadia.

4.   To apply by 10% stages between now and Autumn 1999 to all
     other matches played at designated grounds.

The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and
expects to apply it in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the
4 Divisions of the football league, and the national stadia as
recommended.


The application of the recommendation to Scotland and to other
sports cannot be achieved under the Football Spectators Act 1989
but the Government will in any case wish to discuss it with the
sporting authorities concerned. Designated sports grounds under
the 1975 Act include cricket, rugby union and rugby league
grounds which are not all enclosed grounds and which it may not
be practicable to deal with in this way.



ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL (Recommendation 5)

The Government supports Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation
that the football league and Football Association should
establish an Advisory Design Council on stadium design.




NATIONAL INSPECTORATE AND REVIEW BODY (Recommendation 6)

     (a)   The Football Licensing Authority should be created to
           review the discharge of functions by local authorities.

     (b)   The powers of the Authority should be extended to other
           sports and other sports venues.

The   Government   supports  the   recommendation   that   safety
certification of designated grounds should be centrally reviewed
and proposes to bring into force relevant provisions of Part I
of the Football Spectators Act to create and empower the Football
Licensing Authority to carry out these responsibilities in
England and Wales in relation to grounds used by football league
clubs and the international football grounds. Consideration will
be given to introduction of legislation extending the role of the
new authority to Scotland and in relation to other sports grounds
and sporting venues after consultation with the representative
sporting organisations, the local authority associations and
other interested bodies.    Consideration will also be given to
extending the Authority's responsibilities in the meantime on a
voluntary basis.

MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES (Recommendations 7-10)

7.    Safety certificates to specify maximum number of spectators
      in pens or areas (interim recommendation 1).

8.    Calculations of crowd density:    revised figures   (interim
      recommendation 2, revised).

9.    Arrangements to prevent further access to pens      (interim
      recommendation 3).

10.   Turnstile flow rates.

The Government supports these recommendations. Local authorities
with responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(the 1975 Act) have already been urged to review and amend safety
certificates to reflect reductions in terrace capacities
recommended in the Interim Report.      The adjusted figures in
recommendations 8 and 10 will be drawn to local authorities'
attention.   The next edition of the 'Green Guide' will reflect
the new figures.

PILLING AND MONITORING OF TERRACES (Recommendations 11-12)

11.   Statements of intent (interim recommendation 4, revised.

12.   Stewarding or policing of pens (interim recommendation 5).

The Government have already urged police and clubs to enter into
non-contractual statements of intent with the aim of ensuring
that no doubt exists as to the respective responsibilities of
each; and to provide monitoring of terraces accordingly.       The
relaxation in recommendation 12 (b) will be drawn to the attention
of local authorities and clubs.

GANGWAYS (Recommendation 13)

Local authorities will be urged to include in safety certificates
terms and conditions to give effect to this recommendation.

FENCES AND GATES (Recommendations 14-21)

14.   Removal of spikes.

15.   Reduction in height.

16.   Training of stewards (interim recommendation 6).
17.   Emergency gates in perimeter fences.

18.   Narking of emergency gates (interim recommendation 7).

19.   Gates normally to be kept open during matches            (interim
      recommendation 8, revised).

20.   Nanning    of    emergency      gates      (replaces      interim
      recommendation 9).

21.   Cutting equipment (interim recommendation 10).

The Government supports the recommendations on perimeter fencing.
Local authorities will be urged to amend safety certificates to
include requirements so as to implement recommendations 14, 15,
17 and to note recommendation 19 which varies             interim
recommendation 8 . The revised recommendations on closure and
manning of gates in perimeter fences at football grounds will be
drawn to the attention of local authorities, clubs and police.

CRUSH BARRIERS (Recommendations 22, 23)

22.   Inspection (interim recommendation 11).

23.   Review of layout (interim recommendation 12).

These are repeated from the Interim Report.        They have already
been commended to local authorities.

SAFETY CERTIFICATES (Recommendations 24-31)

24.   Mandatory conditions in safety certificates.

25.   Variation from terms of safety certificates.

26.   Terms of safety certificates.

27.   Review of safety certificates (interim recommendation 13).

28.Issue of certificates     to    grounds    without   them   (interim
recommendation 14).

29.   Annual   review  of   certificates;  annual         renewal   of
      certificates (interim recommendation 15).

30.   Review of arrangements for issuing certificates          (interim
      recommendation 16).

31.   Local authority advisory groups (interim recommendation 17,
      revised).

The Government agrees with the aims of these recommendations.
An order under S.15A of the 1975 Act will be made to implement
recommendation 24. Consideration will also be given to including
within the scope of such an Order provisions which will require
terms and conditions addressing other aspects of safety to be
included in safety certificates.
Local authorities will be urged to ensure the terms/conditions
in safety certificates are clear and unequivocal: they will be
reminded of the need to have an effective review system/ the
desirability of a properly constituted team approach to
certification and the desirability of consulting club and
supporters association representatives.

Annual review of safety certificates already exists in effect
because annual inspections of designated grounds in connection
with safety certificates is already required by law.       The
Government will consider whether any change in the law should
be made to make annual renewal of certificates compulsory.

DUTIES OF FOOTBALL CLUBS (Recommendations 32-43)

32.   Measurement of turnstile flow (interim recommendation 18).

33.   Correlation of turnstile      flow   and   capacity   (interim

42.   Recruitment of stewards.

These recommendations are aimed primarily at football clubs and
are supported by the Government.       Where appropriate, local
authorities will be asked to amend safety certificates to enforce
these recommendations.

POLICE PLANNING (Recommendations 44-53)

44.   Nomination of a Chief      Officer   for    liaison   (interim
      recommendation 26).

45.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation     27).

46.   Operational orders (interim recommendation     28).

47.   Police action on ticketless fans.
48.   Review of arrest procedures.

50.   Early kick-offs and Sunday fixtures.

51.   Control room facilities.

52.   Training of senior officers.

53.   Charges for police services.

These recommendations, some of which are repeated from the
Interim Report are directed primarily to Chief Police Officers
and police authorities. The Government supports the proposal for
senior   officer   training  and   the   objective    to  improve
effectiveness of policing at football matches.     The Government
agrees that the cost of policing inside grounds should be met in
full by clubs and will consider providing guidance to police
authorities after consultation with relevant representative
associations, to ensure consistency of practice.

COMMUNICATIONS (Recommendations 54-58)

54.   Radio communications (interim recommendation 31, amended).

55.   Provision of a command channel.

56.   Land lines (interim recommendation 32).

57.   Public address (interim recommendation 33).

58.   Illuminated advertising (interim recommendation 34:   advice
      on hand signals withdrawn).

These are largely repeated from the Interim Report which the

to implement. Chief Officers will also be encouraged to use an
additional, discrete channel of communications for police match
commanders.

59.   Co-ordination (interim recommendation 35).

60.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 36).

61.   Communication with emergency services.

62.   Arrival of emergency vehicles (interim recommendation 37).

63.   Briefing of police officers (interim recommendation 38).

These recommendations are intended to ensure full co-ordination
and co-operation of the emergency services and are substantially
those covered in the Interim Report which the Government has
already endorsed. The Government will urge all those concerned
to comply with the further recommendation devised to ensure
immediate summons of emergency services.

FIRST AID, MEDICAL FACILITIES AND AMBULANCES

provision of major incident vehicles with the authorities
concerned.

OFFENCES AND PENALTIES (Recommendations 70-73)

70.   Selling tickets.

71.   Other specific offences.

72.   Attendance centres.

75.   Crush barrier tests.

76.   Inspections for corrosion.

The Government accepts these recommendations and will act on them
with urgency.

                                                                         improve standards, but Lord Justice Taylor's clear

impact o f closed circuit television on the hooligan
problem. It also m entions other measures taken by the
G overnm ent, such as the restriction o n the sale o f alcohol
and the power given to the courts to make orders
excluding convicted h ooligans from grounds.
    Lord Justice Taylor also recognises the great potential
value o f the police national football intelligence unit in
dealing with football-related crime and with hooligans
travelling to matches abroad.
    A s I have said. Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
better facilities and better treatment o f fans will bring
better behaviour. Beyond that, the report recom m ends the
creation o f three new specific offences to apply at
designated sports grounds— throwing a missile: chanting
obscene or racialist abuse; and going on to the pitch
w ithout reasonable excuse. It also asks for consideration
to be given to extending the courts' powers to impose
attendance centre orders and for the use o f electronic
tagging in the case o f offenders' convicted o f football-
related offences. T he specific new' offences suggested seem,
to som e extent, to duplicate offences which are already
available in the Public Order A ct 1986. but 1 shall look
carefully and quickly at all these suggestions,
    I now com e to the proposed football membership
schem e. Lord Justice T aylor exam ined the invitation to
tender for a schem e which was issued by the consultants
em ployed by the footb all authorities. H e cam e to the
conclusion that he co u ld not su pp ort a schem e o f that kind
because he cou ld n o t believe that the tech nology would
w ork well en ough to avoid the danger o f con gestion and
disorder. H e w as also concerned a b ou t the call on police
resources. Instead, he proposes the measures to which I
have referred.
    In the light o f this advice, the G overnm ent have decided
n ot to proceed with the establishm ent o f a football
membership authority, but part I o f the A ct will remain on
the statute b ook . W ork will contin ue to see h o w the
sh ortcom ings identified by Lord Justice T aylor could be
overcom e in case w e have to return to the matter again,
should the p roblem o f h o olig a n ism not be defeated by the
alternative strategy p rop osed in the report.
    Let no on e im agin e that this m eans that there will be
any let-up in the fight against hooliganism . T h ose w ho,
unlike the G o v e rn m en t, have for so lo n g shrugged off their
responsibilities will n o w have to face up to them.
    T he G overn m en t intend to proceed as quickly as
possible to the establishm ent o f a football licensing
authority and, subject to con su lta tion , section 11 o f the
 F ootball Spectators A ct will b e used to direct the Football
 Licensing A uthority to require all-seater stadium s— with
standing being reduced by stages and entirely eliminated in
first and second division g rou nd s by A u gu st 1994 and in all
 F oo tb all League grou nd s by 1999.

   The Final Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secretary
   following the disaster at the Hillsborough football g r ound was
   p ublished on 29 January. A copy of the Report is attached.

   2.   The purpose of this circular is first, to apprise recipients
   of the R e p o r t 1s recommendations and the G o v e r n m e n t 1s response to
   them; and second to give guidance to local authorities with
   safety certification responsibilities on compliance with the
   recommendations.

   The Report

   3.   The Report contains 76 r e c om m en d at i on s , 43 of w h i c h are
   repeated in substance (see also paragraph 6 below)                 from the
   Interim Repo r t c i rc ulated with HOC 68/1989. A t t a c h e d at Annex A
   is a copy of the Home Secretary ’s oral statement to the House
   of Commons on 29 J a n ua r y responding to the final Report.            At
   Annex B is a copy of the schedule referred to in the statement
   setting out the G o v e r n m e n t 's initial response to the individual
   recommendations in the report.

   4.   Local authorities m a y wish to note, in particular, the
   response to recommendations 1-4 (all seated accommodation) and
   recommendation 6 (National Review B o d y ) . The inte nt i on i s to
   bring into force the relevant sections of Part I of t h e Football
   Spectators Act 1989 in order to implement these recommendations
E.R.                                                                          I

   as regards football grounds as soon as practicable.              Safety
   certificates should not be amended for this purpose.

   Scope

   5.   Paragraphs 238-239 of the Report indicate that in directing
   the recommendations "essentially” to sports grounds designated
   under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 the flexibility of
   approach referred to in paragraph 5 of the Guide to Safety at
   Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) should apply. Paragraph 14 of
   the Report makes clear that its emphasis is on football, with its
   special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour, which
   are not experienced to the same extent elsewhere.      The Report
   states that "crowd problems are directly related to the nature
   of the event and the numbers attending it” . It would therefore
   be consistent with the Report's findings for local authorities
   to take proper account of these factors when applying the
   recommendations to individual grounds:     for example a careful
   appraisal of the value of such matters as the installation of
   sophisticated communications systems and CCTV may be necessary
   where spectator attendances are numbered in hundreds rather than
   thousands and where the police presence at the ground is minimal.

   Interim Report Recommendations Adjusted

   6.   The   attention   of   local   authorities   is  drawn   to
   recommendations 8 , 11, 12(b), 19, 20, 31, 33, 58, 66 and 67 all
   of which were contained in the Interim Report but have been
   modified as follows:

           recommendation 8 •   revised maximum figure

           recommendation 11 - "agreement” between club and police is
                               replaced by "statement of intent"

           recommendation 12 - qualification introduced by 12 (b)

           recommendation 19 - discretion as regards opening of pitch
                               perimeter gates

           recommendation 20 - mannincr bv oolice or steward

           recommendation 31 — revised   composition   of   the   Advisory
                               Group

           recommendation 33 - reference to 1975 Act provision

   New Safety Recommendations

   7.   New   recommendations are summarised below and          local
   authorities are urged to take the action indicated           where
   appropriate.

        Turnstiles (recommendation 10) - to note the revised
        maximum flow-rate to be used in place of the figure of
        750 quoted in the Green Guide which will be amended as
        soon as possible;

        Gangways (recommendation 13) - to include appropriate
        conditions in safety certificates;

        Perimeter Fences (recommendations 14, 15, 17) - to
        secure   action  by  clubs  to   comply with   these
        recommendations and to amend safety certificates, as

 Governm ent, such as the restriction on the sale o f alcohol

dealing with football-related crim e and with hooligans
 travelling to m atches abroad.
    A s f have said. L ord Justice T aylor takes the view that
better facilities an d better treatment o f fans will bring
better behaviour. B ey o n d that, the report recomm ends the
creation o f three new specific offences to apply at
designated sports g ro u n d s— throwing a missile: chanting
obscen e o r racialist abuse; and goin g o n to the pitch
w ithout reasonable excu se. Ft also asks for consideration
to be given to ex ten d in g the courts' powers to impose
attendance centre orders and for the use o f electronic
tagging in the case o f offenders' convicted o f football*
related offences. T h e specific new offences suggested seem,
to som e extent, to d up licate offences which are alreadv
available in the Public O rder A c t 1986. but I shall look
carefully and quickly at all these suggestions.

tender for a schem e w h ich w as issued by the consultants

con clusion that he c o u ld n o t sup port a schem e o f that kind
because he cou ld n o t believe that the tech n olo gy would
w ork well en o u g h to a v o id the danger o f con g estion and
disorder. H e was a ls o co ncerned abou t the call on police
resources. Instead, he prop oses the measures to which I
have referred.
    In the light o f this advice, the G o vern m en t h ave decided
not to proceed w ith the establishm ent o f a football
membership a uthority, but part I o f the A c t will remain on
the statute b o o k . W o r k will con tinu e to see how the
sh ortcom ings identified by Lord Justice T aylor could be

should the p rob lem o f h o o lig a n ism not be defeated by the
alternative strategy p r o p o sed in the report.

unlike the G o v e r n m e n t, h ave for so lon g shrugged o f f their
responsibilities will n o w h ave to face up to them.
    T h e G ov e rn m en t intend to proceed as quickly as
possible to the esta b lish m en t o f a football licensing
authority and, sub ject to co n su lta tio n , section 11 o f the
F ootball Spectators A c t will be used to direct the Football

INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM INQUIRY


Initial response by the Government to the recommendations in the
final report of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry into the
Hillsborough stadium diaster.


In his statement on 29 January, the Home Secretary indicated that
he would place in the Library a schedule setting out the
Government's initial response to the recommendations of Lord
Justice Taylor's final report. The schedule is annexed.




29 January 1990
Initial response by the Government to recommendations contained
in the Taylor report.


ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION (Recommendation 1-4)

1.   General recommendation in respect of all sports grounds
     designated u n d e r the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

2.   To apply to all UEFA "high risk" matches from Autumn 1993.

3.   To apply by 20% stages between now and Autumn 1994 to
          Football league, Divisions 1 and 2
          Scottish football league# Premier Division
          National stadia.

4.   To apply by 10% stages between now and Autumn 1999 to all
     other matches played at designated grounds.

The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and
expects to apply it in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the
4 Divisions of the football league, and the national stadia as
recommended.


The application of the recommendation to Scotland and to other
sports cannot be achieved under the Football Spectators Act 1989
but the Government will in any case wish to discuss it with the
sporting authorities concerned. Designated sports grounds under
the 1975 Act include cricket, rugby union and rugby league
grounds which are not all enclosed grounds and which it may not
be practicable to deal with in this way.



ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL (Recommendation 5)

The Government supports Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation
that the football league and Football Association should
establish an Advisory Design Council on stadium design.




NATIONAL INSPECTORATE AND REVIEW BODY (Recommendation 6 )

     (a)   The Football Licensing Authority should be created to
           review the discharge of functions by local authorities.

     (b)   The powers of the Authority should be extended to other
           sports and other sports venues.

The   Government   supports  the   recommendation   that   safety
certification of designated grounds should be centrally reviewed
and proposes to bring into force relevant provisions of Part I
of the Football Spectators Act to create and empower the Football
Licensing Authority to carry out these responsibilities in
England and Wales in relation to grounds used by football league
clubs and the international football grounds. Consideration will
be given to introduction of legislation extending the role of the
new authority to Scotland and in relation to other sports grounds
and sporting venues after consultation with the representative
sporting organisations, the local authority associations and
other interested bodies.    Consideration will also be given to
extending the Authority's responsibilities in the meantime on a
voluntary basis.

MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES (Recommendations 7-10)

7.    Safety certificates to specify maximum number of spectators
      in pens or areas (interim recommendation 1 ).

8.    Calculations of crowd density:    revised figures   (interim
      recommendation 2 , revised).

9.    Arrangements to prevent further access    to pens   (interim
      recommendation 3).

10.   Turnstile flow rates.

The Government supports these recommendations. Local authorities
with responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(the 1975 Act) have already been urged to review and amend safety
certificates to reflect reductions in terrace capacities
recommended in the Interim Report.      The adjusted figures in
recommendations 8 and 10 will be drawn to local authorities'
attention.   The next edition of the 'Green Guide' will reflect
the new figures.

PILLING AND MONITORING OP TERRACES (Recommendations 11-12)

11.   Statements of intent (interim recommendation 4, revised.

12.   Stewarding or policing of pens (interim recommendation 5).

The Government have already urged police and clubs to enter into
non-contractual statements of intent with the aim of ensuring
that no doubt exists as to the respective responsibilities of
each; and to provide monitoring of terraces accordingly.       The
relaxation in recommendation 12 (b) will be drawn to the attention
of local authorities and clubs.

GANGWAYS (Recommendation 13)

Local authorities will be urged to include in safety certificates
terms and conditions to give effect to this recommendation.

PENCES AND GATES (Recommendations 14-21)

14.   Removal of spikes.

15.   Reduction in height.

16.   Training of stewards (interim recommendation 6 ).
17.   Emergency gates in perimeter fences.

18.   Marking of emergency gates (interim recommendation 7).

19.   Gates normally to be kept open during matches            (interim
      recommendation 8 , revised).

20.   Manning    of    emergency      gates      (replaces     interim
      recommendation 9).

21.   Cutting equipment (interim recommendation 10).

The Government supports the recommendations on perimeter fencing.
Local authorities will be urged to amend safety certificates to
include requirements so as to implement recommendations 14, 15,
17 and to note recommendation         19 which varies     interim
recommendation 8. The revised recommendations on closure and
manning of gates in perimeter fences at football grounds will be
drawn to the attention of local authorities, clubs and police.

CRUSH BARRIERS (Recommendations 22/ 23)

22.   Inspection (interim recommendation 11).

23.   Review of layout (interim recommendation 12).

These are repeated from the Interim Report.        They have already
been commended to local authorities.

SAFETY CERTIFICATES (Recommendations 24-31)

24.   Mandatory conditions in safety certificates.

25.   Variation from terms of safety certificates.

26.   Terms of safety certificates.

27.   Review of safety certificates (interim recommendation 13).

recommendation 14).

29.   Annual   review  of   certificates;  annual         renewal   of
      certificates (interim recommendation 15).

30.   Review of arrangements for issuing certificates          (interim
      recommendation 16).

31.   Local authority advisory groups (interim recommendation 17/
      revised).

The Government agrees with the aims of these recommendations.
An order under S.15A of the 1975 Act will be made to implement
recommendation 24. Consideration will also be given to including
within the scope of such an Order provisions which will require
terms and conditions addressing other aspects of safety to be
included in safety certificates.
Local authorities will be urged to ensure the terms/conditions
in safety certificates are clear and unequivocal: they will be
reminded of the need to have an effective review system, the
desirability of a properly constituted team approach to
certification and the desirability of consulting club and
supporters association representatives.

Annual review of safety certificates already exists in effect
because annual inspections of designated grounds in connection
with safety certificates is already required by law.       The
Government will consider whether any change in the law should
be made to make annual renewal of certificates compulsory.

DUTIES OF FOOTBALL CLUBS (Recommendations 32-43)

32.    Measurement of turnstile flow (interim recommendation 18).

33 .   Correlation of turnstile       flow   and   capacity   (interim
       recommendation 19).

are supported by the Government.       Where appropriate, local
authorities will be asked to amend safety certificates to enforce
these recommendations.

POLICE PLANNING (Recommendations 44-53)

44.    Nomination of a Chief      Officer    for    liaison   (interim
       recommendation 26).

45.    Pre match briefing (interim recommendation      27).

50.   Early kick-offs and Sunday fixtures.

51.   Control room facilities.

52.   Training of senior officers.

53.   Charges for police services.

These^ recommendations, some of which are repeated from the
Interim^ Report are directed primarily to Chief Police Officers
and police authorities. The Government supports the proposal for
senior^ officer    training  and   the   objective    to  improve
effectiveness of policing at football matches.     The Government
agrees that the cost of policing inside grounds should be met in
full by clubs and will consider providing guidance to police
authorities after consultation with relevant representative
associations, to ensure consistency of practice.

COMMUNICATIONS (Recommendations 54-58)

54.   Radio communications (interim recommendation 31, amended).

55.   Provision of a command channel.

56.   Land lines (interim recommendation 32).

57.   Public address (interim recommendation 33).

      on hand signals withdrawn).

These are largely repeated from the Interim Report which the
Government has already urged clubs, local authorities and police
to implement.^ Chief Officers will also be encouraged to use an
additional, discrete channel of communications for police match
commanders.

CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES (Recommendations 59-63)

59.   Co-ordination (interim recommendation 35).

60.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 36).

61.   Communication with emergency services.

62.   Arrival of emergency vehicles (interim recommendation 37).

63.   Briefing of police officers (interim recommendation 38).

These recommendations are intended to ensure full co-ordination
and co-operation of the emergency services and are substantially
those covered in the Interim Report which the Government has
already endorsed. The Government will urge all those concerned
to comply with the further recommendation devised to        ensure
immediate summons of emergency services.

FIRST AID, MEDICAL FACILITIES AND AMBULANCES
(Recommendations   64-69)

64.    First aiders (interim recommendation 39).

The Government accepts these recommendations and will act on them
with urgency.
            SYMAS' INTERIM     RECOMMENDATIONS



Ambulance Service Attendance


At any Specified Activity where the attendance is expected

to exceed   25,000   and/or   the past history        and / o r   other

circumstances    indicate that ambulance service presence is

desirable (a "critical match"),     the holder of the safety

certificate should invite the statutory ambulance authority

to attend with such personnel,     vehicles and equipment as

shall be agreed between them but in any event not less than

an officer with one vehicle       and   crew,   the    appropriate

payment being made by the holder of the safety certificate.

This is in addition to the present attendance of St John

Ambulance Brigade or the British Red Cross.



First Aid Room



Each club being the holder of a safety certificate,               should

maintain a first aid room, equipped to a basic standard,              as

specified by the licensing authority after consultation with

the appropriate ambulance authority.
Doctor



The Football League,   Football Association and the relevant

licensing authority should require clubs holding safety

certificates and intending to stage a critical match to

arrange that the doctor in attendance:



a.   is trained and competent    in advanced   first aid to a

     standard equivalent to a NHS TA Paramedic;



b.   is available to treat any injured spectators and to

     attend the first aid room, when called upon to do so.




Communication



There shall be an agreed and common method of communication

between all the emergency services,   if necessary with the

assistance of a dedicated radio and/or telephone direct link

to the ground and the respective headquarters.




Liaison



Before each critical match the liaison officers from the

police and ambulance service should make contact and arrange
 to be in direct contact with each other during the match.

The police liaison officer should be in direct contact with
police control.



Emergency Plan



For    all designated grounds there should be a joint and

common      emergency plan drawn     up by      the    relevant   police

authority,     fire service,   statutory ambulance authority and

the holder of the safety certificate.              The emergency plan
should detail:



a.    The   relevant    function    of   each    service      during    an
      emergency.



b.    The liaison officer from each service,                preferably by

      name,   their    respective    station          and   particular
      responsibility.



c.    The agreed rendezvous points for each service and the

      (named) police officer who is responsible for collating

      and   issuing    information   to,     and      coordinating     the

      response of, the relevant services.



d.    Emergency access and egress.
 e.    Casualty clearing point.



 f.    Preferred routes to and from hospitals, to be kept clear
          the police during an emergency.




 Licensing Authority



The licensing authority should satisfy itself before issuing

the safety certificate that a joint and common emergency

plan (as described in paragraph 6 above) is in existence for
the designated ground.




Advice From Statutory Ambulance Authority



The statutory ambulance authority should be asked to advise

the issuing authority for each safety certificate on the
question of:



a.    access and egress for ambulances



b.    medical equipment



c.    attendance   of    ambulance   personnel   and vehicles   at
      critical matches
            and should be consulted before there is any variation in

           the terms of the safety certificate as regards items a,
           b and c above.




9.   Amendment to 1975 Act



     SSGA    1975       be   amended   so   as   to   require   the            licensing

         Dear Colleague

         H-i11 shnroiigh Football Grnimri Disaster

         Here are some notes I made of the discussion we had on 12 May.   Perhaps you
         could confirm that they are a correct record of the issues and the action we
         need to take.   If there are any aspects that concern you, please give me a
         ring.

             It would seem, now that the collection of evidence has been completed by
             Lord Justice Taylor, that it would be appropriate to have a meeting with the
             police representatives on issues such as communications.

             In the meantime, no doubt the issues that were raised as individual matters
             are being or have been considered a& part of the individual unit’s debriefing
             arrangements.

             Yours ^^ncerely

                           HILLSBOROUGH FOOTRAI.I. GROUND DISASTER


          Note of issues discussed at debriefing meeting held at the
   Northern General Hospital on Friday. 12 Mav 1989 with representatives of
        District, the Roval Hallamshire and Northern General Hospitals
                  and the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service


IS.sas._JL       Initiation of Procedure

                 It was noted that forewarning could be received from a variety of

                 sources, although the police was the most likely.         It was also

                 recognized that initiation could be undertaken by any of the

                 emergency services but it was considered to be preferable that the

                 ambulance service undertook that responsibility.         The question of

                 confirmation by the hospital to ensure that the reported incident

                 was not a malicious false alarm, was recognised.         However, it was

                 also generally agreed that it was better to initiate the

                 procedure and then stand down rather than have delay and

                 vacillation in the early minutes of notification of an incident.




Issue        2   C o m mun ic ati on

                 Consideration was given to the question of communications between

                 the hospitals, police and ambulance authorities, and the use of

                 ‘red* ex-directory lines between SYMAS and the Accident and

                 Emergency Departments.      Having discussed various possibilities,

                 the preferred solution, on balance, was the use of the ‘red’ ex­

                 directory lines between SYMAS and A and E.          Links with the police

                 would continue to be established in accordance with current

                 practice.




Issue    3 Who    decides within the hospital      that   the maior    disaster   procedure
                 is to be put in hand

                 It was noted that the Royal Hallamshire Hospital had an internal

                 procedure with a medical check, whereas the Northern General


                                             1
   Hospital did not, before activating the procedure through the

   telephonist.     After discussion, it was agreed that the Accident

   and Emergency Department was the central pivot, and switchboard

   operator should set the call out procedure in motion after a check

   by a senior member of the Accident and Emergency Department on

   duty.     it was noted that if the police initiated the procedure,

   including using such terms as ‘standby’, an immediate check would

   be made with the Ambulance Service.




  It was also agreed that if casualties started arriving without

  prior notification, the senior professional member of staff in the

  A and E Department would put the disaster procedure in motion

  immediately.




Distribution    Procedures   for   Injured   Pai

  4.1 the first receiving hospital would be selected by the

      Ambulance Service and would be dependent on both which

      department was open and ease of access, bearing in mind the

      location of the disaster.




 4.2 The method of diversion of casualties from the first receiving

     hospital was discussed.        It was agreed that the senior doctor

     m     ^ e Accident and Emergency Department at the first

     receiving hospital would notify SYMAS when he/she decided that

     further casualties needed to be diverted to another hospital.

     If possible, the second receiving hospital would be notified

     by the first receiving hospital in advance.       Any diversions

     beyond the immediate city hospitals would again be initiated

     through the Ambulance Service.
9< '


       Issue 5      Children’s Casualties

                   After consideration, it was decided it would not be appropriate to

                    change the existing procedures, and children’s casualties,

                   eminating from a major disaster, would be taken to the district

                   general hospitals.          At the same time, assistance would be sought

                   from the Children’s Hospital for any specialist medical and

                   nursing help and, at an appropriate time, casualties would be

                   transferred to the Children’s Hospital following initial care in

                   the district general hospitals.




       Issue   6 Public    R adio   Messages

                    It was agreed that a check needed to be made of the pre-recorded

                   messages to be broadcast by local radio in the event of a major

                   disaster, informing staff of action which they should take if off

                   duty.




       Issue   7 Site   Medical     Officer   and    Site   Medical   Teams

                    Consideration was given to the possibility of changing the

                    existing procedure.             It was agreed that the existing procedure

                    should stand whereby        the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service site

                    officer would call both for a site medical officer and/or site

                    medical teams as he felt necessary.               In the event of such call,

                    it was agreed that asenior anaesthetist             and senior surgeon

                    (consultant or senior registrar) would need to be despatched to

                    the scene.       It was noted that the Ambulance Service would

                    continue to send a vehicle, to transport the site medical officer

                    and/or site medical teams to the scene of the incident.




                    It was noted that the inquiry being undertaken by Lord Justice


                                                     3
             Taylor might well advise on attendance at major sporting events of

             professional emergency teams rather than relying, as at present,

             on sporting organizers making their own arrangements with the Red

             Cars, St John’s Ambulance Service, etc.




Issug— §. Whst— iff, to be— carried by Site Medical Teams    bv wav of Equipment.

             Drugs. Etc?

             Consideration was given to the different arrangements in the

            Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals.         The Northern

             General Hospital had assumed that it could well be the second

             receiving hospital and would, therefore, be the most likely

             hospital to be asked to send an emergency team.        Accordingly, it

             planned to carry equipment, drugs, etc, on the basis of treating

             20 casualties, whereas the Royal Hallamshire Hospital worked on

             the basis of sending a mobile team to a single incident as opposed

             to a major disaster.        Mr Hopkins referred to the major disaster

            vehicle standing by at SYMAS which carried substantial equipment

             and supplies which would provide a back-up to any mobile team

            despatched by the hospitals.




            After some discussion, it was agreed that the Accident and

            Emergency consultants would have further discussions between

            themselves and SYMAS as to what equipment would be carried by whom

            to the scene of any major incident.




Issue., 9 Action   bv   District   and   Unit   Controls

            Consideration was given to the various arrangements which had been

            made at the time of the Hillsborough disaster relating to the




                                           4
function of the Bed Bureau, clearance of beds within hospitals and

links with the press.




The role of the Bed Bureau, in diverting other emergency workloads

away from the hospitals receiving the casualties from a major

disaster, was confirmed.




With regard to clearance of beds, and particularly transfers to

other hospitals to create space in the main receiving hospitals,

the procedure had worked well and any minor re-arrangements would

be considered between the units concerned.




With reg:ard to the press, the importance of gathering information

in one central control, which, it was understood, was the Police

Authority’s responsibility to establish, would be further

considered with the Police, and the possibility of gathering the

information on a computer base at the individual hospitals capable

of transferring information between the hospitals and the Police

Authority, would be considered as a means of expediting a

comprehensive casualty list and condition state for all

appropriate spokesmen to draw upon.




It was decided that, for clarification of the various local

controls in the hospitals and also the Police, Ambulance and Fire

Authorities, the District control role should be reviewed and put

in writing.
Issue   10 Who     does   what

            Arising from the discussion on the District control role, further

             consideration was given to the role of the police concerning

             enquiries on casualties and the method of providing information to

             the Police.         Secondly, hospital condition checks;   this again

             raised the question of hospital information to be linked and

             transmission of information to relatives’ holding areas.          The

             ease of supply of hospital information, establishing comprehensive

             alphabetical index at individual hospitals and between hospitals,

             was given a further airing.




             It was agreed that clarification would be required on these issues

             and a scheme prepared.




Issue   11 Radio    availability     and use    for   Communications

             There was a general feeling that radio communications were not the

             most appropriate or efficient way of proceeding and, whilst

             recognizing that facilities were available at the Royal

             Hallamshire and Northern General Hospitals, it was agreed that

             this matter be given further consideration as part of general

             communications between the hospitals, the Health Authority central

             control, the Ambulance and Police Authorities.




             It was noted that, for certain communication functions within the

             hospitals, runners were more effective than telephone

             communications.




                                            6
Issue    12   Relatives

              Discussion took place on the arrangements which had been made for

              both accommodating and informing relatives, and of the

              arrangements for support staff for counselling, arranging

              accommodation and transport, supplying information, etc.    It was

              agreed that had the incident not occurred on a Saturday, then some

              of the arrangements would not have worked as well in terms of

              accommodation being readily available and, in any case, it was

              noted that more private offices and separate interview rooms were

              needed.




Issue   13 Standard Format of Frontispiece    of Maior Disaster Plans

              It was agreed that the two hospitals frontispiece should be a

              common format with common information which would also be

              available to the Ambulance, Police and Fire Authorities, and

              arrangements would be made for such standard format to be

              prepared.




Issue   14 Reception and Control of Volunteers. including Non-Base Hospital.
             Staff. (ie staff arriving at a hospital which was not their usual
             place of work)

              It was agreed that whilst volunteers and non ‘base* hospital staff

              fulfilled a valuable role, a procedure was required to enable the

              most effective use to be made of such persons, including reception

              and direction to appropriate areas of work through the central

              hospital controls.




Issue    15   W h at   if?

               It was recognized that the experience learned from the

              Hillsborough disaster might be considered a typical in view of the
               similarity of the casualties and the non-surgical nature of the

               incident, and it was agreed that consideration should be given

               within the hospitals and on a District-wide basis, on the issues

               which would arise from various other scenarios, eg large numbers

               of surgical casualties, incident happening during the working

               week, etc.




Issue     16   Other

               Various general issues were raised at this time, including the

               need for scanning facilities at the Northern General Hospital, the

               roles of other hospitals in their supporting functions, the number

               of official visitors and timing, and the diverse nature of press

               enquiries, including foreign press.

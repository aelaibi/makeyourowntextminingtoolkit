              noticed a steady                  stream of N o t t i n g h a m       fans arriving              in plenty of time

causing        no     problems.

At 'approximately' 2 . 0 0 p m the same                           day    I p ositioned my horses                          'in.-.

were    obviously             d e a d , the       ones who        se e m e d    to have       gone    blue          so quick,

attempted          to    revive           her.        The most     sad of all           w hen a      lad who          looked

no more      than        twelve           passed       by us the        police mans ano rack                rell          from

the    body showing                 him dead.

I counted          to sixty              five    or    so and even then               it.just      didn't           sink       in

what    had happened.

Ambulances             were    then a r r iving            in droves           all    sense    of time          had gone

and then the             feeling           of horror        thinking           back    that    it w o u l d         not have

drun k e n stupor             they had got              t h emselves         into.

All    the m o u n t e d       officer s          at    the back        of     the North S t a n d were               then

deployed       to a s s i s t            fans    on their way home after                     the game had been

abandoned.

I was at the             bo t t o m       of H i l l s b o r o u g h Park,         m ain gates and          saw"a.crowd

there were people being pushed to the ground and walked over, fans were also climbing
over the walls into what by now was obviously a very dangerous situation.
I attempted to halt the flow of fans, it was by now an impossible task. As I looked at
the ones who had not yet pushed their way into the ground I could see from my experience
                                                                               A
that they were not only drunk but wild with it, not listening to me nor to **e|3on • The fans
were jeering, pushing, and attacking a police horse with fists as they were being carried
along with the flow.
Seeing that it was a lost cause to try and get the gates closed I looked towards Leppings
Lane. The gates that are opened to let police vehicles gain access til   the   rearofthe South
Stand were wide open. I then placed my horse accross    this gap to stop the    flowoffans
in an attempt to regulate them. %• now we looked to have started to regain control of the
situation, another horse came to my right hand side and did the same to block the gates
next to the ones I was at. I was being spat at   and a string of abuse from drunken louts
was being directed towards myself and two other mounted officer's I could see.
After we had totally regained control and the crowd was just a steady stream Inspector
Davies, Mounted department appeared and instructed me to check tickets of the few fans that
were left outside. This I did   although there was by now no problemn.
Almost immediately after this order from Insp Davies    Along with about another seven mounted
officers I was instructed to go to the rear of the North Stand as we were informed that ther
was a pitch invasion.
On arrival I saw the dog section with their dogs out of their vans    going on to the pitch,
along with many foot officers. A short while later the dog section came of the pitch and
all that was left was a large amount of foot officers facing the Kop.
A message came over the radio from the officer next to me saying that there were people
dead. This didn't sink in untill I saw a youth being carried out on a stre&fehaa? and pirt
at the side of a St. Johns ambulance out of the view of the public.
From then there was a steady stream of bodies being carried out some on stretchers     carried
by foot officers and many more being carried by football fans. They were by this time
using the advertising boards as make do forms of transport for the bodied.
For some reason I dont know why but I started counting the ones that were obviously dead,
the ones who seemed to have gone blue so quick, the ones with vomit at the sides of their
faces on the stretchers , the woman with her clothes high aroung her neck as though someone
had attempted to revive her. The most sad of all when a lad who looked no more than twelve
passed by us the police mans anorack fell from the body showing him dead.
I counted to sixty five or so and eveh then it just didn't sink in what had happened.
Ambulances were then arriving in drives all sense of time had gone and then the fealing
of horror thinking back that it would not have happened had the Liverpool idiots not
turned up so late and in the drunken stupor they had got themselves into.
All the mounted officers at the back of the North Stand were then deployed to assist fans
on their way home after the game had been abandonned.
I was at the bottom of Hillsborough Park, main gates and saw a crowd of perhaps thirty
fans fighting violently amongst themselves. I galloped towards them and they dispersed
unfortunately I was unable to get hold of any of them. They just hadn't had enough.

REPORT OF P.C .VL^VL WHEATCROFT   NIAGARA. STABLES, SHEFFIELD.   MOUNTED DEPARTMENT. \



At 8«OOam on Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at Niagara stables, Sheffield*
I am thw regular rider of Police Horse LOXLEY, and in this capacity I groomed the said
horse for the Semi final football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
At 10.00am the same day I along with other members of the mounted department attended a
briefing for members of Nott's, Liverpool, and our own mounted departments. The br*€fing
was conducted overall by Superintendent Marsh Operations Division, and most of the relavent
facts put by Inspector Daviei South Yorkshire Mounted, to whom I was directly responsible.
On completion of the brifcfing we set fair our horses and paraded on the car park adjacent
to the 'Niagara Club*.
My working partner for the day was P.S. Watson Nott'S Constabulary. P.S.Watson and myself
were deployed on Penistone Roadclose to the entrance of the rear of the South Stand, Being
out as early as we were I took the opportunity to familiariseSgt Watson with the layout
of the ground.
On returning to our point on Penistone Road a short while later, I noticed a steady stream
of Nottingham fans arriving in plenty of time to get a good place in the ground. The fans
were in good humour and causing no problemns.
At approximately 2.00pm the same day I positioned my hores in Penistone Road, directly
outside the large blue metal gates which lead to the rear of the South stand. The volume
of Nottingham fans had increased to the extent that they were starting to spill inttf
Penistone Road. Iassisted the fans into their correct stand or seat for a good fourty
minutes, and assisted Inspector M.Booth in moving the fans towards turnstiles.
The Nottingham fans at this time were arriving carrying four pack's of beer and lager       to
the extent that it was almost impossible to deal with the problemn due to sheer numbers.
Atapproximately 2.^+Opm the crowd had mostly gone into the groun§ and the ones that were
left outside were ushered towards the turnstiles they requested.
At approximately 2.5Qpm I was instructed along with P.C. Swain a fellow South Yorkshire
mounted officer to go immediately to the Leppings Lane end of the ground. The instruction
came from P.S.Sorsby. Idid not have a radio so did not at that time realise what the problemi

was*                                     CKO'S-
Due to the urgency of P.S.Sorsby.P.C.Swain cantered along the rear of the South stand where
                                            /t*
on arrival I saw that the large blue gates where the mounted enter the ground were open
and a large group of fans were pushing to gain entry into the ground. Not knowing what
had caused the gates to be opened I attemted to block them off using my horse.
The crowd, if they can be called that weee more like animals, the stench of beer was over­
powering from the vast numbers that had obviously been drinking. There were Liverpool fans
being pushed to the floor and their fellow supporters stamping all over them. The ones I
saw get up again rejoined the push totally oblivious to the pain they were causing to
their own supporters.
From my position outside the gates I could see directly into the rear of the West stand
where the two central gatesallow supporters to the middle of the standing area of the West
Stand. The area was full of what I can only describe as idiots pushing with nowhere to eo

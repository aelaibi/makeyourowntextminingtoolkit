    just       off        Penistone            Rd    towards          the     City          Centre.



    I drove           out     of        the    main Penistone                 Rd       entrance          left into       Penistone             Rd,

    to       the    i s l a n d at        the       junction with Leppings                         L n a n d H a l i f a x Rd.            Turned

    At       this     time      there          were       not m a n y       supporters             at all       in the        area       of    the

    ground          in P e n i s t o n e        Rd       side.




    I went          to     the C a s h a n d             Carry       spending          about       15 m i n u t e s     and    I drove

    back       along        Penistone               Rd    and    there        is a       Pub       just    up f r o m    the B & Q

    towards          the     gr o u n d .




    I don't           know      the       name       of    the       Pub,    it's       a    big    stone       building           and    it    is

    on    the       opposite            side        of    the    r oad      r i gh t    opposite          the    dog     tra c k .




    There's          a big         paved area              in    front       of    the       Pub and       I saw        between          SO    or

This    would        be    between          1.SO      pm    (1320       hrs)        to    1.30    pm    (133 0     hrs).




I drove        bac k      to    the    club and            I saw a        few       scattered          supporters            walking

along       Penistone           Rd    towards         the    ground.




I assumed          they were           Notts       Forest         supporters              because       this      was    their

side    of     the     gro u n d .




I drove        back       in o n t o       the   club       car    park.




I'd    collected           some       glasses         from    the C a s h           and    Carry and          I dropped         them

off    at    one     of    the       side    entrances            to    the     kitchen          at    the    back      of    the

South       Stand.



I went       and     gave       th e S e c r e t a r y      his    keys       back        to    his    car a n d       then    waits

around       the     foyer       a r ea.




This    would        be a b o u t      2    pm   (1400       hrs)       a n d at         this    time    the      team       coaches

began       to a r r i v e .




When    the      Liverpool            team arrived            and       had     gone       to    the    changing         room       I

waited       nearby        in    c ase      they wanted            anything,              like    tea    or    cof f e e .



That's       all     I d i d up        until       kick-off            time     3    pm    (1500       hrs).




I never        left       the    building          or w e n t      to     the       pitch area          u n til    3    pm    (1500

hrs)    so     I can't          say w hat        the       crowd       s i t u a t i o n was      up    to    that      time.




Just    before        3    pm    (1500       hrs)      the    practice              balls       were    passed         from    the

pitch ar ea          up    to    the       top   of    the    Players           tunnel.

I was     there       with                                                  and




We    then    put     the    practice           balls     into      the      boot       room,



We    then    locked        all     the    dressing          r o oms     and      with     the       others,       I went        down

the    tunnel       to m y    seat        behind       the    Liverpool            dug     out       which    is    on    the

left    side     of    the    tunnel        as    you     look      towards          the     pitch.




The    match     had    just        kicked       off    as    I reached            my     seat,        I know       that a

Liverpool        player       had     just       hit    the    goal         post     or    c r oss     bar.        I had

missed       that     happening.




As    I reached my           seat     I noti ced the K o p w i t h N o t t s                     Forest       supporters

was    full.




The N o r t h   EStand for          Liverpool           fans     was        also     full.




I d i d n ’t n o t i c e     th e   South        Stand       because         it was        b e h i n d me.




The West        stand and           terraces       were       full       I could          not    tell      from where            I

                sitting          on       the    edge        of    the    pitch.




                There       wa s      a    continual              stream        of    people       getting          over     t his    fencing.




                1 also       saw          many       f ans    being       pulled           up f r o m    this       terracing         into       the    West

                I remember                seeing        Police          walking        along       the     North       side      track      at    this

                fans       were       now       over      the      fencing           onto    the    track        and    pitch.



                They were             just       sa t     down and a               few w ere       lying        down.




                This       was     just         two     or    three        minutes          a f t e r I s a w the      firstsupporter

I just          saw    the     g ame      stop and         because       of    this    I went       b ack    up       the    tunnel

to    open       up the        Players         dressing          rooms.



The       players          went     into      the    dressing       rooms       I remember          making        a    cup       of

tea       for    Brian        Clough         the    Notts    Forest       Manager       and    I took        it to          him

into       his       teams     dressing            room,




I can't          remember           how      long    I stayed       in the       dressing       room a r e a           I can't

remember             much     more      about       what    was    happening.




I    do    remember           going       back      down    the P l a y e r s    tunnel       towards       the        pitch          two

or    three          times     to    have      a    look w h a t    was       happening       but    I could           not       see    a

thing       because           so m a n y      people       were    on    the    pitch .




On    one       of    the     times       I walked         down    the    Players       tunnel       I was        stood          in

front       of       the    tunnel,          just    on    the    pitch       I saw a Liverpool             supporter,                  I

knew       t his      because        of      his    accent.        He w a s     standing       on    the     pitch about

a yard          away       f r o m me     facing         towards                              who     is a s s i s t a n t

groundsman             and who          was    also       about    a yard       from    me,




The       Liverpool          Supporter             was    shouting       in                direction,




He was          on a b o u t      they       should       have    been    in the       Hop    end.                    was

trying          to    talk     to    him,      trying       I-think       to    calm    him    down




The       supporter           said      to               something       1 ike \ J u s t     'cause    you've           got a

      I don't          know where                        went       and    I    don't           know where             the       supporter         went




      1 can       only       describe             the    supporter             as     being          about        SO years          old    about

      5*4- tall         of a v e r a g e          build with          medium              length          h air      dark     brown       col oured:

      He    had a       proper          moustache.




      He was          wearing          blue       jeans    and       either           a    blue       top       or    b lue      denim     shir t .



      I went          back       up    the    tunnel       and       stood          up     the       top with                             to     make

      sure       no    one       could       get    into       the    Players              dressing             rooms,




      I can       only       remember             going    down       the       tunnel            again         and    seeing       a     ro w    of

      Policemen across                   the       width       of    the       pitch,           at    the       half       way     line    facing

      towards          the       West    Stand.




      That's          all    1' can      remember          I spent             th e       r est      of    the       time     around       the

      changing          room areas.




      I did       not       see       anyone       who    had       died       I only           saw       one     injured          person        and
                                                                                                                                       PAGE         8
                                                                                                                                       S 1035

*   t hat      was    a    little          lad a b o u t        10 or        12 y e a r s      old    carried          in a

    Policeman's                arms       up the        tunnel         and       he w a s    taken     to    the

    Physiotherapists                      r oom a n d      l aid       down.         I remember            the    little         lad    crying

    "I'm       not    going          to    die     am    I?,      I'm not          going       to    die".




    I went       to       the    kitchen           to    fetch         some       ice   for     the    lad a n d        I took         it to

    the P h y s i o ' s         room and           the     Policeman              put   the     ice    on the          l a d's     stomach.




    I then       left          the       room.




    I also       saw a woman                 about       40 years            old     come      up    the    tunnel          wi t h a man

    the     same      age.           She    was     holding            one    of     her    arms      across        her       che st.        She

    also       went       into       the    Physio's            room.         I didn't          see    her       again.




    I never          saw any more                actual         injured           people.




    I did       go    back       onto        the     pitch and            gave       out    cups      of w a t e r      to     people

    standing          around.




    I made       t hat         trip a        couple        of     times       to     give      out    water.




    That's       all       I     c an say.              I left         the    ground        about      6.30       pm    ( 1 8 3 0 hrs)       when

    I went       home. T h e         memo-cies          of   that        day will           l i v e w i t h me               for the     rest,

    of    my    life.            I 'm o n l y       glad        I dicfrv^t see             mo re     than    I did.

    I remember             saying          to    someone          at    about       half       past    two       ( 1 4 30     hrs)     there

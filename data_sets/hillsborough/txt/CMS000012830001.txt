Mr Kinghan

LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY AND THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

The Secretary of State was grateful for your minute of 27 July. Both
he and Mr Moynihan will attend the Home Secretary's meeting, which
is at 5.00pm on Wednesday, 2 August.

I should be grateful for further briefing for Ministers as soon as
you have had an opportunity to study Lord Justice Taylor's interim
report.

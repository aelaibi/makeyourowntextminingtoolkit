Lord Justice Taylor                               19th April 1989
Hillsborough Inquiry
Sheffield.




Your Honour,


I write to make an observation on the subject of your enquiry,
based on my personal experience as a football supporter with some
knowledge of the Hillsborough stadium.

Essentially the tragedy was an outcome of human error and
circumstance.  But several features of the stadium itself added
to the events. I list these below.

1.   The small number of turnstiles at the Lapping Lane end.

2.   The absence of signings once through the       turnstiles   to
indicate alternative entrances to the terracing.

3.   The penning barriers - these are a relic of seasons previous
when both   home and away supporters could stand at   that end ofthe
ground.     For some years now the Lepping Lane end   has been given
over totally to visiting supporters, thus ending their purpose.
They could have been removed some time ago.

4.    The   absence of aisles or gangways to facilitate   the
distribution of crowds away from the more populated areas of
terracing.

This final point is I feel the crucial one and one that       has
received scant attention so far. At Lapping Lane      on    enteringthe
viewing area the spectator is immediately on the terracing.    To
move away from the area he finds himself in the supporter can
only use the terracing.   This compares with for example Goodison
Park. Here at each entrance on the terracing the spectator finds
a system of aisles permitting movement to any part of the
terracing.  In other words spectator movement is via gangways and
not by threading through the terracing itself.




                                                                          2
Whilst the gradual move towards more seating in stadiums will
continue I feel it would cripple the structure of the sport in
England to enforce such arrangements on clubs at this stage. The
costs of conversion are not just those of installation of seats
but of lost revenue from reduced capacities and lost support.
And anyway the risks of a repetition of Saturdays tragedy could
simply be removed by the adaption of terracing to provide for
gangways.

I would recommend the Commission visit Goodison Park and look at
the Gwladys Street end of the ground to see how terracing, with a
capacity of over 14000, can provide perfect safety - with
perimeter fencing.


Yours faithfully.

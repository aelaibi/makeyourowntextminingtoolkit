Whatever the outcome of the Inquiry we suggest that entry to the ground
under no circumstances should be through a door established for egress
rather than ingress. Where absolutely necessary, entry should be purely
by turnstiles which slow down numbers and records them simultaneously
whilst consequently lowering pressure factors.

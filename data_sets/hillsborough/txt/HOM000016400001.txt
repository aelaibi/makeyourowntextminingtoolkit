Dear Sir,


re: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER      -   INQUIRY


I wish to advise you that I attended the Football
Match in question at Hillsborough and was involved both
Inside and outside the Ground from the Lepping Road end.

For this reason, I would wish to give evidence to the
Inquiry.   Please advise.


Yours sincerely,




E LOYDEN M

                  Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster


Your Lordship,

Thank you for your reply to Mr.Ken Walker's letter of 24th
October 1989 in respect of the research which the Inter-
Institutional Working Group feels in necessary.

In Mr.Walker's absence, and in my capacity as chairman of the
Working Group, I am pleased to be able to report that
considerable progress has been made in preparing advice to your
Inquiry. Though far from complete, the enclosed should enable
you to see the depth of the problem which the industry perceives
needs to be addressed, and we hope that it may be of benefit to
your Inquiry.

In trying to prepare a revised Guide or Code of Practice there
have been a large number of issues to be resolved in order to
get it right. The input of the whole industry as well as
operators, authorities and other interested parties has been
started, especially with the debate at the recent IOA Reproduced
Sound Conference at Windermere earlier this month, and the
publication of the Proceedings of that Conference.

Our Working Group anticipate being able to send a draft of this
Code of Practice in the near future, but it is likely not to be
available before the end of the year.

The Working Group would appreciate it if you could indicate if
this would be useful to your Inquiry. Meanwhile, I remain,

yours faithfully




Stephen P Jones
Chairman to the Working Group for
Safety at Sports Grounds (Sound Systems)

Object of the Group:

To be able to offer to whoever requires it, guidelines and or
specifications for the design and use of Sound Systems for
Safety at Sports Grounds.                    /



Composition of the Group;

Institute of Sound & Communication Engineers - Stephen Jones
                                               (Chairman)

Noise Council (Institute of Environmental Health Officers
Appointee) - T.B.A.

                                               (Secretary)

                                For

                    Safety at Sports Grounds

                         (Sound Systems)



The working group proposes the following:-


 A) The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds be re-worded



  B) A research programme be commissioned



  C) Commissioning of a Working Party to produce

        (i)   Guide to Sound Systems for Safety at Sports
              Grounds

        (ii) Guide to CCTV    Systems for Safety at Sports
             Grounds


  D) The introduction of a two part licensing system
     specifically for the Communications Systems at Sports
     Grounds to be administered by the Local Authority
     licensing officers

        (i)   A systems license valid for 5 years

        (ii) An event license valid for each event

     with a recommendation that these licenses only be granted
     if the guidelines (see c above) are met in full.

Expansion of the points raised in the foregoing proposals:-


The Existing Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
To do justice to the subject of sound and communication in
sports grounds would make the current format of the Guide
unwieldy - hence the cross reference to two separate
publications.

Research of Noise Levels
As previously explained, not enough is known about the effects
of crowd packing in the open, under a canopy, or in a corridor
to properly specify objective design parameters for effective
emergency sound systems. Similarly not enough is known about
the psychological & psychoacoustic effects of various warning
tones and emergency messages to be able to determine whether
they would actually help or hinder in any given situation.

Guide to Sound Systems and CCTV Systems
These guides will enable the standards of systems installation,
operation and test to be objectively established and enforced.
They should be written in the style of British Standards so
that they can be offered (via BSI) to CEN for possible
adoption. Members of this working group are a^Lso appreciative
of the facts that

   a) the establishment of a standard is measured in years, and
   b) The European linking may cause unnecessary complications
      and delays to the needs of Britain.
                                    t


Two Part Licensing:
No system will be effective unless it is designed and installed
correctly, is fully operational, and therefore has undergone
routine tests and maintenance.

No system will be effective unless not only do the audience
know what to expect, but that the system is used correctly.

The design and installation are permanent and therefore a
system license for 5 years is reasonable. The 5 year timescale
should be fast enough for potential changes in legislation, yet
long enough not to overburden the sports ground operators.

The continual operability of the system is something which does
need constant monitoring, and hence falls quite neatly in the
same category as existing licensing practice.

The use of the system is partly definable and is a matter of
education more than legislation, (i.e. intelligibility starts
with the voice of the announcer)

Prior to sports taking place:-
Standard procedure announcement made (as done in aircraft)
advising the public that the emergency arrangements are about
to be demonstrates.

           An example of the subject matter to be included in a Guide
                or Code of Practice for Safety at Sports Grounds

Public Access Routes

     Public access control according to site design and in
     consultation with staff and authorities.


CCTV Coverage = Paging Zones

     Zoning of the paging facility to be generally coordinated
     with camera coverage.
     Paging to also cover areas not in the view of cameras.
     Automatic sequenced pre-recorded evacuation messages shall
     be capable of being overridden or muted.
     Local paging inputs for turnstiles.
     Local paging inputs in the case of camera failure.


Sound System Design Parameters

     Calculating the sound pressure level (SPL) required of the
        system.
     Control of the SPL under non-emergency conditions.
     Mains supplies - Uninterruptible or battery back-up.
     Intelligibility - frequency response, distortion,
        dispersion.
     Control panel ergonomics - Microphone performance.
     Installation standards - Cabling, housings, etc.
     Maintenance Programmes.
     Correlation of sound and vision systems where possible.
     Correlation rather than conflict with fire alarm systems.
     Maintaining the integrity of evacuation systems whilst
        being also available for other purposes i.e.
        entertainment.


Note: A fuller version of the first draft was published in the
Proceedings of the Reproduced Sound Conference by the Institute
of Acoustics on November 3rd 1989, being the basis for
discussion at that Conference, and under revision as a result
of those and other discussions.

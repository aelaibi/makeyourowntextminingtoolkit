            Dear Sir Douglas
            HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY
            TRIBUNAL OF INQUIRY
            At a meeting of the Finance and General Purposes Committee of the Police
            Authority last Friday, reference was made to the establishment of the
            independent enquiry to be carried out by Lord Justice Taylor. The Committee
            wholeheartedly welcomed the establishment of this enquiry but expressed concern
            as to how it would be financed, including particularly the investigation to be
            carried out by the Chief Constable of the West Midlands.
            The Committee felt that the terms of reference of the inquiry "to enquire into
            the events and to make recommendations about the needs of crowd control and
            safety at sports grounds" reflected the national importance of the issues raised
            and firmly indicated that finance should be made available by central
            government. You have yourself made it clear that the Chief Constable of the
            West Midlands will be reporting directly to Lord Justice Taylor.
            Preliminary announcements on the scale of the enquiry indicate a cost well in
            excess of Elm. Such a cost if borne locally would eliminate the Police
            A u t h o r i t y ’s provision for operational contingencies with a consequential threat
            to the efficiency of the force. It would also leave the Authority completely
            stripped of financial resources to face the uncertainties of next y e a r ’s
            budget.

            The Committee therefore directed me to write to you on behalf of the Authority
            seeking your confirmation that the full cost of the Tribunal including the
            enquiry by the Chief Constable of West Midlands will be borne by central
            government.
            Yours sincerely


            R C Johnston
            Clerk and Financial Officer

POLICE INVESTIGATION INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY
This note is simply to record, as copy recipients will already
know, that Mr Hillier the Assistant Chief Constable of the West
Midlands Police telephoned on Thursday 20 April to ask whether
the West Midlands Police could look to the Home Office to cover
their costs arising from the investigation into the Hillsborough
incident.

2. Mr Hillier said that the West Midlands Police were proposing
to deploy several hundred men and to rent offices in Sheffield
and possibly Merseyside, though on Merseyside they may use
accommodation provided by the Merseyside Police.     There was a
strong possibility that the total cost of the investigation could
be about £1 million.

3.   Mr Turney tells me that this is something which you are
looking into, and I have told Mr Hillier that that is the case.
I have also told him that the position is complicated because the
investigation is being conducted, as I understand it, for 3
separate purposes:   to service the tribunal, in response to the
South Yorkshire Chief Constable's request for assistance, and to
service the inquest.    He should therefore not expect a quick
reply.

4.   I also explained to him your responsibilities and those of
Mr Watts and suggested that any further enquiries about
Hillsborough should be addressed to you or him as appropriate.

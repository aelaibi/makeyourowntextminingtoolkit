Thank you for your letter of 21 June agreeing to the suggestion in
my letter of 25 May that we should work up a proposal for the
licensing authority provided by the Football Spectators Bill to
monitor local authorities' performance in granting and operating
safety certificates and to enforce any direction which you might
make about the contents of safety certificates in the light of Lord
Justice Taylor's report (my option C).

We subsequently spoke about the need for an Instruction from the
House of Commons to the Standing Committee on the Football
Spectators Bill to enable the Committee to consider an amendment on
this subject, since safety is not within the present scope of the
Bill. I have agreed with the Business Managers that we should move
this Instruction with Second Reading next Tuesday 27 June, rather
than come back to the House at a later date while the Bill is in
Committee. I have asked Parliamentary Counsel to table the enclosed
Instruction tomorrow.
The Instruction is widely drawn, in order to ensure that it provides
for the amendments that we may need to make to the Bill. I propose,
however, in my speech on Second Reading on Tuesday to explain what
we have in mind, ie that the licensing authority will be backing up
your existing powers under the Safety of Sports Grounds legislation
(though only in relation to designated football matches in England
and Wales); and ensuring that we can act upon Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations.

I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, the Ministers
present at her meeting of 9 May,to John Major,and to Sir Robin
Butler.                   .            y

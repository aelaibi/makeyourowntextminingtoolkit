       INQUESTS


       The purpose of this letter is twofold.       First, I thought you
       would wish to he aware that the Attorney General has now received
       a formal'application under section 13 of the Coroners Act .1988
       for his consent to the making of ian application to the High Court
       for an order quashing the inquisitions in respect of six of the
       victims of the Hillsborough disaster.     You will recall, that the
       Attorney General was informed at: his meeting on the 12 February
       1992 with Mr George Howarth MP and Mr Peter Kilfoyle_ MP that
       advice was being sought with a view to such an application.      It
       is a voluminous presentation drafted by Counsel and I have not
       yet had an opportunity to digest it.


       I leave it to you to, decide whether to alert your Ministers to
       this development;    the Hillsborough Action Group is alrea.dy
       trying to drum up some publicity for its application.


       On a separate issue,                   the Attorney General has also received a




      Thank you in anticipation of your cooperation.

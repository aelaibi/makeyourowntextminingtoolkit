FA/HILLSBOROUGH

■John Dyson QC's clerk phoned. He wanted to discuss fees.
He wanted to structure them differently from the normal High
Court case because of the peculiar nature of the Inquiry.
He would be doing odd bits here and there even when he was
not in Sheffield. I agreed that he would be working on the
written submission with us whilst he was not actually being
an advocate at the Inquiry.

The clerk said he did not want to make money out of other
people's misfortunes but he had to look at it on a
commercial basis. I entirely agreed.

He said a normal brief fee for a 6 week substantial
commercial action would be £40,000 for Mr Dyson. He had in
mind that figure. He had in mind £1,400 a day for
refreshers whilst he was in Sheffield and whilst he was not
£1,000 for the work he would be doing down in London ie
reading transcripts and general assistance in the case for
Phase 2 of the Inquiry,

He mentioned that if it went past June 30, ie if it ran
substantially into July he would require a top-up brief fee
of £5,000 for every month it overran.

I said I would discuss the level of those fees with v'l-tfR and
the client and get back to him.

Engaged 15 minutes including dictation

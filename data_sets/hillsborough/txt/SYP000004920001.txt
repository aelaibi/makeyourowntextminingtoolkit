             w a 1k i ng     past      the                 towards          Penistone          Rd.          I would          say

             approximately               between         20-30     of      them    but    1 d o n ’t k n o w w h i c h                 t eam.         I

             did     not     find      this     particularly               unusual       for      a    semi-final                day.

             At    about      3.05pm          (1505)       I left       the                   with                    to t ak e        her    to      the

             bus     stop.         Prior       to    leaving,        th e     other      cashier                                             had

             arrived         and     I ha d     given      her     specific            instructions                  to   keep     the       do o r

             leading         into      the     shop      area     locked      and       serve         only       through          the    hatch.

             The     traffic         was      not    too   b ad    untill         we    got    to      the       junction          with       Herri

             Rd.     South.          The H i l l s b o r o u g h     ground        is    j us t       on    the       r ig h t    hand       side.

             I noticed            between       50-150       supporters            standing            outside            the     turnstiles.

             They      were       b e in g   supervised           by P o l i ce O f f i c e r s            and       I did       not    witness

             any     trouble.

            •10.00am.

            In charge of my serial                was PS 577 Gardner and                 1 was     paired off with               -

           PC 70 White ley to             perform duties           in the S o u t h Stand.            Prior        to kick

           We    remained at the              inside/of      these     turns t i l e s   until     kick    off      time and

           the For est           fans e n t e r i n g the ground were           good humoured a n d            pleasant.

           A l t h o u g h a few canned soft drinks were                     taken from        people      entering the

           ground there were              no m ajor       problems.        An air horn was t aken from a

           Fo r e s t     fan and a bout 3 Liverpool               fans who       entered that          part of the

           only other            event   prior    to kick off was a youth that                     jumped over         the

    turnstiles w i t h o u t          paying.        He was    chased an d detained by PC 591 Tune

    and PC 60 G o d l e y who were also                 present      on the    inside     of these

    turntiles.

    S h o r t l y after     kick off PC 70 W h i t e l e y and PS Turner                 took some        cans of

    pop and the air             horn to the P o l i c e        room a n d I made my w a y upstairs

    into the S o u t h Stand.

    As   I wa l k e d    into    the    stared,      the game had begun.            The gr o u n d a p p e a r e d

    full and       I could       see fans starting            to   climb over the          fencing at the

    Leppi ngs Lan e ter racing.                 They began         s p i 1 1 ing onto the       perimeter

    track and numerous Po l i c e               officers were         heading      round the          pitch to

    that     end of the ground.                I looked for         other    officers      from my serial

    a nd found them            in anot h e r    entrance       to the stand.          I joined them so

    that we were ail             together       in case we were          to be     r e - d i rected to the

    pitch as        I was      under    the    i m pression that a pitch            invasion was taking

    place.

    As   I joined        them    (I    can recal 1 being           w ith PC    '1962 F iore-Hi rst and PC

    3341 Mitchell           an d PC      1584 Collier)         1 remember      seeing the fans            in the

    L e p p i n g s Lane    t e rracing       suring    forwards       towards     the    pitch and more              of

    them     climbing the          fences.       A senior P o l i c e       officer      then    ran onto the

    pitch to the           referee and stopped the g a m e .                 The   players made          their

    way off the          pitch and numerous Liver pool                  fans   ran towards            them.    The

    fans     from the L e p p i n g s Lane           end were      now spilling onto            the    pitch at

    that end of the ground.                    One    fan   ran from the L e p pings Lane               end and

    ran the entire             length of the          pitch to the S p i o n Hop that was                holding

    the Forest          fans.     He then began dancing and jigging about                             in front of

    them     in a provoking manner w hich                   caused the Forest            fans to break out

    into     chants.

    Po l i c e   o f f icers    chased him from the H o p end of the ground and he ran

    back towards           the Leppi ngs Lan e end w h e r e he was e v e n t u a l l y detained.

    I then saw that h u n d r e d s            of fans      from the L e p pings Lane            end had come

                                                                                                    R 1 88

onto the       pitch a n d we re milling about.                   At this    stage     I saw two Police

o fficers      c o nducting       heart massage         on a m a n     laying on the edge of the

pitch in front of the S o u t h S t a n d .

 It was at this           point      that    1 realised that           a serious incident        had

occurred.          The P o l i c e    officers at that           end of the field were by this

time     flooded by Liverpool                fans and       I could see heart m a s s a g e      being

conducted on numerous                 people on the floor.              PS 577 Gard n e r    then

informed us that we were                    being   re - d i r e c t e d onto the    pitch to assist

wit h w h a t e v e r we     could.

We ente red the           pitch via the         players       tunnel and as         I ran towards       the

L e p ping s Lane      end    I could see that              numerous     injured people were           being

carried awa y from that end of the                      pitch.         Some fans were just

w a n d e r i n g a r o u n d on the    pitch,      others were        running about      shouting and

swearing and others were                    tending    to    injured    people on the floor.

W i t h other      officers       I assisted,         where    possible,     to the     injured on the

pitch and          tried to move        the u n i n j u r e d to the side of the f ield so

that the       injured       could be seen and tended to more quickly.                          At this

point     numerous L i v erpool             fans began to surge          towards      the Ho p end      in a

threatening m a n n e r .            Subsequently,          along w i t h other      officers    I ran

towards      the K o p end of the ground to bring                      these fans back.          They

were e x t r e m e l y abus ive and m a n y were              having    to be phys i cally forced

back    towards       the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.                   The y were shouting

and swearing and making                 t h r e a tening     gestures    to the Fo r e s t   fans on

the Kop.

O nce   these      fans    had been m o v e d back           I formed    part of the      line of

o fficers across           the    pitch for a short            time.     Fans from L i v erpool         still

a t t e m p t e d to get     thro u g h towards        the Kop but were        prevented.

As   I was     standing       in this       line,     numerous     bodies were        conveyed    past me

on m a k e - d o   stretchers.         One    person,       a y o u t h aged about 20 years,            was

'-arried past        on an a d v e r t i s i n g    board,     and he was     laughing w i t h the

     Li v erpool    fans who were           carrying      him.       He a p p e a r e d   to consider        it all

     a big     laugh!      At    this     point w i t h several         other     officers     I was

     d i r ecte d to the        rear of the West S t a n d / L e p p i n g s Lane           terraces.

     As    I w a l k e d along    the access        road at      the    rear of the S o u t h Stand,

     towards L e p p i n g s Lane,         I saw several         people      being tendered           to.    The y

     were    laying     on the      roadway at the          rear of the Police Control                  box.        We

     walked     past    these     people      to L e p p i n g s Lane.       In the narrow        part of the

     access     road just off L e p p i n g s Lane,            there were         numerous ambulances.

     On the floor,         against        the fencing       of the      river     bank     I saw about        12

     people.       Some had their heads               covered w ith coats and shirts and

     others just        lay there,         o b v i o u s l y dead.

     We went      into the ground to the               rear of        the L e p pings Lane      terraces and

     there     I saw numerous           people     coming     from the       rear of the terraces.                  I

     formed     part    of the Police           line that      pre v e n t e d the fans w a l k i n g out of

     the g r o u n d , t h r o u g h the gates        that w o u 1d lead them d i r ectly to where

     the dead      lay.     T hey were        d i r e c t e d to gates further along a way from the

     dead.

     I also a s s i s t e d at      the    rear of the        c o n t r o 1 t u n n e 1 at the L e p pings

     Lane terraces         to    prevent      people going           back onto the         terraces.

     At the     rear of this         stand     I saw numerous Liverpool                   fans that were

     obviously d r u n k .        T h e y were    shouting an d swearing at the Police and

     called us      "Fucking m u r d e r e r s " .       One female         f an with some male             friends

     was    compla i n i n g a bout       having thrown her            ticket awa y after         getting

     into    the gr o u n d so she wa n t e d to know how she would get her money

     back.      This    caused      problems w i t h other L i v erpool              fans w h i c h    led to

     small     outbursts        of fighting w h i c h we had to split up.

     Two L i v erpool      fans,     one    in a turquoise           blue tracksuit a s s i s t e d us to

     re-direct      fans    to other gates an d the fans                    paid more a t t e n t i o n to

     them than they did to the Police.                       These S fans a s s i s t e d us greatly.

/I   After     these duties,         I attended        the de-brief          in the N o r t h S t a n d and
                                                                                                                    PAGE            5

           then formed part              of a cordon near           to the g y m n a s i u m holding         the dead.

           This was to prevent any u n a u t h o r i s e d access.

           At about 6 . 3 0 p m we we re told we could stand down and                              I made my way

           back     to H a m m e r t o n R o a d    in company w i t h PC 591 T u n e .            At H i l l s b o r o u g h

           C orner we were a p p r o a c h e d again by a L i verpool                    fan who      called us

            "Fucking m u r d e r e r s " .         On a r r iving   back at        Hammerton Road           I went        off

           duty at 7 . 0 0 p m .

           Throughout           the    p r e -match time all         contact      I had with fans was good

           h u m o u r e d and    pleasant.          These were        the N o t t i n g h a m Forest     fans.

           Wh i l s t    on the gate duties              there were a couple             of stewards        next     to us

I          at an exit           gate who let caterers             etc.    in and out and a s s i s t e d to

           direct        the fans       upstairs.

           The stewards           upstairs         in the S outh S t a n d , just stood about watching

            the events          taking    place on the          pitch an d      in the L e p p i n g s Lane        terracing


            I cannot        recall      seeing any other s t e wards at any other                      location        I

           attended.

           Whi l s t     on the       pitch,   even w hen t r y 1ng to help p e o p l e , I kept                 1ooking

           a r o u n d me due to the Liverpool                  fans     running aro u n d on the           pitch.         I

           was      pushed about         numerous        times by these         fans     in the 1 r efforts          to

^          r emonstrate w i t h me an d              in their a t t e m p t s   to get to the Forest               fans

           end of the ground.              These actions            caused      confusion on the           pitch and

           split        efforts       to help the        injured.

           Th r o u g h o u t   the    incident      I   cannot     recall any feelings            but a f t e r w a r d s      I

           was a f f e c t e d    by the way and amount                of resentment        shown towards myself

           a n d my      colleagues w h e n we had done                every t h i n g   that we     possibly        could.

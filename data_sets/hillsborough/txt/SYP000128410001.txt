THIS IS THE STATEMENT OF                    of 1
           Cheshire, the Father of               Deceased'who died at
Hillsborough Football Ground on 15 April 1989.                   ’'


1 have already made a statement to officers of West Midlands Police Force
and I am now making this further' statement- to clarify "the events 'which
occurred when X went to identify my Son’s body in Sheffield immediately
after the incident on 15 April 1989.


Once my Wife and-I had discovered that my Son was not on the coach which
reurned t o ________ ^ith his friendfe, we immediately left to travel to
Sheffield to make direct enquiries at the Hospitals.


We arrived in Sheffield at approximately 11.00 pm, and went to all of
the Hospitals in the immediate District.    The Staff at the Hospitals were
very helpful and we were taken into Intensive Care Units to see if air
was there.                   .'


We had to look at several unidentified injured persons who were not conscious
but, it became clear that our Son was not in the Hospitals.


We were then directed to Hillsborough with a Social Worker who drove us
there in his car.


When we arrived at Hillsborough, we had to park'' on the*main road near
the Football Ground and make our way through the many Press photographers
who had gathered outside.
                                                                                   ■
                                                           . ,          - --   -


Once in the' Ground, -we were directed to a queue'"‘in the'yard by the side .
of the Stadium and waited outside for approximately 1 hour! " We arrived
"at about 12.30       and whilst we were waiting, blankets ware handed out
to keep everyone warm.
 Once we arrived in the gymnasium, there were several boards with photographs
 of what w e   described as "unidentified people", and we were asked by the
Police Officer to look carefully at all of the photographs to see if we
could recognise our Son*          ■         ■        " '


The faces of the people in the photographs were a terrible sight as they
were mostly swollen, bruised and cut, and it was very difficult to recognise
any particular features.               *


We went along the board of photographs carefully but, did not recognise
our Son and whilst we thought one of the bodies was                the Police
Officer who checked, returned after' 10 minutes to say it was not our Son.


On a second viewing o f .the p Totographs, there was a person with a black
T-Shirt who we thought maybe          tat we did not tMnk that it was him
as to our recollection, he was not wearing a black T-Shirt.


However, when the Police Officer went to check, he cane back art said
that it was definitely our Son as there was a ticket on the body from
the Coach Company which bore the words

                                                                                                         r
                                                                                                         i '
It then became immediately clear that the Police had known all along that                    .           •,
our Son was in the mortuary and I asked why they had .not contacted us.                 ,       • b
                                                                                        ..       ,           i
We were advised by the Officer present that they did not have          ime
contact us and in any case proceedure did not allow them to do this.


1 carrot understand why we were put to. such suffering in'not knowing                                .   !‘

°ur Son had died in the tragedy and having to go through all of the agony
when it is clear that the Police knew .that our Son had been killed and             ,                    j-,i
presumably were aware o f this from when the body was brought to the n m   w                             M
which was likely to be in the late afternoon,                              '   ••                         ■■

There was only 1 telephone in the place and this was not for use for the
Public and accordingly, we could not notify anyone back home.


There are other natters about .which I wish to make a statement but, as
these relate to the actions of ■West Midlands Police, I will place them
in a separate -statement.          . ----------------

             On Saturday,              15-4-89 (150489)         I travelled to H i l l s b o r o u g h tea see the

              of the entrance Tee into the ground.

We arrived at the entrance to the ground at about £.43 - 2,50                                                   (1445) -

(1450).       There was a mass                   of    people at the entrance      to the ground and
                                                                         __________
we found ourselves              in this           crush,'       Me being            | and myself.

There was no order ly . q u e u e s ,                  There was a Mounted Police Officer there

and his horse stood on the heel o f                             my    trainers,            The crowd was so

qrsat that there w a s n ’t a lot that could be done to ease the

situation.          it seemed as though the                      fans at the back were pushing on

purpose,     as if it was part of the* fun of the gams,



1 can remember seeing two youths go over th© gate and into the

ground.      There were probably a lot mors,                                 I'm sure I saw the Police

helping them over.                The crush at the gates got quite bad and lasted

for about         two minings and than the gates opened and I and a number of

poeple went through.                  I          was behind me at this time and I got the

impressi on that they then tried to again                                  close the g a l e              which would

have separated us.                However w i t h the number                     of people there,              there was

no   chance of the gats being                         closed,        I seem to remember                   it being       both

a Steward and a Police Officer that opened the gate.



Inside      the    ground ws stood to the side to                            let the crowd go past.                      |

then started to walk towards the tunnel and I f o l l o w e d him.                                             1 d i d n ’t

We went along a tunnel with other                             people around us.                     As we got to, or

two people in front,                  which in that situation was only two feet away.

He was saying that he c o u l d n ’t breathe.                                   People were treading on my

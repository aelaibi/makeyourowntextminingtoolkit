   P.C. 265
   WOODSEATS POLICE STATION



At 9•30aro Saturday 15th April 1989 on duty at Hillsborough Football Ground and deployed
to serial 8 under S®?g*1£03 Harpies, Insp. Calvert.     At 1 2 .0 0 noon together with P.C. 2975
I was deployed to the rear of the Spdton Cop behind the turnstiles searching supporters
as they entered the ground .For-. •the next hour there was a steady flow of supporters
entering the ground.
                 .
    At approx. 1 ‘Opns I was signalled by P.S. Marples to join up with other officers
who were forming a seperating line between opposing supporters on the spion Kop.
    Just after the kick off I noticed a number of people on the outskirts of the pitch
in fronj of the Leppings lane stand*,     this time both myself and P.C. 2975 were positioned
at the front of the area layed aside for Liverpool Feins , preventing fans climbing
into that area from the passageway below. The number of fans     in front of the
Leppings Lane stand started to increase and I could see people climbing over the fence in
front of the stand. Eventually the game was stopped , this caused the Nottingham Forest
to start shouting threats and abuse to the Liverpool fans. At this point I thought
ttfet some sort of trouble was going to start on the Kop end but hhis was diffused when
the ambulance came onto the pitch.
      Serial 8 took no part^in       events at the Leppings lane end of the ground we were
penned in on the Kop end separating the Notts Forest fans from the Liverpool fans.
After the match was officially cancelled the Kop end was cleared of supporters and
and our serial was directed to the gymnasium area .
     At *f»50pm that same day serial 8 on mobile patrol in transit on Middlewood Road.
     At b.OOpm off duty at Sheffield Wednesday Ground

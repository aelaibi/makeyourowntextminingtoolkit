Agenda Item 1 - Minutes of Previous Meeting


1.   The minutes of the meeting on Tuesday 7 November
were agreed.


Agenda Item 2 - Matters Arising


2.   It was agreed to defer these matters for
consideration later in the meeting.


Agenda Item 3 - Report on Visit to Utrecht


3.   Professor Maunder reported that this had been a
worthwhile and instructive visit, not least because of
the realisation that the Dutch constructors, Ballast-
Needam, were now a wholly owned subsidiary of British
Aerospace, and, with the parent company, were involved
in discussion about the possible redevelopment/
construction of a number of stadia in this country.
The majority would follow the design of Utrecht, which
accommodated 20,000 spectators,   12000 of whom were
seated but that proposed at Birmingham would, by
contrast, accommodate approximately 100,000
Negotiations with the FA on this project were at a very
early stage and the information was consequently of a
commercially sensitive nature.
4.   The actual stadium at Utrecht was impressively
laid-out, and incorporated a number of commercial
ventures which utilised the spacing under the stands.
Office accommodation occupied the corners of the
ground, and these projects combined to bring in revenue
to the club.     The stadium had been financed by the
municipal authorities, but was now being handed over to
private ownership.


5.   As to ground characteristics, the pitch was
surrounded by a concrete moat approximately 3 metres
wide and 2 metres deep, giving a clear walkway round
the ground, and providing ingress/egress for emergency
vehicles.    Although possible for fans to descend into
the moat, few did so since visibility was very
restricted.


6.   Entry to the ground was by way of wide, level
tunnels which emerged at the bottom of the terraces and
stands.     There were no turnstiles.   Once through outer
gates guarding entry to the tunnels, fans could
purchase tickets at guichets set into the walls or, if
already in possession of tickets, proceed straight to
the end of the tunnel where stewards manned double
gates opened sufficiently wide to allow fans through
one at a time.     It was here that ticket inspection took
place.


7.   The design features of the stadium had enabled a
reduced police presence pitch-side, but it was still
necessary for a heavy police contingent to escort
visiting fans, especially those from "high-risk" clubs,
from the railway station to the ground.      Such fans were
bused in under armed escort and disembarked straight
into the tunnel leading to their section of terracing.
A similar process operated in reverse at the end of the
game, giving little opportunity for rival fans to
clash.    This system was facilitated by the amount of
space around the building which allowed coaches to draw
                                                                Action

up alongside the relevant tunnel.     It would clearly be
impracticable at many stadia in this country.


8.    Moulded, plastic seating had proved resilient and
difficult to vandalize.


9.    The Dutch government had sought recently to
introduce a national identity card scheme, but the
pilot project had been sabotaged by fans and the       clubs
themselves, who    remained opposed to the idea.   Although
the government was keen to reintroduce the scheme, it
was clear that this would command little support among
many in the football fraternity.


10.   On advice from Mr Carter, it was agreed that it
was, at this stage, unnecessary to pursue any
particular points with BAe representatives in this
country.     Mr Carter undertook, however, to obtain            Carter

further details of the density, spacing, slope and
strength specifications required by the Dutch
authorities for    stadia there.


Agenda Item 4 - Report on Meeting with Professor       Canter


11.   Professor Canter believed that there was
insufficient knowledge and information on crowd
behaviour;     as a result, the figures on which many
designs and rules were made were suspect.     There was a
failure to integrate clubs more closely into the local
community and insufficient dialogue between clubs and
their supporters.     That lack of informationrecognised
by the Working Party, was a major handicap in seeking
to improve both conditions and fans' behaviour, and it
was accepted that longer-term research might be
advantageous.     It was not, however, for the Working
Party to pursue.


12.   Some research on crowd behaviour had already been
carried out.     Mr Dickson referred to a number of
                                                             Action
published articles:     once obtained, those would be
circulated.                                                  Sweet



Meeting with FA/FL


13.     Although not an agenda item, Professor Maunder
thought Working Party members would wish to be aware of
a number of details which had emerged at a recent
meeting with the football authorities.     Important among
these were a UEFA proposal to increase seating at
designated grounds by means of a 10% per annum
reduction in standing, a requirement that, as from
autumn 1992, all World Cup matches were to be played at
all-seater grounds, and a stipulation that as from
January 1993 all "high-risk" events, including domestic
games, were to follow suit.     Whether UEFA had the
authority to impose such a regulation on the domestic
game, was less important than this evidence of the
attitude and approach they were adopting.


14.     Some support had been expressed by the FA/FL to
the idea of making the Green Guide mandatory.     That
view was not shared by Working Party members who felt
that complete enforcement was impractical given the
enormously wide disparity between grounds and ground
conditions.     What was preferred was to make consistent
the process of certification and it was here that an
overseeing body such as the FLA might play a crucial
role.     Such a certifying authority would ensure a
degree of standardisation which many felt lacking under
the current system.


Agenda Item 2 - Matters Arising


Crush Barriers and Handrails


15.     Dr Nicholson and Mr Dickson tabled their paper on
the inspection and testing of crush barriers and
handrails.     It had been drafted following discussion
                                                              Act ion

and examination of the existing literature on
structural testing, but was only a draft and open to
amendment.


16.    Its format was welcomed by   other Working Party
members who appreciated its concise and logical
structure.     The figure of 75% referred to in 2(c)   (The
Bedding-in cycle) was based upon criteria set out in
Institution of Structural Engineers' papers and was
accepted as a suitable figure.


17.    There were a number of minor amendments, which it
was agreed Messrs Dickson and Nicholson would give            Dickson/
                                                              Nicholson
consideration to in advance of the next Working Party
meeting.     These included a possible refinement of 2(a)
(The Proof Test) paragraph 3, and a more explicit
examination of the impact of reverse loading and
sideways movement.     There was a measure of consensus
that the actual test needed to be spelt out in greater
detail.    Similarly reference to foundations and             Dickson/
                                                              Nicholson
terrace-cracking might be made more explicit.       It was
also recognised that reference to a fixed percentage in
2(d)   (The Test Schedule) might prove counter-productive
and be regarded as the fixed figure to be tested.        A
degree of flexibility was required;     if a particular
type of barrier failed, then all barriers of that type
would need testing.     Similarly, should there be any
discrimination within a testing cycle as to the
proportion of existing to new barriers which were to be
tested?


18.    After discussion, it was agreed that further           All   Members

comments on the paper would be submitted to the
Secretary as soon as possible for immediate
circulation.                                                  Sweet


Inspection and Tests


19.    Mr Sticklev's paper (already circulated) had
raised a number of important issues, including the
current unsatisfactory nature of Chapter 4 of the Green
Guide, which needed considerable expansion.     There was
clearly a need for detailed pre-event inspection and
the proposed new paragraph sought to cover the areas
where inspection ought to take place.     It was accepted
that any post-event inspection could probably be of a
less rigorous nature, since such an inspection was a
safety, rather than detailed maintenance, check.


Turnstile Flow Rates


20.   Paragraph 6 of the minutes of the previous meeting
had recorded the Working Party view that a notional
flow rate of 500 persons per hour was more realistic
than the existing Green Guide figure of 750.     After
further discussion,    it was accepted that as a general
rule the rate of ingress at a ground was to be
established by the local authority in keeping with the
provisions of the Safety Certificate, but that the
figure of 500 was to be regarded as the median for a
normal turnstile.


Reservoir Densities


21.   Paragraph 14 of the previous minutes had recorded
the Working Party view that a lower density was
required.    Professor Canter had, in his meeting with
the Inquiry, been unable to illuminate the issue
further and discussion, therefore, returned to the more
general principle of whether to allow reservoir areas
at all.     Some support emerged for recalculating flow
rates earlier in the exit route so as to obviate any
need for such areas.    After lengthy discussion,   it was
agreed that if this could be done, then it should be,
but that where reservoir areas were still required,
their density should be in the region of 35-40.     All
agreed on the benefits of a proper, networked plan for
each ground, delineating all aspects of ingress/egress.

Handrails


22.   Mr Sticklev tabled a 1952 Fire Grading of
Buildings document (attached) which laid down the
figures on which the Green Guide had been drawn up.      It
was agreed that a similar figure and wording be
adopted.


Terrace Step Widths


23.   After discussion, it was accepted that whilst the
280 - 380mm range specified in paragraph 92 of the
Green Guide was reasonable, a general form of words
covering extremes outside that range was also required.
Working Party members agreed to give thought to a             All   Members

suitable form of words.   It was also agreed to
substitute the word "excessive" instead of the
reference to 180mm in the final sentence of paragraph
93.


Division of Spectator Accommodation


24.   Both Professor Maunder and Mr Sticklev had looked
again at the problems associated with terrace divisions
and sub-divisions, and Mr Carter had sought information
on the current state of League grounds.    He reported
that, at the majority of grounds, terrace areas were
related to their own, specific turnstiles (and
facilities) and that further sub-division such as had
occurred at Hillsborough was rare.    This applied
throughout the League and was not confined solely to
the larger 1st and 2nd Division clubs.    Such sub­
divisions as did exist had invariably been introduced
at the instigation of the police for security/crowd
control purposes.


25.   It was agreed, after detailed discussion,   that the
Working Party would recommend the objective of a direct
                                                                 Action
one-to-one relationship between turnstiles and
enclosures, wherever practicable.       On the rare
occasions when further sub-division was required,        it
was imperative that the totals to each such sub­
division should be counted separately.       It was
unnecessary to specify a maximum figure for terrace
size.


Viewing Slope Crush Barriers


26.     After discussion,   it was agreed that Mr Sticklev's
recommendation of "two-thirds that of", replace "the
same as" in paragraph 107 Green Guide.


Auxiliary Lighting


27.     Mr Dickson had obtained an invaluable document on
this subject prepared by North Yorkshire County
Council.     It was agreed to circulate this to all
Working Party members (attached).


Green Guide Chapter 10 - Roofed Stands with Seated
Accommodation


28.     Messrs Bush and Carter's paper (already
circulated) was discussed in detail, and their
recommendations accepted, with one caveat.        The view
that the strength requirement in paragraph 128 was
excessive found widespread, but not unanimous,        support.
It was agreed to record the majority view that a lower
figure might be acceptable.       There was unanimous
endorsement of the proposal for a separate Chapter in
the Guide on temporary stands and structures.         Mr Sweet
undertook to establish whether the proposed Home
Office/Scottish Office document referred to in
paragraph 140 had ever been published.                           Sweet



Green Guide Chapter 14 - Crowd Control
                                                               Action
29.     There was general consensus that, as currently
drafted, this Chapter was too negative.     Substantial
redrafting was therefore required.     Two areas were of
critical importance;     (i) the emphasis on sub-division
in paragraph 206, the principles of which had already
been discussed, and (ii) the suggestion in paragraph
209 that access to the pitch be made as difficult as
possible in normal circumstances.     A divergence of
views emerged amongst Working Party members as to the
emphasis to be placed on access, the majority favouring
more positive wording on the availability of access to
the pitch.


Agenda Item 5 - Review of Capacities


30.     Chapter 16 of the Green Guide was fundamentally
important to safety, and considerable debate had
already taken place as to the advisability of retaining
the density figures currently set out in paragraph 222.
Whilst some members remained confident that the figure
of 54 was, if anything, too cautious, Professor Maunder
reiterated his belief that Lord Justice Taylor would           W
unlikely to recommend raising density figures.       Indeed,
given the interim recommendation to reduce terrace
capacities by 15%, there might be some criticism of a
return to that figure.     Nonetheless, Working Party
members felt strongly that, from an engineering
perspective,    54 was an acceptable, safe figure;    it was
therefore agreed to recommend retention of that figure
to the Inquiry.


31.     Debate was equally vigorous on whether to retain
the lower maximum density figure of 27 specified in
paragraph 222 (b).     After much discussion the Working
Party agreed to recommend the deletion of that figure,
such deletion to be accompanied by a careful re-wording
of paragraph 223 emphasising the need to interpolate
between the maximum figure of 54 and a minimum figure
of 0.    Mr Sticklev undertook to consider a suitable          Stickley
                                                             Act ion

form of words for discussion at the next meeting,
together with the inclusion of diagrams and examples.


32.   In conjunction with the debate on capacity ran a
parallel debate on the structure of perimeter walls,
and their use as crush-barriers.   Such walls should not
be considered as crush barriers unless they conformed
to crush barrier specifications.   Mr Sticklev agreed to     Stickley

undertake further re-evaluation and drafting of
paragraphs 225-228.


Communications


33.   Too little weight had in the past been attached to
the need for a comprehensive communications system, and
the amendments suggested in Mr Sticklev's note (already
distributed and itself based on the earlier paper
presented by Professor Maunder) were accepted.     Copies
of relevant documentation on "communications" were to
be supplied by Mr Dickson to the secretary in due            Dickson

course.


Agenda Item 6 - Alternative Designs Submitted to the
Inguirv


34.   Mr Sweet undertook to circulate any designs which      Sweet

were felt to be particularly worthy.   It was recognised
that a large number of individuals would probably
produce very similar schemes, many lacking a proper
engineering basis.


Agenda Item 7 - Form of Working Party Submission


35.   Lord Justice Taylor had indicated that he hoped to
present his Final Report to the Home Secretary in
January.   It was therefore important for the Working
Party to present its conclusions before Christmas.      It
should not seek to engage in detailed re-drafting of
the Green Guide but should address key issues and
principles, making general recommendations which, where
appropriate, could be followed up later by Government
departments.     Those recommendations should include,
inter alia, the following essential topics:


     i)      perimeter fencing.   The Working Party was not
     qualified to give an assessment on whether,        in
     principle,    fences should remain or be removed, but
     where they did remain, would recommend a reduction
     in height to not more than 2'2metres, the removal
     of spiked or barbed wire, and the removal of
     overhangs.     The majority of members also favoured
     the existence of gaps, rather than gates, within
     the fencing, such gaps being aligned with, and of
     the same frequency as, gangways.      Such gaps should
     be at least as wide as the gangways feeding into
     them.     Fencing in front of seating was
     unnecessary, and it might be that a moat around
     the pitch, where practicable, would be preferable.
     Physical constraints might, however, cause some
     terracing to be lost, and this would prove an
     unduly harsh financial burden on smaller clubs.


     ii)     all-seater stadia.   Earlier minutes had
     recorded the recognition of a general move (not
     only in England but abroad) towards all-seater
     stadia, and the impact of UEFA/FIFA regulations.
     Nonetheless,    there was nothing inherently unsafe
     about non all-seater stadia;      if standing
     densities were low, there was little risk of
     injury;


     iii) role of FLA - inspectorate function?        It was
     agreed that a central repository        knowledge,
     whether the FLA or another forum, was essential to
     facilitate information flow between clubs,
     football bodies and other organisations.        Working
     Party members saw benefit, too, in having a body
     with an overview function, ensuring consistency of
                                                             Action

      approach;   and


      iv)   radial fences.     The issues had already been
      canvassed in depth, but would need to be addressed
      in the Working Party's report to the Inquiry.


36.   It was agreed that Professor Maunder and Mr Sweet      Maunder /
                                                             Sweet
would prepare a draft form of report, skeletal in
nature but encapsulating the issues to be referred to
Lord Justice Taylor,    for distribution prior to the next
Working Party meeting.       If agreement as to its
format/content could be reached at that meeting, the
report would be presented to the Inquiry by mid-
December.


Agenda Item 8 - Any Other Business


37.   There was no other business to report.


Agenda Item 9 - Date and Place of Next Meeting


38.   The next meeting would take place on Wednesday 13
December in Queen Anne's Gate commencing at 10.30am.
Further details and Agenda would be distributed in due
course.                                                      Sweet

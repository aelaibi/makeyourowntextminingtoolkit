RE: IDENTITY OF CASUALTY BEING TREATED IN HILLSBOROUGH GYMNASIUM UNDER
FIGURE 6 AT APPROX. 4.00 PM IN VIDEO "VRM 2"

I refer to your telephone conversation of 14 January 1998, with Ken Greenway regarding the
above and our subsequent conversation the following day.

In order to try and identify the casualty receiving treatment, we have checked the ambulance logs
for references in particular to females carried from Hillsborough around and after 4.00 pm on
15 April 1989 with negative result. We have also checked the statements of fire officers who
entered the gymnasium, but none of there relate to specifically named individuals. In addition we
have checked the female body files that remain here in the Hillsborough Archive for fire service
statements and in relation to the visible clothing of the casualty receiving treatment. Once again
we have not been able to identify the person.

Ken Greenway and myself have also repeatedly checked and viewed VRM2, at the appropriate
time when the casualty under the number 6 in the gymnasium was receiving treatment, to see if
we could identify whether the casualty is Sara Hicks or not. We are of the view that the casualty
is not Sara Hicks for the following reasons:-

      a)   The casualty's jeans are very light blue colour, Sara's were dark blue, almost grey.

      b)   The   belt    on      the   jeans       of   the     casualty   is     black,    Sara's   was   brown.

      c)   The casualty is wearing light blue socks,             do not believe Sara's were this colour, I can
           not be positive on this point.

      d) The casualty is wearing trainers. Sara's footwear was missing from her body when her
         clothing was first listed.

      e)   The casualty's footwear is black Adidas trainers                  with   black soles
           (the white Adidas stripes can be clearly seen on the sides).      Sara's footwear was
^          described as being a pair of brown Dr Marten boots.

      f)   The casualty appears too be a well built person, having thick ankles, large thighs and
               even bearing in mind they are in the recovery position a broad posterior. Sara was
               slim, weighing 60kgs (9 1/2 stones).

      g)   There appears to be a stain on the seat of the jeans worn by the casualty, which is not
           apparent on the photograph of Sara's clothing.

      h)   I am not even certain that the casualty is female.

      i)   The casualty is located in that part of the gymnasium where people who were alive
           received treatment and it is quite probable that they survived.

I have forwarded you a still from the video under separate cover and I think this illustrates points
a) to h) above. I am sorry we cannot be more helpful, for in addition to being unable to identify
the fireman, we cannot identify the 4 people in civilian clothes, either.

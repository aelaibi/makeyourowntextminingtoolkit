                            will say I was born on 28.4.66.              I am a
Control Assistant.           I have been with SYMAS for 20 months.

Prior to that I was a shop assistant.                The training consists
of two to three weeks on site basically watching the other

assistants and seeing how to handle the various situations
and calls that arise.



Saturday 15th April was my day off.                 I got a telephone call

at 1545 from                        one of the control assistants.         She
asked me if I could come in as there was a major incident at

the Hillsborough football ground.                   She told me that some

people had been crushed.              I had not heard anything before
that.



I got    to    work    at    about    1610    and    reported   straight    to
control.      On Saturdays there are usually only two people in

control but when I arrived there were at least six.                  Shortly

after my arrival Superintendent Clarke asked me to go into
the Major Incident room to relieve                              who had been

there from the start.          It was now about 1630.            I asked her

what she had been doing as I had not worked in the Major

Incident room before or received any training for it.                      She

said that she had been writing all messages in a log.                      She
was not taking actual calls.            I then took over from her.          It

was   very    busy    to    begin    with    with   messages    coming    from

hospitals and ambulancemen and I were making a note of the

messages and of the time that they were coming through.                      I
was also given an ear piece to listen to the radio on ERC
which is the emergency channel.



The major incident control room consists of one console with
two telephone points.     The controller was                 and

he was dealing with the vehicles on ERC.       I was then making

a note of what messages were coming back, eg vehicles to go
to the ground or vehicles being sent back to base.            It

started to quieten down after one to one and a half hours
and we were then standing vehicles down and sending them to

Herries Road bus depot.     Some of the messages which had been
coming through were unclear and so I asked for an earpiece
so that I could listen as well.       Some were loud and clear

and some you could not hear at all.     I do not know where the
unclear calls were coming from.



The senior officer at Herries Road bus depot was Station
Officer Eason.   At one stage we were trying to contact him

but could not get through.      I think this was early in the

evening.   I was then asked to get the telephone number of

Herries Road so that we could try to get through on the land

line.              found the number andArang it but it was
unobtainable.     then rang the operator and she said that

all lines were blocked for that area.      We then got through

to South Yorkshire Transport control room to see if they had

an internal line that we could use.       They said that they

would try to get through.      Eason then telephoned to us and




                              Z2Z
     said that he would ring at 10 minute intervals.



6.   We had received a lot      of press calls all afternoon. We had

     to open up a switchboard and divert them so that they could
     be answered by              the public relations officers.     We
     set up the switchboard at about 1700.



7.   As things began to quieten down I was told to go back to the

     control room to help on the telephones.        I went back and

     answered calls until we finished at 2120.       The calls were
     mainly   from doctors doing everyday admissions        and others
     from Northern General Hospital wanting to transfer patients
     to Hallamshire.

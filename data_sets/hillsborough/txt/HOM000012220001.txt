  Mr Roberts,



    ADJOURNMENT DEBATE FRIDAY 24 JANUARY: GEORGE HOWARTH MP (LAB) ON
^ T H E IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TAYLOR REPORT

  As requested by Mr Wilson in his note of 16 January to Mr Peters,
  we prepared the attached draft speech and briefing papers for
  Mr Lloyd's use when replying to the debate for the Government.

  The speech was prepared in accordance with advice from the Chief
  Whip's Office that Mr Howarth intends to raise the subject of
  implementation of Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report.

  We have since learned that Mr Howarth is also likely to refer to
  police matters which were raised in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim
  Report. Consequently, Mr Lloyd will be advised to make greater
  use of briefing material provided by F2 Division on police
  responsibility and disciplinary procedures (see Annex B, page
  13ff of the attached).   This briefing follows closely the text
  of a letter dated 26 November which Lord Ferrers sent in reply
  to one from Mr Howarth dated 5 November which first raised the
  matter with the Home Secretary.

  On the question of responding to recent press comment on
  Government policy on the Taylor deadlines for all-seated
  accommodation at football grounds in England and Wales,
  I understand that the Minister for Sport confirmed yesterday that
  the Government intends to ensure that the deadlines are met
  whilst acknowledging the financial implications for clubs.
  I would therefore advise against a similar press release being
  issued by the Home Office today.




                                                 R J MILES

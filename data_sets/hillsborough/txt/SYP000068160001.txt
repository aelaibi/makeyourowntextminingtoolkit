             On S a t u r d a y      15th April       1989      (150489)      I t r a v e l l e d to Hills b o r o u g h ,

             Sheffield             in order    to w a t ch the F.A.           Cup S e m i - F i n a l   then betw e e n

             L iv er p o o l      and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.         I travelled        by coach w h i c h       had been

             hired         by the S u p po rt er s    Club.         About     fifty other members             travelled         on

             the       coach to the game.

             The    coach       left H a rr og at e             at about e l e v e n o'clock              (1100)    and a r r i v e d

             S h e f f i e l d at about         one         o ’clock    (1300).        I do not know the               exact

              location where we                parked but            it was      near a brewery.



              I w a l k e d to the G ro u n d and a rr i v e d at a bout                      twenty minutes             past     one

              (1320).         I had pur c h a s e d my Ticket                   through      the S u p p o r t e r s Club.            It

             was    for      the West S ta nd terrace and                       cost me      si;-; pounds.



             I went         to the L e p p in gs            LN t urnstiles        and joined a queue                of about

Cjfcr        th i r t y supporters.                 I was        s e a rched    by a Police         Officer         prior   to

             I wa l k e d     through         the    t u n n e l/ an d took       up a posit i o n           immediately         to the

             left.          I stood at         the     r^er       of the terraces           w ith my back to wall                 in Pe

             f our.



             I. noticed         nothing        u n t ow ar d while         I was      s t a n d i n g on the     terraces

             wait i n g      for   the game.                It was about        hal f - p a s t - t w o    (1430)    when    3.

             n ot i c e d    that Pen         four was           very   crowded,      but more         and more       people were

             coming         in through         the tunnel.              I could       see    that      the area       to the left

             appeared         half empty.



             The    build up of s up p o r t e r s                s t e adily    c o n t i n u e d until      the   teams    came

             out.       At this stage               it was        so tigh t l y     packed that my arms were                     down fa

             m y side and          I was       unable           to move    them or       raise      them      in the air         to

             scored.          Peter B E A R D S L E Y hit            the   crossbasr and a                loud cheer went             up.

         I could not           see what was           h a ppening at          the    front    of the terraces           but       I

         could hear        people       screaming.             I was    frightened and           people       in the     crowd,

         began     to    panic.        At    this     point     people were           being    pulled up       into     the

         seating area above.                   I was     turned       to the        side and    could not see what

         was    h a ppening      on the        pitch.        I began helping            people       climb up into        the

         seating are a some of the                    people were            injured and unconscious.



         This    continued         for about          h a l f - a n- ho ur    before    the    crowd       pressure     began

         to ease.



         I could see           that a gate at            the    front        of the    fencing       was    open and

         people were           going    thro u g h onto         the    pitch.         I could see Police           Officer

         and S t e w a r d s    pulling       people        over   the fence          on to the       pitch.



         As the     crowd eased             I f i l t ered     forw a r d on to the           pitch.        1 would,

         d e s cribe     the scene          on the     pitch as one            of total       chaos.        There were

         about    tw e n t y    people       lying m o t i o n l e s s X .x\ various areas             of the     pitch.              1.

         do not know           if they were           dead or u n c o n scious.              I saw    people    being

         given m o u t h - t o - m o u t h and F i r s t yfti d treatment.                   Injured       people were

         being     c arried on advertiVsinia/boards                      to the       far    end of the Ground.               1

         cannot     describe any             of the      casualties           in details       because       so m u c h was

         h ap pe n i n g a r ou nd me.          All     I can remember              is seeing    people       lying     on the

         pitch who        had gone          blue     in the     face.



         I was     very upset and sat                 in the goal            area and       I broke down an d          cried

         for about        h a 1f - a n - h o u r .

            As     the    s it ua t i o n grew   calmer     I left       the G r o u n d and made my way          back       to

             the    coach.

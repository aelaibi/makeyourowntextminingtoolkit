                       i am a qualified doctor my qualifications are MBChB I qualified at

                       Sheffield in 1987 I worked at the Chesterfield and North Derbyshire

                       hospital for twelve               ( 12) months and then moved to the N^tJ>*^n^*General

                       H o s p i t a l , Sheffield in August                 1988-

                       On Saturday 15th April                  1989,       (150489), I was working in the casualty

                       department at the Northen General Hospital                                 I started work at 9 am

                       (0900).         At sometime shortly after 3 pm (1500) an ambulance brought a

                       patient to the A & E (Accident and Emergency)                                    department and the

                       driver mentioned that there was an incident going on at Hillsborough.

                       He was unable to give us any more details.                                  The patient that he had

                       brought        in was nothing to do with the Hillsborough disaster.

                       Shortly afterwards the emergency telephone                                 rang and we were informed

                       that there was a paediatric                       cardiac arrest on route to the hospital.
                                                                                               PAGE     2
                                                                                               S3289

            At that stage I' was not aware that it had anything to do with

            Hi 11 sbo/'ou^.    I bleeped the paediatric SHO (Senior House Officer -

            RachaeJt yfettinger) and told her what we had and asked her to come down

            to the department

            I made my wav round to the resuscitation room/and within a short time
                                                               r / f i S f   g O fH S '
            art ambulance arrived and the first p a t i e n t y L e e Nicol) was brought

            into resuscitation room*         I remember that Doctor Ed ^alker walked into
    J   K
            the hospital more or less at the same time as the first ambulance

            arrived.      The patient was grossly cyanosed       (blue) and no peripheral

            pulses.      he was not breathing.     Some one,   I can't recall who,

            commenced cardiac massage.



                           I remember his colour    improved and the patient              regained an

            o ut pu t.

            I am aware that several more patients had arrived and although I

            attempted resuscitation on some of these I am unable to give any

            description.      As far as I can remember most of the casualties if not

            all,   in this initial   influx showed np signs of life.               They all seemed

            to have fixed and dilated pupils.         Few of them had any obvious

            external     injuries.

            I can remember however dealing with the following patients,                    but I

            cannot remember in which order I dealt with them.                 There was a female

            in the A & E plaster     room,   she was not at an official            resuscitation

            poi n t .



                                                      I recall that there was a female

            medical student, whose name I d o n ’t know and a middle aged policeman

            who appeared distressed with this patient,
            ________________________________________________________


Vt/'y       I would describe this patient as a white female                       late teens/early
                                  ------------------------------

    twenties she was well built and had dark        hair I think.          I cannot

    remember what she was wearing.

    I also had dealings with a male patient        who I believe was in         the

    middle    resuscitation point in the clean theatre.




                                                                                      and he

    was moved out of the resuscitation room.        I d o n ’t know what happened

    to him.     I am unable to give you details of anyone else who may have

    been dealing with this patient.

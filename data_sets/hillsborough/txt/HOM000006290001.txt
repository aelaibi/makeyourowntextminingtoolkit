          INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER

        I am writing to let you know that Peter Whitehurst and I had a very useful meetine
        ■ p s : morning with Chief Superintendent Pemberton of West Midlands Police Authority.
        W     Pemberton is playing a key role in organising the evidence-gathering being
        undertaken by the West Midlands Authority.         It appears that the Authority arf
        committing an impressive amount of resources to the taking of statements from
        witnesses m Sheffield, Liverpool and elsewhere.        (A total of some 250, it would
        seem, for Sheffield and Liverpool together).     I understand that these Officers w i U
        be starting their task on Monday next, 24 April.

        This is obviously going to be of invaluable assistance for the purposes of the
        £   fia Ihnquiry‘ H°wever, I should be grateful if you would confirm my understanding
        of the basis on which the West Midlands force are operating.       I understand that
        originally the Chief Constable of West Midlands agreed to carry out the "police
/       investigation" at the request of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, so that the
        findings of an independent force's investigation would be available in the event of
v/      any complaints being made under the Police Complaints Procedure. However, given the
                       •?* ,P“bllC InqUlPy and t0 aVOid the                   and overlap that might
         be involved if two separate investigations were being conducted in parallel               I
     V ^ h e e7 hJ?? that        has been agreed between Lord Justice Taylor, the Home Office and
        the Chief Constable of the two Authorities concerned that the West Midlands
                    investigation should in fact be a dual purpose one, serving the function
        described above (provision of material for the South Yorkshire Authority) and also
        Inquiry^        l m P o r t a n t one for our purposes of providing evidence for the Public


       You will appreciate that normally the taking of witness statements etc for such
       G i v e ^ t h ^ ^ 6! J f a / ™ c t i o n Performed by the Treasury Solicitor's Department.
       Given that the scale of the present Inquiry and the time constraints against which
       we are operating, this is clearly something that is not feasible in this case
       However, I should be grateful for your confirmation when replying that there will be
     | no question of the Treasury Solicitor's Department at the end of the day being
       o f ^ t h M r ° rei”bUr®e the West Midla"ds Authority      for such proportion of the cost
     ^ of their investigation as may properly be attributable to the Public Inquiry.

       A copy of this letter goes to Wally Hammond.

                                                        Yours sincerely




                                                            D BRUMMELL

terr#ce       ticket      holders          sh o u l d go.     At this      stage    I noticed      that      there

were    t ur n s t i l e s a l r e a d y    open and that           supporters      had started to enter

the ground.            I also        told ‘the officers             that there: w o u l d    be a buiid up

of suppo r t e r s without             tickets,        hanging a r o & n d on the. pavements and

near    to the        perimeter        gates        in hope      that    they would get       tickets;

Also     to expect        ticket       touts w h i c h w o u l d o b viously attract              supporters,

thus    blocking         entry to the ground.

Once     briefed,        I took all           the officers          up to G a t chbar Lane,        Hidlewood

Road,     P a r kside Road,           Pen i s t o n e Road and f i nal ly Le ppi ngs Lane,

points and their              points        for Phase        III.       On return to L e p pings          Lane,          I

i nstructed          that PC's        1696 Stanbr'idge and               1300 Grunhill       should work

together          in a pair,         that     I should work wit h PS            1952 S m i t h and PC

W i l s o n by herself,              I also        s u ggested    that because       there was       very-

leg str e t c h and also              to have another             look    round the area.

At -12.30pm that             day,     in company wit h PS S m i t h we went                 on a general

patrol.           We went     up to iliddlewood R oad and                  turned    right    up W a d s l e y

Lane,     pass The Park              public      house.       I returned a steady stream of

Liverpool          s u pp or te rs ,w al ki ng       up W a d s l e y Lane away from the ground.
                                                                                              \      -         '■


Most     stated       that    they were looking               for    somewhere      to get    something             to

eat.      When       passing     the shops           in W ad sl ey Lane,       I noticed      that

Liv e r p o o l    suppo r t e r s    where        leaving „off-licence' premises with                   packs       of

beer and what a p p e ar ed                to be the        two. litre     plastic    bottles      of beer.

Some    supporters           were     sitting        on garden walls          drinking      the   beer,

whilst      others       just    sat on the           pavement.          I a c t ually m oved     six or

seven that were              sat on the         kerb edge .          I also adv ised that          they

should go to the ground early and                            that    if they a r r i v e d at the ground

drunk     they w ou ld not get                in.     We    continued to walk up W a d s l e y Lane

until    we     reached The H orse             and Jo c k e y    public       house.      Ihere    I saw

approximately             100 Liverpool          s u pporters        drinking     beer   in the        car

park.      Some were sitting                on the nearby grass               venje,     We     continued to

walk    round the estate              passing       other    o f f - l icence     shops,       where again

Liverpool         s up p o r t e r s were      buying    cans    of b e e r .

Approx.       I.OOpm we        returned to the ground to join officers men t i o n e d

above.     At     this     time     I asked      the M o u n t e d    officers     to keep the are

front     of the       perimeter         gates    clear.     Asking      them without           tickets

leave    the area.           I was also asked by a foot                   Inspector        to try to keep

the f o o t p a t h over       the    bridge      clear,     because      supporters were

congreg ating             blocking       the    pavement      causing other           pedestrians           to step

out    into     the    road.        This was      passed on to the other M o u n t e d

officers.           At this       time     I noticed that all            the turnstiles           were       open

and that supp o r t e r s           were    going t h r o u g h without any            problems.

For    the next        hour - u p    to a p pr ox im a t e l y 2 . 0 0 p m all my        contingent were

e m p l o ye d as     des c r i b e d above.

At a pp r o x i m a t e l y 2. 0 0 p m     I heard over         the    radio that        the    special       train

had a rr i v e d at W a ds le y Bridge.                 I looked at the turnstiles                 and

noticed       that small          queues had formed             leading       to nearly all        the

turnstiles          and the       foot     officers were         s e arching all         the supporters

going . i n t o     the    ground.         Moun t e d officers         were     still, asking      people       not

to block        the entrance          to the      ground,       a ga i n getting       people without

tickets away           from the       ground.         I was a s k e d    by an Inspector           to       clear

the    foo tpath       in front       of the shop and terrace                   house,   so     that    the

suppo r t e r s a r r i v i n g     from the special            train    could be direc t e d           towards

their     respective         turnstiles.            Queues were already               being     formed by

foot    officers at the              t urnstiles and at this stage                    there was        no

problems.           I was    then joined by Insp.                Hand-Davies          and eight        other

Mounted       officers.           I noticed that as             people a r r i v e d     they seemed

confused,         because      for the next           10-13 minu t e s        I was    c o n t i nually being

A p p r o x i m a t e i y 2 .1 5 p m    I looked at the L e p p i n g s Lane                terrace

turnsti les         (:B ) and noti ced that              there was a build up of                     people,.        No

q ueues a t . t u r n s t i l e s . At      this stage all             the    perimeter          gates were           open

a n d s u p p o r t e r s were         continually arriv i n g at             the ground.             I noticed

that PC       1300 and         1696 had a c t u a l l y gone           into the          pen area and started

to    relieve       pressure and           re- e s t a b l i s h queues.        I went         in to help

because       I    n o t i c e d that some         s upporters were           trying        to    crawl under         the

barrier and           push their way to the front.                       It seemed at this                stage

that       the s up p o r t e r s a r r iving at the ground just did not want                                to .wait

their       turn but,        j.ust push their way to the                     front..,. The mood of the

crowd gra d u a l l y        changed from being                happy    to a g g r e s s i v e      because myself

and the other             two M er s e y s i d e   officers were             trying       to get them          into

queues       thus     preventing a crush.                 I noticed that                 people with small

children were             holding        them above       their       shoulders.            People were

totally d is re ga r d i n g . w h a t was             being    said to them.               I noticed beer,

cans       being    thrown at one           of the M e r s e y s i d e       officers.              A man w ith his

y ou n g    son was       shouting at me to do something                       because         he was      getting

crushed.           B ec a u s e as Ihave           said above,         the    people -a r r iving just

w a n t e d to     push their way to the front.                        I then     left        the    pen area

because       I w a s n ’t being          effective.           I tried       three       times to get my

horse       into    the    pen area just where                 the    blue    barrier        finished.,        but

could not          because      the supporters were                  so densely          packed.

The    s upporters a c t ua ll y           pushed me out.              My    intention was            to try and

join up w ith          the two other M e r s e y s i d e             officers     so that we            could        put a

c ordon of horse across                   thus stopping          some       of the       pressure       on the

t urnsti les        and also           to try and      regulate        the    flow of supporters.

P eo pl e at this          stage were         c omplaining of being trod on                         by the     horse.

I m ov e d out of that area and o r g a n i s e d a cordon of horses across                                          the

blue       perimeter       fence.         I noticed that PC Grunhill                      an d S t a n b r i d g e   had
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                              R192

also     left     the    pen are a because               they were       not being       effective, , After

organ i s i n g    this       cordon      I noticed that           people at the front              near      to the

turnstiles were               being      crushed.         I also    noticed an          Inspector       standing

cm tile blue         barrier         near      to the turn s t i l e s      pulling and         lifting       people

out.:     W hilst       I was     in the        cordon of horse on the                 perimeter     gates      I

was a s k i n g ' s u p p o r t e r s    not    to    push,    but yet again they just               ignored

what was being            said.          I saw youths          cl irnbing the         perimeter    fence       just

to get      into the          pen area.          At about        this    time myself and the             horse

were     pushed thro u g h the gates.                     The,supporters             pushing    past.      I -saw

several       people       fall      to the floor and myself and PC 2316 Scott managed

to    push back         the    crowd,       blocking        the gap,      allowing       the    people who          had

fallen to get            back onto          their      feet,     otherwise       I believe       that    they

would have         been t r a m p l e d on.            It was at        this    stags    that    I tried to

get    through on the             radio,        saying      "Emergency"         but    I c o u l d n ’t get

through to          control.

It was about            2 . 4 3 p m when       I finally got         through and a sked control                 to

send the horses               d e t ailed to,work at the                rear    of the S outh       stand up to

L e p p i n g s Lane.         They arri v e d a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.30pm.

It was about            this    time when            I saw supp o r t e r s     that was       in the    pen

being     u she r e d    round towards Gate C.                    I w ould say that a p p r o x i m a t e l y

100 went         towards Gate C.                This     still    left a p p r o x i m a t e l y 200,    still       .

trying      to    push their way through towards                         the.turnstiles.           About

2.50pm      I then saw Gate S open w hich a l l o w e d                        the    remaining     supporters

the    pen to enter            the      ground on mass.            I saw Gate 8 close arid we                  then,

a l lo we d supp o r t e r s      to filter           through towards           the turnstiles.

It was at         this     point        that    I went     to the       turnstiles and          put my horse

right     up to the wail.                 I saw two youths              a p p r o a c h the turnstile,         one

had a ticket            in his hand,            the other        had a ten pound, note.              It was at

this    time      that    I heard a message                over    the    radio asking          for all

t u rnstiles       to be       closed.          I i mm ed ia t e l y stopped further             entry     into*

         1 w ould say         regarding           radio          communi c a t i o n s    that because           of the

         organise M o un te d deployment,                         I found J t          very diff icult         to;:hgar

         a n y t hi ng    clearly.        Whether           it was       because        of the noise          round me at            the

         timf    or because          of traffic                 on the     radio       I cannot say.

         I have      eight years M ou n t e d experience,                          having worked at all                  the

         not     listen to advice.                   They seemed to totally                     d i s regard what was              said

outside % h e             ground          on the P e n i s t o n e             Road         end.

At a b o u t         3.05pm         (150 50)           t hat    date,         I was         stood       with       the    rest       of     my

serial         at     the      corner           of P e n i s t o n e      Road         and Herries             Road       outside           the

Charlie          Brown         shop.            We     were     approached              by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t ,           wh o      had

j ust      emerged          from         the      football          g r o un d ,       he    immediately              ordered         us       into

the       g r o u nd .

At     this      t im e     I had          no     i de a w h a t        was    happening,               I entered          the       ground

with       the       rest      of m y       serial           together          with PS Taylor                  and       Inspector             Newey

w ho      were       both      in     possession               of   police          rad ios.            As     I approached               the

playing          area       from         the      entrance          between            the N o r t h         stand and          the S p i o n

Kop,        I saw        the     players             leaving        the       pitch and a               la rge      c r o wd    of

spectators               on the          pitch around               the       Leppings          Lane         end    of    the     ground.

My     immediate            r e a c t i o n wa s          t ha t    t h er e      had been a             pitch        invasion            by     the

Liverpool             fans.           I then           ran a c r o s s        the      pitch       to    offer        my assistance,

there        were        s ome      police           officers           present         but     not      many.

As     I approached                 the     Leppings            Lane      terraces            it    became          obvious          to me

the       s m a ll    e xit      gate.            I realised             t h at     the      s i t u a t i o n was        very       serious

and       I could         not       get     into        the     gateway           to    help.           I looked          towards           the

I w as     faced with a situation where                                    I could             not     get    to a n y o n e          to    help.

I w as    at        this       time       with Police               Constable             Reeves.            Situated            to    the

ltnqjediate          r i ght        of    the       g at e    I saw s o m e          wooden          hoardings.                 I climbed
         _  Aov/e^
onto     the h o a r d i n g s            w i t h PC R e e v e s          doing          the    same and           I wa s        trying          to

present         along          the       length        of     the     terrace            and    some        15 to 2 0           deep       in

p e o p le .        People          were       pushed         up a g a i n s t       each       other        and       gasping         for

breath.             It    seemed          to    stretch            for a b o u t         10 f ee t      back a l o n g           the       terrace

and     then        I saw a gap                of a b o u t        3 f ee t     and       from       t hat     p o int a l t h o u g h           it

was     crowded           people were                standing          in a n        upright           position and               looking

towards         the       pitch.

I thought            t hat       if      I could         encourage             the       people        at    the tiack to m o v e

repeatedly               to    the       people        at     the     b ac k    to       "Move       back,        walk     out        of    the

response            I got        from        the     p e o p l e at       the       back was           obscene          language,               "V"

assistance.                   I d o n ’t t h i n k           the    people          at    the    b ac k      realised            the

seriousness               of     the      incident            at    the    fro nt.             I was        in a h e l p l e s s

situation            so       I then         started          to    speak       to       the    people         crushed           into       the

During        the        incident               the w o o d e n        hoarding              broke         and myself              and     other

officers            fell         to    the       ground.              I w as       sti ll         able       to    c l i mb       up o n t o       the

fence        by     using         the       supports             of    the        number          4 gate.              I w as a w a r e        that

several           bodies          had       been       placed          o nt o      the       playing          a r e a.         I could         not

believe           at     first         t ha t        many were             dead.         My       i n it ia l      thoughts             were       that

many     h ad       been         pulled          through          the       gates        and       o ve r     the       f e n ce w e r e       alive

The     c r o w d at          the      back          did    e as e at        one        stage          and    I noticed 2

policewomen appearing                                from    the       tunnel          at     the       back.           I shouted             to    them

to    encourage               people            to    l e av e    the       terracing              and       for       them       to m a k e       t h ei r

way     to    the        b ac k       of    the       crushed          fa ns       and       to    pull       them        backwards            and          to

safety.             After         great          difficulty                I noticed              t ha t     the       two     policewomen                  had

moved        through             the       crowd a nd were                  n ow       into       the      c r u s h e d area.             They

appeared            to      be     receiving               the    same        response             from       several             of    the    fans.

It a p p e a r e d          to me          t h at     the    fans          d id    not w a n t          to m o v e        in      case     they         lost

and     down        to      the       fr ont,         he a p p e a r e d          to    be    caught          up       in the          c r u s h at         one

stage        and       from my             p o s i t i o n at         the     t op      of    the       fence          I directed             him       to

through,           however,            the      people        at     the    front       had great            difficulty              in

climbing           up    through           the       fence     from        the    drop       behind         the   w a ll.        W h e n all

I could        not       believe           t ha t     s u c h a s m all          area      h ad    been able             to    hold       so

many    p e rs on s.

Whilst        at    Gate        4    I cannot           reca ll       seeing         any     person who            w as       dead      being

carried        from        t hat      a r ea ,       except        for     the    m a n PC D a v i e s         had       been w i t h who

appeared           unconscious                 to me.

I moved        back        onto        the      pitch and            tried       to a s s i s t       any    persons           who      had

obviously           been        in th e         crush.         Many        people       were       being       resuscitated                by

Police        officers              and ambulance               crews       and also            fans.        Many        f ans    were

shouting           and     swearing             on the        pitch        blaming         the     Police         for     the     crush

but    I j ust          c o u l d n ’t c o m m e n t         because        from       entering          the      pitch area              to

leaving        it       I did        not       receive        any     information               via     rad io     or w o r d        of

m o u t h as       to    the        c a u se    of    the     crush.

I must        h av e     spent         s om e       15 to 2 0 m i n u t e s          walking          around       the        crowd

preventing              fa ns       from       fighting        amongst           themselves,             firing          i n s u l ts

towards        other         officers,               myself        and     persons         in g e n e r a l       who were           present

on    the     pitch.

I saw many              fa ns       and    officers           carrying           bodies       away       on a d v e r t i s e m e n t

ambulance           originally                 on    the     pitch and           then after             20 minutes             another

came.         I w as       amazed          t hat      20     or 3 0      had     not    been       directed          o nto       the

h av e    been       drinking,             to       some       deg re e.          I found        it     impossible           to    reason

with many            of    the       fa ns      and       I am       s u re    t hat     they        d id   not     know     the    full

extent        of     the    tragedy.                 I certainly               d i d n ’t k n o w       so m a n y    people        had

died.         In f act          I made          a    remark          j ust a f t e r         4 o ’ clock        (1600)       to    one    of

my     colleagues,              PC    Humphries,                to    the      effect          that     I thought          there        had

been about            S fatalities.                       He    replied           ’M o r e     like 5 0 . ’         I was       numbed        by

t his     and      realised           in m y         o wn m i n d       that       I should           h av e   d on e m o r e      to    help.

I l a te r      joined a number                      of    officers            who      h ad    formed a           line    across        the

pitc h.         I was       then       directed                to a s s i s t      in    crowd        c o n tr ol    outside        the

ground and assist                     re     the N o t t i n g h a m           Forest          supporters,           who     left       the

ground without                  any     incident.

I was         joined       by    the       other          members         of      the    serial         and     I again assisted

in the R a w s o n S p r i n g               R o a d a rea .            After        the       crowds       h ad    cleared        I went

            Directly               in f r o n t       of   the t u r n s t i l e s        I saw      several         Police           Officers

            apart           from       the     occasional           group        of 2 D      to 3 D y o u t h s        singing             and

            behaviour               was      very      good.

            I noticed               the      odd group         of 5 to           10 p e o p l e       walking        around           obviously

            without              tickets;           they a p p e a r e d      to     be     looking         for     friends           who    ha d

            arranged              to m e e t        them    outside          the G r o u n d         to    receive         their       tickets            or

            Shortly after                    the     k i ck-off        I went ^ t o             the G r o u n d ;        I s aw       no

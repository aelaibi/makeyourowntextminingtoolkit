               On S a t u r d a y       15th April,     1989   (150489)   my tour of duty was 9 am to 6 pm
                                                                                                              PAGE          2

(0900 --\1800 h r s ) on th'                   parti cula                 I was    to work with Sub

O ffi c e r                    t-lreman                and Fir                     on a pumping app l i a n c e

call    sign Central             One.      I remember           that we a tt en d ed a call          in

Sheffield          returning           to the Fire S t at i on at a ro u nd 3 pm              (1500 hrs).              We

then went          into the g ym n as i um to            play football.



A r o u n d 3 .15       pm > 4 5 1 5    hrs)   I heard the audi bl e             bleep sound w h ic h tells

us that we are              required at a fire                 call.     We then w al k ed to the

t e l e p ri n t e r w h i ch    prints out the mess ag e and the                   location we are

required at.               I then went         to the         pumping a ppliance       in readiness            in

case our mach i n e was                 required Sub Officer                        then a n n o u n c e d over

the ta n n o y system w h i ch appli an ce s were a t te nd in g                     the     call.        I

remember          that     the a p pl ia n c e s    required were Central              one    (Pumping

a p pliance)           Central     Two    (Pumping appliance)              Central    Five     (Emergency

t e n d e r ).



Eiub Officer                       t h e n \ j o i n a d us    in the vehicle and told\us                 that we

w e r e \ e q u i red to a tt e nd Hi liYbo rough football                       ground where kjrnajor

irre^dent had occurred.                    S u X Officer                   also    informed us that

resus'e^lis^ation and            cutting       equ^ffiient was          required.     We were        not aware

of what          the    incident        involved.        I had seen on telev is io n earlier                     that

there had              been trouble at H i l l s b o ro u gh Football Gro un d but I didn't at

that     time          think    that     they were one and the same incident.                    The          initial

t e l e pr i n t e r m e s sa ge       told us to head for the P e ni st on e Rd j un ct io n

Leppings         Ln end of         the ground.           There        is no s ig ni ficance     in this

location,              it wasn't        that we knew there was              trouble at this particular

point     it was m e r e ly an ad dr es s              for      the    ground.    We did not receive any

i n f o r m a t i o n telling          us at what      part of the ground we were                required.

F r o m this    point       in the gro un d we were able                 to see the stand and

ter ra ci n g which         is located at the             rear of one           of the goals.         We      could

also    see a small          part    of the       playing a rea w hi ch at this time was

covered by a mass             of    people.        We still       d i d n ’t know what was           happening.



After         out Isuo minu te s we          realised that           some       equipment w o u ld be

                       *     find out what was             required of us.               I dropped the

I didn't       see the       cutting       equipment a g a i n until             I saw    it later      back on

the appliance.              I was    in full       firemans       u n if or m    including a y el l o w fire

managed       to get onto          the    playing       surface.        I could see that there was a

mass    of    people on the          pitch some of w ho m were                  lying down or staggering

about.

required aid and               I w ould   estimate       that   I g%ive about another 5 victims

m o ut h to m ou th       r e su s ci ta ti on and    cardiac mass ag e     if there was               no one

were all        male     but    I am unable       to give any d es c ri p ti o n of them at all.



I was      very s up ri se d how man y doctors were on the                  pitch.           I recall           that

everytirne       I did help a casualty wi th in a short                   time     of    commencing

re su s c i t a ti o n there w ould         be a doctor who would either                 take over            from

me or      pronounce          life extinct.



I became aware            that a lot of the Liverpool               s upporters were g e nu in el y

helping       the e m er ge nc y services.            Some of the     fans were          removing

a d v e r ti s in g    boards    from the edge of the            pitch to use as stre t ch er s                   for

the d ec e as ed and           injured.        A lot of the fans were          just milling around

d az ed & shocked and                crying.



B y this      time      it had been e s ta bl is he d that         the g y mn as iu m at the              rear of

the N or th S ta nd was              to be used as an e m er ge nc y hospital.                 The

Liv er po o l    s upporters          seem ed to be aware        of this and were             carrying

casualties            along    the    length of the       pitch on these mak es hi ft               stretchers

towards       the gymnasium.



As   the    pitch                clearing       of the    injured and d ec ea se d         I made my way

towards       the P o li ce \C o nt r o l      box s it uated betw e e n the West S ta nd and

de ce a se d supporters         who were        being    helped    by firemen,     doctors and the

am b ul a nc e     personnel.



As     I entered through the S p i o n K o p             end     s a w Police Officers

d ec e a s e d     supporters    and    I w a sN s ho c ke d to see that there were           between

40 and 50 bodies             covered with blankets             in this area.



W i t h i n a short       distance     of these       bodies     I could see supporters           resting

agai ns t        the gym wall.        These     I would estimate were           the not so    injured

and as       I m oved further         on inside       I saw     casualties     in the    centre of the

 room receiving           t reatment    by medical        staff and firemen with

 r eceiving        initial   t reatment        were   carried out on stretchers            to waiting

ambulances          at the o t h e \ e n d     of the gymnasium.



 I a s s i s t e d a number     of    injured myself           inside    the gym na si um but a ga in

 the    details      and d es cr ip t io n s    of the    casualties       are vague.      I do

however          remember a ss i st i ng medical         staff with one y outh who          I believe

 had a broken neck            by placing him on a stretcher,                  covering    him with a

blanket and          placing    him    in the ambulance.



           thrsk I was       instr uc te d to check the           pitch for a ny Nether

              and Fireman                      we were unable       to    locate any others.



As we      reached opposite           the Police Control           box,    we were a dv i se d over

the     radio      that   the game was         to be a b a n d o n e d and we were      to return to

our     individual        tenders,     after     this    I had no further        contact wit h any

 casualties.           I w ould esti mate we          left the     football     ground at around

            about 5 pm <1700 hrs).



            As    I was     giving    the m ou th to m outh      r es us ci ta ti on   I cannot say that        I

            was     very aware       that    the    people   I was dealing with had been drinking.

            In the m ain there was             no smell      of drink   on them,       but   I w ould   imagine

            that     I had probably dealt with ma in ly the                people at the front          of the

            pens     that    had a rr i ve d early.

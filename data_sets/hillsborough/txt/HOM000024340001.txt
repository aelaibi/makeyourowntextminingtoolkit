Present:     Lord Justice Taylor        Mr Tom Pendry MP
             Mr Johnson                 Mr Joe Ashton MP
             Professor Maunder          Mr John Greenway MP

                                        Miss Jane Enticott (Research
                                        Assistant to Mr Pendry)



All-seater Stadia and Standing Accommodation


1.   Lord Justice Taylor asked for the Committee's views on the
merits of all-seater stadia.       Mr Pendry said that in general
there was a view that an element of standing should be retained.
He himself did not feel that in Scotland the installation of
seating, by comparison with other factors, had been the dominant
one in reducing hooliganism.       Mr Ashton referred to the greater
danger in the evacuation of seating areas in the case of a fire
or a bomb, and to the risk of seats being torn up and used as
missiles, as well as to the inconvenience of sitting in the rain,
as factors which might tell against all-seater stadia.           Mr
Carlisle also believed in a mix of accommodation.           Mr Lester, Mr
Meale and Mr Greenway all raised the problems of smaller league
clubs (third and fourth division).      At many of these grounds,         the
number of fans regularly attending was less than the seated
accommodation.     It was conceded that for big cup matches some
sensible limitation of the numbers on the terracing would be
necessary:    for larger clubs,    the ratio might be two seated
places to one standing.    Mr Meale referred to the costs of
building new stands, and several MPs suggested there was a risk
of all the spectators being congregated in to a small stand,
leaving three sides of the field empty,       if an all-seating
requirement was imposed.


2.   Mr Hughes drew attention to the difficulty of setting
targets for clubs moving regularly between divisions, and the
disincentives to bringing people back to football which
requirements on stands might impose on clubs.       Mr Ashton felt
that letting off steam at a football clubs was a safety valve,
with violence otherwise being displaced on to the streets.


3.     Lord Justice Taylor drew attention to the building of all-
seater stadia abroad.      Mr Pendry felt that English football
suffered from elderly stadiums, which was not the case in
mainland Europe.      Discussion then turned to comparison with other
entertainments.      There were mixed views over whether those
attending pop concerts preferred to stand or to sit, but Mr
Carlisle suggested that any new construction would have to be
all-purpose, with a strong presumption to all-seating.       But clubs
would be reluctant to spend money if they thought that the trend
was to build new super stadia which would take the big matches
away from them.      Mr Ashton thought that semi-finals should be
played at Wembley, on the principle of big matches being played
on neutral grounds.      But he conceded that such an option would
not overcome the problem of fans being unfamiliar with the
gr ou n d .


4.     Lord Justice Taylor pressed for a view on how far down the
league table requirements for seating should extend.       Mr Hughes
saw a gradation of view with requirements being more acceptable
the higher up the league, at the larger stadia, and for the more
important clubs.      Mr Lester believed that the criterion should be
a specific number, was related to the need to build covers over
seated areas.      Mr Greenway believed that a formula could require,
for a given ground capacity, a ratio of seating to standing
accommodation,     to be enforced by a particular date:   he believed
that football would accept the case, on the argument that they
were under an obligation to make their ground safe, so long as
there was no absolute requirement against standing on terraces.
Mr Ashton favoured a 10% capacity for seating, with a minimum of
between 2,000 and 5,000.


5.     On the broader arguments about football culture, Mr Ashton
said that fans would simply refuse to sit down if they did not
want to:      Mr Pendry sited the Coventry experience, which he
believed had shown that fans would always be reluctant to go to
all-seater accommodation, and Mr Greenway saw it as a problem
essentially for resolution at local level.         In further discussion
on the culture against which proposals for all-seater
accommodation had to be judged, Lord Justice Taylor asked whether
excitable behaviour was genuine or manufactured.         Mr Greenway
believed it was fuelled by alcohol.         Mr Pendry believed that
there had been some overreaction to problems of hooliganism,
which had led directly to the suggestion of all-seater stadia.


6.   Mr Carlisle said that he assumed Lord Justice Taylor's
criteria were those of safety, and therefore questioned whether
all-seater stadia were relevant to discussion of those criterion.
He argued that a blanket approach on all-seater stadia would
impose a financial penalty on clubs.         The Football Licensing
Authority could make any specifications in consultation with the
police.    Lord Justice Taylor drew attention to the direct link
between all-seater stadia and crowd control and safety, under his
terms of reference.


7.   In conclusion, none of the members of the delegation was in
favour of requirements for all-seated accommodation.         Nor was
there unanimity that certain matches should be played only in big
selected stadia.      There was, however,    a general agreement that a
dividing line should be drawn somewhere between large and small
clubs above which requirements for seating could be imposed, but
there was no unanimity as to where that line should be.          Most
envisaged a formula based upon actual capacity, projected
percentage occupancy of that capacity on a regular basis,
different requirements for the first and second divisions of the
league, or a ratio of seated to standing accommodation leaving a
small proportion of standing accommodation.


Fences


8.   Lord Justice Taylor asked for the Committee's views on
perimeter fencing.      In reply, Mr Pendry drew attention to
paragraph 2.2 of the submission prepared in June.         (For
convenience this is set out below:-


     2.2    Fences.    Where possible,   fences should be removed.      All
           fences in front of seats,      family enclosures,    junior
           areas and disabled facilities should be removed.
           Elsewhere,   fences in front of terraces should
           collapse/open fully in an emergency or should be low
           enough to act as a deterrent, not a barrier.          Access
           should be possible to the pitch in an emergency.          The
           provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act should
           be reviewed.     The Football Authorities should make
           clear whether a result will stand if a match is
           abandoned due to a 'pitch invasion'.)


Lord Justice Taylor drew attention to the inter-relation of
fencing with crowd behaviour on and around the pitch.           There was
general agreement that a new offence of going on to the pitch
without lawful excuse would be valuable and would receive
Parliamentary support.      Lord Justice Taylor indicated the three
elements which might be covered (going onto the pitch, throwing
missiles, or racial or obscene behaviour at a football grou n d) .
He indicated the possibility of combining attempts to take down
fences with prohibitions of that kind.


9.   In discussion,     some MPs took the view that the sanctions
should rest within the game, with clubs being severely penalised
where their fans went onto the pitch,       for example by having a
punitive deduction of points or banning from competitions.           Mr
Carlisle believed that the FMA's power to withdraw cards would be
sufficient sanction.      Others,   including Mr Greenway,    took the
view that a new offence would be valuable,       subject to
satisfactory provision being made for cases where,       in high
spirits,   supporters ran onto the pitch at the end of the match.
Mr Lester suggested that, in view of the developments at other
sports such as cricket and rugby, the offence should be general
and not restricted to football.       He was supported by Mr Hughes,
who believed however that a new offence would be secondary in
effect to the removal of fences, which were an inhibition on the
development of civilised behaviour.        He saw the prospective
linkage between the offence and the removal of fences as a quid
pro quo which would be generally acceptable to football
supporters.    Subject to the satisfactory resolution of the.
position of children,    the disabled,   and with regard the UEFA
requirements,   there was no dissent to the proposed linkage,
except from Mr Carlisle, who expressed reservations about the
removal of fences because of the ready access to the pitch which
would be generated,    and the risk of fights between rival
supporters.


Touts and Ticketless


10.   Some MPs seemed unaware of the menace which touts presented
to the effective control of matches.      Lord Justice Taylor
explained how they disrupted segregation arrangements and
encouraged fans to turn up without tickets.      Mr Carlisle believed
that ticket touts were irrelevant to problems of safety, and that
arguments of market forces legitimised touting activity.        Mr
Lester, however, recognised the problems which touts presented
and several MPs referred to the need to ensure that the
legitimately spare ticket could be disposed of.       In conclusion,
there was no opposition, other than from Mr Carlisle,      to the need
for legislative action against touts, but the specifics of such
an offence were not discussed in detail.


Football Spectators Act


11.   Mr Carlisle asked about the relevance of the discussion to
questions of safety, and said that now that the Football
Spectators Bill had been approved by Parliament,      the way was
clear for the Government to implement it.       Lord Justice Taylor
summarised the position which had been reached on the overlap
between his Inquiry and the passage of the Bill, and indicated
that he would be making clear in his report his views on the
proposed scheme.    Any scheme for football membership would
require two further Parliamentary debates before it could be
enacted,   following receipt of his Report, and Mr Carlisle was
free to refer to the undertaking which the Minister for Sport had
given to this effect.     He was therefore anxious to have as wide a
range of opinion as possible put forward for discussion.


12.   In discussion, all but one of the members of the delegation
expressed misgivings to a greater or lesser degree about the
efficacy of the Bill.     Mr Carlisle excepted himself from these
doubts.   Mr Pendry did not believe that whatever trouble remained
inside football grounds would be overcome by an identity card
scheme, and feared that it would merely encourage greater
ingenuity on the part of hooligans.     Mr Lester shared misgivings
that hooligans would see the scheme as a challenge.     Mr Hughes,
having Millwall in mind, stressed the need to avoid trouble
outside grounds.   He feared that the effect of the Bill would be
to cause more congestion at peak times outside grounds, which
might lead to frustration spilling over in to violence.        He was
also concerned that casual supporters would be prevented from
watching football, and the clubs would be hit by loss of revenue.
This seemed to him, overall, a huge price to pay for the
potential advantages claimed by the Bill.     He believed that if
the Government were starting again, they would not have based
their strategy on the Bill.    Mr Meale returned to his concern for
the smaller third and fourth division clubs, the comparatively
small number of arrests (one or two per match) and the unfairness
of penalising all these clubs because of the activities of the
fans at half a dozen or so difficult clubs.


13.   Mr Carlisle's views on the merits of the Bill were that it
would better guarantee safety inside and outside grounds.       He was
particularly concerned with the interests of those of his
constituents outside the grounds whose lives were disrupted by
football hooligans.     He believed that the mass of genuine
supporters of football would accept the inconvenience imposed by
the scheme as a reasonable price to pay for curtailing the
activities of hooligans, and making less necessary the enormous
police measures currently in force at big matches.     In response
to Lord Justice Taylor's question how the Bill would exclude
hooligans, Mr Carlisle said that the police would be strengthened
by the knowledge of a banned list of supporters.     He was less
concerned about those who entered a football match without the
proper documentation but nevertheless behaved themselves, and
claimed that the object of the Bill would thereby have been
achieved, even though criminal offences would have been
committed.   In response to Lord Justice Taylor's question whether
a blanket strategy was the right one, or whether a better
targetting on the basis of applying Part Two of the Bill to
domestic matches was more appropriate, Mr Carlisle reaffirmed his
faith in the central strategy of the Bill.


14.   In discussion on other positive ways of dealing with
hooligans, Mr Lester stressed the need to target the individual
hooligan,   and agreed with the proposition that Part Two should
apply domestically.    Mr Hughes supported the proposition that
football hooligans should have to sign on or register, possibly
at an Attendance Centre, and felt that offenders would recognise
the stigma of being separated from their peer group at a time
when the incentive to disruption was at its strongest.     Mr
Greenway,   recognising that the Bill had been passed by a majority
of 69 on Third Reading, nevertheless felt that there remained a
considerable body of Conservative back-bench opinion concerned
with details of the scheme such as the risk that offenders would
borrow or steal cards, that spontaneous hooliganism would remain,
and that the overall objective might not be achieved.


Miscellaneous Points


15.   Mr Pendry raised the comparison between the pools tax and
the levy on horse-racing;   Mr Meale mentioned some video film
being shown by South Yorkshire police showing that the original
decision to open the gate had "never been reviewed";     and Mr
Pendry drew attention to a number of recent delayed kick-offs
following the Interim Report.

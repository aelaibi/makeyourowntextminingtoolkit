be    some       confusion          from Ground              Control              as    to w h i c h         gate       should           be

opened and          the      increased              urgency            of    the       transmissions                   gave       the

impression          that       there          was    a    crowd         problem          outside             the       Leppings           Lane

turnstiles.

I instructed             the       driver       of m y       transit              (PC 2 6 0 9 M o r g a n )             to    proceed              to

the    Leppings          Lane      area        to    see     if we           could       be    of a n y           assistance.                  We

were       not    directed          by    radio          to a t t e n d          the    ground.

On arrival         the       area was           s t ill      very           congested with Liverpool

supporters         and       having           parked        on L e p p i n g s         Lane        I got          out    of       the     van       to

walk       towards       the       turnstiles.               From           recollection               t his       would          be a b o u t

Almost       immediately                on       our    arrival           at    Claywheels              Lane        I heard a          radio,

parked       near       the    r i v e r JBridge               and       I walked          towards           the     turnstile

railings        which         form a boundary                       to    the    river.            It was           immediately

apparent        that      ^Un^^^e^^d^ad^                            Some       police       officers              were     already

being    used       as    a    cordon             to    protect           the    bodies.            I got           my   serial        to

assist       in f o r m i n g       a       human       barrier           between          Liverpool              fans     and    the       dead

bodies.        There          was       a    lot       of    verbal           abuse    being        directed             towards        us

by    some    Liverpool             supporters.                     At    the    s ame      time        s o me      injured       fans

were    being       brought             out       from       the       ground        and    it w a s         deci d e d to        place

I considered             the    protection                   of     the       dead    bodies        to       be     of   paramount

importance          and       c o o rdination                  o f those         injured           was       being       supervised           by

Ins p e c t o r Sykes          and          other       officers.               Doctors          were        tending        most       of    the

injured       and       shortly             afterwards              about       3 ambulances                 arrived        in q u i c k

succession.

The    nature       of    the       roadway             is     such       that       there       is o n l y         room    for    one

hospital.              Inspector             Sykes    was      doing          his        best, to       prioritise             the              /

casualties             but       because       o f the        narrow          roadway           it wa s         almost      impossible

to    achieve          success..

A    number       of       other       constables            had    by       n o w a r r i v e d at         the      scene      and       the

cordon was             obviously             adequate         to    protect              the    bod i e s .

I left       the       cordon          and    found     PC     Morgan              and    instructed             him      to f e t c h     the

of    the    injured             to     hospital       as     it s e e m e d            there    were       insufficient

intention             of    transporting             casualties               had          been       s u p e r s e d e d by eve n t s .

cordon       of       police          off icers.        I estimated                     there    were       between         12-18

                        Audit and Data Protection Unit

                        Force Headquarters, Snig Hill



I am a Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police Force at present working in the

Audit and Data Protection Unit of the Communications and Computer Development

Department at Police Headquarters, Snig Hill, Sheffield.

On Saturday 15 April 1989 I performed duty at the Football Association Cup Semi-

Final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Hillsborough Football

Stadium, Sheffield.

I paraded for duty at 0930 that day at the Driving School, Brightside Lane,

Sheffield frcm where, together with other officers, I made my way to Hillsborough

by Police transport.

At 1000 that day I attended the briefing given by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

and other officers in the North Stand.

I was    part    of   Sub-Section   20 which   consisted of      three marked Transit vans

containing uniformed officers.          One of these mobile patrols was Serial 51, call

sign    'Tango   Six'   of which    I was   in charge.     The   serial consisted of five

constables.

Our    written   instructions    were   to patrol   the   Grenoside   area,   paying   special

attention to licensed premises.          My inmediate supervisory officer was Inspector

Robinson.

After the main briefing I collected a personal radio, meal tickets etc and had a

brief   conversation with       Inspector Robinson as to our expected duties           before

leaving Hillsborough to patrol in the Grenoside area.

Frcm approximately 1100 to 1445 hours we paid passing attention to public houses

in the Grenoside area.       It is fair to say that there was very little evidence of

Liverpool supporters drinking in that area and the whole period passed without

incident.
It is perhaps pertinent to note that personal radio communications frcm the ground

were often broken and it was obvious that conversations were being missed as a

result although I had no necessity to contact Ground Control during the period and

to ray knowledge they never attempted to contact me.

At about 1445 hours we drove down Foxhill Road and parked near to Wadsley Bridge

Railway Station with the intention of remaining there before going to Claywheels

Lane for meal at 1515.

Almost immediately I heard Superintendent Marshall asking for a gate to be opened

at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.        There appeared to be some confusion frcm

Ground Control as to which gate should be opened and the increased urgency of the

transmissions gave the impression that there was a crowd problem outside the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.

I instructed the driver of my transit (PC 2609 Morgan) to proceed to the Leppings

Lane area to see if we could be of any assistance.          We were not directed by radio

to attend the ground.

On arrival the area was still very congested with Liverpool supporters and having

parked on Leppings Lane I got out of the van to walk towards the turnstiles.           Frcm

recollection this would be about 1455 hours.

On arrival it appeared that the problem heard over the radio had been resolved and

there seemed to be sufficient officers in the area to cope with those supporters

still milling around so after a few minutes I instructed ray serial to return to

the van and we then left the area.

I told PC Morgan to go to Claywheels Lane where I intended to allow ray serial to

start their mealtime at 1515 hours.        The match had obviously commenced and this

course   of   action   complied   with   our   written   instructions   regarding   mealing

arrangements.

Almost immediately on our arrival at Claywheels Lane I heard a radio transmission

asking all available personnel to go straight away to the ground.              We resumed

immediately and returned to Leppings Lane^ parked near the river bridge and I

walked towards the turnstile area.       As I approached the area I saw about 12 people
laid out on the tarmac roadway which leads frcm Leppings Lane round the back of

the South Stand and main entrance of the ground.     They were laid near the railings

which form a boundary to the river.       It was immediately apparent that they were

dead.     Sane police officers were already being used as a cordon to protect the

bodies.     I got ray serial to assist in forming a human barrier between Liverpool

fans and the dead bodies.    There was a lot of verbal abuse being directed towards

us by sane Liverpool supporters.     At the same time sane injured fans were being

brought out frcm the ground and it was decided to place them on the opposite side

of the roadway to the dead bodies.

I considered the protection of the dead bodies to be of paramount importance and

co-ordination of those injured was being supervised by Inspector Sykes and other

officers.    Doctors were tending most of the injured and shortly afterwards about 3

ambulances arrived in quick succession.

The nature of the roadway is such that there is only rocm for one vehicle at a

time travelling nose to tail and as each ambulance stopped the rear doors were

being opened by fans and their friends and relatives were being placed in that

ambulance irrespective of their medical condition.     Vain attempts were being made

by sane officers to rationalise the use of each ambulance.

I recall a doctor who was rendering first aid complaining that as an ambulance

arrived and stopped on the roadway        the nearestcasualty   to the rear doors was

being placed in the vehicle either         by relatives/friends or by police officers

without concern for the injuries of that casualty compared with others waiting to

be conveyed to hospital.     Inspector Sykes was doing his best to prioritise the

casualties but because of the narrow roadway it was almost impossible to achieve

success.

A number of other constables had by       now arrivedat the scene and the cordon   was

obviously adequate to protect the bodies.

I left the cordon and found PC Morgan and instructed him to fetch the Transit van

to the track area at the rear of the Leppings Lane turnstiles with the intention

of using the vehicle to transport sane of the injured to hospital as it seemed
there were insufficient ambulances to cater for the casualties.

By the time PC Morgan returned to me with our Transit van other ambulances had

arrived     and   it   became   obvious   that   ray original   intention   of   transporting

casualties had been superseded by events.

As the ambulances cleared in front of us all the injured had been removed to

hospital leaving only the dead bodies still guarded by the cordon of police

officers.     I estimated there were between 12 - 18 bodies although I never actually

counted them.

Rather than attempt a difficult reversing manoeuvre I instructed PC Morgan to

drive the van right round the roadway behind the South Stand and out again onto

Penistone Road with the intention of driving round the block to get back to

Leppings Lane.     At this time there was just the two of us in the vehicle, the rest

of the serial remaining in the roadway area with the bodies.

As we drove past the directors entrance we were stopped by DCI Addison who asked

us to convey him to Hammerton Road police station which we did.

Frcm there we returned to Leppings Lane where I was rejoined by those of ray serial

who had not got involved in other duties.           We then parked in Penistone Road near

to Wadsley Bridge and monitored Liverpool             supporters   leaving the ground and

returning to their coaches parked in Halifax Road.              Apart frcm the odd abusive

comment they were mainly orderly and obviously subdued by the events of the day.

As they cleared the area I got PC Morgan to take us to Claywheels Lane to allow

the officers on ray serial to wash and freshen themselves up.

On arrival I was met by Superintendent Brougham who invited us to have a hot drink

and sit and talk to a number of police officers who I recognised were frcm the

Barnsley area.     He informed me that they had been on duty inside the ground on the

perimeter track near the railings where it seemed most of the Liverpool supporters

had died.     They were obviously distressed and he asked me to sit with them and

just listen to their accounts of the events leading up to the tragedy.

I remained at Claywheels Lane for about 20 minutes doing this before re-ccmmencing

a mobile patrol in the area.       Traffic was still very congested and I found that we
were being stopped by police officers on foot who had off duty doctors and nurses

with them who were trying to get to the Northern General Hospital in answer to a

request for their attendance which had been broadcast over local radio.         We

escorted several of them to the hospital if they had their own cars or took them

in the back of the transit if they were on foot.

We remained on general mobile patrol in the area until about 1845 hours.   By this

time traffic was light and there were few supporters left in the vicinity of the

ground.

I returned to Claywheels Lane frcm where my serial was stood down.

I booked off duty at the Driving School, Brightside Lane at 1900 hours.

In conclusion, I feel it necessary to re-iterate that prior to the match I had not

witnessed any public order incidents involving supporters frcm either team but

following my arrival at the Leppings Lane roadway area at about 1505 hours to form

the cordon of police officers surrounding the bodies I was subjected to more

verbal abuse frcm Liverpool supporters who were obviously the worse for drink than

I have ever witnessed in 26 years police service.

I think it is fair to say that if the circumstances had been different numerous

arrests would have be made but I am convinced that such action would have inflamed

an already difficult and distressing situation and would only have been counter

productive.   For that reason and for that reason only those involved were politely

but firmly told to move away frcm the area.

EC AID FOR HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you for your letter of 19 June.

I will certainly deal with handling questions of the allocation
of the EC money with the Hillsborough Appeal people.

I would be grateful if you would submit the official thank you
letter as proposed,since your Department will always have the
better sense of the appropriate level at which to deal with an
international body. However, I am happy to offer a contribution
on the internal practicalities of dealing with this grant and you
may like to use a short paragraph as follows:

     "It is particularly helpful that the Commission has agreed
     to make the payment directly to the Hillsborough Disaster
     Appeal fund. In the UK disaster appeal funds provide the
     quickest and most effective way of getting assistance to
     those who most need it,based on^Iocal knowledge and
     sensitivity that only a locally organised fund can have.
     This is the route we ourselves use in making specific
     Government funds available for the victims of disasters."

I am copying this to Tony Budd and to Alan Hingston at UKRep.

                                              W

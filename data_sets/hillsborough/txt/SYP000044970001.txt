 Dear Sir

 I refer to your letter in respect of Anthony Dennis Leigh with regard to
 the Hillsborough disaster and his complaint.

 The allegations made by Mr Leigh fall within the criminal inquiry now
 undertaken by this force. This investigation is now supervised by the
 Police Complaints Authority but the nature of the inquiry now, as opposed
 to that conducted for Lord Justice Taylor, means that the statement made by
 your client cannot be released.

 I do hope you understand the current situation.

 Yours faithfully

 SUBMISSION OF H.E. WRIGtfP,, QFSM,MIFireE,FBIM, CHIEF FIRE OFFICER. SOUTH
 YORKSHIRE— COUNTY FIRE SERVICE, TO THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO THE
 DISASTER AT THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM. SHEFFIELD, ON 15TH APRIL, 1989.




 1*      Introduction




         I feel sure that all the members of the Safety of                        Sports     Grounds

         Working    Party, including myself, never believed that the disaster

         at   the   Hillsborough          Stadium,     Sheffield,         could     ever        occur.

        However,     it    did,        and having given positive thought as to why it

        happened and what steps might be taken to obviate the                            possibility

        of     repetition         at     any      stadium,       I   submit        the     following

        recommendations for consideration.                 In making these I am conscious

        of    the need to put forward practical suggestions capable of being

        implemented quickly and relatively easily.



2.      Recommendations



2.1     Ingress

        To prevent any unduly large crowd                from     being     kept     waiting      for

        admission    and    at the same time minimising the consequent dangers

        of crushing and illegal entry;—




2.1.1   Separate turnstiles should be provided to permit                         access    to    each

        stand, terrace and pen within the stadium.




2.1.2   The   turnstiles     providing          the    access     mentioned       in 2.1.1 above

        should be in sufficient number to               be      capable     of    admitting       the

        capacity    calculated         using     Chapter     16 of the Guide to Safety at

        Sports Grounds in not more than 1 hour, using the notional rate of

        750 persons/turnstile/hour.

                                               - 1 -
2.1.3    Where          there       are    insufficient turnstiles to satisfy 2.1.2 above,

         either:

             (i)       additional turnstiles must be provided, or




         (ii)          the capacity            of   each         stand,    terrace     or    pen    should     be

                       restricted         to    the        number       of spectators that the existing

                       turnstiles will admit using the notional rate                             mentioned     in

                       2.1.2    above.




2.1.4   Chapter           5    of    the       Guide       to        Safety at Sports Grounds should be

        amended to satisfy the above and cross referenced to Chapter 16.




        In effect the capacity of each stand, terrace and pen will be                                        the

        lowest figure produced based on exit capacity, standing or seating

        area and the capacity of the turnstiles.




        The factor which determines the capacity should be recorded on the

        General Safety Certificate for each stand, terrace and pen.



2.2     Control of Numbers




        There          has     never been a legal stipulation in the Safety of Sports

        Grounds Act 1975, that required the capacity of                                    individual      parts

        of         a     sports      ground         to      be       specified    in   a    General      Safety

        Certificate.




        Section 2(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act,                                   which    did     set

        out    matters          which      had      to      be included, was replaced by Section

        19(2)(a) of the Fire Safety and Safety of                                Places     of   Sport     Act,

        1987, with effect from 1st January, 1988.

                                                       -    2    -
                  The    present position is that the Secretary of State now has power

                  to    issue   Regulations     detailing    the    matters     to        be       covered,

                  including     capacities,     but   has   not    yet done so, therefore each

                  authority is free to        apply   whatever     conditions        it    wishes       to,

                  therefore




         2.2.1          The   Secretary of State should urgently make Regulations regarding

                 **ke terms and conditions as may be included in the General                        Safety

    ,   Yuri     Certificate.       This    should include a requirement for the capacity

                 of each stand, terrace and pen to be specified.



         2.3     Perimeter Fences




                 Planned means designed to allow for the             quick    release          of    crowd

                 pressure need to be clearly specified in guidance to authorities.




                 Chapter 15, paragraph 215 of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

                 provides guidance on the width but          not    the   frequency            at    which

                 gates should be provided in perimeter fences.




                 The    provision   of     perimeter fences goes against all professional

                 training of Fire Service Officers and it is hoped              that           a    better

                 solution might be found.




        2.3.1           Perimeter    fences    should    only     be required where it can be shown

^                that they are absolutely necessary and the continuing provision of

                 all existing fences should be reviewed in this light.




                                                 - 3 -
 2.3.2       An     accepted       professional body should be requested as a matter of

             urgency to produce a standard specification for a perimeter                        fence

             for     use    at     sports grounds.          I recommend that this specification

             provide for sections to be quickly and                 easily     removed   from    the

             perimeter track side by authorised personnel in an emergency.




             When     available,       this standard should be satisfied at all grounds

             where    perimeter fences are considered necessary.




2.3.3        Where    perimeter fences are required then gates, not less than                    1.1

             metre    in width,must be provided to allow spectators to be                   quickly

             evacuated       onto     the     pitch    perimeter.     Such     gates   should     be

             sufficient       in     number    to provide for the evacuation of each area

             within 3 minutes, with a minimum provision for each area of 2 such

             gates.    Chapter 15, paragraph 215 of the Guide to Safety at Sports

         Grounds should be amended accordingly.




2.3.4    A level stepping arrangement should be provided through                         gates    to

         avoid        tripping hazards and wherever possible such gates should be

         in line with radial gangways.                 Gate-release fastenings         should    be

         capable           of easy     and immediate release from the pitch side only,

         especially under crowd pressure.



2.4      Stewards




         It is vital that the number of stewards on duty are sufficient                          in

         number, adequately trained and effective in their duties.




2.4.1    I    recommend that in broad terms a syllabus to enable satisfactory

         training for stewards, together with                    examination    standards    with

         regard to their duties, be established on a national basis.

                                                  -4    -
2.4.2    The    Police should be the examining authority for stewards and the

         passing of the examination will enable those so                 qualified    to    be

         employed if so capable as stewards at sports grounds.




2.4.3    The    standard     of    examination should reflect the responsibilities

         and duties of each steward.




2.4.4    A Chief    Steward       should   be    appointed   to   take    charge     of    all

         stewards.




2.4.5    Senior Stewards should be appointed to take charge of the stewards

        in a defined area of the ground.




2.4.6   All stewards should be readily identifiable when undertaking their

        duties     and I suggest that this be in the form of coloured jerkins

        each separately numbered to enable each steward to                 be    identified

        from a distance.



2.5     Communication




2.5.1   The use of the       public address system to provide advice to stewards

        and Police should be fully realised,            especially when      noise    seems

        to    apparently      reduce   the      overalleffectiveness        of   hand held

        radios.    Training in the use of this equipment should be                 provided

        for    those   who    use the equipment to instigate messages and those

        who are expected to react to them.




                                           - 5 -
2.5.2    Should any decision be made to evacuate any part of a stadium                                   for

         whatever        reason, I suggest that each emergency service be alerted

         even if their attendance may not be required at that                            time.          This

         will     provide       a pre-warning during which basic requirements as to

         the correct address to which a                  response     may    be     needed       can      be

         satisfied, together with the need for a likely rendezvous point.




         Should     the       situation       develop to the point of needing a response

         from another or all emergency services a much                       briefer      call          will

        ensure this.




2.5.3   I     understand       that     the     Police    have made recommendations to the

        Inquiry which suggest either:-




            (i)   A senior officer of each of the                 emergency       services         be    in

                  attendance at the Police control box at a stadium, or




        (ii)      the    Police       control    box     at the stadium is provided with a

                  private      wire    connection        to the     Control       room    of        each

                  emergency service.




        My     opinions       regarding       these     suggestions are not supportive.                   I

        understand that at Hillsborough on 15th April the                         Police       in       the

        control box were not aware of the difficulties that existed on the

        West Terrace.          Should this be so then I would assume that                      a    Fire

        Service     Officer       would       have    equal   difficulty but even when the

        problem was identified he would                  be of      little    use    without            the

        manpower        and    equipment       that    he would undoubtedly request.                    The

        advantage would, therefore seem                  to be     related     to    knowing            the

        abilities of the Service.




                                                - 6 -
         The provision of a senior Fire Service Officer to achieve this on,

         hopefully, the extremely infrequent                       occasions      when      it    will    be

         required      would      seem    to     be    an     over-provision          which       could be

         achieved more easily by close liaison between the Services.




         I also understand that the Police were in communication with their

        own     main    control      room      at Police Headquarters which already has

        private       wire    connection         to    each    of     the       emergency        services.

        Private wire connections from each of the stadiums provided with a

        safety certificate, or likely to require such in                             the    future,       to

        each     of    the    emergency        services       control rooms would also be an

        extremely expensive way of providing good information to the other

        Services which good training and liaison should satisfy.



2.6     Liaison




2.6.1   Regular liaison between all those responsible for implementing the

        requirements         of   the     Safety       of    Sports        Grounds    Act        and     the

        respective       clubs          should        take    place        to   provide      a     greater

        understanding of the problems being met.




2.6.2   The arrangements proposed by the                    Club     and    Police,        where       these

        differ    from       those   specified         in the General Safety Certificate,

        should be considered by the appropriate                       local      authority        working

        party     to     ensure      that      these        will    not     affect     other       safety

        precautions.




                                               - 7 -
 2.7      Other Matters



 2•7*1    The Club managements of each ground                 requiring    a       General     Safety

          Certificate        should   be    required     to    audit the safety provisions

          within their ground considering the different uses to                        which    they

          are    put.       A full written report should be presented to the local

          authority for consideration.           The full satisfaction of               the    Guide

          to Safety at Sports Grounds should be used for such audit.




          Any    proposed changes to the ground which would affect any part of

          the safety precautions should be accompanied                by       a     safety    audit

          report      identifying     the    effects     of    the proposals and the steps

          proposed to compensate for them.             The     proposals       and    the     report

          should      be    submitted to the local authority for consideration and

          approval under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act prior to any other

          submission for approval,




2.7.2     In    order to undertake such duties effectively it must be realised

          that manpower resources are needed and this should be catered                          for

          in    the        departments      of   local        authorities          holding      such

          responsibilities.

   SUBMISSION ON PAST ONE OF THE


        HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY




            ON BEHALF OF




SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE


               AND


     CIVIL DEFENCE AUTHORITY
                       THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE FIRE SERVICE ON
                          15TH APRIL, 1985, AT HILLSBOROUGH




     1-(a)     It is not suggested in the light of the evidence                                       tendered

               at    the     Inquiry        that       the          earlier summoning of the Fire

              Service would have resulted in the saving of lives or                                            the

              prevention           of     injuries.            Nevertheless         it is regrettable

              that     notwithstanding                the          obvious      need          for     cutting

              equipment,           once    it        became          apparent      that       persons were

              trapped behind the perimeter fence in pens                                  3    and        4,   no

              request        for    the      Fire         Service       to attend was made until

              15.13.45.          Every appliance carries cutting equipment which                                      Hornsby
                                                                                                                      20.73.F
              could        have         speedily              removed        the   perimeter              fence.

              Emergency tenders also carry heavier duty portable cutting

              equipment          which     could,             if    necessary, have been used to                      20.75 -C
              remove the radial fences.



      (b)    Chief Superintendent Duckinfield accepted that by 15.04 it
                                                                                                                     Duckinfield
                                                                                                                     8.107.E-F
             was     apparent to him that people were trying to get out of

             the pens and that             they        were          having     difficulty           getting

             through        the     gates.       Although he accepted that an obvious

             solution would be to cut some of the fence down, he stated

             that     the    thought         did      not          immediately pass through his

             mind,     it is noted however that at 15.07                           a    request            from      S.A.I.
                                                                                                                     P.11
             ground control for a fleet of ambulances was made.



2.           Calling the Fire Service

     (a)     Following       a     request for bolt cutters made at about 15.12

             by radio from the area                  of       the     perimeter        fence         to    the

                Service.




     <b)        PC Bichard passed the following message on the VHF channel

    (c)    This        request        was     overheard by Chief Inspector Edmundson
                                                                                                      Edmundson's

(d)        Meanwhile,           in     the     operations       room    Julie    Webster,       a

           temporary control                room   assistant,     was     dealing       with    a     Webster's

     therefore be at risk.

     telling         her     to    tell     the    Fire   Service      that      cutting       Edmundson’s

     equipment was wanted at Hillsborough.                                                     statement




     The conversation between Miss Webster and Miss                        Davies       is

     recorded        in    the     transcript of the Fire Service tape and

     the part relating to Hillsborough took                     from     1 5 .13.45    to

     15.14.58, a total of 1 minute 13 seconds.



    Comments

    It    is   to be noted that although the message passed by PC

    Bichard to Force Control complied with the requirements of

    the   emergency procedure in that the precise location that

    the Fire Service were. to. attend and the type of                      equipment

    required     were        specified,      Miss Webster who spoke to Miss

    Davies made no mention of Leppings Lane or                     the     need       for

    hydraulic    cutting           equipment.      This    procedure       had    been

    agreed upon at          a     meeting    between      the   three      emergency
                                                                                             Core
    services on the 9th August, 1988.

Inspector        Sewell           accepted    that the necessity to provide

such information to the Fire Service was obvious and                              that
                                                                                             Sewell

the Fire Service was entitled                     to expect such details from

the police.           By contrast, such           detailed      information       was

provided        by        police    force    control      at    Snig Hill to the
                                                                                             Clarke
                                                                                             24.75.E-F
Ambulance Service.
      (C )     Miss Davies whose call had been interrupted, had                            to     make

               sure that she had satisfactorily dealt with the Gatty Road

               fire whilst at the same                time    trying     to     deal      with     the

               police request for assistance at Hillsborough.




  <d)         She     needed     to     know the address of Hillsborough Football

              Ground to make           sure     the    appliances        were      sent    to     the
                                                                                                          Davies
                                                                                                          20.40.C-D
              correct     place and as quickly as possible from the nearest

              fire stations,           she was, in our          submission,        entitled        to

              expect     that         police    force        control would know the place

              where     the     Fire    Service        were    required       as    they         were

              presumably already in attendance. If more detail as to the

              location could in fact have been provided , it                        could        have

              caused    an unnecessary delay,if she had mobilised the Fire

             Service to the district of Hillsborough. This                          would       have

             been     the appropriate alternative procedure in the absence

             of such information.




(e)          She asked for the           road    three        times    whilst      typing        the

             information        into     her    computer       and     the    first       enquiry

             produced    an     answer        unrelated       to   the    question.              The

             address,    Penistone           Hoad,    was     finally     provided by Miss

             Davies' supervisor, Mrs Moody.




(f)      If the police at Snig Hill had relayed                        the     message      from

         ground        control        that     the    Fire     Service       was required at
                                                                                                         Davies
                                                                                                         20.46.B-C
         Leppings Lane, that information would have been typed into

         the     computer        by    Miss     Davies        and produced an immediate

         'special risk' response.




                                              - 4 -
 (g) Miss Davies needed to know the nature of the                             incident         at

           which   the      Fire     Service was required to attend so that a

           decision could be made as              to   what       type     and   number         of

        appliances          should     be   sent.       m     the        circumstances the

        statement that there had been a                 major       accident        was    not

        helpful       and      it   is unfortunate that PC Bichard's request

        for hydraulic cutting equipment which would have indicated

        the    need      for      emergency     tenders was not relayed to Miss

       Davies.

   and       later the Safety of Sports Ground Advisory Group gave

   advice to the local authority.




  until 7th September, 1987, the Pire Service was designated

  the        primary      authority        for     means        of     escape       and     fire          Core 27

  responsibility           was         defined     as    fire        precautions,          fire

  alarms, means of escape, emergency                        lighting          and    stadium

  potential overlap of responsibility was                             quite     extensive.

  It had been pointed out on the instructions of ACFO Seaman                                          Sea^n

 by DO Grimshaw that the fire Service would only be able to

 for the effect on holding capacity of the structure of the

 terrace       including         crush     barriers            was      the       Building

 Surveyor's Department.




Thus,        for example, when the removal of barrier 144 in pen

3 was discussed and determined on 7th August, 1986, it was                                           Calvert

not expected of the Fire service representatives to advise

on how holding capacity would be affected, if at all.

                movement.




                Even with the maximum holding                   capacity    permitted         by

                the     Green      Guide,      the     density     of spectator packing

                would permit ease of movement through the pen                        and      it

                is most unlikely that a serious crushing problem would

                occur.       The    Fire       Service     video     and      photographs

                demonstrate             the      maximum        density      of      packing

                contemplated by the Green Guide.

      The gates in the perimeter fence and in the radial fences

     in the west terrace.




     These were never intended by the Fire Service to cater for

     the        numbers      which       were admitted to pens 3 and 4 on 15th

     April, 1989.            when the perimeter gate to pen 3 was opened,

     many        persons     were        already lying across the mouth of the

     gate and it is, in our submission, highly                        unlikely,         even

     if     the       gate   had        been   1.1 metres wide, that evacuation

     could have been conducted at such a rate as to                           save      life

     or           prevent               serious           injury.            That          is

                                               - 9-
   not to say that the gates would not have been adequate for

   the     kind of emergency which could reasonably be envisaged

   if the appropriate holding capacity had been adhered to.



  Perimeter Fence Gates




  (a) Paragraph 18.3 of the 1976 Green Guide                              requires       that
                                                                                                     1986 Green Guide
         access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as                                      Paragraph 209

         possible in normal circumstances whilst providing                                the

         police       with    proper          access to the terraces for crowd

         control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event

      of        a     serious          emergency.        Paragraph          7 .9.1      which

     requires that such fences be provided with                                 gates     for

     use        in    an emergency does not stipulate the frequency

     or minimum width of such gates.




 (b) Paragraph 215 of the JL986 Green                        Guide    provides - that -

     perimeter          gates          should    have       a minimum width of l.i

     metres subject               to    paragraph       6    which        accepts       that

    deviation          from        individual       guidelines            are   possible

    without necessarily detracting from the overall safety

    of     the       ground       and        paragraph 8 which states that it

    should be borne in mind that, when using the Guide                                   to

    assess            whether           existing        circumstances            provide

    adequately for the safety of spectators, the criterion

    to     be       aimed    for        is    that of a reasonable degree of

    safety.

     evacuated       in the event of an emergency which required

     total evacuation.            The gates were intended for use                             in

     the      event of local emergency to permit the evacuation

     of a relatively small                 number         of       spectators         and     to

     allow access by the police.

    to    the   rear,       and   the        placing of exit signs on the

    perimeter fence         gates          would        be     likely         to     attract

    spectators       away    from the preferred route and lead to

    an exacerbation of any existing crushing problems.

    the police at the time that too                   many     spectators       had

    been allowed to escape rather than too few.




(h) It    is     a    requirement of paragraph 7.9.2 of the Green                     (1986 Green Guide)
                                                                                      Paragraph 215
   Guide 1976 that perimeter gates should be                      controlled,

   so     that       immediate      access        to the pitch or perimeter

   track, can be ensured in. the event of an emergency, - It -

   follows       in     our   submission that if they are to be an

   effective safety measure:




   (i)         There must be an awareness by those controlling

               the    packing       of the pens of the possibility of

               crushing among the spectators.




   (ii)        There must be constant vigilance to ensure that

               any difficulty or problem              within     the    pen     is

               noted.




  (iii)        Prompt action must be taken to open the gate or

            gates       if    the        need arises. In relation to the
                                                                                      Core 140
               1981 incident, the chief              Constable    said     that

                               -    12   -
                his    only       criticism of his senior officers was

                for not opening the gates earlier.

               Superintendent              Duckinfield      had    concluded, in            7'14°'G

               the light of the discussions and information he

               had,        that      the    pens     on the       Leppings     Lane

           terraces did not present a major problem.                            The         Mole

           mentioned in any briefings.                                                     Greenwood
                                                                                           12.29.E


           The operational orders emphasised the                        need        to     South Yorfcshix.

          eventualities, particularly crushing,                        was     not

          referred to.




          Thus on or before 15th April, 1989 the officers

          on the ground do not appear to have                        been    made

          aware       of     the dangers of crushing in the pens,

      maximum holding capacity i.e. 54 persons per 10 square

      metres and steps had immediately been taken to prevent

      further spectators from entering the                       centre    pens       by

      closing      the tunnel and the radial gates, any crushing

     problem that arose could have been safely resolved                               by

     evacuating an appropriate number of spectators through

     the perimeter fence gates.              These would have permitted

     evacuation at a rate of at least 60 persons per minute

     per pen (attributing to each gate only one unit width,

     namely 0.55 metres.)

         of 5 minutes 38 seconds for 1015 spectators and the                                        3

         unit      widths       at     the tunnel for pen 4 provide an exit

         time of 5 minutes 45 seconds for 1,036 spectators.




  (b) in compliance with paragraph 6.13 of                            the        1976       Green

        Guide an alternative exit route was provided, although

        its possible use in an emergency was regarded                                  by     the

        Fire    service         as     extremely        remote.       The alternative

        routes were through the radial gates each of which are

        of   two    unit        widths.          Thus pen 3 could be evacuated

        through the gate into pens 1 and 2                       in    8     minutes           27

    seconds and pen 4 could be evacuated through the gates

    into pens-6,and 7 in 8                    -minutes     38    seconds.                     is

    submitted             that        if    an    announcement         was           made     to

    into       which      the        spectators        from     pens 3 and 4 could

    readily be absorbed.




(c) There is a potential                   conflict       between      the        need        to
                                                                                                         Evans

   spectators from the outer pens.                         However,          paragraph

   50     of the 1986 Green Guide states that a smooth, free

  flow through an exit route                      to   the      outside          is    best

                                 -     16 -
            achieved by controlling the crowd flow at the entrance

            to the     exit    route.     The   provision     of     a    wider        or

            additional gate in the radial fence would be likely to

        hinder the free           flow      through   the    alternative        exit

        route        via     the north and south ends of the west stand

        in that spectators would be entering                  the     outer    pens

                                                                                                       LAU   /j
        from the centre pens at a greater rate than they would

        be leaving them.




  (d) It would have been              undesirable     to    mark     the     radial
                                                                                             Eastwood
                                                                                             27.76.D
        gates or exit routes since that would                 in an emergency

       be likely to deflect spectators from the preferred and

       speedier        exit route even when the tunnel was open and

       available. Furthermore, the gates served not merely as
                                                                                             Seaman
                                                                                             23.4.C-E
       emergency        exit     routes     but were also there to enable

       safe distribution of the spectators to take place.



 (e) When the radial fences were approved                    by     the    Officer

       Working        Party      on 11th September, 1981, it was made a
                                                                                            Core
       condition that           the new gates in the radial fences                at        153

       the     rear     of      the terrace     should      be under       police

      control.         It       was clearly     understood by         the     Fire

      Service        that     such    control    would be effected by the                   Seaman's statement
                                                                                            2.11.(ii)
      gates being constantly manned, it was a matter for the

      police      to    decide       how many officers were deployed to

      carry out that function.




(f)   Paragraph 7.9.2 of the 1976 Green Guide required                        that

      access      points       through a pitch perimeter fence should

      be "controlled so that immediate access to                    the     pitch

      can    be      ensured    in    the event of an emergency".             The

                                 -   17 -
    condition       imposed         in     relation          to     the radial fence

    gates should have been read in this context.




(g) According to Superintendent Stuart, the requirement of                                     Stuart
                                                                                               31.108.D-H
    the    Working        Party      that        the    radial gates should be

    under police control was interpreted by the police                                   as

    a   conditional        control          in    the        sense that the gates

    would only       be    manned         when     segregation            was        taking

   place.      There       is       no    evidence           that    this       was ever

   discussed or given approval by the Working Party.




(h) In our submission, in order to control the numbers                                  in

   pens 3 and 4 it was essential to man the radial gates.
                                                                                              Evans
                                                                                              26.25.D-E
        further entry into pens 3 and 4 was to be prevented
                                                                                              26.26.B-E
   by     closing    the central tunnel, it would be necessary

   to prevent or at least control                      movement        through         the

   radial     gates.       A police officer or officers stationed

        the back of the terrace could have                          supervised         the

   packing     of    pens       3    and     4, directed spectators, and

   notified police control when the                      pens       were       reaching

   their      appropriate            capacity.           Furthermore,            in     an

   emergency when the tunnel could not be used the police                                     Eastwood
                                                                                              27.75.E-76B
   officer    would       be     immediately            available         to     direct

   spectators to the presence of the gate and                             assist        in

  the      passage        of        spectators          through       it.       In     our
                                                                                              Sewell
  submission,        a    police         officer        or        officers           could    31.31.E-G

  properly     carry       out      these        functions          without       being

  "swamped"     providing           the     maximum          possible          holding

  capacity      envisaged            by     the        Green      Guide     was       not

  exceeded.




                               - 18 -
 (i) It     appears that on 15th             April,        1989     spectators did

     not    leave        pens     3    and 4       by way ofthe radial gates

     after serious difficulties had arisen within the pens.

     The    Fire     Service          anticipated that were the gates in                     Seaman
                                                                                             22.151.D-E
    the radial fences to be                  used    for     this       purpose,       an

    announcement           on    the    public       address        system to that

    effect would be made.               If    there        had    been     a    police

    officer on duty at the gate he would have been able to

    make spectators aware of the existence                         of    the        gates

    and     assist       in     keeping      the     gangway clear.             Had the

    number of spectators in each pen                   been         kept       even to

    their    maximum          possible holding capacities, permitted

    by the Guide, relatively                 free    movement        towards         and

    through the radial gates would have been possible.




(j) However,       the     apparent       failure of spectators to maVo
                                                                                            Sykes

                                          IN SUMMARY



  (1)       There       is no justifiable criticism that can be made of the

            Fire Service as to the manner in which they                             responded             to

            the     call   for     assistance             at 15.13.45.         The request came

            from South Yorkshire Police                   Headquarters         Force          Control.

            The     Fire   Service       in        the    interests       of    a    prompt           and

            appropriate response were entitled to proceed on the basis

            that    the    police    would          be     able    to     provide details of

            precisely where their appliances were to                        attend            and     the

         precise         purpose    for       which        they    were required.                  On the

         basis of the information that had been                           passed         to    Police

         Force Control, all such information was in fact available.




 (2)     In       any   event,     even - if any criticism can justifiably be

        made against the Fire Service on this score,                                in    view        of

        the        times   involved,          it    had     no causal       connection with

        deaths and injuries sustained in the disaster.




(3)     m     so far as there was any delay in the                        updating            of    the

        Safety Certificate, that was neither caused by, nor was it

        the responsibility of the Fire Service.




(4)     As regards the pens on the west terrace, and in particular

        the       perimeter      fence    gates           and    radial    gates, the Fire

        Service, in giving           advice          to    the    Working       Party,             were




                                          - 20 -
 entitled     to    proceed    on the basis that the Club and          the

 police would control the numbers in, and the safe                 packing

 of,    the   pens.     Even    if the numbers in the pens were as

 high as the maximum possible holding capacity permitted by

 the    Green Guide, it is submitted that the perimeter fence

 gates and    the     radial    gates    would    have   performed    the

functions     for     which    they   were intended,      The perimeter

fence gates would have permitted the              safe   evacuation    of

sufficient     numbers to resolve any local crushing problems

that could reasonably have been anticipated as               likely    to

occur    in   those    circumstances.       The    radial gates, with

appropriate     directions,      would    have    provided     a     safe

alternative    means     of    escape from the centre pens if for

some reason, which was regarded as           highly      unlikely,    the

tunnel was to become blocked.

                               FINAL OBSERVATIONS
                                                                            t(£J




      I. INTRODUCTION


   1.        A large number of witnesses and a great deal of evidence has

  been heard in the course of the 31 days during which the inquiry has

  been sitting.     We do not propose in these observations to go into

  detail or seek to resolve issues of minor importance.      We will give

  our views on the major issues and seek to indicate what in our opinion

  are the important findings of fact which the Tribunal ought to make.

  We do not conceive it to be our task to invite the      Tribunal to

  apportion blame, but we recognise that is inevitable that criticisms

 will be made in the course of deciding what happened and why.      We

 shall not shrink from making such criticisms as we consider

 appropriate.




 2-         In deciding what happened, we have been greatly assisted by

 the video and photographic records, all of which have been freely made

 available by their owners.    We should like also to place on record our

 gratitude to the interested parties for their co-operation in

producing relevant documents and witnesses and to the West Midlands

Police for their immense effort in interviewing witnesses and

collecting the necessary evidence and in producing for us, often at

very short notice, exceedingly helpful reports and summaries of their

enquiries.     Without that assistance and co-operation our task would

have been impossible.    As it is, we are conscious that we have

completed this stage of the inquiry within 3 months of the occurrence

of the disaster and that many witnesses who were at the ground and who
                                               2



       could have given relevant evidence have not been called.           We have

       taken the greatest possible care to try to call a representative cross

       section of witnesses and to ensure that no serious issue has been left

      uninvestigated or uncovered by evidence.         We are satisfied that we

      have succeeded in   this    objective and that   sufficient   evidence has been

      called before the Tribunal to enable it to reach proper and accurate

      findings.   All parties represented have had the opportunity to

      nominate witnesses whom they considered were able to give useful

     evidence and we have, so far as possible, tried to accommodate then,

  We confidently believe that there are and can be no complaints that

  any relevant witness, who could add to the account given by others

  has been overlooked or that any evidence has been omitted which

  affects any material finding of fact.




  3.         In opening this inquiry on lsth May, there were set out what

 the indications were at that stage of the sequence of events.               After

 31 days of evidence,      it is not necessary to change anything of

 importance.      The picture, broadly speaking, remains the same.          By

 about 2.30 pm, there was a serious crush outside the turnstiles at

 U ppings Lane.     As the minutes went by, the situation deteriorated and

 by 2.47 had reached such a state that the experienced police officer

in     charge, Superintendent     Marshall, decided    that the   only way to avoid

injuries or death was to open the exit gates to relieve pressure                 He

radioed    a message to   the    controller,   Chief Superintendent   Duckenfield

who authorised the opening of the gates.           At 2.52 pm Gate C was opened

and    about 2000 went through it.      By this time, the two central pens on

the terraces, 3 and 4, were full, although there was space on the
  wings.     When the gate was opened, no measures were taken to prevent

  those entering going down the tunnel ahead of them into the already

  crowded central pens.      Most did so, causing severe congestion in the

  pens.    As a result, 95 in the pens were crushed to such an extent that

  they died and many more were injured.     Unfortunately, the police

  officers in the control room and on the perimeter of the pitch failed

  to appreciate that the pens were overcrowded and that fans were in

 distress.     The perimeter gates, inadequate as they were, were not

 opened in time and measures to relieve the situation were

 insufficiently expeditious or adequate.      This does not mean that

 individual police officers did not do all they could.      The fault lay

 in a lack of planning and of leadership and, above all, in a failure

 to appreciate the need to control the numbers in the central pens.



 II. STATE OF THE GRflIJNn

 1.        Following representations by the South Yorkshire County

 Council in April 1978, on 7th August 1978 Hillsborough was designated

 as a stadium requiring a safety certificate under the Safety of sports

Grounds Act 1975 with effect from 1st January 1979.      The club

appointed Dr. Eastwood’s firm, Eastwood and Partners, Consulting

Engineers, to act on its behalf in its dealings with SYCC and/or

Sheffield Metropolitan District Council     "in relation to the ground

being designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act" (Doc: 30).

There were meetings and correspondence about various improvements

which were needed to the ground in order to achieve the capacity

desired by the Club.    The Leppings Lane terraces were awarded a

capacity of 10,100, after the existing crush barriers had been tested

and, as necessary, replaced and new ones positioned.     This capacity
                                      4



 was based on the figure in the Green Guide, stated to be the maximum,

 of 5.4 per m2 reduced by about 10% to take account of the lack of

 gangways.     This lack was not considered by Dr. Eastwood to be   of

 significance because of the ease of movement throughout the terrace:

 at that time, there were no radial fences.




 2.          In 1981 at a cup semi-final there was some crushing.   This was

 caused by a combination of uneven distribution on the terrace, an over

 capacity of about 500 and the late arrival, due to traffic problems,

 of a number of supporters.     An early goal exacerbated the situation,

 because there was a surge, and a number of fans were injured.

 Perimeter gates were eventually opened and fortunately sufficient fans

were able to escape to alleviate the problem.       There had been some

crushing at the turnstiles and the police were, according to Mr Vaux,

slow to react to events.      There are obvious similarities to the events

of 15th April 1989, but fortunately the injuries were few.




3.          It is significant that the police at the time appear to have

believed that the figure of 10,1000 in the Safety Certificate was too

high: see Doc: 136.     Their letter to the FA does not reflect this

belief - see Doc: 138 - and it does not seem to have been put to the

Working Party of SYCC concerned with the Safety Certificate.        The

answer to the problem was considered to be the division of the terrace

by radial fences with 3 pens of roughly equal areas.      Eastwood and

Partners were asked by the Club at the same time to consider an

alteration to the turnstiles, but that did not in the end come to

anything.
      4.      The erection of the pens was not of itself a bad idea.        The

      fences were to have gates at the top, to enable egress to be made to

      the adjoining pens.    Much has been asked about these gates and the

      arrangements,   if any, to man then., whether by stewards or by the

   police.     It seems they were to have a dual use: first, to enable fans

   to go from one pen to another to help in an even distribution on the

  terrace as a whole and secondly, as emergency exits in case of the

  need to evacuate the pen.       Dr. Eastwood said that he believed there

  would be police control over these gates because he recognised the

  importance of maintaining the numbers of people in the pens.

  Unfortunately, although he was aware of the importance of this

  control, he does not seem to have impressed the club or the working

  party with it.      The police interpreted control as meaning that the

 gates should be left open, only needing an attendant if they were to

 be closed and might need to be opened in an emergency.




 5-         The reality was, as Dr. Eastwood accepted, that without any

 mechanical means of counting, there was no possibility of adhering to

 the capacity in the pens.       Accordingly, no capacity was formally

 adopted and the safety certificate remained as it was.       Reliance was

placed on visual assessment.       The problem with that was that all

responsible, both police and stewards, accepted and tolerated density

in excess of that which was proper.       Evidence was given by police

officers to the effect that full meant chest to back and shoulder to

shoulder and that it was only when people were in obvious discomfort

that action would be taken to shut off a pen.       This is not

intentionally callous; it is a reflection of what football crowds have

been conditioned to put up with.      It is significant that in both 1987
                                    6



 and 1988 the conditions on the terrace in the central pens were

 thoroughly unpleasant, but no-one complained and each match received a

 clean bill of health.   The failure to seek the views of supporters or

 to take any steps to inquire into their comfort is a notable feature

 of the story unfolded in the evidence.    It has led to assumptions

 being made which were dangerously inaccurate.




 6.       In 1985 there were plans to improve the turnstiles at Leppings

 Lane.   In addition, the police asked for more radial fences.    The main

 purpose of those changes was segregation, so that home and away

supporters could both be accommodated at the west end of the ground.

 In the result, the scheme to increase the turnstile numbers, and to

achieve not only segregation but a means of counting numbers into each

part of the terrace, was riot pursued due to the reluctance of the club

to incur the expense.    In fairness to the club, it does not appear

that Dr. Eastwood impressed upon them with sufficient emphasis the

absolute need to keep the numbers in the pens to a safe level and the

desirability of the increase of turnstiles to achieve that.      He said

that he saw   it as his duty to advise the club on the safety

implication   of any proposal and to raise any objections he may have

had on that score.   But he seems, perhaps understandably, to have

adopted the attitude that the working party was there to approve or to

disapprove and, if it was satisfied, all well and good.    The working

party for its part did not appreciate the absolute need for regulation

of the numbers in the pens and so no steps were taken to review the

safety certificate appropriately.   In the result, the centre pen was

divided by a radial fence down its centre and part of it was taken out

of commission by a second fence to form the sterile area now known as
V




                                          7



     pen 5.     The barriers in pen 3 had to be modified because one stretched

     right across it.     This was done by removing two sections of railing.

     This had an effect on capacity and also resulted in the gaps being too

     wide.    In 1986, as a result of a police request, barrier 144 in pen 3

     was removed because it was said to be causing an obstruction at the

     mouth of the tunnel.     This, too, had an effect on capacity.




     7*         It is clear from the history that the pens were developed in a

     piecemeal fashion.     It is difficult to accept Dr. Eastwood’s evidence

     that he made a positive decision not to follow the Green Guide advice

    on the width of gaps and that there was a full discussion at the

    working party.     There is no record of such a discussion, which is

    surprising.     One suspects that the significance of the changes and the

    need to ensure that there was no overcrowding was not fully

    appreciated at the time and there is an element of hindsight creeping

    into the evidence that has been given.      Furthermore, the record of the

    telephone calls at docs. 379 and 380 do not suggest that Dr. Eastwood

    was as concerned as he now suggests about the need to monitor and

    control numbers in the pens.     His evidence that he was misquoted by

    his colleague Mr Strange is not very convincing.        Be that as it may,

    the result of the changes     was that the capacities of the pens

    according to the formulae     set out in the Green Guide were 822 in 3     and

    871 in 4.    A conservative   estimate of the numbers   in pen 3 at 1503   pm

    on 15th April 1989 is 1576.     It is likely that that pen contained at

    least double its safe numbers.
                                     8



 8.           In April 1986 the Sheffield City Council became the licensing

 authority.    Mr Bownes was the individual responsible.   He himself had

 no direct knowledge of sports’ grounds and their safety and was

 responsible for a large number of disparate licensing systems.      In May

 1986 he reported that the conditions attached to the safety

 certificate gave "some cause for concern, as they appear to be

 inadequate or inappropriate in some areas” .    In evidence, he said that

 those were ill-chosen words and he meant nothing more than that the

 certificate should be updated to reflect the substitution of the City

 for the County Council.    We find that evidence unsatisfactory, but we

 are left in the dark as to the precise ways in which Mr Bownes

 believed the conditions were inadequate or inappropriate.    They

clearly were in that they failed to reflect the existence of the pens.

Mr Bownes very properly embarked upon a review of the conditions.and

decided that the working party system inherited from the County

Council needed to be changed.    Sadly, his review was not concluded,

nor indeed nearly concluded by 15th April 1989.     He was undoubtedly

overburdened and he did not appreciate that there was any real problem

at Hillsborough.    Nevertheless, there can be no excuse for the failure

to sort the certificate out and more particularly to ensure that

something was done to prevent overcrowding on the terraces.     In

fairness to him, the other members of the advisory committee (as the

working party became) did not apparently appreciate the need for

action.   The absence of any certificate at all at Sheffield United and

the glaring omission to change the capacity for the Kop are

symptomatic of failure to do what ought to have been done.
                                     9



 9.          The police and fire authority both had an input, being

 statutory consul tees.    But on the key issue of capacity neither had a

 direct concern.     The police were, of course, concerned with problems

 of order and generally safety.    They were not experts in capacity nor

 is it altogether surprising that they thought in terms of visual

 monitoring.    The fire service was concerned with the sufficiency of

 emergency evacuation measures.    They say they were given to understand

 at a meeting on 10th April 1985 that the police would man the gates at

 the back of the radial fences and thereby be able to monitor numbers.

 The police deny this.    It is difficult to believe that there was such

 a positive undertaking by the police: if there had been, one would

expect it to be recorded in writing and it is not.     The only record is

back in 1981 (Doc: 153) where it is noted that the new gates would be

under police controlr     The probability is that the need to.control

numbers was not properly appreciated so that having men at the gates

was not considered to be as important as it now appears.     The fire

service may well have believed that the police would be in charge of

the gates.     In league games they were, and the system involved the

filling of the pens one after the other.     In 1985 and 1986 there were

no semi-finals and the problem of a capacity crowd into all the

terrace did not arise.    This may have given rise to any

misunderstanding.




10.      It will be clear that it is our view that the avoidance of

overcrowding in the pens is the key to safety.    The perimeter fences

are needed to prevent pitch invasions and they, or some similar

barrier, are a requirement of UEFA and of the FA: see Doc: 296.       They

are not in themselves the problem, although the gates or means of
                                      10



  egress through them must be adequate to cater for an emergency.       Those

  at Hillsborough were not, being narrower than the 1.1 metres required

  by the Green Guide.     Provided that the fans are properly distributed

  in proper numbers, no problem of crushing should arise.     Indeed,

  smaller areas ought in theory to be safer, since they contribute to

  ease of distribution.    However, the smaller the area, the greater the

  significance of an increase in numbers over the safety limits.




  11.        There are other defects in the ground which contributed to the

 disaster.     There were an insufficient number of turnstiles to

 accommodate the 24,000 or so fans who were to come through them.       The

 Leppings Land entrance to the ground formed a natural bottleneck.

 Crushes at the turnstiles were, it seems, not uncommon, but normally

 they were shortlived and. contained well within the perimeter gates.,

 Unless fans came to the ground over a reasonably long period,

 ie. about 90 minutes, and at a reasonably steady rate, problems were

likely.   Furthermore, there was a complete absence of adequate signing

inside the turnstiles.     All fans were encouraged to go down the

central tunnel and would be forgiven for not being aware of any

alternative route.     Suggestions that anyone who had been before,

indeed any fan who knew football grounds generally, would have

realised that they could go round the side of the west stand we found

unacceptable.    The lay out at Leppings Lane was the result of a need

to segregate.    That need had not existed since the 1987 season, but no

changes had been made and no signs put up.    It was accepted by Mr

fiackrell that the club could not at semi-finals comply with the

requirements of condition 28(1) of the Safety Certificate that a

record be kept of the numbers of spectators admitted to the west and
                                     11



 north west terraces respectively.        There were no means of controlling

 the numbers on any part of the terrace within the limits of total

 capacity.




 III. OTHER PRELIMINARY MATTFRS

A. Who was to control the fans on the terrace?

 1.          The Green Guide clearly places the responsibility of ensuring

the safety of spectators upon the management of the ground, in this

case, the club: see paragraph 23.     The South Yorkshire Police Standing

Instructions for the Policing of Football Matches (Police Doc: 11)

include as one of the specific duties of stewards that they should

prevent overcrowding and ensure that crowd limits in various parts of

the ground are complied with: see Appendix L paragraph 7(a).        The

evidence of all senior police officers from Chief Superintendent Mole

at the outset has been consistent.        The police did not expect there to

be any stewards on the terraces and no active steps were to be taken

by anyone to control or direct spectators on the terrace so as to

avoid overcrowding.     The fans were expected to find their own levels.

If the central pens became overcrowded, the fans would either turn

round and go back up the tunnel or disperse by the gates at the rear

of the radial fences to the adjoining pens.       The police in the control

room would keep an eye on the pens and, if overcrowding was detected,

should take steps to stop more coming in.       Alternatively, although it

was not part of the match operational order, police officers on the

perimeter of the pitch and in the west stand would report any problems

to Control to enable them to take necessary action.       The club was

clear that it had no responsibility for the management of the fans on

the terrace and said there was an agreement, not in writing or
                                      12



  specifically recorded (pace Mr Lock whose evidence in this regard we

  consider unsatisfactory: such an agreement would in our view

  necessarily have been recorded somewhere), that the police should take

 on that responsibility.      At league matches, it seems that the police

 did manage the pens.      At semi-finals, the arrangement was as described

 above.




 2.       In the light of the evidence, which is all one way, it is in

 our view futile for the police to attempt to suggest that the club and

 not they were responsible for the safety of the fans on the terrace.

 It is interesting to note that in Harris v. Sheffield United FoothaH

 Club, South Yorkshire Police asserted that their responsibility went

 beyond maintaining law and order and extended to the safety and

 comfort of the fans.   This is not at all surprising, since it was

 accepted in evidence that the police were concerned with the safety of

everyone in the ground.      There certainly ought to have been a clear

and explicit written agreement between the Club and the police to

ensure that there was an effective means of maintaining and

controlling the numbers going into the pens to prevent overcrowding

and its attendant dangers.     It was a grave defect that not only did

no such agreement exist but no arrangement at all was made which

produced any effective means of avoiding overcrowding.     The policy of

allowing the fans to find their own level was dangerously useless:

Dr Eastwood’s description of it as ridiculous is clearly right.

Furthermore, the monitoring of the state of affairs in the pens by

Control was ineffective.     It is quite extraordinary to find that Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield could look at a photograph of pen 3 at 2.45

(Composite II DB16/29) and say that there was still plenty of space in
                                   13



 it.   There manifestly was not, particularly when one bears in mind

 Dr. Eastwood’s evidence that people tend to avoid the very front

 because it is below the level of the pitch and so the view is poor.

 That evidence of Mr Duckenfield is a good example of the conditioning

 referred to in I1/5 above and the dangers of reliance on visual

 monitoring.   It seems, too, that the view from the control box    tended

 to give a false impression.   No field glasses were available and the

 camera, which could have been used for close-up shots, was defective

 and in any event not used at the material time because those in the

 control box were concentrating on the problems outside the turnstiles.

The police failed to make it clear to the officers who could have seen

the numbers building up that they should report to control; there was

nothing to that effect in the Operational Order or any briefings and

Mr Duckenfield’s evidence that-he expected the officers to report....

those matters is not credible.   There was no system to deal with

overcrowding and the problem does not appear to have been foreseen.

This is surprising since in 1988 the tunnel was blocked off to prevent

more going into the central pens, which was overcrowded although not

dangerously so.   That was not reported in the course of any debrief

and was unknown to Chief Superintendent Mole or any senior officer

involved in the planning.   It ought to have affected the 1989

operational order.




B._ The decision to give Liverpool the Leppinas Lane end

1.      Chief Superintendent Mole made it clear that he would only

agree to police the semi-final at Hillsborough if each team’s

supporters had the same end as they had had in 1988.   That decision

was in our view justified and it was left to the FA to decide whether,
                                     14



 in the light of it, to choose Hillsborough.       The 1988 fixture had,

 according to Mr Evans’ report, gone well.       In fact, Liverpool had then

complained that, although they had more support, they had the smaller

ticket allocation.      In addition their supporters had further to

travel.      Mr Kelly accepted that, in retrospect, the choice of

Hillsborough for the second year running was somewhat unfair to

Liverpool.      It was also unfortunate that Liverpool’s complaints about

the choice of Hillsborough for 1989 were not put before the Committee

which had to decide on allocation.        Liverpool and its supporters had

reason to feel unfairly treated.     There were no factors which

militated in favour of Hillsborough rather than Manchester United.

Those set out by Mr Kelly in his evidence are unconvincing.        The truth

seems to have been that it was thought convenient to use Hillsborough

because things seemed to have gone welT in 1988.




2.        Although the wrong decision was in our view made, it is

difficult to see how it had any direct connection with the tragedy.

There were no doubt a number of fans who were unable to get tickets,

perhaps more than there might have been had the match been played

elsewhere.     This may have resulted in more ticketless fans coming to

Sheffield in the hope of getting into the ground.       Certainly, there is

evidence of considerable numbers of fans asking for tickets.        It is

clear that after the tragedy, some Liverpool fans were blaming the

allocation of ends.     We do not think that an inference can be drawn

from that that large numbers of ticketless fans gained admission.           In

the shock and confusion things were said which were not properly

thought out.     There is no reason to change the opinion stated in

opening this inquiry that a disaster such as this could have occurred
                                      15



  at any semi-final and that, if Nottingham Forest supporters had been

  allocated to the Leppings Lane'end, an Inquiry might well have been

  considering why some of them were crushed to death.




  C ^ The testing and collapse of barrier 124A and the removal „f     ml a


  1.      Two sections of barrier 124A in pen 3 collapsed as a result of

  the overcrowding.    There can be no doubt that that collapse caused a

 number of deaths.     The barrier had been tested by Dr. Eastwood’s firm

 in July 1988 and had passed.




 2.      The test had been carried out in accordance with

 Dr. Eastwood’s interpretation of Annex C to the Green Guide.    The

 force of 6.0 KN/metre width has to be applied for three 5 minute

 periods, a record being-kept.of.the amount of deformation during each

 loading and of the percentage of recovery.    If the recovery is less

than 50% after the third application of force, there is a failure: if

it is 50%-75%, there must be a retest.     As may be apparent, the

question is 50% or 75% of what?     Is the recovery by reference to the

position of the barrier before the first application of force or

before the third?     If the former, a span of 124A recorded 53% and

should have been retested; if the latter, it recorded 100% and passed.

 Dr. Eastwood adopted the latter and so passed it.    He justified his

interpretation in evidence.    We think he was wrong and that safety

ought to have dictated that the recovery must be by reference to the

position of the barrier before the first application of force.       But we

do not think we can be criticised for adopting his interpretation,

because it is fairly open on the language of Annex C and has some

support from the tests in the British Standards.
                                       16



     3.     Although the collapse of the barrier caused deaths, there were

     many who died elsewhere in pens 3 and 4 and, if it had not collapsed,

     fans would in all probability have been crushed to death against it.

     In his statement, Dr Eastwood said that it was in his view "reasonable

  to believe it failed on 15th April 1989 because it was subjected to a

  significantly greater crowd pressure than is envisaged in the 1986

  Guide".     That evidence was not challenged, since it is manifest that

  the gross overcrowding in pen 3 would have created an excessive

  pressure.    The vertical run behind it to barrier             ancj the

 diagonal run to the tunnel side of the pen at the top would have

 increased that pressure.     There is no certainty that the different

 interpretation and a retest would have led to renewal of the barrier

 or that, even if it had been renewed, it would have survived the

 pressures exerted upon it.     Furthermore,- even-if it had-survivedv i t ..

 is difficult to say that lives would have necessarily been saved.          It

 is incidentally unfortunate that Dr Eastwood’s test records were

 incomplete, since the test of one out of three of the spans was not

recorded.     It happens that in the case of 124A the one omitted was the

one which survived.




4.          We should also refer to the removal of barrier 144 in 1986.

This did materially affect the capacity and we think that insufficient

consideration was given to the adverse effects of the removal.       It

made it all the more important to regulate the numbers going into the

pens; this no-one seems to have appreciated.     Its removal made it the

more easy for fans coming down the tunnel to spread out into the pen

and we believe that its absence did result in a greater flow down the

pen. The evidence of Inspector Bullas, who was looking down from the
                                            17



   west stand, of a sea of people flowing down the pen ts graphic and

   consistent with the sort of movement one would expect.           A number of

   fans spoke of being carried down the pen from the tunnel as they

   entered after Gate C was opened and we know that at least 20 of those

   who died came in through Gate C after 2.52 (a fact which gives the lie

   to the opinion expressed in some quarters that drunken late-comers

  killed those who had arrived in good time) and some of those ended up

  at the front of pen 3.




  IL   The Police P l a n n i n g


  1.        The police operational order for 1989 was essentially a

  reproduction of that which had apparently worked well in 1988.           So

 much was this so that it omitted to include the Instructions to the

 police Tango units to assist the ambulance and fire services to make a

 rendezvous point at Herries Road Bus garage as had been agreed in              "

 August 1988: see Doc:477.          This omission might have been important: in

 the event, despite the emergency that arose, it seems to have made

 little difference.        Since there had been a minor pitch invasion at the

 end of the 1988 match the Order underlined the instruction to serial

 1, the offices on the perimeter track, to forbid anyone "access to the

 track from the terraces without consent of a senior officer (except to

receive medical attention)".          In this context, senior officer meant an

inspector of higher ranking officer.          Thus it was drummed Into all

officers that access to the pitch must not be permitted except in the

most exceptional circumstances.         This led to the failure to react

quickly enough to the emergency that in fact arose.         Police were

conditioned to believe that any attempt to come out of the terraces

must be a pitch invasion and therefore must be prevented.         In

addition, there was insufficient planning to deal with the arrival of
                                        18



      fans a   the turnstiles.   It was assumed that they would arrive in a

      steady flow and that there would be no build up.     It 1s interesting

      that there was a considerable body of evidence from fans to the effect

  ' that in 1988 there had been a much higher profile policing en route to

      the ground.   Fans coming down Lepplngs Lane had been stopped and asked

      if they had tickets and steps had been taken to weed out those who had

      not and to control those going to the turnstiles.    Some witnesses even

      talked of a recollection of barriers across Leppings Lane.    The police

  denied that there was any difference and there 1s nothing in the

  Operational Order which suggests any change, save for a reduction in

  numbers of officers posted to public order duties away from the

  ground.      It may be that the relatively smooth running of things in          '

  1988 has led people to think there was more control than 1n the chaos

 of 1989, whereas in fact there was no materia, difference:        In any     ■

 event, it 1s clear that in 1989 insufficient consideration was given

 to the possibility of the arrival of large numbers at once or to the

 problem of a substantial number of latecomers.       The need to control at

 a distance from a ground was Identified in 1926; that lesson was not

 learnt at Hillsborough.




 2-        The plan had been operated in 1988 by Chief Superintendent

Hole.     He had considerable experience of overseeing the policing of

Hillsborough.       He was moved to a new post at the end of March 1989 and

was succeeded by Chief Superintendent Duckenfleld.        Mr Duckenfleld had

little recent experience of policing football grounds and had not been

to Hillsborough for some 10 years.      That was, of course, not his

fault.     He Inherited a plan which had appeared to work well and was

content that it would work well again.       He did not have the experience
                                          19



      to recognise all the potential problems.     This was not his fault, but

      we feel that he should have taken more time and greater care to

      familiarise himself with the ground and    all its problems.

      Alternatively, Mr Mole could have been asked to deal with the match,

     notwithstanding his new posting, since to require that Mr Duckenfield

     should be in control if such an important match with a capacity crowd

     so soon after his appointment was     to     aska greatdeal of him.



     Ill   SATURDAY 15TH APPTI   i q «q


  As— The crush at the turnctiloc


     1.      Because of the need to segregate Liverpool from Nottingham

  Forest fans, 12 turnstiles which normally were used to gain access to

 the North Stand from Penistone Road were not used.        This meant that

 all 24,000 Liverpool fans had to enter by the Leppings Lane...

 turnstiles.      1-10 were allocated to the 9880 in the North Stand, 11-16

 to the 4465 in the West Stand and A-G to the 10,100 on the terrace.

 This meant that there was considerable pressure on the turnstiles and,

 assuming a hoped-for rate of 800 an hour was achieved, it would have ’

 taken well over an hour to get everyone in.       Any hold ups would have

 increased that time.     The design of the ground made this imbalance of

 turnstiles inevitable and it is a defect which undoubtedly contributed
to the disaster.




2-           It was essential that there should be no impediment to the

s.coth operation of the turnstiles.        However, there are a number of

things which did cause fans to congregate outside the turnstiles and

to obstruct and delay the entry to the ground.        In particular, we

would identify the following matters:-
                             20



   (1) The confusing nature of the tickets coupled with the

   signing outside the turnstiles.    1-10 were marked A, 11-16 C

   and A-G B, so that they ran ACB.   B was the other side of a

  wall to A and C, so that anyone getting himself on the wrong

  side had to extricate himself and go to the other side.

  Furthermore some of the signs placed to show the appropriate

  colour coding of the relevant turnstiles were too low and

  invisible once a substantial queue built up.     Police officers

  said that there were numerous queries from fans as to where

  they should go and that the signing was not at all good.      The

 Club ought to have made sure that the tickets and signs were
 clear.




 (ii)     The activities of ticket touts.   There were touts

 operating, albeit not in large numbers, in the vicinity of the

 Leppings Lane turnstiles: one at least was arrested for

 obstruction.   Touts are a menace because (a) they encourage

 fans to come without tickets in the hope of being able to buy

one, (b) they sell supporters tickets for the wrong end of the

ground, thus imperilling the segregation of the fans and (c)

they cause obstruction.    Ideally, they should be barred from

the vicinity of any ground, but there are difficulties in

devising a means of curtailing their activities without

preventing the perfectly lawful and unobjectionable swapping

or selling of tickets other than as a business.
                           21



  (iii)   The presence of ticketless fans.    The evidence makes it

  clear that there were many fans asking for tickets.      Police

 officers on duty at and near the turnstiles give various

 estimates of the numbers, ranging from 200 to 2000.      Fans have

 told the inquiry that much more was done in 1988 to try to

 weed out the ticketless than in 1989.     Whether or not that is

 right, very little was done in 1989.    The police told the

 inquiry that there was little they could do, since no offence

 was committed in being near a ground without a ticket,

 provided there was no obstruction or breach of the peace.         We

 do not think the police are so powerless.    Ticketless fans do

 cause problems and, in sufficient numbers, are almost bound to

 cause an obstruction.   It is in our opinion perfectly

reasonable for a police officer to ask a fan if he has a

ticket and, if he has not, it is lawful to refuse him access

to the immediate vicinity of the ground.     Such refusal can be

justified on the basis of an apprehended obstruction.      In any

event, we suspect that in many cases an indication by an

officer to a ticketless fan to go away would suffice.




(iv) Some ticketless fans tried to get in by bribing turnstile

operators or by rushing or climbing over turnstiles.      Others

with tickets for the Kop tried to get in the Liverpool end.

Both of those categories of people delayed the turnstiles and

affected the smooth running of entry to the ground.
                                       22



   3-          By 2.30pm all pretence at orderly queueing had ceased and

   there was a crush of fans at the turnstiles.       Although, according to

   the operational order, officers outside the turnstiles had inter alia

   to form orderly queues, the Inspector in charge (Inspector Sykes) told

   the inquiry that that was an impossible task when a large crowd

  attended.   By 2.40pm or thereabouts the police had lost control.         The

  crush got worse and worse and the gates had to be opened.        Attempts to

  save the situation by the use of mounted officers failed.        Despite the

  views of Inspector Hand-Davies, which must be given considerable

  weight, it seems to us that the area was too confined to permit of

  effective action by horses,     t h e y did not have sufficient room to

  manoeuvre and were enveloped by the crowd since individuals were

 unable to move away, there being nowhere to move to.       Superintendent

 Marshall himself was overwhelmed by the crowd and his efforts to

 alleviate the crush were ineffective.      At some stage, an attempt was

 nade to shut the perimeter gates and to form a barrier of horses to

 prevent new arrivals coming down Leppings Lane joining the back of the

 crush and so making things worse.     This tactic seems to have

 succeeded, at least for a time, but it was too late, for, very soon

 afterwards, Gate C was opened.     Evidence was given that, despite the

barrier, fans were forcing themselves through, even going under the

horses’ bellies.   The perimeter gates, or some of them, were pushed

open.   The evidence of what precisely happened is confusing.      There is

no doubt that there were fans, particularly among those arriving at a

relatively late stage (i.e. 2.45 onwards) who, perhaps because they

had had too much to drink or because of selfishness or to create

difficulties in the hope of getting an advantage (e.g. admission to
                                      23



    the ground without a ticket, or for SOme other reason, did push and

    shove and exacerbate the position.     But those were a minority.




   4-          The manual log kept by Superintendent Murray shows that at

   14.17 there was a request to close Leppings Lane.      Hr Marshall and Hr

   Duckenfield think the request came later and certainly Leppings Lane

   was not closed to traffic until after 2.30.     If Hr Hurray’s timing is

   correct, the police outside were aware of problems building up at a

   comparatively early stage.    We find it surprising that no measures

  were taken by those inside the ground 1n the control box to try to

  seek information to ascertain whether many fans were still coming

  towards the ground.    It is also surprising that nothing was done by

  the Commander outside to deploy officers to try to control the fans

  arriving further away from the ground to create a breathing space          At

 about 2.30, Hr Duckenfield, seeing the crowd at the turnstiles, asked

 Mr Hurray if they would get everyone in by 3pm.     Hr Hurray said he

 thought they would.    It does not seem to have occurred to them to

 check the turnstile count or to find out how many were to come         It

 should by 2.40 at the latest have been apparent that all would not be

 in by 3pm and the kick-off should have been postponed.     It had been

 d e e d e d that kick-off would only be postponed if there were some

reason other than their own volition which caused late arrival of a

substantial number of fans.     This was to adopt too inflexible an

approach.   Postponement might not have eased the crush, but, since it

was accepted by many witnesses that things got worse nearer to 3pm

because fans did not want to miss any of the game, it might well have

d»ne.   If a dangerous situation was created, it should not have
                                        24



      mattered what caused ,t.    If postponement of the kick-off might

      reasonably have overcome the danger, it should have been done.




      5-      All the police witnesses concerned in the policing asserted

      that they did not foresee that there would be so many arriving late,

      and at once.   They go on to suggest it was unforeseeable.   We

     disagree.   It is, we would have thought, not in the least surprising

     that fans should be reluctant to spend many minutes standing on a

     terrace or, for that matter, sitting in a seat with very little in the

     way of entertainment provided.   There was some evidence of knowledge

     by the police that fans were developing a pattern of arriving 15

     minutes or so before kick-off because,   it was thought, they were

  seeking alcoholic refreshment elsewhere since they could not get in

  the ground: see Doc: 434A.     This was not particularly referable to

  Liverpool fans, but, on the day, the police were at a fairly early

 stage aware of a considerable amount of drinking by supporters.          It

 was a fine and fairly warm day, such as would encourage people to sit

 - o u n d in the sunshine.   ,t was an all-ticket match, so that fans

 "°uld be f° rgiVe" f° r S i e v i n g that it would not take very long to
 get in.




6-         In any event, we do not think that those who arrived ihour

before kick-off can properly be branded latecomers, particularly since

the t.ckets said spectators should be in their places by 2.45.          It was

taking up to 20 minutes to get through the crush and into the ground

Once the crush developed, there was more difficulty in getting through

the turnstiles which worsened the crush.
                                        25



            It has been said that, had the fans not pushed, the problem of

 crushing would not have arisen.        This is a superficially plausible

 View.     But It ignores the reality of crowd behaviour.     It has not been

 seriously suggested by any police officer that the mood of the crowd

 up   to about 2.30 was other than good natured.      It is precisely because

 people who are aiming to go to a particular place through a limited

 means of access do tend to crowd together that there is a need for

control.        And, as one witness said, once you are in that sort of a

crowd, you only move forwards or sideways, never backwards.         Sideways

was constricted, so all were tending to move forwards.




8.        We should refer to other factors which have been suggested as
causative of the crush.




          (a)    licketless Fans                      ....      ~          ~


          As we have already said, it is very difficult to estimate the

          number of ticketless fans.     It has been suggested that there

         were a substantial number who were determined to get into the

         ground without a ticket.      There is some evidence, notably

         from Mr Taylor, the effect of which is that some fans were

         overheard expressing the intention to get in by way of an open

         gate or to cause a gate to be opened.     Attention is drawn to

         the arrival of large numbers of Liverpool fans at all-ticket

         League matches in the hope of gaining admission.     And it is

         pointed out that at this year's Cup Final there were up 1000

       fans who had come to force an entry to Wembley Stadium.       We do

       not doubt that there probably were some fans who came without
                              26



  tickets determined to gain entry.      But we find it impossible

  to accept that the crushing was caused by such fans so as to

  engineer the opening of a gate, a theory propounded by

  Superintendent Greenwood.      (See Day 12, p.95).   That would

  have involved a truly amazing degree of preparation and good

  fortune.     However, there may well have been a number of fans

  who took advantage of the situation and were happy to

  exacerbate and make use of the crush.     Opportunists probably

 did hope that a gate would be opened and that they would get

  in through it.    To that extent, ticketless fans may have

 contributed to the difficulties at the turnstiles.



 (b)   Drink

 Many witnesses, particularly the police, refer to a large

 consumption of alcohol, mainly lager.     Fans arrived in

 Sheffield in good time but then stayed outside the ground

drinking, either at pubs or in public places.      Some police

officers suggested that the ban on the sale of alcohol in the

ground contributed to this pattern of behaviour.       It was

pointed out that, having regard to the crowds, those seeking a

drink inside the ground, if it was permissible to sell it,

would be unlikely to succeed in getting more than a pint (i.e.

a single drink).     It does certainly seem that a significant

number of fans did decide to take advantage of the sunshine

and drink so that they arrived comparatively late and in a

condition affected by alcohol.     The drink had increased

selfish and stupid behaviour, leading to pushing and a
                                       27



              failure to take any notice of police appeals to hold back.

           There was a considerable amount of boorish and loutish

           behaviour (e.g. urinating in gardens or backyards, throwing

           empty cans all over the place, shouting, swearing and

           chanting) which sadly tends to be associated with football

          crowds.     That sort of behaviour is inexcusable.      But it was a

          minority of fans who were guilty of it and it did not cause

          the trouble.     It probably contributed to the inability of the

          police to alleviate the trouble once it had arisen.



          (c)    Hooliaanism

          This is really coupled with the taking of drink, although

          those may well have been fans who did not need drink to behave

          in a thoroughly antisocial fashion.    Police horses were burnt

         with cigarettes, there was pushing and shoving and some fans

         behaved in a thoroughly selfish way, concerned only to get

         themselves into the ground without caring for the comfort or

         safety of their fellows.     But this sort of behaviour was that

         of a minority and did not cause the problem.    The primary

         cause of the crushing was the bottleneck at Leppings Lane,       and

         insufficiency of turnstiles and a failure by the policy

         properly to control fans arriving before they reached the

         perimeter gates and the turnstiles.



B.   The opening pf the gates

1.      At 2.47 Superintendent Marshall radiped the first request tp

ppen gates.     Grpund cpntrpl was fpcussing pn gate C and   sp   it was that
                                       28



      gate that was expected to be opened.     At 2.48 it opened to eject a fan

     and some 200 or so outside burst in.      This happened before Hr

     Duckenfield was able to decide on an answer.     Shortly afterwards the

     request was repeated, again that the gates should be opened.        Chief

     Superintendent Duckenfield realised that to open the gates would be to

     act contrary to all the planning and, would let unsearched and

     possibly ticketless fans into the ground.     He had a difficult decision

     to make and he took his time making it.     Unfortunately, neither he nor

     any of his advisers in the control room took any steps to prepare for

     the consequences of opening Gate C In particular.    The inevitable

  result would be an influx of fans down the central tunnel and into

 pens 3 and 4:     this should have been foreseen.     Hr Hurray attempted,

 he says, to contact Hr Lock, but was unsuccessful.        Otherwise, no

 attempt was made to contact or to warn the stewards in the club.           The

 suggestion that the officers on the concourse ought to have acted on

 their own initiative does not bear examination:        they did not know

 that the gate was to be opened nor did they know that pens 3 and 4

 «ere already full.     I„ fact, by 2.50 pens 3 and 4 had reached their

 safe capacity.    This should have been obvious to those in the control

box.     Even if it was not, steps should have been taken to prevent the

large numbers who were bound to come through Gate C from going down

the central tunnel.




2-         At 2.54 the teams came out onto the field.     This resulted in a

roar from the crowd, encouraging entrants to the ground to hurry to

their places.     So it was that the greater portion of the 2000 or so

who entered through Gate C went into pens 3 and 4.       They came in in an
 orderly fashion, glad to escape from the dangerous crush outside.          At

 2.58 Gate A was opened, but this time there was some preparation

 inside, largely because of the foresight of Sgt. Higgins.         Mr

 Duckenfield took additional steps by deploying a serial to the front

 of the North Stand to cater for that influx which might have caused

 trouble to the seated customers in that stand.        Those standing on the

 terrace were left to fend for themselves.




 3*       It is clear that the failureto take any        steps to prevent fans

 going from Gate C to pens 3 and 4 was theeffective cause        of the

 disaster.    The decision to open the gates cannot be criticised:        the

 failure to foresee the result can.




C.    Inside the around             -       .........      ... ........

1*       It has been submitted that a    video shows    activity in pen 3

suggesting that the barrier broke before 2.52.         We do not find that at

all likely.    It is contrary to the evidence that is available from

fans who were in the vicinity of that barrier.         It is also less

probable, since a surge in an overcrowded pen was far more likely to

have done the damage.     It was believed at an earlier stage of the

inquiry that the surge of fans coming in from Gate C, coinciding with

the arrival of the teams on the pitch, caused the collapse.         The

evidence now available suggests it may have occurred later, possibly

even as late as 3.05, when the hitting of the bar at the Nottingham

Forest end caused a surge on the terrace.     There is much conflict, but

it seems that by 3.02 or thereabouts, when Gate 3 had been opened

properly, a pile of bodies was already obstructing it.
                                         30



     2.     Since no steps were taken to prevent it happening, the pens

     got fuller and fuller.   As they did, people began to be crushed to

 death.     Some fell to the ground and were asphyxiated as a result:

 others were unable to breathe standing up.            Almost all died from

 traumatic asphyxia - the crush was so great that they could not

 breathe.     As this happened, they began to cry out in distress.         The

 police officers at the perimeter fence were slow to react, partly

 because they were accustomed to overcrowding, partly because the noise

 level made it difficult to hear that the cries were of people in real

 distress and partly because they were conditioned and instructed to

             the integrity of the pitch.      PC Hooson told the inquiry that

 he came past the North Stand and, as he approached gate 4, he realised
                                              <k-
 that fans were in distress and he tookjjjpon himself to open Gate 4.

 This was sometime between 2.55 and 3pm.            Thereafter, Gate 4 remained

open.     PC Illingworth, the officer on Gate 4, does not agree; he says

he opened that gate.      It is possible that it had originally been

opened by PC Illingworth and shut again and then reopened by PC

Hooson.     But insofar as there is a conflict of evidence to be

resolved, we would submit that PC Hooson’s account is to be preferred.

PC Illingworth must feel himself open to criticism; PC Hooson has, on

the face of things, no axe to grind.




3.         Gate 3 was opened, according to PC Smith, by the force of the

fans in the pen.     He shut it again.     The same happened again and it

was only then that he appreciated the need to keep it open to try to

help to extricate the injured.     This account, courageously given, is

corroborated by fans.     Dr Eastwood accepted that, given sufficient

pressure, the gate could have opened in the way described.
                                      31



 4*          It is not possible to say precisely when the gates were

 opened, since the videos available were not focussed on the pens at

 the crucial time.     The photographs in Composite Album II show gate 4

 open at 15.00 and gate 3 at 15.02.        Videos show both gates closed at

 15.00:45 (MAP 1) and gate 4 open at 15.00:50 (MAP 3).       The earliest

 that Gate 3 is shown open on a video is 15.03: 49 (MAP 8).       All this

 makes Mr Grobelaar’s timing very suspect and his description of the

 various moves in the match is not borne out by the video of the game.




 5.          Not only was there a slowness to react to the situation in the

 pens, but also, once fans had begun to climb over the perimeter fence

 (at about 3pm), the immediate reaction was that it was a pitch

 invasion.    This was unlikely for various reasons, not least because

 (a) the fans did not go on the pitch and (b) there was no conceivable

cause for an invasion at that stage of the game.        Valuable minutes

were spent while those in the control box tried to find out what was

happening.




6.      Attempts were made by standing on the perimeter fencing and

gesticulating to get those at the back of the pens to move back.

These attempts failed.     This was not in the main due to cussedness

on the part of the fans, but to (a) an inability to move and (b) a

failure to realise what was going on down the front.       No senior

officer thought to send police down the tunnel to haul fans out the

back - that was left to the initiative of junior officers.
                                    32



 7.        There was an absence of leadership by the senior police

officers.     Individual efforts were made to try to save lives and to

evacuate the pens, but the picture was one of chaos and lack of

organisation until Chief Superintendent Nesbitt came on the scene at

about 3.15.     No attempt was made to use the tannoy to try to summon

medical assistance until about 3.20.      Similarly, those not directly

involved, particularly the Nottingham Forest fans on the Kop, were

left ignorant of what was happening.      Chief Superintendent

Duckingfield defended his decision to say nothing on public order

grounds.     We can quite see that fans had to be kept in their places to

avoid interference with the emergency services, but we think that some

announcement should have been made.      Most football fans are decent

law abiding people and, if treated as human beings, are likely to

react sensibly.     When an announcement was eventually"made, the fans

all behaved well.




8.         The club had an agreement with the St. John’s Ambulance

Brigade to provide sufficient numbers to comply with the requirements

of the safety certificate.    Their members did all they could when the

tragedy occurred.     SYMAS had very prudently, by stretching the

relevant DHSS guidelines, determined that two of their personnel

should attend the ground with an ambulance.     Two complementary tickets

had been provided for league games, but not for semi-finals.        It did

appear that there could be some criticism of the club for withdrawing

the tickets, but we heard from Mr Mackrell, and we have no reason to

doubt,that it arose from an administrative error.     In any event, the

personnel were at the ground and able to react quickly.     There was,
                                     33



 however, a lack of proper liaison with the police, largely because the

police had no plan specifically to deal with a disaster at

Hillsborough Stadium.      The same comment applies in respect of liaison

with the fire service, who were eventually called to produce bolt

cutters to remove the perimeter fencing.        The first fire officer to

arrive was told he wasn’t wanted.         In addition, there was confusion

between the club and Dr Purcell as to his role.         He thought he was

present to administer to the team or directors and was not the

physician referred to in the safety certificate.




9.      Much publicity was given to the attempt by the police to

summon the fire brigade and the conversation seeking to identify the

precise location of Hillsborough Stadium.        It would be unfair to blame

the fire brigade operator for her endeavours to get the right

information for the computer.     She expected the police to be precise

and there ought to be full briefing so that the police know what is

needed of them.     There was some confusion as to what was needed from

the fire brigade.




10.     Complaints have been made of the lack of proper medical

equipment.   We do not think any football club could reasonably be

expected to carry sufficient equipment to cater for a disaster of the

magnitude of that which occurred.     But there should have been at least

a resuscitator.     The SYMAS ambulance had all necessary equipment and

oxygen was quickly available.     It became clear that a defibrillator

would not have been a sensible piece of equipment to use in the pitch.

 We were not impressed with the complaints made by Dr Ashton and Dr

Phillips in that regard.

 11.        Although there was confusion and disorganisation and a failure

 to act as expeditiously in summoning the necessary assistance as was

 desirable, we doubt that the delays caused deaths which would not in

 any event have occurred.    We do think that, had the perimeter fence

 been opened earlier and positive steps taken to get people out of the

 back of the pens, some lives might have been saved.       But we doubt that

 the delays in seeking medical aid and a sufficiency of ambulances made

any real difference.     As was pointed out in evidence, the first 4

minutes are crucial and immediate mouth to mouth resuscitation is the

only really effective and practical treatment.        This was given by

police officers, St. John’s personnel, fans etc.




12.       Much ill-feeling was generated by the allegation made that

afternoon that fans had "taken down a fence and thereby caused the'.

tragedy.     This version was given by Mr Duckenfield to Mr Kelly at

about 3.15.     Mr Duckenfield has admitted that he deliberately did not

tell the truth.     That account had been given to the fire service and

to SYMAS.     There was scope for misunderstanding, since the call to

SYMAS may well have referred to the forcing of a perimeter gate.          That

possibility of misunderstanding cannot exonerate Mr Duckenfield.




D.     Radio Communication

1.        Radio communications were generally poor.    This was largely

due to the fact that over 100 officers had radios and so, particularly

as the situation became more difficult, there was a tendency for more

than one to talk at once.     In addition, shortly after 2.30 a problem

was apparent and the control box seemed to have lost transmission.
                                   35



 The reserve station was brought into use.     This was so badly sited

 that it was impracticable to use it.     Hence the control box had to use

 a set instead, thus losing the ability to switch to non-talk through

 so as to override all other transmissions.     It did gain the advantage

 on talk through that it was able to compete on equal terms with the

 other officers.




 2.      The situation was wholly unsatisfactory.    Many messages did

not get through.   Officers on the perimeter were not heard trying to

announce that there was crushing and asking for ambulances.

Superintendent Marshall could not get through his request to open the

gates and had to route it via the police station.




3.       Since an inspection by a Home Office expert has disclosed no

faults, the breakdown must have resulted from too much traffic on the

air.   Too many officers had radios for the system to cope.     Clearly,

consideration will have to be given in Stage 2 to means of improving

communications and avoiding the problems which arose.




IV.1    As will be apparent, we have not sought to cover all the

matters dealt with in the evidence.     We have not thought it necessary

to suggest the resolution of disputed evidence as to who said what and

when in relation to numbers still to come into the ground.      No doubt,

those matters are important to the individuals involved.      It is

possible that some people ought to have been aware of things which

should have led them to take action which might have changed events.

We are not satisfied that identification of the shortcomings of
                                   36



 individuals in those sorts of respects will help the Tribunal in its

 task.   No doubt the parties concerned will, if they consider such

 incidents to be important, deal with them in the course of their

submissions.




2.       This was a wholly avoidable disaster, but one which was bound

to occur so long as nothing was done to control the numbers going into

the pens and to provide a sufficiency of turnstiles and

policing to avoid a dangerous build up of fans seeking admission.

Luck prevented it happening before; that luck ran out on 15th April

1989, with the tragic consequences which have led to this Inquiry.     It

is clear that there must be education of all concerned, police,

stewards, spectators, so that overcrowding can be the more easily

recognised.    Ignorance, complacency and lack of foresight, not

deliberate callousness, led to the disaster.    Perhaps the lessons can

now be well and truly learnt and this will be the last of the series

of inquiries into disasters at football grounds which have led to loss

of life and injury.

          SUBJECT:   HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - COMMUNICATIONS



           In making enquiries of the Home Office Directorate of Telecommuni­
           cations regarding the difficulties with communications experienced
           at Hillsborough, I learned that the problem of the controller being
           over-ridden by incoming messages whilst on 'talk thro' mode can be
           overcome by the installation of a UHF base station of the type
           normally used throughout the sub-divisions of this force. When
           this equipment is put on to 'talk thro', the controller, when trans­
           mitting, can automatically over-ride the 'talk thro' mode, and he
           retains control. This system would allow the obvious advantages of
           'talk thro', but provide a safeguard against the controller losing
           control.

           We have not in actual fact determined the cause of the clipping which
           occurred at Hillsborough on the 15 April.  Certainly, noise and a
           heavy demand on the system would appear to be the principle problems,
           but to demonstrate to the Inquiry that we are concerned to ensure
           that all steps are being taken by ourselves to ensure there is never
           a repeat of this tragedy, I would suggest that we advise them,
           through Counsel, that we intend to install the above system at all
           our football grounds.

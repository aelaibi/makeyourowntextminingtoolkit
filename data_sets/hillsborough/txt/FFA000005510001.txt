FA/HILLSBORUGH

                perbert Smith called. He had      fax. He
asked what the meaning was behind a particular paragraph.

I said the meaning was to discuss with ourselves as to
whether there was anything that bothered them on the media
coverage. That was the impression we had received from his
fax and the impression that Glen Kirton had received from
it.

He said that the fax was meant to go between lawyers and not
the clients. Kirton had asked for a copy so I had given him
one. He said he fully understood that and the answer to
that fax was n o ,neither he nor his clients were aware of
any way in which the FA had handled that could be said to be
unfortunate. He apologised if that was the way in which
Kirton took the tone of his letter.

With regard to the report he was sending me a page letter
saying that Taylor made it clear that the FA's involvement
was not causative and that therefore be arguing that there
was no legal liability. In the context that they agreed to
indemnify the FA against claims that the FA became legally
liable to pay CU would be taking a tough line with any
potential claimants. He imagined that the FA would also be
taking a tough line. I agreed that was so. I looked
forward to receiving his responses.

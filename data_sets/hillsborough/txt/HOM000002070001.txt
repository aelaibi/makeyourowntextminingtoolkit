I am       a Police           Constable              in    the     South        Yorkshire             Police       stationed           at

'F'    Divisional                 Headquarters,              The        Common,        Ecclesfield.                 I have

worked       in     this          same       Division        since         joining         th e       police       in    1969.

I have,       during              this       time,        been     involved           in   the        policing          of    numerous

football          matches           of       a ll    categories            at     Sheffield            Wednesday             Football

C l ub .     For        about       the       last        five     seasons,           I have          worked       in the       ground

control           located          between           the    South        and West          Stands          and     have       done     so

for     th e m a j o r i t y            of   g am e s ,    including            all    those          of   a major           nature.

This       Control         Box          overlooks          the     terraced           area       of    the       West    Stand.

At    8.00        a m on          Saturday          15 A p r i l    1989,         I commenced              duty,        with    PS     616

Goddard,           at    the        Ground          Control        at    Sheffield           Wednesday             Football          Club

in    relation           to t h e            Liverpool       FC     -v-     Nottingham                Forest       FC C u p     S e mi

Final.            At    the        time       I carried          out     certain           routine          checks,          including

tests        of    the       public           address       sy s t e m .        Work       was    being          ca rr ie d out        on

one     of    the       speakers              at    the    rear     of     th e    Ground         Control          by an

engineer.               At        his    request          I tested         that       speaker.             All    appeared        in




                                                                    /
order.           The      cameras           in     the      Control            Room were          switched         on.        A    fault

was     found        on    the        camera          to    th e    Leppings            Lane/West           Stand       end

(mounted            near        electronic             score        board).             Th e    engineer         attended           a nd

attempted            to    rectify            this         fa ul t .          Only     a partial          improvement              in

quality          was      obtained            and      he     informed            me    that     this was          the    best          he

could      achieve              on    the     day.         The     work        took     probably          in t h e      region          of

an    h o ur .

During        this        time        I also          spoke        to O p e r a t i o n s       Room and         'Dl'     Control.

I advised            that        we       were    now operational                      and     checked with             them

regarding            any        reported movement                        of    supporters          or     any problems              or

points        of     interest              there       may       be.           There      w a s nc      i n f o r m a t i o n of a n y

consequence.                    During        this         time      I        also     spoke with Mr            Lock,         the

Club's        Security               Advisor.

About        9.30       am o f f i c e r s         started          to        arrive     in t h e       North     Stand           and    at

10.00      am       the    briefing              commenced               in    that     location.

About        this       time         we    were       joined        in C o n t r o l         by P o l i c e    Constable            1370

Bichard.

After        th e    briefing              was     completed              Superintendent                Murray       attended            at

Control.

My     duties        that        day were             to m a i n l y          deal     with     the     telephones            and       the

public        address            system          in    th e      Control          Roo m.        Sergeant         G o d d a r d was           t

operate          th e     radio,           although           these           jobs     would      obviously          overlap

during        th e       day.         There        are      three             t e l e p h o n e s in    the   C o n t r o l Room.

O ne    is       a direct            outside          line;        th e       second      an     internal         SWFC

Station.             The        public        address            system          is an       extention          f r o m t ha t

operated            by    the        DJ    in th e         box b e l o w         Police        Control.          Th e    Police

have      the       facility              to o v e r r i d e       any        transmission.




                                                                         Si
The    ground          for    this       purpose          is     divided          in N o r t h ,     South,         West    and

the    Kop     (East).             Facility          is     provided          to     speak        separately          to

spectators             in e a c h       of    these       sections           or    al l    at    the     same       time.

There     is      also       facility          to    speak        to    the       rear     of    these      Stands         and

turnstile          areas.

About     11.15         am the m a j o r i t y            of     the    serials           were     out    f r o m the

briefing/meal.                 A message             from Mr Lock was                     passed       to t h e      effect

that    although             turnstiles             were       not     due    to    be o p e n e d       until       12    noon,

operators          were       starting          to a r r i v e         and    some        turnstiles           could       be

opened       at    police          request.           About          this     time        were     the    first       reports

of    supporters             arriving         by m in i         bus     and       cars     and     attending          at    local

pubs.        The       majority          of    reports          at     this       stage      related       to       the

Nottingham             supporters.

At    11.20       am    radio       checks          were       commenced            a n d at t h i s     t i m e the

majority          of    serials          were       in     location.              Coaches were            also starting

to    arrive.           There       were       numerous          radio        and       telephone        messages           being

passed       at    this       stage.

In a d d i t i o n      to    the       radio    and       Ground        Control           operating           on    Channel          25

there     was      a Club          radio      giving           direct        contact        to C l u b     officials.                 A

VHF    set m o n i t o r i n g          channel       1 which           was       the     designated           channel          for

traffic        involved            in    this       operation          was m o n i t o r e d        by PC B i c h a r d .

Further        sets      were       available             to m o n i t o r        channel        19,     the    designated

channel        for      CID p e r s onnel            and       also     channel           35 w h i c h w a s        for    'F l '

Control.

As    time     progressed               radio       and     telephone             t r a f f i c i n c r e a s e d an d

although          it    became          very    busy        it    appeared           about normal              for    this       type

of    occasion.              The    vast m a j o r i t y          of    telephone            calls       received          by me

were     from      police          officers.              However,           a number           of m e m b e r s     of    the
public         spoke       to m e    regarding           complaints.

Some      of     these       were:




These      calls           are     related       to    t he    behaviour           of   football         supporters        at

local      pubs.

The     complaints               related       to     supporters            urinating         in t h e    street,

footpaths,             gardens           and    other     locations           in v i e w of        residents         and   the

public,          together           with       other    drunken         behaviour          including          throwing

beer      glasses            and    bottles.

These         messages           were     passed       to p o l i c e       mobiles      in    the     area    for

attention             where        possible.

As      far     as    I recollect              the    main     pubs     i n v o l v e d we r e :

1   .         The     Horse        and    Jockey

 2.           Th e    Middlewood           Tavern

 3.            Th e   Pheasant

 4.            The    F ox

 5.            The    White        Horse

                      majority            of   telephone             calls    f r o m the     public       would     have
    The    vast

           made       to P o l i c e       Headquarters,               Operations         Room,        or m o r e   probably
 been

                      Police        Stations.          Members         of    the    public would           no t     normally
 to     local

 telephone             direct        to    the       Police     Control.

 Spectators                had     been    entering           th e    ground       steadily throughout                this

    period.           As     far    as    I recall        there        had    been      no m a j o r     problems      at a n y

    turnstiles             involving           delays     or     queues.
About      2.10/2.15             pm     I looked             around       the    ground       and     could        see     that

the     Spion      Kop       and      the       South        Stand       were    almost       full.       These           were       the

areas      allocated             to     Nottingham             supporters.

The     North      Stand,          West         Stand        and    Leppings          Lane    areas,          allocated           to

Liverpool         had        still         not     been       filled       and    there was           still        room        in a l l

sections         of     these         areas.

From about             2 . 30    pm     number          of    spectators          were       growing      outside              the

Leppings         Lane        end      of    the     ground.              Telephone        and radio           traffic           was

constant         at     this       time.           Radio       transmission/reception                     was      very         p oo r .

A civilian             member         of    the     Communications                Department,            Andy       Sanderson,

attended         at     Ground          Control.

He     informed         me      that       he     had    been m o n i t o r i n g       the    radio      and       that        there

was     a fault         and       it w a s        necessary          to c h a n g e     the    radio.          A    'b ack up

s e t 1 was       in    position            in     the       Control       Room .       Andy    disconnected                   the

original          set     and      connected             the       spare      set.      I ' m not      sure wh at              he d i d

b ut    throughout              this       procedure           messages          were     still       being        received

for     the      majority          of      t he    t i me,     although          it w a s     not     possible            to

transmit.

The     change         over       took      only        a few minutes,                possibly        three        or     four.         I

recall        that       the      hand      telephone              set    would       not w o r k     when       Sergeant

Goddard          tried       to      useit.         Andy       checked          the    radio,       there        was      still        no

response.              I told          h i m to     switch          on    the    talk     through         facility.               When

this       was    done       radio         communications                 were    restored          by t h e       us e    of a

personal          radio         on     talk       through          as    an    alternative          to    th e     hand        set.

Throughout             this       time       queues          had    continued          to b u i l d      up    in L e p p i n g s

L a n e.      It w a s          then    that       I saw that             the    turnstiles,             the     approaches

and     Leppings           Lane        itself        were      full       of    supporters          as    far      as     I could

 se e   on    th e m o n i t o r .                                                                  ----------------------




                                                                         5
In    it:','    experience              I have         never        seen       so     large     a crowd          gather      so

quickly              so    late        outside         these        or    any       other      turnstiles.

I would              estimate           the      numbers        as       several        thousands.               In a d d i t i o n     to

this       very           few people             appeared           t o me      to     be     entering        the     ground

through              the     turnstiles.                Radio messages                  were     still        constant        and       at

this       stage           there        were      reports           of    crushing            outside       the     turnstiles.

Extra           serials           of    officers          and m o u n t e d           section        were     deployed.            A

message              was     passed         over       t he    public          address         system       fo r    the

information                  of    Liverpool            supporters              at     th e   turnstiles.              I cannot

remember              th e    exact         words       I used           but    I asked         t h e m to       stop pushing;

t ha t     people            were       being      crushed           and       that     there        was    still      room       in the

ground            for      them        to   be    accommodated.

This       I repeated                  several         times.        It a p p a r e n t l y      had       no e f f e c t    as

reports              were     still         being       made        over       th e    radio     of    the       seriousness            of

the      situation                at    the      turnstiles.

Whilst            this       was       taking      place        messages              were     still       being     passed        by

teleohone                 into     the      Control           Room.

In a d d i t i o n ,          a number            of    supporters              were        climbing        directly         in    fr ont

of    th e        Police          Control         from        the    terraces           of     the    Leppings         Lane       end

into           the    uncovered             seating           area       of    t he    South     Stand.            This     was    dealt

with           by o f f i c e r s       nearby         deploying              along     the     front       of     Ground     Control

as     best          as    possible.

During            this       time       requests          were       made       fo r    the     turnstiles/gates                  to be

opened            d ue     to t h e         crushing.

 'C       gate        was     at       this       stage       opened,          although         by w h o m       I do not         kno w .

A number              of     supporters             entered          through           th e    gate    before         a mounted

officer              held     back          the    crowd       and       the     gate was         then       closed.

 A short             time         later       a radio         message          was     received,           I believe         from




                                                                         (p
Superintendent                   Marshall,              directed        to    Control             with words           to the

effect        of     'Open          the      gates        or    someone       will        be      killed'.            I believe

that    a further                similar           message        was    also       passed           by a di f f e r e n t

officer        to       th e     same        effect,           although       I cannot             be    certain        of    this       or

who    th e    officer              was.

Chief     Superintendent                      Duckenfield,              who       was    in c o n t r o l ,         then     gave    the

instruction               that       the      gates        be    opened       and       the m e s s a g e        subsequently

passed        over        th e      ra d i o .

Th e   gates        were         opened           and     a large       number          of     the      crowd       entered.         Th e

problem        at       the      turnstiles               was    then    apparently                e a se d .

I cannot           be     certain            of    th e    exact       time       this       happened           but    I would

estimate           it       at      shortly          b e f o r e the m a t c h      w a s due t o         commence.

I did    not        particularly                   notice         the g a m e s t a r t        but      play     was    under        wav

when    supporters                  started         climbing           the    fences          onto       the     perimeter

track    at        th e    Leppings               Lane     end.

Officers           were        on    the      perimeter           track       and were             apparently           trying       to

prevent        this.

There    were           no m o r e        reports          of    any    problems             or    any    indication

visible        to me           as    to w h y       this        should       be    occurring.                 The     numbers

climbing           over        increased            and        large    numbers          were        spilling          onto   the

playing        area.             Instructions               were       given       for       the m a t c h       to    be   stopped.

This    was        done        by    Superintendent                 Greenwood            going          onto     the    p i tc h and

speaking           to the           referee.

A   number         of       officers              had     b e e n d e p l o y e d i n t o the        Leppings          Lane end

from ot her             parts        of      the    ground.

The    gates         in the           perimeter            track were             opened          and mo re         spectators

were    coming            onto        th e    pitch.            I only       became          aware       of     the    true

seriousness               of     the      situation             when    a radio message                   was       received        to
t he    effect        that       there        were       people          dead.       This      appeared          to me       to be

some     minutes           after        the    game       had       been    stopped.

Instructions               were        given      fo r    operation             support        to    be    called.           All

available            manpower           was    directed             to    the    Leppings           Lane    e n d of     the

ground.         By    this       stage        radio/telephone                   messages        to    Control       were

constant.             Large        numbers          of    supporters             were     on    the       pitch    and       it was

impossible            to    see        if   any     injured          persons         were      amongst       them.

On     instructions              from Chief              Superintendent               Duckenfield,               I passed

messages            over    t he    public          address         system,          asking         that    the    playing

area     be     cleared,           that       supporters            move        on   to   the       perimeter       tr ac k ,      in

order        that     the    injured may                 be    given       assistance.

The     operation           to     remove         the     dead      and     injured         from      the    gr ound went

on     for    some        time     until,         when        the   last        ambulance           had    cleared       the

area ,       th e    crowd       were       informed           over      the     public        address       s y s t e m by

Superintendent               Murray           that       the    game      would       obviously            not    continue.

The     crowd        slowly        left       the    ground.             Throughout            all    this       time    I

remained            in the       Control          Room and          did     so u n t i l       our    job w a s     completed

at     10.30        pm.

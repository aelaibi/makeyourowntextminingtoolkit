Address:



On Saturday 15th April 1989 I travelled by coach to Hillborough in

Sheffield to watbh Liverpool play Nottingham Forest in the semi

final of the F.A. Cup.     I arrived at the football alarm at about

13.50 hrs.     At this time there were no queues and there was no

problem whatsoever in getting into the ground.



I showed my ticket at the turn styles which they retained and returned

to me my stobb.     One I had gone through the turn styles I walked through

the tunnel and walkid into enslosure B and noticed at this time that

it was pretty full.     As 1 am quite small 1 could not see the pitch

very well so I walked down as close as I could to the front where 1 girl

moved to one side to let me in.



About 2.50 p.m. I realised that there were more and more people w8*e

coming in and it was getting a little tighter and then just after kick

off all hell let loose.



I was forced up against the fence and had to take off my gglasses after

they were forced against the bridge of my nose.     I held them in my hand

and tried to protect my fact by raising my arms against the rallngs.

   head i»as banging and my chest was being forced against the fence

by the iAareasing pressure of people and bodies behind me,     I coulnot

breath and lost conciousness completely.



The next thing that I knew was that the top of my body had come away

from the rails and iiwas iniamence pain and still feeling faint.        By

this time ray hearing had started to return and X could hear people

 screaming and crying for help and to be got but.     X then felt something

 or somebody was down at my feet and I tried to pull my legs away but

 could not so i turned around to see what was going on.     All I could see
                                       t- nf these people appeared to be
loads of people lying in heaps ana m, ,

unconcious.              A                                          railing t° avoid

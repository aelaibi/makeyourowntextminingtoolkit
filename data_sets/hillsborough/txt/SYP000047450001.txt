CHIEF CONSTABLE                                                     24 July 1990


L Sharp Esq QPM LLB FBIM
Chief Constable
Hillsborough Inquiry Team
c/o West Midlands Police

Many thanks for your letter of 17 July 1990 which concerns the routeing
of your report to the DPP.

I quite understand that there   are exceptional circumstances which surround
your investigation and that     the bulk ofthe material which accompanies
your report is considerable.       It is also relevant that the matter was
referred to the DPP by Peter     Wright in the first instance, and the need
for expediency should require   no argument.

Of course, I am directly concerned only with the matters which involve
officers of and below the rank of Chief Superintendent, so I cannot speak
for my Police Authority which is concerned with officers of ACPO rank.

I have no objection to your submitting your      report    to the    DPP through
the PCA without sending a copy to me.

I understand that in due course I shall receive a statement from the
PCA in respect of your conduct of the      investigation and that I shall
receive all the reports and supporting evidence in good time for me to
consider any disciplinary aspects of the case.

I trust that this letter is sufficient for your purposes             and that    it
will help to bring the matter to a swift conclusion.

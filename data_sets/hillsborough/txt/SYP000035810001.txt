Dear Sir,

I wri te as a L i v e r p u d l i a n for the first 32 years of my
life;     a pupil of the Colle g i a t e School and a med ic al
g rad ua te of the Un iv ersity.

I arri ve d in N o t t i n g h a m in 1955 and becam e a doctor to
N o t t i n g h a m FoiSst and later se rved as a mem b e r of the
committee.

I was at H i l l s b o r o u g h last S a t u r d a y w h e n trag ed y struck
your supporters.           I, w i t h at least 3 other do ctors from
N ott in gh am , we nt onto the p i t c h to give w h a t me dical aid
we could.

The police wh o were a t t e n d i n g the injured wer e superb;
the Li ve rpool fans w h o strove so har d to save their friends
were truly ma gn if icent.        On that p i t c h ev eryone tried to
help - c o m f o r t i n g the injured or e n d e a v o u r i n g to r e s u s c i t a t e
those su ff ering from c r u s h injury.

I think the b e r e a v e d and their frien ds will like to k n o w
that their loved ones were s u rrounded by sympathy, k i n dness
and fr ie ndship, and a l t h o u g h I am m u c h sa ddened at the
eventual out co me of their ende av ou rs , that day I was
proud to be a Liv er pu dl ia n.

Yours sincerely,
J MERVYN JONES MSc                                                                              FURNIVAL HOUSE

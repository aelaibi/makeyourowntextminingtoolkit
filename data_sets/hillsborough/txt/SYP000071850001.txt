               on the     card,        I then made my way off the turnstile                           no              I got        to my

               t urnstile at about                   "12,00 mjrff'day.

               At     12.15    pm I opened                    my turnstile,       but at that        time       there was

               nobody waiting              to JT a m e       in.   The fans      didn't   start     coming in           until

               about 2,15         pm./As            the      fans came   in I took the tickets              from        them tore

               off the sma^fl section and gave the                           larger    piece       of the       ticket    back       to

               the    supporters.               I then        released   the turnstile         by using         the     foot

               opposite me,          in

               It was at ti^/s time,                   it,    had gone a bit quiet and              I was       talking       to

                              udde n l y     I saw 6 lads one at ar'time jump o v e r                      my    turnstile.            I

               quick     I d i d n ’t have a chance ttfo stop them-                       My mate                             caught

               one but        he got       loose and           ran off    into    the Kop.         I think this group

               were all        together.

s a   -t       At about 2 ,50          pm I saw j/wo lads                come up to my turnstile,                 by this          time

r i o t t t v it had gone quiet                        le one       lad said to me,       "If you      let me and me mate

               in t h e r e ’s £40 qu:               for y o u , "     He held his hand out holding 2 ;< £20

               notes.         1 said       '/ n o   I can't        let you   in not without a ticket"                    He    then

               w a n d e r e d off / n d        I d i d n ’t see him again.

               At 3 ,00       pm I closed my tu rnstile                  down,      I counted up the ticket                    stubbs

               a nd    counted      115,        put this figure          on the ticket and bound them up with

               an elastic         band,         I locked up the tursntile and went                     off       back    to the

               large     room at the back                    of the S o u t h Stand.      Before      I got       to the South

               Stand,     near to the               j u n cti on with S p i o n Kop,      I heard      people         running.             I

               t urned    round and saw about 20 ~ 30                        policemen     running         past    the    back of

               the S outh Stand.                    I then went       to the     room where we had the                briefing

               but there was           nobody there.

             I came back            round     i n b e twe en the S outh S t a n d and the S p i o n Kop and

             stood wi h other            stewards          and turnsti i e operators.

             As    I looked onto the                p i t c h 1 looked straight           over   to the L e p pings Lane

             end and saw            people     being       crus plea, at    the front against            the fences,           and

             saw     people     being        pulled up          into the West Stand           by other      supporters.At

             this     point                               said he w a s n ’t sure what was              happening and

             decided         to go and put my tickets                    back   in the office,          I went with him,

             as he at         this time was              stood with me at South S tand at the S pion Kop

             co r n e r ,

             I was     in the office for about                     10 minutes       came back        out to where            I was

             stood before and then I saw policeman on top of the fences                                           pulling

             people up over            the     top and also ST Johns Amb u l a n c e                 pulling      people       over

             as well.          Still     people were            being     pulled up into the West                stand and

             people were            running        everywhere.           From where I was stood             I    could see

             people sat and            lay on the           pitch.

  cm /       Also     from where         1 was          stood    I saw    2 0 0 ^ odd Liverpool        fans make a run

              0r the Spion Kop as                   the N o t ti ng ha m Forest         fans were       jeering      the

             The Police         then     ran on and A ormed a line across                      the    pitch,     dividing

             the Liverpool            fans from the N o t ti ng ha m Forest                fans,      who were       still

             behind         the fences.            At    this   time also       I saw ambu l a n c e s arriving.

             At this         time    I decided to go onto                 the    pitctv and    look for my son,              who

             was     in the Nott i ngham Forest                  end,     the S p i o n Kop stand.           1 w a l k e d up

     Dear Mr Johnston

     HILLSBOROUGH - Assistant Chief Constable Walter JACKSON

     In response   to your   letter of 4 September    1990  and our telephone
     conversation of 6 September, I write to confirm that although I have to be
     in Stranraer for the night of 13 September, I am prepared to travel to
     Barnsley to meet your Police Authority on 14 September, leaving Stranraer
     directly after breakfast.

     When we spoke on the telephone I explained some of my reservations about
     the timing of any decision by the Police Authority in respect of the
     complaints and disciplinary issues which involve the Assistant Chief
     Constable, Mr Jackson.

     I shall telep' gone your office during the morning of Monday 10 September but
     my secretary,                  will be able to contact me at any other time.

     Yours sincerely




     Chief Constable

      Cumbria     CA10 2AU

       Dear Mr Sharp
       COMPLAINT AGAINST ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE WALTER JACKSON
       Thank you for your letter of 3 September concerning the objections you have
       received from Dr S L Popper to any further progress in the above matter.
       While I do not accept that the Coroner should be able to delay the delivery
       of a completed report which the Police Authority has commissioned from you,
       I am prepared to stay any further action until I hear from you the result of
       your consultations with the Police Complaints Authority. I see no reason
       for the Coroner’s objections to be made public at this stage.
       In the event that you are able to reach a positive conclusion on or soon
       after 10 September, I would hope to be able to report to the Police
       Authority at its meeting on 14 September. I have not yet discussed with the
       Chairman how the matter should be handled and whether he would be asking you
       to be present. In the meantime however I should be grateful if you would
       let me know whether you are available to attend on the morning of the 14
       September if so requested.
       Yours sincerely
                    a      ,

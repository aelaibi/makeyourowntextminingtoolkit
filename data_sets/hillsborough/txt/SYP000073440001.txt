                          and his farther and his family.  My ticket I paid for was                                    for

              L ep pings Ln startling terrace                  price £6.         There were       no traffic      holdups

              as     I remember       ofi route    to H i ll s bo r ou g h but as soon as we              reached the

              a rea about mile and halt               from the ground traffic                   started   to become

              congested.        The      coach was     parked on an            industrial         estate and the

              police     caffie on and spoke          to us.        We    left     the    coach at about       1.45

               (1345)    and wa lk ed down the           road.       The     police       did not walk with us but

were     standing around          in pairs.         We just      f ol lowed the flow of          people.

I had never           been to the ground before              but my f r i e ndsfe^ftaST      The      fans

we re jovial          and    chatting    to one another and M T a rr iv ed at the L a p p i n g s

Ln Rd to the ground at                 about    two o " c l o . t p r i 1400) , people were      standing

a ro u n d    in large      numbers     asking    if a n y b o d y   had tickets spare          for    the

game.         No    crowds were aro-Gpd Urfe outer             gates       or turnstiles w hen we

went     into the ground.              We were    searched       by the      police    before    going

thro ug h the turnstiles               and after.

Only two or three              people were       in the v ic inity of the turnstil es as we

past    through them.            As we were       in the entrance            between the     turnstiles

and tunnel          entrance     I was waiting        here for about           five mins whilst           they

went    to the        toilet.     As    I was standing         in the enclosure          1 saw that          two

large        gates were      open a ll owing      people     to walk       through from where            I was

to the enclosure              to which a dmittance          to the side        pens 5 and 6 and

seating        area above       the    standing     terraces are.           During a pp r oa c hi n g     the

gro un d and going            through the turnstiles             to where      I was    I saw no

stewards.           When my f r iends,/'returned we walked through the                     tunnel        and
                                        /                                  — -----------------
went     into t he area on yfe              left of the dividing             fence which     I now know

to be Pen 4.            We we n** and stood at the 'yf ro nt against                  the fence and

between        the gate amd gangway between Pei\s 4 and 5.

At about 2.30 pjw (1430)                the    pen appeared full and ws were               feeling

slig h t l y scjuasmed together.                It was    not until         the teams    came out        onto

the    pitch that           I felt myself       getting     crushed and being           rolled upright

along        the fence along with other              people from           left to right and then

right        to left.       People all        around started to shout and scream.                     Whilst

this was           qoing on even before          the match started            I saw some St John

ambulance          girls     crying    on the trackside as            they could see young

children being              crushed    in front     of them.         The    crowd was still        shouting

at the        police    but they did not do anything.                      It was   not untxl      the    gams

s tarted that we shouted and screamed to the                           police to stop the matcn.

The    policeman         in front     of me was wearing a fiat           cap and who     I believe

ran onto         the    pitch to stop the game,           he was   speaking    into his       radio.

The    crush started to get more                 intense as    it went     on and    I was    pinned

w ith my        right arm across my chest and               left arm behind my back.               I was

getting         pressed a g a i t h e          fence with my left    side then       I w ould have

my face        fully     injfo the    fence    then the     right side of my face up againsl

the fence.             I could do nothing        to help myself as everyone was               so

tightly         packed together.         We were in this       position for about         15

minutes         when rny friend m a na g ed to get his knees             in the wall and           his

feet were            trapped under     the fence.      People were       pull^lhg at his arms.

I do not know what             h ap pe ne d to him after that        butySh or tl y after          I

m an a g e d / t o    climb onto     the fence and was        pulled/over     the    fence by t h e

po 1 i car and        ripped my trousers.          I then    lay o/n the    pitch    in the    goal

a re a fend several         people a sk ed       if I needed first aid but           I said no.

I was ^eventually met              by my friend and his         dad and we walked over                 to

the N orth S tand by the              centre     line and stayed there.         We stayed there

until      a police       loudspeaker a n no uncement         a sked everyone       to wait where

they were until            the a mb ul an ce s   had cleared.

About 20 minutes            later the     crowd     in the N or th S tand started to

disperse and we followed                them out     into L ep pings Ln and back         to the

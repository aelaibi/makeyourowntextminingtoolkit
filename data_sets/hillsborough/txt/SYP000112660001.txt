very hostile           t o w a r d s us and there w a s              no doubt that this s e c t i o n of

comments we overheard,                   they were          speaking      of    rushing     the gates to

body in a body             bag,      placing a number                 on each bag.         The     bodies were to

be placed in rows               of     12.     I went      to % u n i f o r m officer at the far end

of the gym and that was                      to be body          1.     The    body was      that    of a young

boy.      The P o l i c e O f f i c e r was         crying        u n c o n t r ollably,     I t a l k e d to him

an d tried to help.                  He told me how he had                    carried the young           boy in,

that he had t ried to                  resusc i t a t e    him,        but he had died.             H o w do I even

start to try a n d expl a i n my f e e lings an d thoughts at that time.                                                1

then moved          to a n o t h e r    body and a n o t h e r a n d           carried out         this   duty,

time doctors           present who were               certifying           them dead,       and     in the other

s e c t i o n helping       the wounded.

On   compl e t i n g    this      duty,      whe n all       bodies        had been n u m b e r e d and

At that time we were monitoring Channel 19 of our personal radio, that Channel being
solely for CID use. Reception was good and in fadt we received notification via
DS   805   Buxton that other local public houses were also congested in the same area.
We did in fact make our way to the 'Royal Hotel* where we spoke to and identified oursel
to uniform Officers who were outside. This was done so that they would recognize
ourselves in the event that we required assistance. We spoke to a uniform
Inspector this being Inspector Burgess who told us that the landlord of that pub had
been cautioned by him for selling crates of beer from the boot of his car which was
parked at the rear of the premises. We subsequently saw a number of crates of beer
when a rear yard gate to the premises was opened. There were crates on the pavement.
Following out conversation I actually entered the Public House to assess the
behaviour of the fans inside. The Pub was completely full of Nottingham Forest Fans
and it is safe to say that the majority of them were the worse for drink. One youth
was actually standing on a table in the Pub leading the fans singing. There was not
however any signs of ttoouble, We reported our observations to the uniform Officers
outside and volunterred our services should the Pub need re visiting.


We then continued our foot patrol along Penistone Road towards the ground* By this
time it would be approximately          1   2.50pm. The footpaths leading up to the ground were
heavily congested with fans and from speaking to them a large number were in fact
 ’Ticket Touts* One particular tout was spoken too and boasted of having 20 tickets
 for sale. He said a        £6   terrace ticket would cost me £25. When we identified ours&lves
 to him, he said he was from Liverpool and ’Touted* on a regular basis. He said he
 obtained his tickets from players of the Club and also held a large number of *Kop»
 season tickets which were purchased with the sols intention of getting large
 allocation of tickets for big games. This particular tout stated that in the week
 before the game Liverpool Police had taken his tickets from him to assess tnexr origin
 and validity. He said he had only got them back the previous evening and this had reduc
 reduced there street value. Each ticket he stated would             have fetched around          in

 mid week.


 As stated at that time this man was one of approximately 20 touts present. We were
 ap'oroached on many occasions by fans wanting to buy tickets, and the high volume of
 them even at that time suggested that many were travelling to the game without
 tickets. This was mentioned within the ground when we attended there for our meal
 break at around     1   . 5 0 pm.


 At 2.00pm D.C. Dynes and I returned to our patrol as mentioned above. In the short
 space of time we had been away, the volume of supporters outside the ground had risen
 drastically. I should point out however             -that the number of fans actually entering
 the ground was minimal. The turnstiles at the Kop end showed no signs of congestion
 and the road at that end of the ground was clear. Traffic ®as moving easily for

 a match of the standard that was taking place # At the city end of the entrance
                                                                            f. - A <
to the Spion Kop is a gateway leading to the South Stand entrances. The gateway and alsc
a bridge on the far side of it was completely congested. It was noted that this
blockage was caused by fans asking for and also offering for sale match tickets. There
were no Police Officers in uniform present at that location and despite the fact that
it did not fall under our brief, we took it upon   oursekves to move these persons on.


V/e continued along Penistone Road towards Owlerton Stadium. Throughout that patrol
we saw two uniform officers only who were standing at the junction with Parkside Roa<J
The lack of Officers visibly present were commented upon. Fans present were arriving
in numbers, a large number of which were drinking beer from cans.


At approximately 2.^5pm D.C. Dynes and I had returned to the bridge area immediately
before the Spion Kop entrances. That area was completely blocked and fans were spilling
into the roadway. A group of 20 plus fans came running down the road away from the
site of Hillsbrough Park. It was apparent that these youths had been involved in
some incident and so whilst I watched over D.C. Dynes   he stood amongst them.


The mood of the crowd at that time, who comprised in the main of drunks, was suc$
that either would have been impossible without the assistance of a uniform officer.
That particular piece of road (Penistone Road) is directly prior to the City side
of the football ground. We continued to follow the particular youth and I was
surprised to find that the only Police Officers in view were three or four from the
Nottingham Force. The youth was cautioned in their presence and his details obtained
by one of the Nottingham Officers. Whilst this conversation w$s taking place the
youths friends became very hostile towards us and their was no doubt that this
section of fans were not only the worse for drink but intended to fight with anyone
they could.


Immediately aflter thfs incident a number of South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Buses ax
arrived at the ground. The majority of persons on those buses were also drunk. It
should be noted however that despite their late arrival their entry to the ground was
quick. I believe that the time would be around 2.50pm to 2.55pra. V/e had been joined
at the scene by Inspector Manus Booth and asked him to relay a message to match
control warning them of the potential disorder in Hillsbrough Park after the match. He
stated that the control channel was heavily conjested and suggested that we pass the
message later. It should be noted that we could neither pass or receive messages
on the radio v/hich we were issued (CID Channel 19)•


Around 5»0 0 pm we assumed the match had started by the sounds of cheers coming from
inside the ground. Traffic in Penistone Road on the Spion Kop end was very sparse
and we commented on how easily it had cleared. It was our opinion that it was in fact
less than a normal Saturday home game at Hillsbrough# No persons appeared to have diffi

difficulty in entering the ground. Apart   from a number of persons who will be described
in the next paragraph the majority of Nottingham Fans appeared to have arrived in time t
to enter the ground.


At 3.00pm however a group of approximately 100 youths had congregated outside the
gate immediately prior to the Spion Kop, those gates leading to the rear of the South
Stand. Their was no uniform Officers in view. The mood of the youthd was restless
and it was obvious that they did not hold tickets for the game. From comments we
overheard they were speaking of rushing the gates to gain entry. At this time we
withdrew to the central carriageway of Penistone Road because we were both of the
opinion that we were isolated from other Officers and would neither of been able to
stop the jrouths or defend ourselves if the situation became ugly. Without warning
the youths suddenly began running down behind the South Stand towards the Leppings
Lane end of the ground. V/e believed at that time that a fight was probably taking
place at the Leppings Lane end and still we could neither pass or recieve messages
on the CID Channel.


At around 3.05pm it was apparent that someyhing was taking place indiide the ground
to the annoyance of the Nottingham Fans who were booing strongly. V/e went to a
turnstile nearby where v/e saw P.C. 1.302 Pitt inside. He told us that there had been
a pitch invasion at the Leppings Lane end. D.C. Dynes climbed over the turnstile and

entered a gangway.


D.C. Dynes on returning to me v/e both then returned to the Penistone Road unaware
that a problem had arisen of the nature that was later to unfold. A short time after
this we saw Police vehicles arriving at the ground and it    was obvious that something
serious had occured. We decided to return to the Police Gym to find out if tfe could
assist.   The turnstiles at the Spion Kop were now empty.


On entering the Gym v/e were told that persons had been crushed at the Leppings Lane
terraces. There was talk of many casualties and possibly some dead. In the Gym
at this time was Inspector Towell and other CID officers. DS Lindley came into the
Gym and their was then talk of over eight deaths. It was suggested that all tables
were removed from the area in case it was needed to receive casualties.


The Gym at that time was divided by nets into three sections. The Section nearest
the entrance was occupied by Police, the centre sectin had tables laid out where
programme sellers were counting their takings, and the far section v/as unoccupied.
 The decision was made that the first area be used for the dead, and the second area
 for the injured. Casualties started arriving in the Gym, within minutes it v/as obvious
 dead bodies were arriving continually and injured which needed urgent medical
 treatment. Relatives were alos entering the Gym looking for their relatives who
 were either dead or injured. The mood of some of them was violent but understahdab&ife

 in the circumstances.
I initially went to the middle section where I did everything in my power to help
the injured, amongst them were two very small children who had lost relatives.
There were Police Officers present who had brought some of the injured in and numerous
Fire Officers, but no medical officers. I strongljr remember seeing a person being
helped by the Police and Fire, who had oxygen in use on him, but at the same time I
was shouted over by another Police Officer who also requested the use of ojsygen, I
brought this to the attention of the Fire Officers but was told they only had access
to one oxygen unit and that if they took it off the man he would die, I returned
to the other Officer and told him, I was unable to get any more oxygen, I felt so
sorry for that Officer and I felt        a little useless, where v/ere the Medical teams?


On returning to the first section I could not believe the amount of dead bodies which
had been and v/ere still being brought in both by civilans and Police Officers, There
were fans in the Gym demanding to see or identify bodies, people being resuscitated
and people weeping over the dead. The dead and injured v/ere being brought into the
g ym on stretchers and advertising boards.         There v/as nothing I could do for those
people I was now seeing, they were already dead.


At some time v/e were instructed that one Detective       must go to one Uniform Officer
and assist with property, paperwork and placing the body in a body bag, placing a
number on each bag. The bodies were to be placed in rows of tv/elve. I went to a
Uniform Officer at the far end of the Gym and that v/as to be body       1   . The body was that
of a young boy, the Polie Officer v/as crying uncontrolably, I talked to him and tried
to help, he told me how he had carried the young boy in, that he had tried to
resuscitate him but he had died. How do I even start to try and explain my feelings
and thoughts at that time. I then moved to another body and another and carried out
this duty, continually finding Police Officers totally destroyed and amongst them
some relatives hugging their dead relative. There was at this time Doctors present
who were certifying them dead, and in the other section helping the wounded.


On completing this duty, when all bodies had been numbered and bagged, with other
CID Officers I returned to Hammerton Hoad Pulice Station, this being after gathering
relatives who were looking for missing relatives onto the Force Coach. Relatives
on arrival at Hamrnerton Road were taken into the Boys Club which had been opened for
this purpose,


X then attended at   an office in Haiaaerton Road Police Station where I lias&d with
other Officers and there commenced the duty of speaking to relatives and recording
details of missing persons.


The following two days Sunday   1 6 th   April 1939 and Monday 17th April 1989 I worked
in the Casualty Bureau, mainly with the West Yorkshire Police working on the computers.

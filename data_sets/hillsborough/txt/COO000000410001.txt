FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL AND SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS
T hank yo u for y our letter of 13 July to N i c h o l a s R i d l e y a b o u t the
l i c e n s i n g a u t h o r i t y e s t a b l i s h e d by the Football S p e c t a t o r s Bill.

I w ill of course c o n s u l t you, and the Home Secretary, about
a p p o i n t m e n t s to the auth ority.            C olin M o y n i h a n made these
c o n s u l t a t i o n a r r a n g e m e n t s clear in m o v i n g the amendments c o n c e r n i n g
the c o n s t i t u t i o n of the a u t h o r i t y in Committee.

As to your second p o i n t - if the lic e n s i n g authority, follow ing
c o n s u l t a t i o n w ith the i n terested parties, w e r e to recommend that
there should be an increase in seated a c c o m m o d a t i o n at a W e l s h
club's stadium, it w o u l d of course be for y o u to issue any resultant
direction.             The a m e n d m e n t to the Bill, as is usual, simply refers to
"the S e c r e t a r y of State".

A c opy of this goes to the Prime Minister, other M e m b e r s of H
Committee, D a v i d Waddin g t o n , Sir R o b i n But l e r and First
P a r l i a m e n t a r y Council.

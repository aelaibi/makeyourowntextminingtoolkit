                                                            22 August 1989


       To Chief Fire Officers
       (on the attached list)


       Dear Chief Fire Officer

       SAFETY IN SPORTSGROUNDS

       The Home Secretary is concerned about suggestions in the Press
       that there may be some dragging of feet on compliance with
       recommendations in Lord Justice Taylor's interim report on the
       Hillsborough tragedy.

       I am in consequence writing to ask you if you will please let me
       know briefly, and as quickly as possible whether recommendations
       3 5 to 3 7 have been complied with in respect of football league
       grounds in your area and whether you are satisfied that all
       reasonable action has been taken by the clubs to comply with
       those recommendations which are addressed to them but are of
       particular concern or interest to the fire brigade. If there are
       outstanding matters of concern, it would be helpful to have them
       outlined.

       If you are satisfied that there are no outstanding problems, or
       they can be briefly described, a telephone call in response to
       this letter can be made to either

               Mr A Brown                  01-273 2765
               Miss D Russell              01-273 3406 or
               Miss H Stewart              01-273 2846.

       Any questions arising from this letter should be addressed to me
       or to Mr Brown.

       I am sorry to put you to this additional task.

       A similar request is being made of police forces.
                                                            Yours sincerely

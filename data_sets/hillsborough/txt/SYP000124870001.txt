 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONKLON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D .

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 SOME POLICE OFFICERS SEEMED IN SHOCK AND DID N 5 y A P P E A R TO BE ACTING VERY WELL

 IN RELATION TO THE INCIDENT.               BUT OTHERS WERE DRAGGING PEOPLE OUT OF THE

 STATING THAT THE MIDDLE OF THE TERRACING WAS TOO CROWDED AND FOR PEOP l E H ^

 THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM SO THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN

       *
 RELATION TO DIRECTIONS GIVEN TO GET TO THE GROUND IN A PREVIOUS LIVERPOOL

 FC PROGRAMME AND IN THE PAPER YOU WERE ADVISED TO GET OFF THE M1 AT JUNCTION

 36 AND USE THE A61 TO GET TO THE PARSONS CROSS AREA WHERE YOU COULD PARK YOUR

 CAR.   WHEN WE GOT ONTO THE A61 THE ROAD HAD BEEN BLOCKED BY THE POLICE AND

 WE WERE DIRECTED DOWN THE A616 AND         THE A6102 WHICH BOUGHT US ONTO THE SOUTH

 SIDE OF THE G R O U N D , THIS DIVERSION   PUT ABOUT 20 MINUTES ON OUR JOURNEY.     IT

 WAS ONLY BECAUSE I KNEW WHERE TO GO THAT I GOT BACK TO THE PARSONS CROSS AREA

 ELSE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST AND WOULD HAVE HAD TO PARK ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF

 T|j. GROUND WITH FOREST SUPPORTERS.        IF THESE WERE OFFICIAL DIRECTIONS I     COULD

 NOT SEE WHY THE POLICE HAD BLOCKED         THE ROAD.

TURNSTILE TO GET IN AND THATS WHY THEY HAD                            SHARE THE S E A T S »

2.       I ONLY SAW 2 POLICEMEN ON HORSEBACK IN THE LEPPINGS LN AREA BEFORE WE
WE ENTERED AND THEY         DIDN’ T SEEM TOO CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THEY MOVED THE
PEOPLE WITH THEIR HORSES,           THEY JUST WANTED US TO GET INTO THE STADIUM,                              THERE

WERE 2 FOOT OFFICERS NEAR THE TURNSTILE E N T R A N T AND I THINK THAT WAS

INADEQUATE FOR A SEMI-FINAL,

3. COMPARED TO LAST YEAR THE ORGANISATION WAS INADEQ^TEj,                                        LAST YEAR THERE WERE

MORE POLICEMAN QUERYING US AND THERE WAS A CORDON OF OFFICERS CHECKING TICKETS

jjjpiOR TO ARRIVAL      AT THE TURNSTILES.
LAST YEAR THERE WERE OFFICERS INSIDE THE TURNSTILES SEARCHING AND CHECKING

TICKETS AGAIN THIS         YEAR THERE WAS ONLY ONE FEMALE OFFICER CHECKING BAGS.
WHILST I HAVE CRITICISED OFFICERS IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT MANY IN THE GROUND

DID A      WONDERFUL JOB INCLUDING THE ST J O H N ’S AMBULANCE STAFF, AMBULANCE, FIRE
BRIGADE AND THE FANS WHO HELPED.

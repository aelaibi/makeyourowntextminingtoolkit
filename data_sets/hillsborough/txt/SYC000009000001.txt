    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re

Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified m
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of'the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.          I am at present engaged m considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writiiig    to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses w h o m you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

 May I please ask you in considering whether you w i s h to draw any names to my
 attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

 I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
 names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
 to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

 I woul d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
 heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
 submit.

De81        Sira,
Be: SBSfBi H03IHS0II (deceased) S6.28,
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

 I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
 Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
 he may wish to undertake.

 I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
 or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
 matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
 a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
 on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

Dear
   r^Hob,


                     SWFC WEST TERRACE - IDEAL DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONS




Thank you for letting me have a copy of the above document so swiftly.
As I have been unable to contact any members of the Team who were present
at the Inquiry on 26 June, I have, for the avoidance of doubt, today sent
out to each of the nine parties’ solicitors a copy of the document.

Yours sincerely,




D BRUMMELL
Assistant Treasury Solicitor

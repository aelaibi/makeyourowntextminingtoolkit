Our Ref: Hills/Sol/4/SLP/JT                                      17th September 1990


Dear Sirs,

Re; RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
submit.

Yours faithfully,
     t-v

Dear Inspector Leighton,

I enclose a copy of a letter from William H. Lill & Go.
In particular could you be prepared to deal with query 1.
at the Inquest. I have not sent a copy of this letter
either to Sgt Tredgold or Superintendent Beechey, hut
if you think it appropriate that it should go to them,
please tell me.

Yours sincerely,

                 Dear Sir,

                                                 re. Colin Mark Ashcroft - Hillsborough

                              Thank you for your letter dated 23rd March.

                      Mr. Ashcroft's family have asked that the following matters
                 be raised at the Inquest

                 1       Mr. & Mrs. .Ashcroft believe from a photograph which they were shown
                         that their son Colin was in Pen 3- Colin's body was removed from
                         Pen k. The Report indicates that there is no f u r t h e r clarification
                         of the circumstances on this potential discrepancy.        ere vi eos
                         examined with a view to checking whether there was any suggestion
                         that Colin Ashcroft was passed from Pen 3 to Pen 4.

                  2. It was only on the afternoon of the 16th April that Mrs. Ashcroft
                     was able to identify her son's body. This delay was extreme y
                     distressing. At some future time can the question of the delay
                     in notifying the relatives be looked into?

                                                                                    Yours faithfully,

Dear         Sirs,

         Colin M- Aahnvntt                                   Bo.S.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had. been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation tmdertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I son in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 folly informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M.Coroner.

         Igran,




        Bear Sirs,

        You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
        reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
        in fact put in as evidence.

        However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
        and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
        I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
        I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
        report of your client(s).

        The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

                 a.     They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                        subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                        they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

                 b.     They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                        conselling of the deceased’s relatives or for proper
                        legitimate purposes in connection with' any legal proceedings
                        in which solicitors may be engaged.

                 c.     Subject to tha-iafe21?g, they are to be kept confidential until
                        they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

        I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
        of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
        assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
        each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
        above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
        I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
        reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
        the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

        The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is 55p    per sheet (total £ / - )
        Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

        Yours faithfully,

     Dear Sir

                                                        re. Colin Mark Ashcroft deceased
                                                        _____ HillsboroughDisaster____

           We understand that it is possible that the adjourned hearing of the
      Inquest will not take place until January next year.

           Our clients, who are Colin Ashcroft’s parents, are most anxious to
      know the details of the immediate medical cause of death and we understand
      that you are giving consideration to the question of releasing the Post
      Mortem Reports in respect of the victims of the Disaster. Having regard
      to the long time which will elapse until the resumption of the Inquest,
      the release of the Post Mortem Examination results would be most welcome
      to our clients. At the present time they have no details as to what
      happened to their son and there is, of course, a continued agony in not
      knowing precisely what fate befell him.

           You will doubtless be receiving representations from Solicitors on
      behalf of the relatives of the other deceased along similar lines and we
      would urge you to accede to the request to release Reports.


                                                                   Yours fait

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

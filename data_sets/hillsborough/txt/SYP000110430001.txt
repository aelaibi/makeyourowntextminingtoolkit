CHIEF CONSTABLE                                           10 September 1991

Mrs D Jones



Liverpool



                     VvA^

I'm sorry that I was away on leave when you wrote first to me.

May I say, too, how very sorry I am that Richard lost his life at
Hillsborough.  As a father of teenage children, I just can't imagine how
you, your husband, and the other bereaved families cope with such a
dreadful loss.

The Tribunal is in the process of being arranged.  My understanding has
always been that complainants have right of presence, and the right to
give evidence.  I have no doubt that you will be kept informed on that
front.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield remains suspended but is ill.       There
is no question of a 'guise' of ill-health, or ill-health as an 'excuse'.
He is ill.  My best assessment would be - though I am no doctor, of course
- that since 15 April 1989 he has been containing the inner pressures
of his human reactions to the events of Hillsborough in the best way he
was able.  I suspect that this is what you saw at the inquest. The Taylor
Enquiry, the investigation by the West Midlands Police, the Inquest, all
followed one another.    News that    he was to appear before yet another
investigative body was succeeded by a rapid decline in his health.

It's difficult to say, now, how events will progress.    If he gets better,
he will appear before the Tribunal as arranged.   If he doesn't get better,
the natural consequence would be     for him to retire  on ill-health.   An
officer - like any other citizen - must be physically and mentally well
enough to stand trial.    Although   the law is quite  complex, a tribunal
could probably not go ahead without the accused officer's consent to have
it heard in his absence.

We are still a long way from such a decision.      We want the question of
the Tribunal resolved as soon as possible, just as you do.

I am anxious not to sweep matters under any carpet; that is not my style.
I do want to make sure that justice is done all round - to Richard's
memory, to you and your family,     and to  the officers, including David
Duckenfield.  Sometimes my hands, your hands, and the hands of the Police
Complaints Authority are tied by the law of the land.    If we don't stick
to that, we're all lost.
I can understand your frustration and anger, along with your sadness,
but please believe me when I say that we are dealing as best we can with
the events that face us; there is no awful conspiracy to thwart you in
achieving what you see as justice.

Dear Madam

Thank you for your letter of 16 August 1991 in which you express concern
with regard to the pending tribunal to be held involving Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield of this force.

I do understand your concern, however. Hr Duckenfield does have the right
to appear before the tribunal in person and at the present time as you
are aware he is indisposed due to ill health.

I am sorry I am unable to be more helpful at this time but hope that this
information will explain the present position.

Yours faithfully




Chief Superintendent
(Discipline & Complaints)

                                                 3rd February 1992
Dear Sir,

       With reference to your rejection of any criminal charges
in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster, we would like to draw
your attention to the following points.

We are now in receipt of letters from the Police Complaints
Authority and Richard Wells Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
Police,which outline the reasons for the rejection.

The basic reason for the rejection of criminal charges is similar
to the reason given by yourself,namely the lack of evidence of
criminal liability.

While we do not agree with your assessment,it is hardly
surprising that you arrived at that decision,in view of the fact
that the enquiries were carried out without any evidence of a
criminal nature being allowed to be put before the inquests.

We as one of the 95 bereaved families would have liked to have
called a lot of lay people who were there on the day,who would
have given damming evidence,but realized that because of the
inquest system the coroner would have rejected their testomony.

With this in mind,we attempted to call 6 senior professional
people,who were there on the day,all were rejected so no
witnesses were called on our behalf.

The South Yorkshire Police,and the coroner had knowledge and
access to all witnesses statements,which they could select the
ones that suited their case best,and would have advance knowledge
of the contents of those statements. The families had no access
to any statements prior to the inquests.

The Police also had control of all video evidence some of which
disappeared without adequate explanation.

The audio tapes which would have provided valuable information of
telephone and radio communication from the Police Control box
were never released for the inquests.

These are just some examples,which show the way inwhich  the
official version of events were diluted to allow you asHome
Secretary to arrive at the decision you made.

As a family,we find it deplorable that the 3 pillars of Law and
Order who should be insuring that the law is applied fairly to
all members of the public,allowing the law to be misused,to cover
up their own basic weaknesses.

In memory of our son Richard,we shall not be put off by all the
abnormalities stated above,but shall go on until the true facts
of the Hillsborough Disaster are allowed to emerge.


                       Yours Respectfully

CHIEF CONSTABLE



 Mrs D Jones


 Liverpool




 Thank you for your brief note of 14 January and for troubling to enclose the handwritten copy of
 your letter to Brigadier Pownall.

 I can fully appreciate your sense of frustration and anger at the latest turn of events and you should
 not focus too much on the Police Complaints Authority. They are very much bound by the law and
 by circumstances and I don’t think that they had much room for manoeuvre in this final decision.

 Although it is difficult for you to accept, questions of evidence impose much more stringent tests on
 those involved in testing the law than do our private observations and beliefs.

 The Director of Public Prosecutions (who frequently disagrees with us and so is not to be seen as
 somehow an ally of the police service) found that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute any
 officer for criminal charges.

 The longest inquest ever held determined, through a jury decision, that the deaths - however tragic
 for you, your family and the other families - were accidental. This didn’t mean that no mistakes were
 made, but that they were not seen as culpable mistakes. The South Yorkshire Police Service has
 stood up and acknowledged its contribution to those mistakes in its admission of civil liability and
 in its willingness to pay damages.

 On the basis of legal advice (a barrister appointed by our Police Authority, who, you’ll remember,
 at first refused to pay our officers’ legal costs - so, again, not to be seen as other than fiercely
 independent), we recommended to the Police Complaints Authority that no disciplinary proceedings
 should be taken. The barrister concerned is also quite independent and it would be more than his
 professional standing was worth to give other than perfectly frank advice. If he had believed that
 discipline should have followed, then he would have had absolutely no qualms in telling us so.

 When we so recommended to the Police Complaints Authority, they felt so strongly in disagreement
 that they directed us to proceed with a disciplinary tribunal and we immediately set about that
 process.

 The next major turning point was when Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield fell ill. I know your
 view is that he was just malingering but you cannot merely set aside the professional view of a very
 independent minded medical practitioner who was emphatic in his opinion about how very unwell
 Mr Duckenfield was. I must say, once again, that if the doctor had thought otherwise, wild horses
 wouldn’t have dragged him from saying so.
It was my decision to require the Chief Superintendent’s medical retirement; he had been declared
to be unfit to discharge the dirties of a police officer and it was the only course available to me. He
wasn't in a fit state to have the charges served on him or to prepare his own defence.

After Mr Duckenfield’s medical discharge, we pressed ahead with the preparation for the tribunal
but the barrister advising on the progress of the prosecution became increasingly concerned about
the legal implications of Superintendent Bernard Murray standing in front of the tribunal alone, and
about the aspects of natural justice which that would have entailed. You, of course, will feel your
own acute sense of injustice but that is not to be rectified by another injustice.

I know only too well that you will not accept this argument from me but the words of Dr Habgood
at the Memorial Service really are compelling:

        "Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don’t usually happen just for one single
        reason, nor is it usually possible to pin the blame on one single scapecoat ...
        Disasters happen because a whole series of mistakes, misjudgments, and
        mischances happen to come together in a deadly combination".

Once again, do let me say how very very sorry I am at the dreadful loss that you and your family
have suffered. Little of this will help you in your distress but I felt that your latest letter deserves a
considered reply.

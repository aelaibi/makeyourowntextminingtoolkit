           My name is Phi lip Michael RhDGARD,               I am 33 yrs of age being born on

                                          I am a Police Constable            in the South Yorkshire

           Police at present stationed at Stainforth.

           On Saturday 15th April          1969 <150489)         I was stationed at Stainforth

           Police Station,       however,    on that day I was on duties connected with

           the F.A. Cup Semi Final           football match of Liverpool            versus Notts

           Forest at the Hillsborough football ground in Sheffield,                      I commenced

           duty at 0800 hours at Stainforth Police Station and went to Doncaster

           D .H «Q for 0845.      From there I was t rans ported with gjrhe r officers by

           Force Coach to the Hillsborough ground for a briefing,                     we arrived at

           Hillsborough about          10arn <1000).     After the briefing all officers

           Joined their respective serials and made the i r way to their allotted

           points.     I cannot       remember my serial number,            only that our pre match

               duties were at Tankersley,      near the 111 checkirpg coaches and mini buses

               for supporters without tickets and for ccwrches carrying alcohol,                 We

               commenced this part of our duties at 1/fam (1100).          During the next few

               hours we stopped coaches and mini buses in a lay by and cheeked

               supporters tickets and the luggage holder and other areas of the

               coaches for alcohol.      The Sergeant   in charge of the Serial       kept a log

               of the registered numbars of vehicles stopped and the names of coach

               f i rms whose coachair were stopped and checked.        We resumed f rprfT this

               duty at 1445 hours and made our way to Claywhee 1s Lane Traffic Depot

               where we        to have our meal.     We arrived at Cl^y^tfTiee 1s Lane at

               15 Q 0 h o y ^ s and went to get our m e a l . We had just sat down to get our

               mehsrr some five minutes later when a message      came over the radio for

               all officers to go immediately to the Leppings Lane end of the ground

               due to serious public di sorder.      We immediately,made our way to

               Leppings Lane and on a r r i v a l , about 1510    rs , we were deployed in

               front of the Leppings Lane entrance t^r the ground,         keeping supporters

               who were still waiting to get i t h e         ground,   o u t . .Af ter some 10

               minutes we were    re-deployed inside the turnsti^ys near the tunnel

               whi ch 1eads to J^ne Leppings Lane tsrracinf;       Once the re I assisted

               with first aijg as^people were carried out of the ground.             Some of the

^ C ^ T u ^ p e o p I e were de<yf and they were put to one side and covered until they
                              I/                                                            .     .   .
               Cjou 1 d be movea to another area.     There were a lot of supporters       inside
       ■   *   r
               this area before the tunnel who were sat crying and dazed,             it was only

               then I realised the enormity of the situation.           Some fans were

               shouting and swearing at other officers who were trying to clear the

               way for the dead and injured to be brought out.           Some fans were trying

               to get back into the terracing to look for relatives.

               The whole scene was one of confusion.         For the next few hours      I was

               engaged with assisting with first aid and then trying to keep the area

               clear for ambulances and other emergency servi ce s .         About   1800 hours
                                                                                   PAGE     3

         our Serial was re-grouped and we relieved a mobile patrol            looking for

         other trouble outside the ground.          There w a s n ’t much trouble outside

         the ground at this time,        just hoards of fans getting off coaches and

         mini    buses going into off licence premises,       buying cans of beer.

         We were finally stood down about         1845 hours and returned to Claywheels

         Lane.     From Cla y wh ee 1s Lane   I returned to Doncaster Police Station in

         a police transit and finally booked off duty at Stainforth at 8pm

         (2000).                                       P M Redgard

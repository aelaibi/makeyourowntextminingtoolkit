    I attach a draft reply for Lord Ferrers'               signature to the letter
    of 21 April from Mr Chris Smith MP.

     2.    The Home Secretary considered at his meeting on 24 April, in
     the light of my note of 19 April to Mr Mawer, whether clubs and
     local authorities should be advised now to remove pitch perimeter
     fences.      It was decided not to go down that path. /^ (A t t h Qfe "

    3.   I think it would be advisable not to go into the merits and
    disadvantages of pitch perimeter fences in the reply to Mr Smith.
    It would be consistent with Ministerial thinking eo fair to adhere
    for the time being to t h ^ status quo and await any recommendation
    which Lord Justice Taylor makes on these fences.

    4.    The attached s^ggirafacl reply has been grafted on this basis.

DRAFT REPLY TO MR CHRIS SMITH MP


Thank you for your letter of 21 April to the Home Secretary about
perimeter fences at football grounds.


You do of course raise an important issue.    As the Home
Secretary said on 17 April in response to comments made on his

statement that day, it is one for Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry

to look into.    We shall of course consider very carefully any
recommendation which he may make on this, but we do not think

that it would be right in advance of that to amend the advice in
the Home Office/Scottish Office "Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds", which gives guidance on a variety of safety issues

which have to be taken into consideration, including Dritisk y\\JL^
perimeter fences.



A pitch segregation fence is sometimes required by the terms and
conditions of safety certificates issued by the local authority
which must be complied with.    In some cases such a fence has

been erected, not because of a specific requirement in the safety
certificate, but as ameasure.   Such measures are

necessary to help combat hoologanism and violence, outbreaks of
which can lead to the death and injury of spectators.



As you say, a number of clubs are removing their pitch perimeter
fence.   It is of course open to them to consider this, but it

would be wise for them to do so in consultation with authorities
locally; where the fence is a requirement of the safety
/




    certificate the club would of course need to seek the local
    authority's agreement to a change in the safety certificate.



    But, as I have said, this is a matter which Lord Justice Taylor's
    Inquiry will be looking into, and we shall consider carefully
    what he has to say.




                                   2

Dear Mr* Waddington,

     I think it normal courtesy that I first introduce myself.
I am a freelance .journalists working with the national radio
station —
     ^I am interested in obtaining two reports which have been
commissioned by your ministry; hence my reason for writing to
you.

     The first is the report on Remand Centres by Judge Stephen
Tuemin which was released sometime in July last year and the
other one is Lord Justice Taylor’s Final Report on the recent
Hillsborough Football Stadium Disaster.

     Incidentally, it was through the BBC World Service program
HEWS-ABOUT-BRITAIN that I learned about the two reports and
tried to get copies of them from the local British Government
Representative Office but was unsuccessful.
     I hope you are in a position to assist me and look forward
to hearing from you. Thank you.
                                  Sincerely.    ________

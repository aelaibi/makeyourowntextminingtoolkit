Thank you for your letter of 2 December. I am writing briefly to acknowledge it and to say
that we have, since we wrote to you last, asked Dr Wardrope for information about some
other patients who were taken to the Northern General Hospital as a result of the football
disaster.

 Dear Mr Boj

Hillsborough Scrutiny

Thank you very much for your letter of 24 November very helpfully setting out the background to
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny of evidence. Whilst personal representatives of the deceased
do not have an automatic right to access patient records, nonetheless we are sure our clients will
be comforted by your letter and we have requested them to release the records in accordance with
your letter.

If in the meantime either the hospital or Mr Wardrope can be of any further assistance to the
Scrutiny, please do not hesitate to contact them. I am sure Mr Wardrope would be more than
happy to confirm exactly what evidence was presented on behalf of the hospital to Lord Justice
Taylor’s Inquiry. Certainly as far as I am aware, none of the documents to be disclosed to the
family are "new evidence".

 Many thanks for your assistance.

 Yours sincerely                             .*

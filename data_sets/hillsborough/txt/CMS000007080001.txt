have plans in place but equally many clubs, particularly in the

considering the reasons for this patchy progress.

football grounds are now safer than ever before.

    PROGRESS ON A LL SEATING


    Background


    1.         The     latest       information          we     have          from    the    FLA,     which   is
    responsible             for         enforcing       the     all        seating          requirement,      on
    percentages             of seating at             individual clubs               is at Flag Dl.      Their
    general          view    is that          reasonable       progress           is being made by most
    Division          1     clubs        although       they        are    concerned         about     lack   of
    progress by 3 clubs.                     In Division 2 about 25% are well on the way
    to    meeting         the      1994       deadline    and       a     further      50%   would    probably
    just about meet the deadline.                         The remaining 25% are causing the
    FLA some          concern.          In Divisions          3 and 4 progress has been patchy
    and it appears that some clubs are simply hoping that the problem
    will       'go a w a y 1. The             FLA   issued     a questionnaire               to all    Football
    League clubs in March seeking detailed information on their plans
    for implementing Taylor. The deadline for responses is 8 May.


     2.         A     summary           of    responses        to       the      latest      Football    League
     questionnaire              on Taylor           implementation             (Flag D2)         indicates that
     the percentage                of    seating at grounds                has    increased although not
     at    a    very        fast    rate.       The    number        of       seats    as    a   percentage    of
     ground capacity was as follows


               January 1990 : 34.08%
               January 1991 : 37.80%
               September 1991                : 40.69%.


     Seating by division at September 1991 was as follows:-


                Division 1                   55.31%
                Division 2                   37.50%
                Division 3                   28.96%

    QUESTIONNAIRE ON TAYLOR IMPLEMENTATION - JANUARY 1992
                                ANALYSIS OF CLUB RETURNS



    INTRODUCTION

    The questionnaire was issued on 21 October 1992 for return by 12 November 1991. All 92
    clubs have submitted a return.

    The purpose of the questionnaire is to enable The Football League to monitor clubs' progress
    on Taylor Implementation and to provide such information to Government, the Football Trust,
    and the Football Licensing Authority, all of whom agreed the content of the questionnaire.

    A copy of the questionnaire is shown at Appendix 'A '.

    This analysis should be read in conjunction with the individual club returns submitted.



    BRIEF SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

    The percentage of seating within grounds rose during 1991 from 3 7 .8 % in January to 4 0 .6 9 %
    in September.

    28 clubs installed additional seating in their grounds during the 1991 closed season, 10 clubs
    in the First Division, 9 in the Second Division, 5 clubs in the Third Division and 4 in the Fourth
    Division.

    The First Division is now over 55% seated.

    £ 2 3 .5m was spent by clubs in the calendar year 1991 on ground safety and general
    improvement works.

    £ 9 .8m has so far been contributed towards this expenditure by the Football Trust, but a
    number of claims were still outstanding at the time of submitting the questionnaire.

    38 clubs have managed to reduce policing levels by the deployment of extra stewards.

    74 clubs have introduced a structured training programme for stewards.

    51 clubs have appointed a designated safety officer.

    28 clubs' local police authorities are phasing in the higher levels of police charges, timescales
    vary between 1 and 6 years. A number of clubs were still discussing this matter with their
    local police authority when the questionnaire was circulated.

    16 clubs are planning*to relocate and a number of clubs are awaiting the results of feasibility
    studies.

    35 of the First and Second Division clubs estimate their forward plans to cost £ 2 5 1 .8m, of
    which they expect to receive some £63.1 m in Football Trust grant aid.

    26 of the Third and Four Division clubs estimate their forward plans to cost £76m , of which
    they expect to receive some £ 2 3 .9m in Football Trust grant aid

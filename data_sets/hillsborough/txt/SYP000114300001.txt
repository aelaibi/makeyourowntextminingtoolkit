PHILLIP G O S S , POLICE CONSTABLE 106, STATIONED AT A3, MEXBOROUGH



At 8.00 am, Saturday 15 April 1989, I paraded on duty at Mexborough Police
Station and was subsequently transported to Hillsborough Football Ground to parade^
re FC Cup semi-final, Liverpool v Nottingham Forest, where I was to perform duties'*
on Claywheels Lane under the supervision of Sergeant Lindop on Serial 36, under
the command of Inspector Townsend.

I commenced patrol of Claywheels Lane, in company with PC 130 Parkin.  It was our
duty to speak to all coach loads of Liverpool fans arriving on Claywheels Lane and
advise them, whilst all on the coach about drinks to and from designated football
matches, banners and advising people not to go near the ground if they were not in
possession of any tickets.  We performed these duties up to 2.15 pm, the same
date, whereupon we moved to the junction of Claywheels Lane and Penistone Road
North, where I and members of other serials commenced to stop the Liverpool
supporters who were in possession of any alcohol.

At 2.45 pm, I, and other officers, were approached by a man with a Liverpool
accent who stated that his friends were being beaten up inside The Gate public
house on Penistone Road North.   Upon arrival at the premises all doors were found
to be bolted from the inside and all the windows were, in fact, boarded.    All the
officers commenced to bang on doors and windows to try and attract persons
attention, with no gain and entrance was eventually gained by the front door.
Upon going into the premises I saw stools scattered around the floor and tables
had been knocked over and a number of pool cues had been smashed in half.    There
were a lot of people milling about in the pub and shouting.   I then called over
 the manager of the premises and asked him what had gone off, to which he replied,
 "JUST A LITTLE PUSHING AND SHOVING."  I then told him to stop serving drinks in
 the bar and to get all patrons off of the premises, which he eventually started to
 do and informed all the persons in the public house to drink up and leave.   I then
 left the premises and liaised with Sergeant Sherratt and Inspector Townsend
 outside the premises, telling them what I had seen and what I had told the
 manager.  I then re-entered the premises, in company with Sergeant Sherratt, and
 remained there whilst all patrons had left the premises in a somewhat drunk, but
 orderly, fashion.  Sergeant Sherratt and myself then rejoined the serial at
 the junction of Claywheels Lane and Penistone Road North.

 There was a large amount of talk on the radio, but it was not clear what, in fact,
 was taking place.   We were approached by an unknown Inspector who said there was
 some trouble in the ground and all officers were being called to/ ^ e n d at the
 ground.   We all then made our way towards the ground.    Myself and PC 779 Wheatley
 entered the ground via the north stand.     Upon arrival we made our way down the
 side of the north stand towards the pitch area.     Upon arrival at the playing area
 Sergeant Lumley was coming towards us with a bill board, a person on the blll
 board and a number of other persons assisting him to carry the bill board.        ere
 was also a group of approximately six youths carrying another bill board with
 another person on the bill board.     I then assisted the gang of youths to the rear
 of an ambulance which was parked in between the north stand and Spion Kop.     It was
 apparent that the two youths on the bill board were dead.     We, therefore, laid
  them on the floor on the bill board and commenced to cover them up.    Whilst doing
  this a number of youths came down from the back of the Spion Kop, began o spi
  on and generally abuse us.  We then commenced to hang blankets on the railings
  around the two bodies and it was decided that due to the general behaviour of the
  fans in the surrounding area, i e ., spitting and abuse, to move the two bodies into
  the gymnasium.  I and other officers carried the bodies into the gymnasium to the

                                                                                Cont'd
bottom of the gym** where they were laid out and chairs placed around them.   I then
wrote my number of the rear of the youths' hand and went back outside in an        *
attempt to assist other officers.   On arrival outside the gym' I saw approximately
three to four apparent dead bodies laid on a pile of sand.   They had obviously
been brought in and left by other persons.   Whilst dealing with the bodies and
getting other police officers to assist in moving them the fans in the north stand
(Liverpool side) were stood up above us and began to urinate on us and began to be-'
abusive once again and officers were deployed to move the fans.   I then assisted
in moving the bodies back into the gymnasium.   I then began to lay the bodies out
in the gymnasium and cover them with white sheets of paper.   Having completed this
I then began assisting in giving first aid to other injured persons.

At approximately 6.30 pm, I began dealing with the sudden death of Ian Whelan and
all the appropriate forms.  I remained in the gymnasium until 4.45 am, Sunday 16
April 1989, when it was decided that all unidentified bodies would be transported
to Medico Legal Centre via ambulance.  The body was taken to Medico Legal Centre
and was dealt with by a Detective Constable upon arrival at the centre and I-
retired from duty at 6.00 am.

Whilst performing duties on Claywheels Lane we spoke to a number of Liverpool fans
who had arrived early, that is between 11.30 am and 12.30 pm, who stated that they
had come early so that they could catch a bus from Claywheels Lane to the
outskirts of the city to enable them to have something to drink.  I saw a number
of these coming down Penistone Road North, some three hours later somewhat worse
the wear for drink.  Also whilst performing duties at the junction of Claywheels
Lane and Penistone Road North, approximately fifty percent of the people coming
down the road had some form of alcoholic drink and were made to stop at that point
to either abandon their drink or drink their drink.  Quite a number of people
decided to sit down and drink it, stating they were in no rush as they hadn't got
a ticket.  The majority of all the fans on the way to the ground were of good
nature, although a large percentage had obviously been drinking.  The vast
majority of fans appeared to be making a somewhat late start passing us at
2.40 p m .

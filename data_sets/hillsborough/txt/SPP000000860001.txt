Dear Miss Kennah
                                                                      •/
I r e f e r to your l e t t e r s of 19th December 1990 (2 ), 3rd January 1991 and
11th January 1991.

1.                          ._____ I note t h a t you   are withdrawing your request t h a t
       t h i s young man should be c a lle d . I was    already aware t h a t th e re would
       be problems in c a llin g him and I do not       th in k in th e l i g h t of th e a v a i l ­
       able evidence t h a t th e re i s any need to    tro u b le him.

2.    Norman Langley.       This man has already given evidence. >

3.    The Liverpool Steward in Gate C, we believe t h i s to be a Mr Lloyd.
       I do not propose to c a ll him.

4.    Coach Companies, perhaps Amberline. I f you have anybody s p e c if ic
      in mind, please nan® them so t h a t I can consider them.

5.    Mr Thomas Lloyd.       This gentleman's name has been mentioned by others as
      w ell. Although I am not c e r ta in t h a t the evidence he can give i s lik e l y
      to be m a te ria lly d i f f e r e n t to what we have or w ill be hearing, i f i t
      i s po ssible to make th e necessary arrangement, I w ill i n v it e him to
      atten d .

6.     P . C . | I do not intend to c a ll t h i s o f f i c e r but I am hoping
       to be in a p o sitio n to c a ll Mr Robertson (Mr Owen's frie n d ) who w ill
       be able to give h is account to the Jury.

With regard to the cases mentioned 1n your l e t t e r of 3rd January 1991, you
might be aware t h a t your c l i e n t s have had a g rea t deal more information regarding
p o st-in ju ry movement of t h e i r loved ones than 1s normal 1n an in q u est. I
have also already Indicated 1n open court the ex ten t to which th e hearings
are going to go and I do not think th e re 1s any need f o r me to say any more
on t h a t .

S t r i c t l y speaking, 1t seems to me t h a t a ll th e po in ts which are ra is e d are
not l ik e l y to have any relevance in helping the Jury to reach a decisio n .



                                                                                      /continued.
I am, however, asking f o r each of the Individual cases to be reviewed and
1t may be possiblev1n some o f th e cases to perhaps I n v i te some of th e named
witnesses to " a tte n d c o u rt with a view to answering some r e s t r i c t e d questions
to seek t o . a l l a y sane o f th e concerns of the f a m ilie s . I must make 1 t c le a r
th a t 1f I were to decide to e x erc ise my d is c re tio n to c a l l th ese w itn esse s,
t h a t the-% 1dence which I would seek to obtain from them would be lim ited
t o , f o M n s t a n c e , a sc e rta in in g whether or not they knew what time a p a r t i c u l a r
event occurred.
Yours sin c e re ly

         Dear Sir

         RE : HILLBOROUGH - DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

         You are aware that we act on behalf of Bernard Murray. We understand that you have
         given an indication to the Clerk to the Justices at Leeds that you do not expect to have
         completed your in depth review of the available information and evidence in this case
         until the end of September. We had expected some form of written confirmation of this.
         We had telephoned today to speak to Mr Croston but understand him not to be in the
         office until 20 August and Mr Enzor is away until 1 September. I f the position is
         different to that which is set out above, perhaps you would be good enough to telephone
         this office early on the morning of 20 August so that we may have the information to
         take with us to the Court.




                                                                       by The Law Society in the cvruhia o f Mvacmenc bnsiiufs,

                   the betting office at the roundabout.

                   From this position we monitp^ed the crowd who were mostly U^verpool

                   support ery ^ n d all of thaifc were in good spirits.                    On sev/ral occasions

                   we were Jisked to recommend and give directions to local                               public houses,

full or closed and suggested they give drinking a miss.                   I was also

aware of a large number of youths from 1330 hours onwards, who were

"touting*       for tickets to the games?        these we moved on and advised them

to go away from the football g i ^ u n d . * A lot of the JLiverpool

supporters were carrying cjg>»7s of beer,             these were stopped and advised,

to return the drink to their vehicles,                dispose of it, or if it was a

small amount of drink to drink it, as we were not allowing them to go

nearer the football ground carrying or drinking alcohol.                   I did not

get any abuse,         in fact the crowd were very good humoured and went

along with my request.              The majority of these youths sat on the wall

at Laws Caraae and shj^flji the drink amongst othe r s upp or te rs .

Approximately lAjlji^nours a couple of hundred supporters              passed my

location,       I ai^esumed they were from the specijjg train that stopped at

Wads 1 ey Jjjffrid g e .   From this t ime onwards th^r numbers of supporters grew

to thousands who were             passing my locatiTon walking along the

carriageway at Halifax Rd causing traffic problems at the roundabout.

At this time I remarked to Police Constabl e^fAYBQULD that we may have

a rough time of it and there could w e l ^ c e            fighting at the end of the

match.

Police Constable RAYBOULD and mysel£/continued to stop supporters with

alcohol or football banners w i j j i sticks and advised them,            but as

1500 hours approached Lepp^ngs Ln became full of sup porters.                  I would

estimate a thousand entered Leppings Ln from Halifax Ftd just prior to
                             ./
the game sta rt in g. /

At   1500 hours a serial who had been w ork i na/€x\ Herries Rd near to the

bus depot moved towards the Leppings Lp^entranee a nd from the radio

messages      I ove rhear d , I believed             were having problems,   then an

Inspector came past our locati&fi and told us to go to Leppings Ln end
                                       /
to help.        When I reached ttfe        turnstiles at Leppings Ln I saw a large

number of supporters wJHo were shouting abuse at the Police Officers

      there and others who were crying and obviously distraught;            at first I

      thought the supporters were fighting,        but when I got to the blue gates

      (C), that open onto the lane at the back of the stand,          I saw several

      bodies in the lane opposite these ga t e s , covered jyj>Pol i ce anoraks and

      tunics, and saw several more bodies        inside^Wfe gates;   I then he 1 ped

      other Officers move these bodies frojjy^xnside the gates to the lane

      outside;   then helped people who jrfere   in.jured from the holding area at

      the rear of Leppings Ln st^ndT into the lane for treatment by a man who
                                   M \<s\
      stated he was a Doctor fjyfim Li ve r p o o l , Whilst doing this, a youth

      came up to me and ask^S for my help; along with Police Constable 139
       M 7 n \            /
      LANGLEY I followed/The youth to the snack bar built into Leppings Lane

      stand and helper a young female with chest        in juries.   As we carried
fit
      her across the holding area to the lane for treatment, we shouted at

      supporters to clear the way,      but were met with abuse and had to

      force our way through the supporters, who by now had grown in number

      to approximately a thousand and were hampering Police efforts at

      this part ojr the football     ground.

Dear    Mr Major,

I   w r i t e to y ou        as a        b e r e a v e d b r o t h e r who - lost m y b r o t h e r at
t he H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l D is as te r.            I wr ite a s k i n g as to what
is to be don e’ now.

T h e i nq u e s t s     into the        95 d ea th s      finished on     the 28*'"’ Mar c h
1 99 1     with a        highly dubious          d e c i s i o n made  by the        jury.       It
seemed from            m y p o i n t of v i e w    that the        whole p r o c e e d i n g s were
n ot      h o n e s t and    t r u th f ul, .but were' more bi as ed             towards        the
P o l i c e a n d in p a r t i c u l a r to the p o l i ti ca l side of things.

T he Cor oner '»hi-mself          s h o w e d no c o m p a s s i o n towards the         gr ie vi ng
families,           ma"ny"' W ho    had made       the       jo ur ne y   to ‘-the       inquests
e v e t y d a y . . Hg- s e em ed     mo r e ^interested           in the ‘‘W e l f a r e of    the
j u r y and of- the P o l i c e ba r ri st er s. His interest s e e m e d to lie
in      m a k i n g sure     the r i ght      verdict         jf     '-Accidental death' was
b r o u g h t in.

N o w t ha t       this v e r d i c t has            occurred, the be rea ve d fa mi li es are
s u p p o s e d t o Ifet this              m a tte r lie.        In the two years            since the
Disaster,            n'o •.improvements s e e m              to have       been made       as towaics
ground         s a f e t y , a n d ' the w a y         'football      Su pp or te rs ar e      treated.
T hi s c an be           s ho w n by the inc ide nt               in L e i c es te r on- 2 3 ^ ^    Ma r ch
1991,         when a         c r u s h i n g inci den t        developed,         and s e v e r a l   fans
sustained            injury.              The      P o li ce   of    course aided       by      pu sh i ng
e s c a p i n g fans back into the crowd.

 Thus, f r o m           the a b o ve      e x am pl e the proper a u t h o r i t i e s    have not
 learnt          f r o m past e x p e r ience!          This I think, is due to the fact
 that       they know           a c o v e r - u p can      take place,      and the n e c e s s a r y
 fund s        r e q u i r e d to    f i n an ce     t he ir defe nce     can come       f ro m  the
 p ub l i c s '      purse.       As     i ndeed it        was in   our case.           The Police
 having their                own b a r r i s t e r s   to def e nd  t h e m paid      for by     the
 pu bl ic, the             i njured p a r t i e s h av ing       to fund     th e ms elv es .   Were
 is the j u s t i c e in this?

 N o w th a t the      case is over, I ask                  what do you         intend      to do       to
 e n s u re it d o e s n ' t h a p p e n agai n?

 The p r e v i o u s    Pr ime M i n i s t e r p r o m i s e d us     there w o ul d   not be a
 c o v e r - u p , but ther e was!!           And n ow all those            re sp on sib le , the
 Po li c e, C o u n c i l   and F o o t b a l l i n g au t h o r i t i e s can do what       they
 like.         For it seems, in this country, MO NEY TALKS.

 I would      t h e r e f o r e ask       you, no,   implore you to           look at        this
 ca se   a g ai n,      and mak e         the  public     aw are       of   the d an ge rs     of
 attending ANY            p u b l i c v enue.     Also,     to r e v i e w   the s y s t e m   we
 have in this c o u n t r y           as r eg ard s pr os e c u t i o n and inquests.         For
 I do    n ot b e l i e v e that          a Coroners'     court is         not the     corre ct
 pl ac e to     r e v i e w e v i d e n c e of this    kind.          Especial ly , when the
said   C o r o n e r has       the     right, to omit       evidence    a nd w i t n e s s e s
which    a re       i mp o rt an t to    the * case,     a nd  t h at  th e w e i g h t    of
evidence       available          w as   e n o u g h to warrant     action      from      the
D.P..P. (was the d e c i s i o n m a de t h e i r for p o l i t i c a l r e a s o n s ) .

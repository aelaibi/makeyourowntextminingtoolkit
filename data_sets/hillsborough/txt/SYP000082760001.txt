special         train             arriving             shortly           after       2    pm    (1400),            that          our    deployment

there      so       early          was       perhaps           not       the    best       use       of      the       serial.              However

and     perhaps              as    was       in     fact       intended          the       serial            was       able       to    pay

attention               to    fans       on H a l i f a x           RD,

I   can    recall             the       public,         house        adjacent             to    the         station,             (towards             the

town      centre             on    the       same       side        of    the    road)          w «}4       shuttered             up    with

boarding            across             the       windows.            I do       not       recall            seeing          anyone,          apart

from      possibly                the    licensees,                 formally             amtering            or    leaving             the       pub       at

the     rear.            This          was       not    the     case       at    £ he      public            house          on    the       opposite

^side     of    the          Halifax             Road     from       the                 ion    entrance.                   A t t h e s id e              of

that      pub       a    road          was       used     for       parking          of    hire         vans,          some       being          used          by

Police         serials.                 I do        not       knoM.yif         any       were       fans’         ’b u s e s ’ .        That          pub

was     also        boarded             up       but    the     /icensee             was       admitting               fans.           At    some          time

around         midday             he    asked          our    A e r i a l , I do n o t k n o w w h o t h o u g h ,                           if       a

couple         of       bobbies          could          s/and        with       him       at    the         rear       of    his       pub       to       help

him     ’s e l e c t ’ w h o            he       w a s /goi n g      to    admit.              The      pub       at    this       time          seemed

quite      full          of       footbal1 /supporters, noisy                                  but      quite          controllable                   by       the

licensee            and       his       stafy.            I stayed             with       him       for      about          10 m i n u t e s

but     given           that       there          was     another          serial          at       that      side          of    the       road,

immediately                  outside             the    pub,        our    serial          and       another            by       Wadsley          Bridge

Station         I did             not    see        the       point       in a c t i n g        as      a    bouncer             for    him       and

returned            to       my    serial.              I was        not       aware       until            leaving          that       area

immediately                  before          3    pm    (1500)           that    he       had       any      problems             with       drunken

customers               and       also       cannot           say    if    the       licensee               ever       requested             Police

assistance               other          than        that       described             above.

From      the       time          of    getting           to    Wadsley          Bridge             Station            which       was       well

before         midday,             there          was     a    steady          stream          of    Liverpool               fans       heading

towards         the          ground.              However,           a    small          number         then       came          back       in    the

opposite            direction                heading           away       from       the       ground.             I    cannot          give

to    the    more       noisy       fans.           ESefore               2    pm       (1400)          any       such       conduct,                      given

the    occasion,             was    quite          acceptable                      and       only       the       odd       few       were             advised

quite       gently       to    save       their          singing                   voices          for       the       match          etc.                 I    c an

recall       during          the    time       spent          at          Wadsley                Bridge       some          fans          shouting

towards        others         about       ’s p a r e         tickets',                      in    particular                one       tall             thin

youth.         He      went    up    and       down          Halifax                   RD    trying          to    find          a    ticket                2    or     3

times.

Above       Wadsley          Bridge       Station             is          a    small             industrial             estate                of       shops,

Kilner       Way.        The       first       stop          on       it       is       a    supermarket.                    Towards                   the

Sheffield             side    of    that       road          and          outside                the    supermarket                   itself                   are

grassed       areas.           As    time          moved          on          toward             the    start          of    the          match,                and

certainly             from    1 pm       (1300)          onwards                   these          areas       were          quite             literally

covered       with       young       men       sat       drinking                      from       cans       and       plastic                bott1es.

The    favourite             quantity          seemed             to          be       *4*       packs       of    cans,             although                   *6 *

packs       and       *12*    packs       were          not       uncommon.                       Nor       were       the       2 and             3       litre

bottles.              Again    before          2    pm       (1400)                they          were       not    causing                a    public

order       problem.

Their       concern          for    the       litter          laws             did          leave       a    lot       to    be       desired                   as     on

emptying          a    can    it    was       simply          dropped                   on       the    floor.              On       at       least             one

occasion          both       myself       and       other             officers                   believed          a    can          had       been             thrown

at    us,    but       what    was       happening                as          time          moved       on    was       so       many          cans             were

rolling       about          and    onto       the       road             vehicles                were       kicking             them          up          when

falling          over,          they       can    get       in.        Only        the          blatently             obvious          drunks          are

going       to       be    arrested             at/or       in    the       ground.

So,    as       an    opinion,             fans       have       readily           exploited                the       weakness          and

provided             they       travel          early       enough         there            is    every          opportunity              for      them

to    drink          considerable                amounts,           if     they            so    wish,          before       going        into         the

ground,          leaving             the    turnstile             officers                 the    subjective                opinion          as    to

whether          they          are    drunk       or    not       and      the         practical                difficulties             of

arrests          in       that       situation.

deal       with       events          after       2    pfli ( 1 4 0 0 ).

monitoring                by    Police.           Shortly          after           2       pm    (1400),             the    single       special

broad       range          of    ages       and       their       conduct              would          not       have       gone    out       of    place

escort          them       to    the       ground.           They        were          held       back          by    M o u n t e d the       first

Before        this       I can          recall                  a     number                    of    men       obviously             desperate                for        a

surprised           if    that          was            due          to      drinking                   a    thermos          flask.              There          was           no

obvious        place,          out           of        sight               of       a       police          officer          at       least,          to       go     to

                                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                                             S27Q2

anticipated             meeting          up    with       the       rest       of     our         aerial,       whom          we       felt       would

leave       the    outside          of    the    ground             for    meal          shortly          after          kick-off.

Before       any       of    us    could       meal       we    received              the         message       to       attend             the

ground       and       did    so    immediately.                    The    3    of       us       jumped       in    the       back          of

another       serial's             van    and    went          to    the       Leppings             LN    turnstile-                    I did          not

know    at    that          point    what       was       happening             inside             the    ground          and          my    obvious

first       thoughts          was    crowd       trouble.

On    arrival          at    the    ground       it       was       frankly           impossible               to    find          out       what

was    happening.                 Initially          I formed             part        of      a    cordon       outside                the       gates

on    the    corner          of    Leppings          LN    it self         with          other          officers          there.                 The

intention          was       to    allow       exit       but       not    entry.                 That    only       lasted             a    few

minutes       as       ambulances             began       arriving             a nd      then       the       fire       service.

Myself       and       PC    BRICKLEY          took       it    upon       ourselves                to    direct          ambulances                   in

towards       the       road       running       around             the    rear          of       the    ground.              By       this       time

I had       gathered          that       there       were       a    number           of      injuries          from          within             the

West    Stand          and    I believed             at    that       time          casualties                were       corning            from       out

of    the    back       of    the    stand.

I did       not    know       the    scale       of       what       was       happening                inside       the       ground.                 As

the    fire       service          arrived       we       tried       to       'park'             them    so    as       to    leave             the

entrance          clear.

As    fans    were          leaving       I    can    remember             a    number             being       abusive             towards             me

and    other       officers.              However          this       conduct                was    that       born       out          of    fear

and    not    through             loutish       behaviour.                 It       was       impossible             to       answer             the

many    comments,             including          "You've             killed           my      mates       in    there.”                 "This          is

all    the    bloody          P o l i c e ’s    fault"          nor       was       it       the    time       to    do       so.           It    was

really       only       when       I saw       the    group          of    8-10          bodies          laid       on    the          ground,

behind       makeshift             screens,          that       I knew          the          scale       of    the       disaster

(although          the       first       time    I knew             the    final             numbers          was    some          3    hours

later       via    a    local       radio       broadcast).

One    incident             outside       the    ground             was    that          a    group       of    Liverpool                   fans

                                                                                                                                          S270Z

             approached             me,    and     indicating            a    man       wearing       a    yellow       press    .jacket        told

             me    "If    you       d o n ’t    get    him    away       from       us    w e ’ ll    fucking          kill    him."       (Had

             he    been    taking          photographs             of    the       1Q    bodies?)»              I escorted       him      off

             down    Vere       RD     a n d told       him    that          whatever        his      actions          had    been   my    advice

             was    that       it    had       obviously       incenced             some     fans         and    he    should    consider

             his    own    safety.              I left       him    at       the    other      end        of    Vere    RD.     I did      notice

             people       on    that       road       opening       their          doors     to      Liverpool          fans.

At    1130          hours,             one          of    our       turnstiles                  opened and               in    view       of t h i s        1'

this       I deployed                      8    officers             in       pairs       to     cover             these       doors        and       the

At    1200          hours          the          remaining                turnstiles              were          opened          in     this       area       and           a

steady             trickle             of       Liverpool                fans       started              to    enter          the     ground.           This

c o n t i n u e d vu n t i 1               1340          hours       with       small           but        steady         numbers           filing           in.

The       fans          were       sufficiently                      few       in    number              that       we    were       able        to    search

the       majority                if       not       all.      of    them       before           entry.                 Many    of        the    fans,           even

from       as       early          as          1130       hours,          were       entering                 the       ground       with        breath

smelling                of    alcohol.                    They       were        not       however sufficiently                            affected                  by

the       drug          to    be       denied             entry          or     arrested                 (or t h e r e        were    not       the    usual

symptons                of    drunkenness                      to    have       enabled              a     successful               prosecution).

In    any          case       to       have          arrested             all       persons              affected             would        have       depleted

the       Police             presence                in     the      area       to       ni l    extremely                quickly.               I saw

dozens             of    fans          sitting              and      hanging             about           in    the       Leppings           Lane       area

and       in       particular                   on       the    bridge          over          the        river,          who    were        consuming

intoxicants                   out          of       cans.           These       people           were          in       the    main       male        and        in

who    were          without          tickets           for       the    match.              They          were       milling             around

outside          the       turnstiles              and       in    the       road       generally                causing             a    nuisance

and    an     obstruction.                    I    personally                told       many          to        leave          the       area       and    on

several          occasions             the        mounted          officers             were          used       to       sweep          them       out    of

the    area.           They       kept        on    returning                and       the       ideal          would          have       been       to

arrest        them         for    obstruction                 however             this       again          would             have       been

people,          a    male       and     a    female,             who    were          trying          to       enter          the       ground          with

several          cans       of    lager           secreted          in       the       females             large          handbag.              Both

smelled          of    intoxicants                 and       both       admitted             having             been          drinking          lager

myself        left         the    Leppings              Lane       end       with       the       prisoners                   in    order       to       take

them     to      the       Police        Room       for       booking             in.        The       detention                   procedures

were     completed               by    1400        hours          and    the       arrest             papers          then          had    to       be

completed.                 PC    3066        was    unable          to       complete             hers          as    she          was    required

to    act     as      warder          f or    the       female          and       in    view          of    this          I went          to    the

gymnasium             and       there        completed             the       paperwork.                    In    view          of    this       I did

not    return          to       the    outside           of       the    Leppings                Lane       end       of       the       ground.

people          were          being          crushed,                 injured              and       that       the       crowds        were        out        of

control,             the       Police           overwhelmed.                           I heard             reference             to     opening              a, g a t e

voice          say    'open             the     gate,             open        the          gate'.              This       would       have        been        about

About          1500       hours           someone                came        in       to    the          gym    and       rounded          up     all

complete             serials              which             were        there,             some          eating       meals.            They        left          and

I was          left       in       the       gym        with          just        a    few       officers,                some    doing           paperwork

radio          message             to     the       effect              that          all    officers                available             were         to

attend          on    the          perimeter                 track           of       the    pitch             at    the    Leppings              Lane         end

of    the       ground.                 No    reason              was        given.              I       immediately             left        the        gym           and

walked          briskly             onto        the          pitch           area          from          the    corner          between           t he       Kop

and       the    North             Stand.               I saw           that          play       had       stopped          and       the       teams          were

just       in    the          process           of          leaving           the          field.              I walked          across           the        pitch

and       as    I did          so       I looked                 at     the       large          clock          on    the       South        Stand.                   It

showed          about          7    minutes                 past       3.         I saw          a       large       number       of       Police            on        t he

climbing             or       attempting                    to    climb           the       fence          from       the       terraces            onto              the

spent        several           minutes             pulling             people             out       of       this          gate          along         with

another           sergeant           and       a       constable.                    I then          forced                my       way      into          the

alley        with        the    constable                   and    we       both          assisted                people             to       climb         over

by     allowing           people          to       use       us    as       a    ladder.                 After             5    minutes               or    so    the

 crowd       in     this       pen       thinned             out       sufficiently                      for          me       to    see         in at       ground

 level .

 I saw       that        there       was       a       female          form          laying          on       the          floor            beneath          t he

 or    3    people        knelt          over          her     giving            heart          massage                and          mouth         to       mouth

 resuscitation.                  L       climbed             up    and          over       the       spiked                top       fence            from       the

alley        into        the    pen       and          at    the       same          time       I used                the       radio            to    request

an     ambulance           for       her.              Once       in    the          pen       I had          no       sooner               checked          that

 the       woman     was       being       properly                treated                than       I saw             what          appeared               to    be     a

fight        further           along       the          front          fence          by       gate          4t            ah«m      itt   "tint fofrg" f l a m .

This        gate     opens       onto          the          pitch       close             to    the          rear          of       the      goal.           I went

across         and       saw    that       people             were          fighting                to       get       out          of      the       gate.

There        was     a    heap       of    bodies              laying            on       the       ground             under               the    wall       where

this        gate     is    situated,                   about       3    or       4    .        Other          people                were         clambering

on     top     of    these       bodies                which       appeared                lifeless                   in a n         effort            to    get

out.         People        had       fallen             and       the       result             was       a    log          jam       effect            through

which        no     person       could             escape.              I       informed             control                   by    radio            about       t he

apparent            dead       and       requested                more          ambulances.                       I then             tried            to    p ul l

in     a    blind        panic.           I tried             to       explain             that          the          danger             was      over       as       t he

             were     treading              on     but    they       wouldn't             listen.              Many    of    these        people

             smelled            strongly           of    intoxicants             and       in rny o p i n i o n         many        were       drunk.

             There       was         an    all     pervading             smell       of    stale         alcohol        in     the     air.

             I   then          saw    that        officers          outside          the     pen         on    the pitch,           together          with

             fans      in       the       pen    were     pulling          and       kicking             at    the m e s h f e n c e       at     the

             this      route          the       bodies       were        removed          along          with     2 or 3 w h o         were       carried

             from     the        rear.            I.then       saw       other       officers             enter       the     pen     from      the        rear

             who    were         in       the     process       of       clearing          people          out       into    the      rear      tunnel.

             Once     uU' 11 UTT w a s            cleared       I    left       it    and       climbed          into       pfflSrfrffiS' w h e r e

             bodies            both       live     and    dead       were       being       removed             in    large      numbers.              I

             asisted            in    this        process       until       this          pen    was          clear    and     then       moved        to    gate

             rear.             I then       spent        quite       a    long       time       on       the    pitch       near      the      goal

             assisting               with       heart     massage          and       sorting             out    the    living         from      the

             dead.             This       process        was    being       constantly                   interferred           with       by

             Liverpool               fans       who     were    drunk       and       being          a    nuisance          although           the

             majority            of       fans     in    the    area       at    that       time          were       well     behaved          and     of

^            tremendous               help.           During        this    period          I did          see       several        young       male

             fans      picking             up     money,       wallets          and       other          items       which      had     obviously

             fallen            from       the     pockets       of       casualties.                 Some       of    this     may     have      been

             with     good           intent        but    some       was    no       doubt       theft          as    the     ' o f f e n d e r s ’ made

             off    quickly               when     I made       to       challenge          them.

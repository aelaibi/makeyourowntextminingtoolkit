              Dear Lord Justice

              RE:     HIT.TSBOROTJGH FO O TBAT1, DISASTER 1989

              I have looked into the matter of Kevin Williams who died in the 1989 Hillsborough
              football disaster. In answer to your specific question in paragraph seven of your letter
              dated 27 November 1997,1 can state quite categorically that no St. John Ambulance
              personnel were trained to perform an emergency tracheotomy and they would not have
              had the equipment to do so.

               St. John Ambulance has never trained personnel in this procedure and it is not
               mentioned in the First Aid Manuals.

               This emergency procedure has occasionally been used in the field, usually by trained
               doctors, and once with success, I believe, by an army medic serving in Northern
               Ireland.

               I am afraid this response may not be very helpful to your further enquiries, it may be
               that you get more help from Peter Wells of St. John in Sheffield, but may I
               nevertheless wish you success in your scrutiny.

               Yours sincerely




               Chief Commander

               Dictated and signed by agreement
               in his absence.

               On Saturday,           -15th A p r i l       1989,       (150489)           I reported           on   d u t y at

               Doncaster        Police         S t a t i o n at     0830       hrs.        Th e    serial       I was       attached           to

               was    No.     23 and      my    immediate           supervisor             was     Sgt.    Lomas.

               After     briefing         at    the    Hillsborough              Football           Ground       I was         deployed,            in

               c o m p a n y w i t h PC     1698 Martin,             on        point      d u t y at th e       junction           of

               Middlewood Road and                   Hinto     Road.

               Neither        myself      or PC       Martin        had        radios      at a n y t i m e      d u r i n g the    day.

               Any     communication            we    r e c e i v e d was       given       to     us v e r b a l l y .

               Throughout        the      morning        of    the     game,         supporters           of    both      teams         were    of
cm             good    behaviour          and     Rumour.           However,          as    the     day    progressed              supporters

               were    passing        by,      towards        the    direction             of     the    ground,          carrying        cans

               of    la ger    and    bitter,         drinking         from      these          cans,     as    they made           their       way

               along    Middlewood             Road.

               Consequently,            th e    alcohol        started          to    alter        the    way    in w h i c h       the    fans

               were    behaving.            They      were     more       loud       in t h e i r       attions      but       their

               behaviour,        at     this      stage,       was     still         acceptable.

               As 2    pm     (-1400)     approached,             myself        and    PC 'Martin w e r e            asked         by Sgt.

               Lomas    to a s s i s t      further         along      Middlewood               Road with        its      junction         with

               Leppings       Lane.         This      was     due    to    large          crowds        gathering         at    this

               junction        (mainly Liverpool                  fa n s ) .

                                                                         ;                                                                 R302

At    t h is    junction          I observed             numerous            empty         cans        of    lager          and       bitter

and    groups         of    people          outside        a nearby           public           house         that       was       open.

Some     supporters              were       now    clearly         the       worse        for      drink          and       the       good

behaviour            and    humour          witnessed           earlier           had      no w    changed             to    fans

chanting         loudly,          their       team and           heroes.

As    2.30      pm    (1430)          approached,              I received              a verbal             message          from          Sgt.

Lomas     to a s s i s t         further          down     Leppings           Lane        towards            the       entrance             to

the    West      Stand.           As    myself          and     PC M a r t i n         made       our       way    down Leppings

Lane,-I         was    informed             by PC       714 Bell         t ha t        the S u p e r i n t e n d e n t ,              in

c h a r g e at       that    end       of    the    ground,         had       requested                that       no    traffic,

except         buses,       be    allowed          to    travel         down Leppings                   Lane       towards             the

stadium         because          that       area    was        getting        heavily             congested,                with

supporters.                                                                       j

i then         returned          to    the    junction           of L e p p i n g s           Lane      with       Middlewood                Road

and    started         to    direct          traffic,          except         buses,           away         from Leppings                   Lana,

I s t o o d at        this       point        until        3    pm (1500).

During         this    half-hour              I o b s e r v e d from my point                      in       the m i d d l e       of       the

road,     a     large       c r o w d at      the       bottom      of L e p p i n g s            Lane       (junction                with       the

s..tadium)       which       was       steadily          growing         from          2.30       pm    (1430)          onwards.                 At

about     Â£.40/2.43/2.50                    (1440-1450)            I remember                 having         a    little

difficulty            with       the    traffic,          du e     to    l a r ge        crowds         descending                towards

me    from      the    road       opposite          Leppings            Lane,          the     road w h i c h           contained

the    open      public          house.           I also       saw a         small        fight         half-way             down

Leppings         Lane,       which          officers           immediately               on    the      scene          broke          up.

There     were        also       groups       of    people        walking              around,          in t h i s          vicinity,

presumably            touting          for    tickets.             One       fa n             I saw,               was        beingcarried                 by

two    others         because          he     was       u n a b l e to   w a l k on his            own.            (He w a s           drunk).

My    feelings         are       that       most    fans       wanted         a       la'st d r i n k        before          going          to

the    game.

After     standing           down       from       traffic         duty       (point           duty )        at    about          3    pm    (1500)        .

I received instructions from Sergeant Lomas that we were to attend at the

ground (outside) to assist at this point.

The    large   number   of   people        I   had   seen   earlier,   at    this    point,   had now

diminished and only a small percentage in comparison remained outside the

ground.

I saw people with tickets, who were being refused admission to the ground,

by other officers, 'because the ground was full'.

After a few minutes,         one young man came out of the ground shouting,                      "What

are you lot standing         there    for,      when there are people dead and dying                   in

there."

At this point in time, I followed Police Constable Shaw (Serial 23) running

towards the tunnel entrance to the Leppings Lane terrace.                           As I ran through

the tunnel area I saw people (one or two I think) lying                        on the ground, I do

not know if they were dead or alive.                   At the other         end of the tunnel I saw

one supporter, white in the face - just coming round (someone was kneeling

down next to the person) saying "Have we won".

I then made my way to the front of the tarracing where                           I saw a pile          of

bodies stacked up by the perimeter fencing.                    My instant feeling was one of

shock and disbelief,         but those         feelings     and fears were put on hold as I

realised the job at hand.

I first of all ushered spectators away from the bodies and then helped pull

the fencing away        (Section 3).           I then assisted other officers in passing

bodies through this gap in the fencing.

I helped pass numerous bodies from the terracing to the playing arena, one

person I was going to pick up was only young, young enough to pick up in

both   arms,    I can't remember whether               it was male     or    female,    but   another

officer said, "I'll get this one (her/him) you help them."                           This person was

passed through the gap in the fencing:                  "You help them" referred to a very
                                                                                      PAGE 4

                                                                                      R302

large/heavy man which two or three officers were attempting to pick up.                      I

helped in the removal of this man through Gate No. 3-                  I then assisted in

removing other bodies through this gate.             Officers at the other side of the

fencing formed a chain to receive these bodies.

I vaguely remember two of the bodies as being late teens/early twenties and

one early teens, all male.         All had white faces and purple lips with their

bowel area wet and stained.

Once I was on the pitch I carried one body,              along with three fans, on an

advertising     board   across   the   pitch   towards   the   gym,   but   halfway   across

another   fan   took    over   and said,   "you go    back and help".        By   this   time

everyone who could be was being attended to.             This person was wearing blue

jeans and probably a teenager (16?).

I then joined the police line in the centre of the pitch.

I noticed while standing there a few scuffles in the stands at either side.

After most of the crowd had dispersed I worked at the Leppings                    Lane end

where I saw a screen surrounding more bodies outside.                 Ambulances arrived

to remove these bodies.

It was here that I witnessed the verbal abuse from the remaining fans that

were leaving but no officers that I saw replied to these comments.

                            Further to my questionnaire on the Hillsborough Disaster, which was

                            completed some time ago,                   I wish to add further details regarding the

                            deceased person I removed from pen four.

                            Whilst    I was      in pen four            I was very crushed but when the people at the

                            front started to move out                    into the pitch it became much easier and I

                            could breath properly again.

          y id              At trnt time I saw an elderly man on my right as you look                               at the
TpCf      1                    7
                            piych. This man was lying on the terrace on                         his b a c k , he appeared to

                r       y   * dead.    I would describe                  this man as about 60 yrs,         stocky build,      grey

                               r ,   thin on top.              I remember he had a anorak type coat on, he also

            /       i                re(* jumper, V necked,               I cannot remember anything else about
                Jj-
                            him. When I first saw the man he was lying directly behind the goal

                            about ten foot from the perimeter fence in pen four
                                                                      ^   - PAGE    Z
                                                                            S3793

         Together with other people,    I helped to lift this man and carried him

         to the perimeter fence from where he was took fro® us by other people

         on»the pitch. That was the last I saw of this m a n.

         After this I walked back up the terrace looking for my mates.    I did

          not go onto the pitch.   I do not remember any other injured or deceased:

          people.

Poli ceman               by    the    gate                4s       well.          He could         have       had       his       hand       on      the

gate       naving             opened          it,     and      possibly                have       checked          the       tickets            of     the

ten       or    so       supporters              who      went          through.              It       w a s n ’t a         rush a nd        th e

Policeman                had    control                over         what was going                 on.           I saw       a l l of      this        while

waiting             to    pass       through             the       cordon          by    the       Police          horses.

I was          kept       on    the       outside             by    the       Police          horses             for    some       time         while          the

crush          inside          at    the       turnstiles                   was    cleared,             eventually                I was         one       of

the       first          through          and       had       no    real          difficulty                going       through            one       of    th e

mi d d I e      tur n s t i le s .

Once       inside             I stood          round          for       a    little          while,          as    did       a    number          of      other

people,             waiting          for       their          friends             to    come       through             the       turnstiles.

I met          up    with                                                                                                         Ia n d

There          was       no    great          rush       to    get          onto       the    terraces,                so    I would            guess

that       we       still       had       a    few       minutes             to    spare          before          kick       off.

As    I had          gone       through             the       turnstile                the    gateman             had       removed          the       stub

and       gave       me       the    rest        of      the       ticket          back.           I don't             recall          seeing          any

stewards             outside          the        ground™                Trie re        were       Policemen             outside            the

turnstiles                as    I went           in a n d          on       the    inside          the       ground          as    1    came         out       of

the       turnstiles.                 I       c a n ’t    recall             whether          there          were       any       stewards             inside

as    I    came          through          the       turnstiles.

I    could          see       the    tunnel           leading               through          to    the       terraces             behind          the      goal

and       could          see    the       other          end       of       the    ground          over          the    heads.             There          were

people          going          through           into         the       tunnel          and       after          a/while          our      group

             Round       about         this       time          I helped                  a    couple       of       lads    with        cut     heads          to      t he

             tunnel          where         Police          were          coming               through,           1    can    remember            helping             some

             others          to    lift         another            bloke             over       the    fence          into    Pen        Two,,       I    can't            say

             what       state        he     was       in.         There              was       so    much    going          on.      I was        not         injured.

             I eventually                  left       the       ground               at       about    1640          hours,       a f tej&Hffei ng            on     t he

             At    no    time        did        I witness               anything                whi,«rft c o u l d      be    regarded            as      a

             My    views          with, r e g a r d         to        the        way          the    incident          was    handled            after          the

             match       was       stopped            are       that            had       the       Police       realised          what        was       happening

             sooner          they     would           have         reacted                quicker       and          could    have        saved          lives.

             Even       if    the     gates           at    the          back         of       the    pens       had    been       opened         it      would

             have       relieved            some       of       the            pressure.

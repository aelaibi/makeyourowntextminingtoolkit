 THAN A PITCH INVASION.
 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOtfSWISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.     MY MAIN CRITICISM IS THE TOTAL LACK OF ANY CONTROL OUTSIDE THE GROUND

 IF THE FANS HAD BEEN ORGANISED PROPERLY IN QUEUES THEY WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH

 THE TURNSTILES IN AN ORDERLY MANNER AND THIS TRAGEDY WOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED

 2.     THE flCKEi ALLOCA SION WAS RIDICULOUS WHEN LIVERPOOL WfcRh. GIVtN       h- ,UliD
 LESS     fJ.CKE1 S 1HAN FORES I AND IHEY HAD SOME UNSOLD.

 3,     WITH THE DISTANCE FANS FROM BOTH TEAMS TRAVELLED TO THE GAME         TOHAVE

 TRAVELLED A SHORT       DISTANCE MORE TO HAVE HAD DIFFERENT ENDS WOULD NOT      HAVE

 MATTERED„

 4.     LIVERPOOL HAVE SUCH A LARGE FOLLOWING THAT WHATEVER GAME YOU GO 10 1 IS

 ALWAYS A CRUSH SO       SHE FANS iHEMSELVES WOULD tit PU i i1NG UP Wi iH iHE

 CRUBHiNG     iHA I WASHAPPENING JUST BEFORE THE    GAME STARTED.

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 POLICE AND STEWARDS ASKED US TO GO.


Q18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 aA ^ R   THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THOUGHT THAT ONCE IT WAS REALISED THAT THERE WAS A SERIOUS SITUATION THE

 POLICE, FIRE BRIGADE AND A M B U L A T E SERVICE DID VERY WELL.

 Q54                               /

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE/feEEN ALLOCATED THE SPION K O P .

 THE LIVERPOOL HOME GATE AVERAGE IS ABOUT DOUBLET THAT OF NOTTINGHAM FOREST,

 THEREFORE THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD THE BIGGER STAND.       THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A

 T^EDY      IF THIS HAD BEEN THE CASE.

 NO NOTHING AT ALL.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1.    ALL THE OFFICIALS WERE GROSSLY INEXPERIENCED.

 2.    VERY SLOW TO REACT TO THE SITUATIQj>/oF LIFE SAVING.      THEY WERE MORE

 CONTENT ON FORMING A LINE ON THE Pl/CH, TO KEEP THE FANS APART, THEY COULD

 HAVE BEEN BETTER USED ACTUALLY RIPPING DOWN JH^E FENCES TO GET THE INJURED

       IGHT ACROSS THE PITCH WASTING VALUABLE LIFE SAVING TIME.

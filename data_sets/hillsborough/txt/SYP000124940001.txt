 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IF THE FA HAD TAKEN NOTICE OF THE LIV E R P O O L ^ C REQUESTS RE TICKET ALLOCATION

 THIS MAY NEVER HAVE HAPPENED - THE POLICING IN LEPPINGS LANE LEFT A LOT BE

 DESIRED BECAUSE OF LACK OF ORGANISATION IF THE KICK OFF HAD BEEN DELAYED THE

 D ^ A S T E R MAY NOT HAVE OCCURR e !



 LAST YEARS MATCH WAS BETTER POLICED - AND ONLY FANS WITH TICKETS COULD GET

 HAPPENED?

 Q30

 WHAT TINE DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 •1640.   (1640)

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 SHORTLY AFTER A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT THERE WERE 3 ANNOUNCEMENTS, THE 1ST

 WAS A POLICE ANNOUNCEMENT TO WHICH YOU C O U L D N ’T H E A R . 4.20 X 4.30   (1620) X

 (1630).     THEN KENNY DALGLEISH TO WHICH THE CROWD RESPONDED UNLIKE THE 1ST ONE,

 3RD ANNOUNCEMENT - ASKING CROWD TO REMAIN TO ALLOW THE EMERGENCY SERVICES TO

 HAVE FREE PASSAGE .

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.            .

 G53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,
                           c—
AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE SEEMED TO BE TOTAL LACK OF DIRE^SJ'ION AND TOTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

       POLICE OFFICERS ROLE WAS.   I THINK THE FIRE BRIGADE WHICH ARRIVED MAYBE

 20 MINUTES AFTER THE INCIDEN>sSEEMED TO BE DIRECTED EXTREMELY WELL.         THE

 ST JOHN AMBULANCE MEN SEEMED TO B K DOING WHAT THEY COULD.       WHAT WAS APPALLING

WAS THE LACK OF ASSISTANCE FROM THE WsjORIjTY OF THE POLICE O F F I C E R S , ALTHOUGH

 A NUMBER WERE ASSISTING.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

HAVING EXPERIENCED CROWD PROBLEMS IN THE PAST I THINK IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME

 Ej^ORE ALL THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED HAPPENED AT ONE EVENT.

THE FAULT LIES IN 4 AREAS,    IT IS THE DEGREE OF THE FAULT THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

 RESPONSIBILITY MUST REST WITH SOME OF THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS FOR GOING TO

 THE MATCH WITHOUT TICKETS.

 SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB THEMSELVES FOR NOT PROVIDING ADEQUATE

 EMERGENCY SUPPLIES.

 THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION FOR LACK OF FORSIGHT IN CHOICE OF GROUND AND

 ALLOCATION OF TICKETS.

 THE EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR NOT BEING ADEQUATELY PREPARED.

 THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE FOR NOT EXERCISING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WITH

 CROWD CONTROL.

 IF N O T , HOW DID YOU ENTER?                   ^     /y

 I ENTERED THROUGH THE CONCERTINA GATE ON THE EXTREME                   LEFT OF THE T U R N ST IL ES .

 THESE WERE TURNSTILES MARKED A.         I WAS STOOD FOR MOST OF THE TIME BY THE

 METAL GATES.        I WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO GO INTO THE CROWD.              PEOPLE WERE BEING

 CRUSHED THERE WERE SCREAMS FROM A FEW PEOPLE.                   WHEN THE GATE OPENED THE

 HsBURE         WAS RELEIVED AND THE CROWD WAS .UST BUCKED I N . I STOOD WHERE I WAS

 STILL RELUCTANT TO GO IN WITH THE CROWD,                  THE POLICE HAD MADE A CORDON WITH

 THE HORSES WHICH WAS KEEPING BACK THE REMAINDER OF THE CROWD,                     MOST OF THE

 CROWD HAD GONE IN WHEN I SAW THE CORDON BREAK AND MORE OF THE CROWD WAS GOING

 TOWARDS THE GATE.        I DECIDED TO GO IN, THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE CHOICE FOR ME.

 I JOINED THE CROWD AND THE MOVEMENT WAS SUCH THAT I W'AS SWEPT IN MORE THAN

 WALKED IN.        AS THE CROWD WENT IN THROUGH THE GATE A. MAJORITY THEN SWEPT ROUND

 TO THE RIGHT AND I COULD SEE THEM CLEARLY GOING THROUGH GATES INSIDE THE

 TURNSTILES AREA WHICH WERE OPEN TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE T ER R A C E S .                THE

 F^CE       OF THE CROWD FLUNG ME AGAINST METAL PANELS OF THE WALL,                ONCE I WAS

 CLEAR OF THIS I MADE MY WAY TO THE NORTH STAND FAIRLY EASILY.                                       0

 I MAS INSENSED BY THE WAY THAT A LINE OF P X ICEMEN yAS FORMED ACROSS THE

 FRONT OF THE STAND WHEN THERE WAS NO DISORDER,       AT FIRST POLICEMEN WERE

 STOPPING FANS FROM CLIMBING OUT OF THE PENS BUT I MUST SAY THAT WHEN THE
                                        \
 EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM WAS REALISED SOME POLICEMEN WERE FRANTICALLY TRYING

 TO PULL THE FENCING DOWN AND GIVING ASSISTANT       TO INJURED PEOPLE.

 G54



 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THERE WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE,        I ONLY SAW ABOUT

 4 ST JOHNS PERSONNEL,

       DESIGN OF THE FENCING WHICH IS METAL MESH WELDED ONTO THE METAL FRAMEWORK

 AND THEY HAVE TO RELY ON THE FIRE SERVICE TO CUT THE FRAME AWAY,         CLUBS SHOULD

 HAVE METAL CUTTERS OR THINK MORE OF HAVING LARGE GATES WHICH CAN BE OPENED IN

 SUCH EMERGENCIES,

 THERE HAS BEEN CRITICISM OF LIVERPOOL FANS ARRIVING LATE,        WHEN I ARRIVED AT

 2.40PM    (1440) THERE WAS ALREADY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WAITING TO GET INTO THE

 GROUND.   I HAD WALKED UP TO THE GROUND WITH FOREST SUPPORTERS AND THEY WERE

 MAKING THEIR WAY UP TO THE GROUND JUST AS LATE.          THE ROUTE TO THE GROUND

 I PASSED SEVERAL PUBS THAT WERE STILL PACKED WITH FOREST FANS AT 2.35PM         <1435)

 WHO W O U L D N ’T HAVE GOT TO THE GROUND UNTIL NEARLY 3PM <1500).

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 AFTER THE LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT THAT STATED THE MATCH WAS ABANDONED

 AND TO WAIT FOR THE EMERGENCY SERVICES TO L E A V E .

 Q52

 NO.


G19

 Q53

       YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OT^Q§SER VAT IONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED,        AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE LACK OF USE OF MAN POWER, A LQNGNS.INE OF OFFICERS WERE USED TO DIVIDE

 THE PITCH.        SURELY THEY COULD HAVE H E L P E R INSTEAD OF SUPPORTERS HAVING TO

 DO X T .    AND BEFORE THIS THEY STOOD IN FRONT OF US IN THE NORTH STAND FOR

 NO APPARENT REASON.

 THERE WAS NO AUDIBLE ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE UNTIL IT WAS NEARLY OVER.            IF THEY

 HAD TOLD US WHAT WAS HAPPENING THEN PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN UTILISED IN THE

 CROWD,     EG DOCTORS,    FIRST AIDERS.   THE ONLY THING BEING SAID WAS CLEAR THE

 R^pfcH WHICH WAS STUPID IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

  0 YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT           \AJ HANDLED:
  FTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?                                 i
   THINK   IT WAS HANDLED BADLY BY THE ADMINISTRATORS AND/THE POLICE HANDLING

 INITIALLY WAS HEAVY-HANDED BECAUSE THEY WERE PUSHING PEOPLE BACK OVER THE

FENCING ONCE THEY REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING         [RE WAS A MORE HELPFUl

RESPONSE BY THE POLICE.

                                               ojs .
THIS YEAR THE CONCERTINA GATES WERE CLOSED WHEN WE WENT IN AT THE SAME TIME,\

 BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSED IN MY OPINION IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE OV ER CRO WD ING ^

THIS YEAR.

 HANDLED y AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED'?

       FEEL IT WAS HANDLED BADLY,    HE LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE

 POLICE    &CLUB   WAS OF A VERY LOW STANDARD.

 2)    WHEN THE POLICE RE-INFORCEMENTS ARRIVED & STOOD IN FRONT OF THE

 NORTH STAND FOR ABOUT 10 M I N S . INSTEAD OF GOING TO HELP THE INJURED

 ANNOUNCEMENT.      I FEEL THAT IF AN ANNOUNCEMENT HAD OF BEEN MADE THEN X N Y

 POTENTIAL CROWD DISORDER WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFUSED & THE POLICE THEN

 GETTING THEM OFF THE PITCH INSTEAD OF REALISING WHAT HAD HAPPENED &

 HELPING THEM.

 BEING OPENED.

 SERVICES TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION.

 THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT ENOUGH EQUIPMENT IE: STRETCHERS THERE WERE POLICE

 AROUND BUT THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.                                          I SAW PEOPLE

 WHO WERE OBVIOUSLY BADLY INJURED BEING ATTENDED TO BY FELLOW FANS WHO WERE

 GROUND IS          NOT CONDUSIVE TO THAT WAY OF THINKING DUE TO THE AREA SURROUNDING

 THE GROUND.         THE BASIC FAULT IS CRAMMING TOO MANY PEOPLE INTO FOUR SIDED PENS.

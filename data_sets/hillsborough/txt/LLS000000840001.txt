On the 15th April/ 1989/ I went to Hillsborough for the semi-final of
the F.A. Cup.      X went with three friends,      \             |_____________
and I                  I We all had tickets for standing at the Leppings
Lane end of the ground.      The tickets cost £6.00 each and had been obtained
from our Anfield Season Ticket Allocations.


        drove in his car.   We left Liverpool at 12.00 noon and arrived at
the ground at 2.00 p.m.      We parked at Bradfield Road: this being the
Nottingham Forrest supporters end of the ground.           We arrived at Leppings
Lane at about 2.15 to 2.20 p.m. and noticed that there was quite a crowd
at the turnstile.      At this stage the crowd seemed to be out of control.
There were no orderly lines filtering to the ground and turnstiles.
One police horse outside was trying to control the crowd.           When we stood
with the crowd waiting to get in it became very uncomfortable.           As
was with us, she being only a small woman/ we decided to stand to one
side to let the crowd get through.         We stood next to the blue concertina
gates.     The crowd did not abate/ but got worse.        A lot of people were
standing back to avoid the crush.         At this stage we could not get away.


I am a regular attender at football matches.           Normally the Police make
people form lines using police horses.         Merseyside Police never let such
a situation arise outside the turnstiles at Anfield.


The blue gates were being used by the Police inside the ground to eject
people who shouldn't have been in the ground.           At one time when the gate
was opened about 45 to 50 people rushed in.            This must have happened
at about 2.40 to 2.45 p.m.      The reaction of the Police to this was to
try to clear people standing by the gates back into the crowd.            At one
point I thought a Police horse was going to trample me.            I saw a policeman
punch a lad in the eye without provocation simply because he would not
move.     The Police were trying to move people into a more dangerous situation
than they were already in/ and needless to say they would not move.
He would not move either.           When we refused to move the counted Police
officer went charging his horse into the crowd.                 This obviously did not

make things any better.

in ny opinion there were not enough Police officers at the Leppings Lane
end to sort out the problem that had arisen.                  It was apparent at          .

 There was no one directing us once inside the gates.                   The only obvious
 entrance was the tunnel.           We just went to the nearest ent"an“ ’

a sort of twisting.             got stuck at the barrier and       and I moved
 involuntarily passed behind him with this motion.        The three of us ended
up pinned at the barrier.        No one could move it was so crushed.    People
were walking on trapped spectators shoulders and heads to escape.             We
were cramped so much that they could not have fallen through.         One man
was screaming, "My legs, my legs”. Other screams were to move back and
to the Police to open the gates.       One Police officer seemed to just hold
up his hand to express that he could not do anything.         A man had his
leg pinned across my hip and when I heard a dull crack, I thought his
leg had broken.       The man was screaming,"my leg."    I was pinned double
over a crash barrier.       The pain was so severe that I though I was going
to die.       It was the most terrifying experience of my life.    I thought
we were being allowed to die in a football stadium without anyone doing
anything to help.      There was a noise which I can only assume was the
first crash barrier we had passed giving away.          When the barrier gave
away, it released some shoulder pressure and I managed to get over the
9ft fence which was close by.      Two supporters managed to get        3Ut
over the fence.           was helped over by spectators on the other side
of the fence.


Throughout the preceding 10 minutes I had difficulty in breathing, I
had severe bruises to my hips and pains in my chest.


The first Police officer to notice anything was wrong was a W.P.C. who
jumped up to the barrier and told people to push back.         Eventually the
Police recognised there were problems and the gates were opened.        The
gates were so small that it took too long to get people out.


It took me at least 10 minutes to recover enough from the crush.         I found
    and          almost immediately, but we could find no trace of


We watched the bodies being taken on to the pitch.        We were there until
4.30 p.m.      There were no loud speaker announcements until 4.30 when we
were told that we could leave the Stadium.      We then tried to find
again.    I      (returned to the car to see if he had gone there.   When at
5.00p.m. we still had not found him, we formally reported him missing
to the Police.


At 5.30 p.m. the Police asked us to join them on the Police coach, and
we were taken to Hairmerton Police Station, Sheffield.       As there were
so many of us/ they seconded a Boys' Club close by


We then telephoned our families and         rent to fill out a missing persons
form about            We then tried telephoning hospitals to try to find
           We waited from 6.00 p.m. until 1.00 a.m. and then were taken
to the sports hall being used as a mortuary to identify         's body.


I was very shocked at what had happened/ particularly the death of my
good friend.     Although I did not attend hospital on the day of the incident/
I did attend Broadgreen Hospital on the 18th April as I had been suffering
with pains in my chest.     I also had extensive bruising to my hips.   Following
the tragedy, I had three days off work.     I have also been suffering from
a chest infection for which I have consulted my G.P. Dr.
         Liverpool.

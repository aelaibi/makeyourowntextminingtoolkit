X-ray department

  The X-ray department faced very heavy demands during the earlier

stages of the incident.    Well in excess of 200 films were taken

within the first six hours.    The large number of radiographers

available permitted the operation of two rooms in the Casuality

X-ray department, three rooms in the Main X-ray department, and

also mobile sets in the resuscitation area in casuality, Ward

60 and both the General and Cardiac Intensive Care Units.    There

were no significant delays obtaining x-rays for acutely ill gilieBli

Films were inspected by T&fc radiologists as they emerged from

the processors, and brief handwritten reports were stuck to each

patients films an adhesive labels ensuring prompt and efficient

communication of significant findings to the clinicians.    There

was, however, a striking paucity of abnormal films, presumably,

because of the nature of the trauma.    Only four patients had

rib fractures visible on chest x-ray, and no pneumothoraces were

seen initially.    Sex. patients showed changes compatible with

aspiration into the lungs.    A single fracture was the only abnormality

found of 21 skull series, and      cervical spine examinations

showed no significant abnormalities.    There were no fractured

long bones . A single arch aortogram was performed.     An ultrasound

machine was brought into the Casuality X- ray department to help

with assessment of possible abdominal injuries, but was used

little and found no abnormalities.

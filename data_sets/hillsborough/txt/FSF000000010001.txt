              world became- Uverpool s
       third cathedral as around a
       million pilgrims flocked topay
       tribute to the HIIIsborough dead.
          Uverpool had never seen anything
       like it and hopes never to see
       anything like it again.
          We all grieved. Those who had
       relatives, those who had friends,
       those who simply saw the dreadful
       pictures flashed before us on our
       television screens.
          And the place where we grieved
       most was Anfleld.
          it was said with flowers --millions,
       each lovingly laid out before the
       famous Kop goalmouth to form a
       giant, colourful carpel
          At first, ’scarves, ribbons

                                    Memorial
       Gates.
           Liverpool striker John Aldridge
       was among the first. He arrived,
       clutching the hand of his three year-
       old daughter, Joanne. She had
       become all the more precious to him
       because of the tragedy.
         Soon, those farneusgates were
       barely visible as more and more fans
       turned up to weep and remember.
          Club officials decided to open
       their doors and the full grief of a city
       flooded through.
          Wreaths, flowers, and souvenirs
       were laid at the foot of the Koo
       goalmouth. Thousands Ued            their
       scarves to the barriers of the Kop.
          Soon the famous turf was turned
       into a field of flowers as thousands
       turned Into millions.
          By last Sunday it seemed that
       anyone who had shed a tear over
       Hillaborough had paid their respects
       to the Anfieid shrine.

   Twelve of the Hlilsborough dead

Kevin Tyrell (15), from Runcorn, who
played for Tranmere’s under-15 side

offered a YTS place at the club.

three hymns, including Abide With

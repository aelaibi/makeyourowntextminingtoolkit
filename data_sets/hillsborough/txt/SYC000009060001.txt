Dear Sirs,


Thank you for your letter of the 19th September.

1 am surprised both by the contents and your last sentence.

   1.   With respect 1 would have thought that it would be
        unnecessary to ask for my comments on what is after all
        standard and elementary courtroom procedure.  Furthermore
        this point was dealt with during the hearings as is evident
        from the transcripts.

   2.   With regard to your second point, i.e. the location of the
        deceased at 2.50 pm. I think with respect if you would
        carefully read the transcripts of the evidence you will
        find that this point is covered.

   3.   I have responded to your letter because the points you
        raise are actually covered in the transcripts.   You will I
        am sure appreciate that it is not practical to try and
        deal with individual inquests by correspondence.




Yours faithfully.

              Dear Sirs,

              mi     HSBMED INQPESTS 19IH H0913CER 1990

             We are writing to acknowledge your letter of the 17th instant. We are taking
             instructions from our client and will reply more fully as soon as possible.

             We had already been consulted by Mr. Owens concerning the inquest on 27/4/1990.
             Our clients were concerned that they were not: allowed to make any statoaent or
             ask any questions at the inquest and that this had to be done through their
             appointed representative.   As you will appreciate, the Hillsborough Steering
             Committee had arranged block representation and our clients believe that the
             summary of facts given to the inquest was both inadequate and misleading and
             that die Jury were not given a fair picture of what happened. It was not made
             clear to the jury that at 2*50 p.m., the deceased was in the turnstile area and
             not in any danger or in any crush. Hie summary indicated that he was at the
             Lepping Lane of the ground.

             We would appreciate your response to these comments.

       Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


       If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
       of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
       on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
       due course.

       I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
       evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
       coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
       inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
       under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
       witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
       this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

       Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
       to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
       appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
       consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
       attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

       I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
       names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
       to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

       I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
       heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
       submit.

       YourjB faithfully,                     ■

Sear Sirs,

Be« MR. J« OWBm .


I refer to your letter of the 9th of February ana our subsequent
telephone conversation.   I « of course very sorry to leara
that your clients have been distressed by the post mortem report.
Unfortunately, this is one of the probleas \*en documents are
disclosed.
As I aentioned to you on the telephone, Mr. Jonathon Ovens was
in fact identified by his father on the l6th of April according
to the documents which I have seen.

It is correct that initially there was a misnaming of this particular
young man by Mr. Hobertson but team aware of this, and the
necessary steps have been taken to clarify the position. $his
will be dealt with as far as is pppropriate at the Inquest.

With regard to your last paragraph, I draw your attention to the
Coroners Act 1988* You will appreciate that this post mortea
was authorised by the ooroner. It was therefore both inappropriate
and uxmecessary to obtain authorisation ftroa the faaily.

With regard to your ooaaent about vihen the faaily were able to
see the body, you will appreciate from what I have already said
that it is plain that they actually saw the body on the 16th.

Tours faithfully,

               Dear Sirs,

               RE; MR. J. OWENS

               We refer to the autopsy report a copy of which you kindly sent to us.       Our
               clients have, unfortunately, been very upset because the report indicates that
               the post mortem was carried out on 16/4/1989. This was a Sunday and the same
               day that our clients were informed that there son had been killed in the
               disaster. Our clients were informed that they could not see the body because a
               post mortem would have to be carried out either the following day or on Tuesday
               at the latest.   There is also a reference in the report to a Mr.       Michael
               Robertson identifying the deceased as Jonathon Cross. We understand that Mr.
               Robertson did not know Jonathon's surname and the reference to him identifying
               him as Cross is therefore incorrect.

               Our clients gave no authorisation for a post mortem to be carried out on
               16/4/1989 and, if as they suspect, the post mortem was carried out prior to
               their attending the Medico-Legal. Centre they would naturally like to know why
               their authority was not obtained. Your early reply would be appreciated.

              Yours faithfully.

             Sirs,

Hes        J0HAS3QK OWEHS (deceased) Ho.34.
As you axe aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not~to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

Dear Miss Steele
We are the p a r e n t s of Jonathon Owens who was one of the 95 victims_
who lost their lives at the Hillsborough Disaster on 15th April 9 9.

When Mrs Owens attended the meeting in Manchester on Wednesday
3rd October 1990 you asked that if any of the families had cause to
be dissatisfied with their own individual inquest and would like if
possible to have points or details clarified for when the inquest
is to be reopened in Noveober 1990* to writ® to you and you would
give these matters your consideration-
May we respectfully point out that ‘it may be advantageous to yourself
if you would read the enclosed transcript of Jonathon s inquest
before proceeding thread the remainder of this letter.

Froa the enclosed transcript of Jonathon’s enquiry there are a few
natters which we consider warrant clarification and in soae oases
possible amendment. At the beginning of PC Parkes’ summary it
atates Jonathon's intentions were to travel to Sheffield by private
ear - whose car? In fact this car'was Mr Owens Senior coapany
vehicle which played a major part in the misidentlfication of our
Son. and we feel that if this had been mentioned it would have given
a clearer understanding when an explanation of mlsidentification was
later given. Secondly and immediately following the above is an
account of Peter Birekett. Michael Robertson and Jonathon's
whereabouts from the time they arrived in Sheffield at 11.15 a.m.
until they joined the crowd at Lappings Lane, said here to brat
1Jl.ilO p.m. We wish to stsxe at this point that in Novem'cer 1989
at the request of the Wes*. Midlands Police we attended the showing of
visual evidence s u r r o u n d o u r son's death. We were given for the
first time a visual and a verbal account of what happened to
Jonathon from when he arrived in oheffiald and up to and vnen he
carried acrcss the football pitch by 'two police officers and a
spectator who lives in Southport. The verbal account given by the
police officer cares in the sain from Michiel Bcbsrtson ar.s the
statement that he had mtde to the police 'sme we*ka e*rU*r.

             We should Ilk* you to consider these points o«* our behalf In order
             to obtain a clearer account of these facts.

             We should like to state at this point that we were never shown
             this summary before it was read out in Court during Jonathon s
             inquest on 27th April 1990. In fact the first time that we
             even saw this summary was only oa Wednesday 10th October 1990.

‘A           We should further like to confirm that we have never “•*
 ^           Robertson either before or since Jonathon s death, Michael was
 : ,f        friendly with 'Peter and Jonathon had- been in his company on a
              num ber of oocasions. We were told in November last by the West
              Midlands Police that Michaeltaiew Jonathon on first name terms
              only as Jon as did most of Jonathon's friends and acquaintances.

             We have had to rely on West Midlands Police as the only source
             of information surrounding our Son’s death and are sorry to say
             that after the inquest w ere disappointed, bewildered and somewhat
             confused.
             We look forward to hearing from you in due course.

Dear Sir,

Re: Resumed Inquests - Individual Queries

I write further to ray letter of 6th March 1991 to confirm the substance of
our conversation on 7th March, to        the effect that the Murray Family no
longer desire Sgt Fox to be called as a witness to the Inquest.

As you correctly surmised, the heading to numbered paragraph 3 of my letter
of 6th should read "Jonathon Owens"        and not "James Gary Aspinall". I
apologise for any confusion this typographical error may have caused.

Yours sincerely,




F.R. Kennah.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection

   Dear Dr Popper

   JONATHON OWENS

   I refer to the above named who was a victim at the Hillsborough Football
   Stadium tragedy on 15th April 1989.

   Enquiries were caused to be made in June, in relation to the blood alcohol
   analysis of the above, as it had been intimated in a written statement from the
   friend with whom he travelled, Michael Robertson, that Owens had consumed
   alcohol prior to attending the football ground.

   Robertson was subsequently reinterviewed, and confirmed that no alcohol was
   drunk by Owens.    There in some confusion as to whether you have been made
   aware of the result of these enquiries, and as such the statement covering this
   point is attached.

   Yours sincerely

 RE : JONATHON OMENS (19.3.71) 132 PLAS NEWTON LANE, CHESTER, CHESHIRE

 The above named died in the Hillsborough tragedy, our reference is body number
 34.

 I attach herewith for your information statements concerning the body proving
 continuity and also explaining the body was mis-identified initially as John
 Cross.

 To summarise Micheal Robertson, the deceased’s friend travelled to Hillsborough
 Football Club with Owens on 15 April.  They got separated in the crush at the
 Leppings Lane end.  In an attempt to find the deceased, Robertson returned to
 the vehicle they had arrived in, which Robertson assumed was the property of
 the deceased’s father.

 A police national computer check revealed that the registered owner of the
 vehicle to be a Stuart Cross. Robertson naturally assumed the deceased’s name
 was Cross as opposed to Owens.

 Consultant anaesthetist, Doctor Andrew John Byrne was present at the match and
 pronounced the life of Owens extinct in the gymnasium at Sheffield Wednesday
 Football Club.

 Pc Morely was the officer to whom Robertson identified the body as John Cross.

 John Clifford Owens is the deceased’s father and identified the body of his son
 to DS Hardy naturally under the correct name. DS Hardy’s statement has yet to
 be received by me.

                                                                                Continued....




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                   Sheffield
Police Constable Weigold provides continuity on identification from Pc Morely
to pathologist Doctor Sivaloganathan for post mortem purposes.

Doctor Forrest, consulting chemical pathologist examined Owen’s blood sample
for ethol but was unable to detect any traces.

I hope this explanation clears any ambiguity in respect of the deceased’s name
and the identification therefore.

If I can help you any further please do not hesitate to contact me.

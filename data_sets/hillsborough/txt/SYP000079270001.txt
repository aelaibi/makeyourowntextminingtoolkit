road,    and A 5 7 . There were             no traffic     delays    on the    route.     Prior      to

a r r i v i n g at H i l l s b or o ug h at    1220 hours     <1220)    I parked my car         in

H o b s o n St and wa l ke d         to the ground.       There were     no Police Officers

giving     directions          but    there was a Police        presence      in the area.          During

the mile        or so walk         to the ground there was           no fighting       or di sorder          of

any    sort,     a l t hough      I did witness       that various      pubs were      closed,       there

were    a few still          open and       I saw a lot of N o 1 1 1n g ham F ores t supportsr s

drinking        heavily from beer glasses                outside    these    pubs,    I a c t u a 11y

c ommented to a Police Officer                   I passed     concerning      the drinking and he

stated     it was all          for money.

On arrival         at the entrance            to the ground at       1350 hours       <135Q)    via

P s n is t u n e Rd the queues were             non-existent,       there were P olice O f f i c e r s

present.        I never      saw any S t e w a r d s .

I never        ex p e r i e n c e d isrfiy d ifficulty entering      the ground and having                been

the    previous                   I knew where       to go.   I did notice a great           lack       of

signs    howeve/directing                 you to your     seating area.       Having     entered via a

tur rtVt i \        handed        over my ticket.        I never    saw any u n au th or is ed entry

into the ground,             neither       did I see any disorder           or fighting      once

inside     the ground.

Between        entering      the     ground and taking        up my m atch viewing          posit ion at

'1403 hours        ( 1403)     I sat with those          I nad m en t io n ed ear lier other            uhan

                   who stood         in the Spion Kop area.

There were         no untoward         incidents at this        point and      I never w i t n e s s e d

a ny   person      consuming alcohol,            neither was       there any fighting          or

a ny thing      unusual      at    this    point,    it a p pe a re d to be a very good

a tm o s p h e r e all   round.

On taking        up my m at ch        position      in the S Stand,      to the      left of the

players        tunnel,    I had a reasonable             view of the standing area at                the

L e p pings     Ln end of the ground.               At around   1430 hours      (143Q)      onwards          I

noticed that Pens 3 and 4 at the J e fe p pings Ln end were                          e x ce ed in gl y full
                                                                                               PAGE        3

and a gain when the          players       took the field for         the usual 5 minutes

warm-up       prior to kick-off at about                1450 hours    < 1 4 5 0 ) , 1 saw that     it

was    still    incredibly full.          Just    prior    to kick-off       I saw the      crowd in

the    same    pens surge     forward.        I saw fans     climbing       over the front

perimeter       f e n c e . I saw    10-13 Police Officers           standing     in front     of the

fsnce,    they did not appear              to know what      to do about       it. They just

stood as       if in a trance.           I immediately thought         it was a pitch

invasion.       The game     kicked off and            I saw that there were         fans still

climbing       over the fencing and            congregating       behind the goal area.            It

a p p e a r e d to me that    neither        the Police or football au th or it ie s           knew

what was taking          place.     As   the game      progressed my a t te nt io n became          even

more    drawn to the ma yh em behind the goal area.                    At this     point     I saw a

P olice Officer        run from the          perimeter    fence    to the     linesman offic ia te d

on the S S tand side.             The Officer      drew the      linesman's a tt e nt i on     to the

crowd trouble and           it a pp ea r ed to me as though the Officer was

attempting       to get the         linesman to draw the          referee's a t t e n ti o n to the

problem and halt the game.                Shor tl y after wa rd s     1 saw another Police

Officer       run onto the        pitch and he drew the           r e f e r e e ’s a tt e nt i on to the

a b s olute mayhem       by now,      behind the goal area.           The   referee then stopped

the m at c h and all        the     players    left the field.        1 feel    that the      referee

s hould not have star te d the game at 3pm                   (1500).

Any    reasonable m in d ed         person    could see that       by kick-off       time   the

trouble       behind the goal was a lot more               than just a pitch          invasion.

During    the    next hour what           I w it n es s ed from my seated area was a

section of fans between 2 — 300                in number     run from Leppings Ln towards

the N ot ti n gh a m Forest         supporters     in the S pi on Kop.       The Police

initially formed a line across                   the   18 yard    line at^A-fil? S pi on Kop end?

and    they    remai ned    i n— situ for a p p r o k i.ma t 3.             ni nutes and during

this    time    I feel     they w ou ld have       been better       deployed,     as si st in g   the

by now severely          injured fans         behind the goal area.

               By now       it was     obvious    that     there were a lot of fans s eriously              injured
               I
                I did not know at this               point    that some of the supporters were dead.

               There was          no ann ou nc em en t    made    by the a ut ho ri ti es    informing supporters

               and Police          that a major       t ragedy had occurred.

                    feel    that    had a loud speaker a n no un ce me nt           been    relayed to the       fans

               this    could have a ss is te d           in some way      in saving     lives.

               At about       1 6 IQ hours     ( 1 6 1 0 ) there were      so m any    people on the     pitch

               area,       I realised that        the match w ould not be             re--started.    My son and

               ■priend decided to            leave    the ground.

               At    no time did        1 witness anything w hich            I would       consider   to be a

                criminal      offence.

               ir feel      that    the football         author it ie s   and the Police w v e r y          lax    m

               their a p p r o ac h to the game,             t here a pp ea re d   to be po o r ga ni sa ti on

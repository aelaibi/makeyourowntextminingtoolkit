               with my husband and son where the F.A. Cup Semi Final was to be played

               between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest,                                1 attended the game due to

               rny huscana                                                       My husband is a

                            and I have accompanied him to many football matches over the

               years.

               My son and I took up our seats                      in the South Stand at about 2.45                     pm in

               stadium was electric: and everyone seemed very happy about the game we

               were going to see.               There were no signs of any trouble                        just normal

            I r emernber look i ng at the

            L e p p i n g s Lane     end where       the Liverpool           s upporters were and            thinking            it

            unusual        that    it was     the    only     place    in

            the    stadium where           there was        still     space.        The    space was       in both the

            outer       pens.      I also     saw that        one    or two    supp o r t e r s    were    climbing         over

            the    fence      directly       liehind    the    goal at       the L e p pings       Lane    end and making

            their way towards              the N o r t h Stand.          I did not think            this was        unusual

            as    I have seen         it ha p p e n at      other matches.

fcw/i
        QSt& started and 1 was still aware that people were climbing over the fence
            at the Leppings Lane end.                     They were not however moving on like                             the

        ^   others but congregating behind the goal.                                I thought this was some form
            of crowd trouble or overspill which X have seen before,                                        but I was a

            little       concerned because             if these fans had moved round to the North

            8?ta n d

            More and more           people were         now con g r e g a t i n g    behind/the       goal    and      1

            remember        thinking       that     there were        hardly any          p o licemen there,         n o r mally

            when       the res    crowd trouble         the Police          seem highly visible.              1 cannot

            remember        seeing any stewards               at all.        I remember       thinking       that

            there were           now so many        people     on the       pitch that       the    gams w o u l d    have        to

            stop and        indeed w i t h i n a few minutes                of the    game    starting a           p o liceman

            ran onto        the    pitch and        the game was        stopped.

            The    players        seemed     reluctant        to    leave    the L e p p i n g s Lane      end and         this

            sur p r i s e d me     because      players       normally       steer    well    clear       of trouble.

            The    p1aye rs did eve nt ua 11y go to the t un ne 1 and then of f the                                 pi t c h „

            More and more people were now on the pitch and I R e m e m b e r                                 seeing

            people       lying down with others trying to resusc.il/ate them.                                 There were

            now more        police officers at this point and sornf were giving first aid

torealise          that       there       were      a     lot     of     people          injured         for w h a t e v e r           reason

but     I di d     not at        this       stage         realise           anyone        was      dead.

What     is      very    vivid        in m y      mind        still         is the        gate        in the         fence        behind

the     goal      and    I thought           how        tiny      it was          for     people         to       h a ve    to    get

about     3.45       pm.       During        the        t im e    th at       I sat       in the S o u t h S t a n d                I saw

more     and more casualties                      l y i ng       on   the        ground       and      by     co ats        being        placed

over     heads       it b e c a m e       obvious         to me         that          people      were        dead.          Th^'

Nottingham          Forest          fans     clearly             did     not      know      what       wa s    goi          on as        they

were     continuing            to    shout        in     support            of    their        club.          In/fact            there      was

a/surge          forward       of L i v e r p o o l        fans        towards          the     Kop                despite         there

'being    bodies         on    the       ground         and      it w a s        at    this     time        t h at    I first            saw

the     ground       by v a r i o u s       means.            I saw h o a r d i n g s          and       ladders           used      as

stetchers          while       others        were        j ust        carried.            More        and     more         people        were

now     being      laid       d o w n at     the        co rn e r      of     the      pitch North             Stand         at    Spion

Kop.      This       seemed         to    show      the       Nottingham               fans         what      was      going        on a n d by

now     they were          quiet.           I can        recall          s o me       small     isolated             incidents

when     fans      reacted          wrongly         to w h a t         was       going      on.

thought          unusual       as    there        were        so m a n y         seriously            injured.              1 was        also

surprised          that       there       were      no a n n o u n c e m e n t s          as          to w h a t      was       going       on. I

eventually           get      out    of     our     s e at s      and       leave.          I was        very        shocked         at     the

t ime    and      felt     numb,         it m a y       have      been        frustration              at     being        so     helpless

         in an effective manner but to be

         police action I thought             it unnecessary that so many policemen remained

         at the Kop end with dogs throughout.                      1 said to my son at the time                if

         they were not holding dogs they could be helping.

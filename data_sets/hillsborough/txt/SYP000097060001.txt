                         SUBJECT:      APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE



                          The interim report of the Inquiry by the Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor into
                          the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster that occurred on the 15 April 1989 was
                          published at 1100 hours on Friday 4 August 1989- The report was very
                          critical of the South Yorkshire Police in general and, in particular, myself
                          and a number of other police officers.

                          National media interest     and comments followed publication and, in view of
                          the extensive criticism     in the report regarding my handling of events on
                          the day of the disaster     and the possibility of actions of criminal
                          negligence/disciplinary     proceedings, I was suspended from duty on the 4
                          August 1989 .

                          The Director of Public Prosecutions was, I understand, requested                  to examine
                          Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and subsequently instructed                  the West
                          Midlands Police to carry out a full criminal investigation, 'not                  limited
                          to the criminal culpability of the police alone' into the events                  that
                          occurred at Hillsborough on the 15 April 1989 .

                          Whilst no criminal charges have been brought to date against me, the
                          possibility of charges being brought exists and I will, no doubt, be
                          interviewed by the West Midlands Police during the course of their criminal
                          investigations.  There is also a possibility of interviews in respect of
                          disciplinary allegations made against me for which a Regulation 7 Notice
                          has been served.

                          I was authorised to obtain independent legal advice from Hammond Suddards
                          resulting in being advised by them to obtain further private independent
                          legal advice as Hammond Suddards could not assist me personally as no
                          criminal charges had been made.  I am now obtaining independent legal advice
                          through a personal Legal Protection Insurance Policy.

                          The policy gives a maximum cover of £50,000.  If I need legal representation
                          at interviews with the West Midlands Inquiry Team regarding possible
                          criminal or disciplinary matters and at protracted inquest hearings, which
                          are unlikely to take place until early 1990, then there is little doubt
                          my legal costs will be very much in excess of this figure.

^       4 Ijyt ^0* ^     If any criminal proceedings are brought against members of the South
                         Yorkshire Police (and manslaughter charges are possible), it is imperative,
                         in the interests of the force, the Police Authority and any individual
    L    J   L
                         officer, that those concerned have had the benefit of the best possible
                         legal advice and representation at any forthcoming judicial hearings.

                         Whilst the force has been, and continues to be, legally represented matters
                         are very complex and conflict of interest can arise in areas concerning
                         different individuals.

  The Clerk to the Police Authority

                                                                                                    4 December 1987




  Dear Sir


  HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 77/87

  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


   There is statutory authority in section 48 of    the Police Act 1964for
   payments to be made from the police fund to meet expenditure incurred
   by police officers in defending proceedings in tort.  Also, acting in
   pursuance of its general statutory duty to maintain an adequate and
   efficient police force for its area, ' the police authority has
^fcdiscretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers - in all kinds of
   legal proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in
   pursuance of their duties, or the' interests of the -force as a whole
   are involved.   The purpose of this circular is to give guidance to
   police authorities to help them in considering requests on behalf of
   officers for financial'assistance.   This guidance has been discussed
   and agreed with the ^local authority and with the police staff
   associations.

  2.    The central principle which should guide consideration of
  individual cases is that, where a police authority considers that an
  officer has acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that
  the interests of a force as a whole are involved, the officer should
  have the support of the police authority to ensure that .he has the
  services of a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket.       The
  following paragraphs provide general ‘guidance to the different
  classes of proceedings.    Payments made to officers in accordance with
  this guidance will b e ‘eligible for police grant.
    ...CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS.     -.    ......

    .-Prosecution bv the Crown Prosecution Service -          . ...

     -'3. \7An ;'officer who is the subject of a public prosecution for an
     •alleged offence committed while carrying out his duties as a police
      officer is in the same position as any other defendant .and must be
      expected to bear the costs of his defence.       If he is acquitted, he
      should,      like  any   other defendant,    look to the court for
      reimbursement of his expenses.. =  ■ If the costs are not paid, or not
     paid in full from central funds, the police authority are in a
     position to decide, on the full facts, whether or not to make a
     payment to the officer or to the Police Federation if they have
     provided the funding.       There may be cases where it is proper to
     provide legal advice and/or legal representation even where the
     officer is found guilty.      This may arise for example in test cases
     where the officer has been carrying out a practice hitherto
     approved of but is found guilty as a result of that practice being
     found unlawful by the court- In the~l i g h t 'of the'circumstances of
^    that particular case.


     Private Prosecutions

     4.  A police officer should be able to carry out his duties in the
     confidence that, if he acts in good ....faith ..and exercises his
     judgement reasonably, his'police authority‘will "support him.   If,
     in a case where a member'of the public brings a prosecution against
     an officer, the authority is satisfied that the officer has acted
     in this way, the authority should provide' or fund legal advice
     and/or representation.        .............

     5. ^ Where a court decides that a prosecution brought against an
     officer was not brought in good faith, it may order the prosecutor
     to pay-the whole or any part of the costs incurred by the defence;
     again, if the officer is acquitted on indictment, his costs may be
     met from central funds.   In either of these cases, the question of
     the police authority providing financial support to the officer may
     not arise. -However, where the costs of an acquitted officer are
•    not awarded by the court or awarded only in part, the police
     authority should consider whether to reimburse any costs not
     covered, taking into account the reasons, if any, given by the
     court for failing to award all costs claimed.


     CIVIL PROCEEDINGS

     Civil Actions   Acainst   the    Chief   Officer   for   Wrongful   Acts   of
     Constables

    6. Under section 48(1) of the Police Act 1964, the chief officer
    of a force is liable in respect of torts committed by constables
    under his direction and control (which includes, special constables
    and officers of other forces serving in the police area under
    mutual   aid  arrangements)    in   the  performance   or purported
    performance of their functions.   Under section 48(2) any damages or

                                                                                2
costs awarded against the chief officer in such proceedings, any
costs he incurs himself, and any sum paid in connection with the
settlement of ,;a claim,: provided the Settlement is approved by ,the
police authority, ^must-be-:paid out of "the police -fund. " In such
cases, :therefore,:;,the;police authority’s discretion extends only to
whether or not .to approve.a proposed settlement of the claim.


Civil Actions Against -Individual Police Officers

7.   Alternatively, the plaintiff may be awarded damages against an
individual police officer/ though he cannot recover the damages
twice over against the.chief officer as well.    Section 48(4) of the
Police Act 1964 specifically empowers a police authority "to such
extent as they think fit".to pay out of the police fund any damages
or costs awarded against an officer, any costs he incurs himself,
and any sums paid in connection with the settlement of a claim.
This   provision   applies  to actions against officers       of the
authority's own force, officers of another force serving the police
area under mutual aid arrangements, and special constables for the
police area.    In considering whether to give financial assistance
the authority will wish to consider in particular whether the
officer concerned acted in good faith and exercised his judgement
reasonably.   Where the court finds for the officer, he may seek his
costs from the plaintiff; should the costs not be ^ awarded or
awarded only in part, the police authority should consider whether
to reimburse any costs not covered,        taking into account the
reasons, if any, given by the court for failing to award all costs
claimed.

8.   Joint actions naming both the chief officer and an individual
police officer may be brought in some cases.   In such cases it is
important that any discussion of the merits and quantum of the
proposed settlement should involve all the parties named in the
claim together with advisers even if they are represented by
different advisers.


Civil Actions Under the Data Protection Act 1984

9. -..Under sections 22 and 23 of_ the Data Protection Act 1984 -an
individual who suffers damage as a result of the inaccuracy, loss
or unauthorised     disclosure  of personal daca    is entitled to
compensation from the data user.   In the absence of any case law on
these provisions,     it is unclear whether the acts covered by
sections 22 and 23 amount to torts, to which the guidance ^in
paragraphs 6 and 7 above applies.   If not, section 48 of the Police
A;t 196*4 does not apt>ly. * However, the position is broadly the
same.     Under  section 38(3) (a) of the 1984    Act constables are
treated as servants of the chief officer for the     purposes of the
Act.   A chief constable is therefore liable for the acts of his
officers falling within sections 22 and.23 in the same way as he is
liable for their torts under section 48(1).     The position of non­
police officers is less clear but it is possible■that in some cases
the chief constable might be regarded as having liability for their
acts.   It follows that it would be proper for the police authority

his responsibility "under ^section ;22(3) and he should not be held
liable if one of his officers-disregards the system established.

10.   Where compensation is sought from -an* individual officer, the
police authority will ~wish, - in ■ considering whether to meet 'the
costs which would otherwise fall on the officer, to take account of
the same matters as in exercising their power under section 48(4)
of the Police Act 1964. (see paragraph 7).        Police authorities
should apply the same broad principles and in particular, meet the
costs of any compensation awarded-against a chief-constable where a
non-police officer is at fault and the chief constable is found to
have liability for the actions performed.


Police Officers Bringing Civil Actions for Defamation

11.   There may be occasions when financial assistance is sought
from a police authority to enable an officer to bring or consider
bringing   a ..■•civil ' action for defamation.      An authority has
discretion to give such assistance but       it will   be eligible for
police grant only if the following criteria are all met:-

      (a)          the             defamation is serious;

      (b)    it relates to the actions of  an officer acting or
      said to be acting in the discharge of his duty;

      (c)         it has attracted public attention;

        (d)    to bring the action is considered to be in the
        interests of the force or of the police service as a
     ...whole; and .

      (e)        the action stands a reasonable chance of success.

Criterion (d) is central.  If only the reputation of the individual
officer is in question, he is in the same position as any other
citizen and must be expected to seek his own remedy.         But an
allegation against a particular officer may well reflect on the
reputation of the whole force or be an example of wider allegations
against the force or a significant section of it.     In such cases
the police authority, provided the other criteria are satisfied,
may reasonably be expected to help to defend the reputation of the
force.
INQUESTS, PUBLIC ENQUIRIES AND TRIBUNALS •

Legal Representation for Chief Officers -      /V.' '7 'V          ’7“

12. ' Any interested party may be legally’represented at an inquest
but at his own expense since expenses 'are payable only to witnesses
and jurors."' .An interested ‘party -will normally be entitled to be
legally represented at 'a public enquiry or other public tribunal.
Where the interest of the force is affected," it will be appropriate
for the police authority to provide at its expense for the chief
officer to be legally represented on behalf of the force.


Legal Representation for Individual Officers

13.  Separate representation for individual officers whose interest
is involved may be necessary.    For example, there will be occasions
when (a) the chief officer's legal representative cannot reasonably
be expected to represent the separate interests of such officers
and (b) -:-the police authority considers that such interests should
be represented.     In such cases the authority should give financial-
assistance to the officers.         In cons i d e r a n ^ ^ T b ) above, the
authority will wish in particular to assess whether the officers
are at risk of being held to blame for actions in connection with
the death to which the inquest relates and whether any such finding
might give rise to legal proceedings for the- costs of which the
police authority would be liable under section 48(1) of the Police
Act 1964 or for which financial assistance might be appropriate
within the terms of this circular.


APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

14.   An officer wishing to seek financial assistance from his
police authority should have the opportunity in advance of as well
as on the conclusion of the proceedings to submit to the chief
officer an application for financial assistance.  The chief officer
should put this, together with his own recommendation to the police
authority for decision.   The officer should normally be given the
opportunity by the police authority to make representations to .-thenL...
if he wishes to do so.

15.   If it decides to give financial assistance, the authority
should inform the officer concerned that, if the information on
which they based their decision to grant the assistance is shown in
subsequent legal proceedings to be inaccurate or incomplete, the
authority will normally expect to recover the money unless it^ is
satisfied that no cilpable misrepresentation was involved and that
to recover the money would involve the applicant in substantial
hardship.   On the other hand, if an authority refuses financial
assistance and then discovers in the light of subsequent events
that such assistance would have been warranted, then financial
assistance should be granted in order to meet the reasonable costs
incurred by the officer in seeking legal advice or assistance.

REPORT BY THE CHIEF CONSTABLE          Act 1972 as' amended.           I


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

1.    Matter for Consideration

      The provision of financial assistance to police officers involved in
      legal proceedings arising from the event at Hillsborough Football Ground
      on 15 April 1989.


2.    Background Information

2.1   Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, published on 4 December 1987, provides
      guidance to Police Authorities on the exercise of their discretion in
      considering applications, on behalf of police officers, for financial
      assistance towards the cost of legal advice and representation arising
      from involvement in legal proceedings which result from the pursuance, in
      good faith, of their duties or where the interests of the Force as a
      whole are involved. A copy of the Circular is attached.

2.2   Arising from the publication of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor
      into the Hillsborough Disaster, the subsequent appointment of the Chief
      Constable of the West Midlands Police to enquire into the justification
      for criminal proceedings arising from the disaster and the forthcoming
      Coroner's Inquest into the deaths, an application for assistance has been
      received from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield who was involved in
      command of the policing arrangements for the football Semi-Final and
      similar applications from other officers similarly involved might be
      anticipated.


3.    Comment

3.1   Following the disaster and throughout the Public Inquiry the interests of
      the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and all officers of the Force
      have been represented by legal officers appointed by the Police Authority
      insurers. The legal officers appointed by the insurers have indicated
      that in relation to criminal proceedings they would be unable to provide
      representation for individual officers who should seek independent legal
      advice and representation.

3.2   It will be seen from the Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, that the
      central principle which should guide consideration of individual cases is
      that, where a Police Authority considers that an officer has acted in
      good faith in pursuance of his duties or that where the interests of the
      Force as a whole are involved, the officer should have the support of the
      Police Authority to ensure that he has the services of a lawyer and that
      he should not be out of pocket.


3.3   It will be further seen that in respect of criminal proceedings pursued
      by the Crown Prosecution Service against an individual officer he should
      be expected to bear the costs of his own defence and the Police
      Authority, at the conclusion of the proceedings, are able to consider, on
      the full facts, whether or not to reimburse any expenses incurred by the
      officer and not awarded by the trial court, even where proceedings have
      resulted in conviction in certain circumstances.    It will be noted from
      paragraph 14 of the Circular that an officer wishing to seek financial
      assistance should have the opportunity to submit to the Chief Officer an
      application for financial assistance, upon receipt of which the Chief
      Officer should refer the application to the Police Authority together
      with his own recommendation.    It will be further seen that the applying
      officer should normally be given the opportunity by the Police Authority
      to make representations to them if he wishes to do so. At this stage
      Chief Superintendent Duckenfield wishes to reserve the right to so appear
       at a future date if necessary.

3.4   The events at Hillsborough were unique in respect of the potential
      criminal liability of police officers involved. The officers were acting
      in good faith in accordance with well established practices and any
      criminal proceedings will largely constitute a test case similar to the
      example provided in paragraph three of the Home Office Circular. The
      unique nature of the circumstances of this particular criminal enquiry
      with its wide implications for the interests of the Force as a whole is
      such that the Police Authority may wish to consider, at this stage, a
      commitment to the funding of independent legal advice for the officer(s)
      concerned. The financial commitment of the officers is likely to
      commence with advice and representation prior to and during interviews
      undertaken by West Midlands Police officers in the course of their
      enquiry. It would be prudent for that representation to continue
      throughout the enquiry and any subsequent criminal proceedings and to
      extend to representation at the Coroner's Inquest which will ultimately
      be held.

3.5   At this stage it is anticipated that representation in any civil actions
      subsequently pursued will be provided by the Police Authority insurers.

3.6    It should be noted that there is available, to all officers of
       superintendent and chief superintendent rank who have chosen to
       contribute, a measure of personal liability insurance arranged by the
       Superintendents' Association of England and Wales. The individual
       liability limit of this insurance cover is £50,000.


 4.    Financial Implications

       It is not possible at this stage to assess the financial implications of
       this matter which will depend entirely on the course and extent of the
       criminal enquiry and the ultimate outcome, and the duration of the
       Inquest proceedings. There is no specific provision in the Revenue
       Budget for this expenditure.


 5.    Recommendation

       The Committee is recommended to approve a commitment to provide financial
       assistance for legal representation to the officer(s) concerned in
       accordance with the central principle of Home Office Circular No.
        77/1987.

    Dear Sir


    HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 77/87

    FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    There is statutory authority in section 48 of the Police Act 1964 for
    payments to be made from the police fund to meet expenditure incurred
    by police officers in defending proceedings in tort. Also, acting in
    pursuance of its general statutory duty to maintain an adequate and
    efficient police force for its area, the police authority has
    discretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers in all kinds of
    legal proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in

•
    pursuance of their duties, or the interests of the force as a whole
    are involved.   The purpose of this circular is to give guidance to

•
    police authorities to help them in considering requests on behalf of
    officers for financial assistance. This guidance has been discussed
    and agreed with the local authority and with the police staff
    associations.

    2.    The central principle which should guide consideration of
    individual cases is that, where a police authority considers that an
    officer has acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that
    the interests of a force as a whole are involved, the officer should
    have the support of the police authority to ensure that he has the
    services of a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket. The
    following paragraphs provide general guidance to the different
    classes of proceedings. Payments made to officers in accordance with
    this guidance will be eligible for police grant.



                                                                                            1
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

Prosecution by the Crown Prosecution Service

3.   An officer who is the subject of a public prosecution for an
alleged offence committed while carrying out his duties as a police
officer is in the same position as any other defendant and must be
expected to bear the costs of his defence.   If he is acquitted, he
should, like any other defendant,        look to the court for
reimbursement of his expenses. If the costs are not paid, or not
paid in full from central funds, the police authority are in a
position to decide, on the full facts, whether or not to make a
payment to the officer or to the Police Federation if they have
provided the funding.   There may be cases where it is proper to
provide legal advice and/or legal representation even where •the
officer is found guilty. This may arise for example in test cases
where the officer has been carrying out a practice hitherto
approved of but is found guilty as a result of that practice being
found unlawful by the court in the light of the circumstances of
that particular case.

Private Prosecutions

4. A police officer should be able to carry out his duties in the
confidence that, if he acts in good faith and exercises his
judgement reasonably, his police authority will support him.    If,
in a case where a member of the public brings a prosecution against
an officer, the authority is satisfied that the officer has acted
in this way, the authority should provide or fund legal advice
and/or representation.

5.   Where a court decides that a prosecution brought against an
officer was not brought in good faith, it may order the prosecutor
to pay the whole or any part of the costs incurred by the defence;
again, if the officer is acquitted on indictment, his costs may be
met from central funds. In either of these cases, the question of
the police authority providing financial support to the officer may
not arise.   However, where the costs of an acquitted officer are
not awarded by the court or awarded only in part, the police
authority should consider whether to reimburse any costs not
covered, taking into account the reasons, if any, given by the
court for failing to award all costs claimed.

CIVIL PROCEEDINGS
Civil Actions   Against   the   Chief   Officer   for Wrongful   Acts   of
Constables

6.   Under section 48(1) of the Police Act 1964, the chief officer
of a force is liable in respect of torts committed by constables
under his direction and control (which includes special constables
and officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutual aid arrangements)       in the performance or purported
performance of their functions. Under section 48(2) any damages or
      costs awarded against the chief officer in such proceedings, any
      costs he incurs himself, and any sum paid in connection with the
      settlement of a claim, provided the settlement is approved by the
      police authority, must be paid out of the police fund.      In such
      cases, therefore, the police authority's discretion extends only to
      whether or not to approve a proposed settlement of the claim.


      Civil Actions Against Individual Police Offleers

      7.  Alternatively, the plaintiff may be awarded damages against an
      individual police officer, though he cannot recover the damages
      twice over against the chief officer as well. Section 48(4) of the
      Police Act 1964 specifically empowers a police authority "to such
      extent as they think fit'1 to pay out of the police fund any damages
      or costs awarded against an officer, any costs he incurs himself,
      and any sums paid in connection with the settlement of a claim.
      This provision applies to actions against officers of the
      authority's own force, officers of another force serving the police
      area under mutual aid arrangements, and special constables for the
      police area.   In considering whether to give financial assistance
      the authority will wish to consider in particular whether the
      officer concerned acted in good faith and exercised his judgement
      reasonably. Where the court finds for the officer, he may seek his
      costs from the     plaintiff; should the costs not be awarded or
      awarded only in part, the police authority should consider whether
      to reimburse any costs not covered, taking ' into account the
      reasons, if any, given by the court for failing to award all costs
      claimed.
      8.   Joint actions naming both the chief officer and an individual
      police officer may be brought in some cases. In such cases it is
      important that    any discussion of the merits and quantum of the
      proposed settlement should involve all the parties named in the
      claim together     with advisers even if they are represented by
      different advisers.

      Civil Actions Under the Data Protection Act^lMl
• #




      9. under sections 22 and 23 of the Data Protection Act 1984 an
      individual who suffers damage as a result of the inaccuracy, loss
      or unauthorised disclosure of personal data is entitled to
      compensation from the data user. In the absence of any case law on
      these provisions, it is unclear whether the acts covered by
      sections 22 and 23 amount to torts, to which the guidance in
      paragraphs 6 and 7 above applies. If not, section 48 of the Police
      Act 1964 does not appl/.     However, the position is broadly the
      same.    Under section 38(3)(a) of the 1984 Act constables are
      treated as servants of the chief officer for the purposes of the
      Act.   A chief constable is therefore liable for the acts of his
      officers falling within sections 22 and 23 in the same way as he is
      liable for their torts under section 48(1).   The position of non­
      police officers is less clear but it is possible that in some cases
      the chief constable might be regarded as having liability for their
      acts. It follows that it would be proper for the police authority
                                                                         3
to meet all costs, including any award of compensation, arising
from this liability. It should be noted that the liability of the
"data user" under the Act is not vicarious but his personal
liability. Therefore his own care in having instituted a system of
obtaining, checking and recording data which would reasonably guard
against error and loss under section 23(3) of the Act should meet
his responsibility under section 22(3) and he should not be held
liable if one of his officers disregards the system established.
10.   Where compensation is sought from an individual officer, the
police authority will wish, in considering whether to meet the
costs which would otherwise fall on the officer, to take account of
the- same matters as in exercising their power under section 48(4)
of the Police Act 1964 (see paragraph 7) .       Police authorities
should apply the same broad principles and in particular, meet the
costs of any compensation awarded against a chief constable where a
non-police officer is at fault and the chief constable is found to
have liability for the actions performed.

Police Officers Bringing Civil Actions for Defamation
11.   There may be occasions when financial assistance is sought
from a police authority to enable an officer to bring or consider
bringing a civil action for defamation.          An authority has
discretion to give such assistance but it will be eligible for
police grant only if the following criteria are all met:-
     (a)    the defamation is serious;
     (b)     it relates to theactions of an officer acting      or
     said to be acting in the discharge of his duty;
     (c)   it has attracted public attention;
    (d)   to bring the action is considered to be in the
    interests of the force or of the police service as a
    whole; and                                                           W
     (e)    the action stands a reasonable chance of success.
Criterion   (d) is central. If     only the reputation of   the individual
officer is in question, he is in the same position as any other
citizen and must be expected to seek his own remedy.         But an
allegation against a particular officer may well reflect on the
reputation of the whole force or be an example of wider allegations
against the force or a significant section of it.     In such cases
the police authority, provided the other criteria are satisfied,
may reasonably be expected to help to defend the reputation of the
force.




                                                                     4
    INQUESTS, PUBLIC ENQUIRIES AND TRIBUN AL
    Legal Representation for Chief Officers

    12. Any interested arty may be legally represented at an _inquest
    but at his own expense since expenses are payable only to witnesses
    and jurors.   An interested party will normally be entitled to be
    legally represented at a public enquiry or other public tribunal.
    Where the interest of the force is affected, it will be appropriate
    for the police authority to provide at its expense for the chief
    officer to be legally represented on behalf of the force.

    Legal Representation for IndividualOfficers
    13. Separate representation for individual officers whose interest
    is involved may be necessary. For example, there will be occasions
    when (a) the chief officer's legal representative cannot reasonably
    be expected to represent the separate interests of such officers

•
    and (b) the police authority considers that such interests should
    be represented.   In such cases the authority should give financial

•
    assistance to the officers.        In considering (b) above, the
    authority will wish in particular to assess whether the officers
    are at risk of being held to blame for actions in connection with
    the death to which the inquest relates and whether any such finding
    might give rise to legal proceedings for the costs of which the
    police authority would be liable under section 48(1) of the Police
    Act 1964 or for which financial assistance might be appropriate
    within the terms of this circular.

    APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
    14.    An officer wishing to seek financial assistance from his
    police authority should have the opportunity in advance of as well
    as on the conclusion of the proceedings to submit to the chief
    officer an application for financial assistance. The chief officer
    should put this, together with his own recommendation to the police
    authority for decision.   The officer should normally be given the
    opportunity by the police authority to make representations to them
    if he wishes to do so.
    1 5 ,  if it decides to give financial assistance, the authority
    should inform the officer concerned that, if the information on
    which they based their decision to grant the assistance is shown in
    subsequent legal proceedings to be inaccurate or incomplete, the
    authority will normally expect to recover the money unless it is
    satisfied that no calpable misrepresentation was involved and that
    to recover the money would involve the applicant in substantial
    hardship.   On the other hand, if an authority refuses financial
    assistance and then discovers in the light of subsequent events
    that such assistance would have been warranted, then financial
    assistance should be granted in order to meet the reasonable costs
    incurred by the officer in seeking legal advice or assistance.


                                                                      5
      Assistance from Police Federation F u n d s

       16. Under Regulation 19 of the Police Federation Regulations 1969,
      as amended, Federation funds may be used to defray legal charges
      incurred by^ a member in w onnection with criminal proceedings
      brought against him for an offence under the road traffic
      enactments (other than offences involving driving when impaired by
      drink or drugs or taking a vehicle without authority), or for
      offences of pausing the death or injury of any person, or for any
      assault, or in connection with his action for libel or slander. An
      officer seeking financial assistance in circumstances covered by
      Regulation 19 should seek such assistance from the police authority
      in the first instance.   If the police authority does not consider
      the request to fall within the terms of this circular, the
      Federation may then consider the application within the terms of
      Regulation 19.   If the officer receives legal assistance from the
      Federation the terms of Home Office Circular No 26/1967 will
      continue to apply.

    FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    1.    Matter for Consideration

          The provision of financial assistance to police officers involved in
          legal proceedings arising from the event at Hillsborough Football Ground
          on 15 April 1989.


    2.     Background Information

    2.1    Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, published on 4 December 1987, provides
           guidance to Police Authorities on the exercise of their discretion in
           considering applications, on behalf of police officers, for financial
           assistance towards the cost of legal advice and representation arising
           from involvement in legal proceedings which result from the pursuance, in
           good faith, of their duties or where the interests of the Force as a
           whole are involved. A copy of the Circular is attached.

    2.2    Arising from the publication of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor
           into the Hillsborough Disaster, the subsequent appointment of the Chief
           Constable of the West Midlands Police to enquire into the justification
           for criminal proceedings arising from the disaster and the forthcoming
           Coroner's Inquest into the deaths, an application for assistance has been
           received from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield who was involved in
           command of the policing arrangements for the football Semi-Final and
           similar applications from other officers similarly involved might be



•
           anticipated.


    3.     Comment

    3.1     Following the disaster and throughout the public Inquiry the interests of
            the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and all officers of the Force
            have been represented by legal officers appointed by the Police Authority
          . insurers. The legal officers appointed by the insurers have indicated
            that in relation to criminal proceedings they would be unable to provide
            representation for individual officers who should seek independent legal
            advice and representation.

    3.2    It will be seen from the Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, that the
           central principle which should guide consideration of individual cases is
           that, where a Police Authority considers that an officer has acted in
           good faith in pursuance of his duties or that where the interests of the
           Force as a whole are involved, the officer should have the support of the
           Police Authority to ensure that he has the services of a lawyer and that
           he should not be out of pocket.


    3.3    It will be further seen that in respect of criminal proceedings pursued
           by the Crown Prosecution Service against an individual officer he should
           be expected to bear the costs of his own defence and the Police
                                     -   2   -




      Authority, at the conclusion of the proceedings, are able to consider, on
      the full facts, whether or not to reimburse any expenses incurred by the
      officer and not awarded by the trial court, even where proceedings have
      resulted in conviction in certain circumstances.   It will be noted from
      paragraph 14 of the Circular that an officer wishing to seek financial
      assistance should have the opportunity to submit to the Chief Officer an
      application for financial assistance, upon receipt of which the Chief
      Officer should refer the application to the Police Authority together
      with his own recommendation.   It will be further seen that the applying
      officer should normally be given the opportunity by the Police Authority
      to make representations to them if he wishes to do so. At this stage
      Chief Superintendent Duckenfield wishes to reserve the right to so appear
      at a future date if necessary.

3.4   The events at Hillsborough were unique in respect of the potential
      criminal liability of police officers involved. The officers were acting
      in good faith in accordance with well established practices and any
      criminal proceedings will largely constitute a test case similar to the
      example provided in paragraph three of the Home Office Circular.   The
      unique nature of the circumstances of this particular criminal enquiry
      with its wide implications for the interests of the Force as a whole is
      such that the Police Authority may wish to consider, at this stage, a
      commitment to the funding of independent legal advice for the officer(s)
      concerned.   The financial commitment of the officers is likely to
      commence with advice and representation prior to and during interviews
      undertaken by West Midlands Police officers in the course of their
      enquiry.   It would be prudent for that representation to continue
      throughout the enquiry and any subsequent criminal proceedings and to
      extend to representation at the Coroner's Inquest which will ultimately
      be held.

3.5   At this stage it is anticipated that representation in any civil actions
      subsequently pursued will be provided by the Police Authority insurers.

3.6   It should be noted that there is available, to all officers of
      superintendent and chief superintendent rank who have chosen to
      contribute, a measure of personal liability insurance arranged by the
      Superintendents' Association of England and Wales.  The individual
      liability limit of this insurance cover is £50,000.


4.    Financial Implications

      It is not possible at this stage to assess the financial implications of
      this matter which will depend entirely on the course and extent of the
      criminal enquiry and the ultimate outcome, and the duration of the
      Inquest proceedings.  There is no specific provision in the Revenue
      Budget for this expenditure.


5.    Recommendation

      The Committee is recommended to approve a commitment to provide financial
      assistance for legal representation to the officer(s) concerned in
      accordance with the central principle of Home Office Circular No.
      77/1987.

           of funding a f t e r Chief Superintendent Duckenfield has sought independent advice.
           I know you are in c o n ta c t with him, and when t h i s has been done perhaps we can
           have another word about the f u r t h e r st e p s t o be taken.

Dear Mr Walker

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - LEGAL REPRESENTATION

I r e f e r t o your l e t t e r dated 19 September 1989 regarding the funding of legal
expenses which may be incurred by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.                              I have
discu ssed the matter with Mr Duckenfield who, having p r ev io us ly been advised
by Mr Metcalfe of Hammond Suddards t h a t a p o s s i b i l i t y e x i s t s of p o t e n t i a l
c o n f l i c t of i n t e r e s t , remains of t h a t view and so, a p p a r e n t l y , does his
solicitor.         I t i s not p o s s i b l e however t o a n t i c i p a t e how and where c o n f l i c t
of i n t e r e s t might a r i s e u n t i l such time as the West Midlands i n v e s t i g a t i o n
pr og res ses to the poi nt where Mr Duckenfield, and perhaps other o f f i c e r s , are
interviewed and the nature of those interviews and t h e evidence so e l i c i t e d
becomes known. Mr Du ckenf ield's f i r s t a n t i c i p a t e d need for legal involvement
w i l l be a t t h e time of his own inte rv iew and i t would seem proper fo r any
advice o f f e r e d during t h a t interview t o be t o t a l l y independent of the Police
Aut hor ity legal a d v i s o r s .

On behalf of Mr Duckenfield can I apologise fo r not being able t o be more
h elp fu l a t t h i s s t a g e .

MEETING HELD AT 2.00 PM ON WEDNESDAY 18 OCTOBER 1989
AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS, SHEFFIELD


Present: P Hayes Esq QPM LLB MA, Deputy Chief Constable
         K S Anderson Esq, ACC (Staff Services)
         P C Metcalf - Hammond Suddards
         S Walker - South Yorkshire Joint Secretariat
         Chief Superintendent D Denton
         Superintendent N Bettison


1.   Legal representation for individual officers?

Mr.Denton read from** letter from MMI regarding legal representation for
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

It was concluded that MMI have not closed the door on individual
representation but are concerned that conflict might arise between the
Police Authority and individual officers.

Mr Metcalf said that MMI would be unlikely to accept the funding of legal
representation for more than a handful of officers.  His personal view was
that MMI may be happy to support one or two individuals. Mr Denton said
no prior indication of conflict can be obtained before the individuals are
questioned about these matters, although Duckenfield and Greenwood have
already intimated that they may allege conflict between their individual
defence and the position of other members of the South Yorkshire Police.

After discussion it was agreed that in the first instance all individual
parties were protected b.y their staff associations for legal cover up to
£50,000. That sum is sufficient to enable representation up to and
including any criminal charges being laid, thereafter MMI and the Police
Authority might be approached and asked for their decision on the
availability of funds to retain defence lawyers throughout a criminal
trial.

Mr Walker referred to claims he had received from federated members
seeking Police Authority financial support in their claims for damages,
for psychological distress alleged'against the club etc. He had responded
that such actions were not covered by the relevant Circular and therefore
could not    be supported by the Police Authority. He pointed out to the
meeting that claims of this nature if put before the Police Authority
might adversely affect the chances of individual officers subsequently
being supported at criminal trial.

2.   'Barrier Defence'/Expert Evidence

Mr Hayes said that he had spoken to Professor Usher about evidence he may
be able to give - e.g. concerning injuries sustained by the deceased - to
connect the failure of the barrier with the deaths in pen 3. Professor
Usher has   information about injuries but has no information as to location
of death.    ACC Mr Jones has been asked for this information and had
verbally refused.

After discussion it was agreed that Peter Metcalf on behalf of Hammond
Suddards will write to the Coroner, Dr Popper, to ask for information about
where deaths occurred.  (A copy of the letter will be sent for the
information of ACC Mr Jones).

Mr Metcalf said he was in touch with Mr David Phillips, Deputy Chief
Constable of Devon and Cornwall, who is being supplied with considerable
information about police planning and actions on the day and who has
agreed to give an opinion as an 'expert'.  If his comments are favourable
then he may be called as a witness on our behalf. Mr Phillips is co­
operating fully with this and this is greatly appreciated.

3.   South Yorkshire Police submission to pre-trial hearing on
     26 October 1989

Mr Metcalf reminded the meeting that Counsel, Mr Payne, had reviewed the
case and suggested that the South Yorkshire Police would, perhaps, attract
25% or more of liability in any civil case. Mr Payne's view therefore was
that we should admit those aspects of the claims to which we have no
defence on the basis that doing otherwise might be seen as weak,
indecisive, and flying in the face of Taylor. Mr Metcalf's view is that
it would not be as bad as Mr Payne suggests and by refusing to admit that
liability we have time to discuss with other parties with a view to a
negotiated settlement.

We could instead submit that we do not at this stage admit liability but
cannot be precise about which aspects are admitted/denied because of
difficulties as follows:-

     1.   difficulties with people being under criminal investigation
          who we may want to call as witnesses;

     2.   aforementioned difficulties of getting evidence for our case
          that is presently held by the West Midlands investigation
          team;

     3.   in any case we are required, officially, only to admit or
          deny the Taylor report into evidence.

There followed a discussion about deferring the civil case until after
completion of all criminal matters.

Mr Anderson pointed out that the morale of the Force depends upon non-
acceptance of liability.

The conclusion reached was that we cannot ask for a stay on Thursday week
but can raise at that stage the problem of a decided case, viz. R v. D P R
Futures Ltd., which found that a civil trial must not be progressed ahead
of any criminal proceedings, albeit preparatory matters may be progressed.

After some discussion about our position before the pre-trial review on
26 October it was agreed that we would put to Counsel, Mr Woodward, the
brief that he makes the best of a policy of non-admission of liability and
non-admission of the Taylor Report.  If, however, it is his view that this
is inadvisable then he may admit the document but reserve the right to
challenge certain parts of it.

Mr Hayes also called for Mr Woodward to take account of the fact that the
Chief Constable had on 4 August 1989 accepted the Taylor Report and its
findings. Mr Woodward must therefore find a form of words that do not
    *
                                          - 3 -

        contradict the Chief Constable's standpoint.  (It may be that the findings
        were accepted without complete agreement on every item of the report).

        At some stage, it was agreed, those aspects of our liability which are
        thought indefensible must be admitted.  Our preferred option is that the
        insurers can work in the background to secure a negotiated settlement
        without us having to face the question of precise liabilities.

        Even if we reached the stage of unilateral admission of liability which is
        an option it is not necessary to admit which aspects of the claim are
        admitted. Mr Hayes said that before this stage was reached the parties
        would all meet again with Counsel to decide a course of action.

        4-   Possible adverse publicity in the light of South Yorkshire Police
             refusal to admit liability on 26 October

        The meeting took note of Mr Payne's view that failure on 26 October to
        admit some liability would lead to critical comment and possibly adverse
        press publicity. Whilst this meeting considered that to be a possibility
^       it was thought Mr Payne's view was exaggerated.

        Mr Hayes asked Mr Metcalf for his advice on the response of the Force to
        such adverse publicity if it came to pass. Mr Metcalf suggested a form of
        words along the following lines:

             "The South Yorkshire Police are, in line with previous undertakings,
             working towards assisting in the early settlement of the claims
             arising from the Hillsborough disaster.  In so doing they have
             complied with all necessary directions in the case to date."

        Mr Metcalf offered to be available on Friday 27 October, the day after the
        hearing, to advise further if necessary.

Third paragraph, page one, should read as follows




      'Mr Metcalf said that MMI would be unlikely to accept the funding
      of legal representation for more than a handful of officers. His
      personal view was that MMI may be happy to support one or two
      individuals.  Mr Denton said no prior indication of conflict can be
      obtained before the individuals are questioned about these matters,
      although Duckenfield and Greenwood have raised the matter of
      potential conflict with their personal solicitors who agree with
      the view of Metcalf, ie, that there would be the possibility of
      conflict of interest between the individual officers and the
      position of the Police Authority should MMI (ie, Metcalf) represent
      all parties'.

           Dear Mr Middup

           RE : HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL TRAGEDY

           There wi ll be r e p r e s e n t a t i o n a t the Inquest along the l i n e s of t h a t afforded at
           the j u d i c i a l in q u i ry . On th e broader issue of independent legal r e p r e s e n t a t i o n
           which you r a i s e d in your l e t t e r , I understand t h a t sinc e the time of the inquiry
           and the i n te r i m r e p o r t of Lord J u s t i c e Taylor, the is su e of c o n f l i c t of i n t e r e s t
           has assumed much g r e a t e r s i g n i f i c a n c e .

           You may be aware t h a t t h e Aut hor ity has al re ad y considered an a p p l i c a t i o n under
           C i r c u l a r 77/87 from a member of the S u p e r i n te n d e n ts ’ As sociation and I believe
           the p o s i t i o n of t h a t o f f i c e r and members of the Federated Ranks r e f e r r e d to in
           your 1e t t e r are not d i s s i m i l a r . That o f f i c e r i s r e c e i v i n g 1egal support under
           the umbrella of the Associ ati on and, again, I assume t h a t members of the
           Federation are r e c e iv i n g the same kind of support.

           I t i s not p o s s i b l e a t t h i s j u n c t u r e to a n t i c i p a t e how and where c o n f l i c t of
           i n t e r e s t might a r i s e u n t i l such time as the West Midlands i n v e s t i g a t i o n
           p r o gr es se s t o the po in t where o f f i c e r s are interviewed and the natur e of those
           in te rv ie w s and evidence e l i c i t e d becomes known.

           As f a r as I am concerned, t h e prime requirement i s t h a t the o f f i c e r s rece iv e the
           a p p r o p r i a t e legal advice and as 1ong as they ar e, i t would not be my i n t e n t i o n
           to r e f e r t h e matter back t o the Pol ice Autho ri ty f o r f u r t h e r co n s id er at i o n un ti l
           such time as the are as of c o n f l i c t of i n t e r e s t which I have r e f e r r e d to are
           resolved.

           I f t h e p o s i t i o n as I have o u t l i n e d i t i s not t o your s a t i s f a c t i o n , perhaps you
           would be good enough to 1e t me know the areas which cause you concern and I will
           g l a d l y look int o them.

Dear Mr. Johnston,

Hillsborough Football Tragedy

Thank you        f o r your l e t t e r of 16 October 1989, regarding t h e claims which
are t o be       made by my members in r e s p e c t of t he Hillsborough t r age dy . Your
l e t t e r is   most he l p f u l in c l a r i f y i n g t h e p o s i t i o n as you see i t and indeed
t h e r e are    are as which I too should c l a r i f y .

 I thoroughly understand t h a t should t h e Chief Constable become enjoined in
any of t h e c i v i l a c t i o n s the n, of course, th e P o l i ce Aut hority could not be
expected t o indemnify our member's c o s t s . However, in t h e event t h a t t h e r e
is an i n q u e s t, I would hope t h a t t h e Pol ic e Authority would stand by our
o f f i c e r s and support them. There i s a l s o , of cou rse , t h e pr osp ect of
criminal proceedings being taken a g a i n s t my members as a r e s u l t of
i n v e s t i g a t i o n s which e i t h e r have taken place or are c u r r e n t l y taking
place in t o t h e i r a c t i o n s in connection with t h e i r d u t i e s a t t h e Hillsborough
t r ag ed y . Unquestionably, I would sugg es t, Home O ffi ce C i r c u l a r 77/87 wil l
apply t o t h o s e people and I have no doubt t h a t you w i l l recommend along
those l i n e s t o t h e Police Aut hor ity .



                                                                             Continued
Many thanks f o r your prompt r e p l y and f o r helpinq me t o r l a r i f v tho
p o s i t i o n . I look forward t o heading from y o u ^ i " S °tS e n el ? f u t u r e .

Dear Mr Middup

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL TRAGEDY

Thank you f o r your l e t t e r of 12 October regarding the claims to be i n s t i t u t e d by
your members a g a i n s t the S h e f f i e l d Wednesday Football Club and/or Health and
Sa f et y Executive. Before I c o n s i d e r whether t h i s i s an a p pr o pr ia t e matter to
put befo re the Police Au thor ity I would welcome your comments on the following.

The Home Of fice C i r c u l a r 77/87 does not envisage support by way of legal cos ts
in the type of c i v i l claim you are pursuing. I f I am c o r r e c t in t h i s
i n t e r p r e t a t i o n , any payments made t o your members would not be in accordance
with th e guidance and t h e r e f o r e not e l i g i b l e f o r p o l i c e g r a n t .

There i s al so another f a c t o r which would seek to d i f f e r e n t i a t e these actions
from t h e norm even i f they are covered by the C i r c u l a r . In the l i g h t of present
cases before the co u rt in connection with the t r age dy, i t may be a n t i c i p a t e d in
due course t h a t the Chief Constable wi ll be enjoined in the proceedings. This
will mean t h a t the Police Autho ri ty would be indemnifying the p l a i n t i f f and
Defendant/Third Party which seems to me t o be an untenable p o s i t i o n .
I look forward to r ec ei v in g your comments.

Yours s i n c e r e l y

Dear Sir

Hri-T.nBOROOGH DISASTER INQUEST

I write to acknowledge* your letter of 6 April 1990 and your subsequent
telephone conversation with Chief Superintendent Denton on 10 April regarding
your intended application, on behalf of apparently all federated ranks,
for financial assistance from the Police Authority in respect of your
attendance at the above Inquest.

You will Le aware of the intended nature of the Inquest proceedings da®.
t:.o commence on 18 April 1990. It is the stated intention of HM Coroner
 Lo adduce merely evidence of fact concerning the situation from which
.individual bodies were recovered, the identification of each and the results
of subsequent autopsies.    It is not intended that any South Yorkshire
Police officers be-called to give evidence or that the actions of officers
b*» called into question, such matters r e m i n i n g subject to an on-going
criminal and disciplinary enquiry being conducted by the West Midlands
Police.                                                         .

in the circumstances, whilst you may wish to be present to note the
proceedings, I would be unable to justify any recommendation to the Police
Authority that your presence, at their expense, is required in the interests
of your unnamed clientu.

Quite obviously there will come a time at some future resumption of the
inquest proceedings when police officers may well be required to give
evidence and your representative presence may be justified. It is at
that time, I feel,/that your application can properly be put bef6ro the
Police Authority.

Should you require confirmation of the intended course of the Inquest
proceedings, I would advise you to contact HM Coroner, Dr Popper.
Russell Jones 6 Walker              - 2 -                       11 April 1990



Meanwhile, I acknowledge your interest in seeking Police Authority funding
for your representation of officers in more 'open* proceedings in future.
I do however feel that the Police Authority* in considering an application,
would wish to exercise some judgment over the justification for such
representation on the basis of the degree of risk faced by an individual
officer.  It may well be that the Authority would need to know which specific
officers were to be represented rather than a blanket situation covering
all federated ranks.

Yours faithfully




Deputy Chief Constable

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - LEGAL REPRESENTATION

I refer to your letter dated' 6 April and my reply dated 11 April 1990
on the matter of your representation of melabers of the federated ranks
of this Force and the possibility of the South Yorkshire Police Authority
providing financial assistance under the provisions of Home Office Circular
No. 77/87. Your letter and my reply have been considered by the Police
Authority Legal Officer who accords with my previously stated view on
the generality of your request.

Paragraph 13 of the Home Office Circular places the onus of deciding whether
individual interest of police officers should be represented on the Police
Authority and suggests that, in those considerations, the Authority "...will
wish in particular t o assess whether the officers are a t risk of being
held to blame for actions in connection with the death to which the Inquest
relates and whether any such finding might give rise to legal proceedings
for the costs of which the Police Authority would be liable ... or for
which financial assistance might be appropriate within the terms of this
Circular...".

It can reasonably be assumed that at any resumption of the Inquests in
this case there would be a degree of awareness regarding which individual
officers might be regarded as "at risk", and that only a small number
would be so regarded. The Authority would therefore wish to assess the
risk in relation to individuals and would anticipate individual application
for assistance with sufficient supporting information to enable the Authority
tb make at proper assessment.

One element of that 'risk' will be whether or not the interests of the
individual conflict with those of the Chief Constable who will be
representing the Force in general.

It is the view of the Clerk to the Police Authority therefore that individual
applications need to be made and that such applications should support,
in detail, the anticipated risk to the individual.

Yours faithfully




Acting Chief Constable

Dear Bob

Paper for Police Authority Meeting 19 October 1990 re Financial
to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings

Please find attached a draft Police Authority paper in relation td applications
for financial assistance to six South Yorkshire Police officers diiTGotly^
involved in proceedings arising from the Hillsborough Disaster,  Yoi3—
may remember that a previous application, by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
only, was considered by the Police Authority at its F & GP meeting of
15 September 1989.  It was deferred. The six present applicants have
each subsequently obtained independent legal representation paid for
bv personal legal insurance in the case of the Superintendents and directly
from Police Federation funds in respect of the Constables.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield reports that his level of funding is
likely to be exhausted before or during the forthcoming Coroner's Inquest
and thus reapplies for financial assistance from the Police Authority.
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield does not make it absolutely clear what
proceedings he is seeking assistance for.              He mentions civil proceedings
and disciplinary matters as well as the Coroner's inquest.             (Other applicants,
such as Superintendent Murray, make similar broad requests).             My reading
of Horae Office Circular No 77/87 leads me to the conclusion that officers
who are other than parties to (see para 7) a civil proceeding are not
entitled to financial assistance and, certainly, the circular is silent
about d i s c i p l i n a r y proceedings. You will see (para 13), however, rhat
officers whose interest is involved at Coronal Inquests are entitled
to such assistance.             Indeed, the Circular introduces an imperative in
this regard for, at paragraph 13, it states that a Police Authority should
give financial assistance to officers who meet other criteria.

Would you please confirm that this is a proper reading of the Circular
and, on that basis, submit the relevant applicants for Police Authority
consideration.
In summary, the scope of these applications is for prospective financial
assistance to six officers whose interests are directly involved in the
forthcoming inquests into the Hillsborough deaths.

Yours sincerely




Deputy Chief Constable
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

19 OCTOBER 1990

REPORT BY THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


1.    Matter for Consideration

1.1   The provision of financial assistance to police officers involved in
      legal proceedings arising from the events at Hillsborough Football
      Ground on 15 April 1989.


2.    Background Information

2.1   Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, published     on 4 December 1987 and
       adopted by this Authority on 8 April 1988, provides guidance to Police
      Authorities in considering applications, on behalf of police officers,
       for financial assistance in legal proceedings.

2.2   The central principle which should guide consideration of individual
      cases is that, where a police authority considers that an officer has
      acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that the interests
      of the force as a whole are involved, the       officer should have the
      support of the police authority to ensure that he has the services
      of a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket.

2.3   After the publication of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor
      into the Hillsborough Disaster the Chief Constable of the West Midlands
      Police was appointed to enquire into the        possibility of criminal
      proceedings arising from the disaster.     At that time an application
      for   financial assistance was    received   from  Chief  Superintendent
      Duckenfield, the officer in command at Hillsborough on the day of the
      disaster.

2.4   At the time of that application it was acknowledged that similar
      applications for assistance, under the terms of Home Office Circular
      No.77/1987, could be anticipated from other officers directly involved
      in legal proceedings arising from the Hillsborough Disaster.

2.5   The application from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was considered
      by the Finance and General Purposes Committee on 15 September 1989
      when the matter was deferred for further consideration of the role
      of the Authority's insurers.

2.6   Following advice from the Authority's insurers and solicitors, Chief
      Superintendent Duckenfield obtained independent legal representation
      from solicitors engaged through his staff association and financed
      by his personal legal insurance.

2.7   The funds available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield under this
      policy amounted to £50,000.   His solicitors have advised him that that
      amount may be exhausted by one or both of the on-going Civil
      Contributions Hearing and the forthcoming Coroner's Inquest.
                                - 2 -


A further application has now been received from Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield for his original application to be re-considered and, as
anticipated,   similar  applications   have   now  been received from
Superintendents Marshall, Greenwood and Murray; and an application
has also been received from Russell Jones and Walker, solicitors, on
behalf of Police Constables Smith and Illingworth.

All officers making application have been the direct subject of
enquiries by the Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police arising
from allegations of criminal conduct received from third parties.


Comment

Following the disaster and throughout the Public Inquiry conducted
by Lord Justice Taylor, the interests of the Police Authority, the
Chief Constable and all officers of the Force were represented by legal
officers appointed by the Police Authority insurers.      In relation to
the subsequent criminal enquiry and possible proceedings the insurers
indicated to seven South Yorkshire Police officers that a possibility
of conflict could arise between the interests of the Force and each
of them independently.   The question of separate legal representation
was considered, one officer continued to be represented by the insurers
and the six applicants obtained independent representation.

Members will be aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions, having
considered the evidence resulting from the enquiry by the West Midlands
Police, announced on 30 August 1990 his decision that there was
insufficient evidence to justify criminal proceedings against any South
Yorkshire Police officer.    There are, however, certain civil actions
under-way and the Coroner's Inquest into the deaths at Hillsborough
will resume on 19 November 1990.

At the Coroner's Inquest the officers concerned are likely to be called
upon to give evidence.    It is acknowledged that cross examination by
Counsel representing other parties may be prejudicial to the individual
officers in respect of their personal liabilities.       These officers
consider it necessary to continue to be independently represented at
this hearing where the Chief Constable's legal representative cannot
reasonably be expected to represent the separate interests of each
of them.

It will be seen from paragraph 13 of the Home Office Circular that
separate representation should be provided at a Coroner's Inquest where
(a) the Chief Officers legal representative cannot reasonably be
expected to represent the interests of such officers and, (b) the Police
Authority considers that such interests should be represented.        In
such cases the authority should, in the terms of the Circular, provide
financial assistance to the individual officers concerned.

It will be noted at paragraph 14 of the Circular that an officer wishing
to seek financial assistance from his police authority should have
the opportunity in advance of the proceedings to submit to the Chief
Constable an application for financial assistance.   The Chief Constable
is obliged to put such application to the authority for decision.
It will be further seen that the applying officer should normally be
given the opportunity by the police authority to make representations
to them if he wishes to do so.
                                     - 3 -



3.6   The events at Hillsborough were extraordinary in respect of the
      potential  individual  liability  of police officers    involved.   The
      officers were acting in good faith in accordance with established
      practice. The nature of the various investigation into the Hillsborough
      Disaster also means that the interests of the South Yorkshire Police,
      as a whole, are involved.   For these two reasons (see para 2.2 ante)
      it is recommended that these officers should have the support of the
      Police Authority to ensure that they each have the services of a lawyer
      representing their individual interests, at the forthcoming Coroner's
      Inquest.

3.7   It would be sensible for the officers concerned to retain the services
      of those lawyers who currently represent them throughout subsequent
      proceedings.


4     Financial Implications

4.1   The cost of independent representation has to date been met by personal
      legal insurance arranged through The Superintendents' Association for
      Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendents Marshall, Murray,
      and Greenwood.   Constables Smith and Illingworth, meanwhile, have been
      represented by Messrs Russell    Jones and Walker, the Police Federation
      solicitor, paid for by central Police Federation funds.

4.2   The extent of future costs will be determined by thetime taken      to
       conclude the Inquest.   There is no specific provision in the Revenue
       Budget for these costs.


5     Recommendation

5.1   The Authority is recommended to approve a commitment to provide
      financial assistance    for legal representation at the forthcoming
      Inquest, to the officers concerned, in accordance with the principles
      of Home Office Circular No.77/1987.

    Dear Sir

    HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 77/87
                                                                          ^

   There is statutory authority in section 48 of the Police lust 1964 for
   payments to be made from the police fund to meet expenditure incurred -
   by police officers in defending proceedings in.tort# Also, acting in
   pursuance of its general atatutgg¥.A4uty to
   efficient police    force for its < Area, tha'fpollba authority
   discretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers in all Js£»t#ii§-c
   legal proceedings   where the offioari--hava acted in food faith in
   pursuance of their duties, or the interests of tha force as
   are involved.   The purpose of this circular is to give guidance to
/^police authorities to help them in considering requests on behalf of
^ ’officers for financial assistance. This guidance has been discussed
   and agreed with     the local authority and with the police staff
   associations.
                                                                                            .
w   2.    The central    principle which should guide consideration of
    individual cases is that, where a police authority considers that an
    officer has acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that
    the interests of a force as a whole are involved, the officer should
    have the support of the police authority to ensure that he has the
    services of a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket. The
    following paragraphs provide general guidance to the different
    classes of proceedings. Payments made to officers in accordance with
    this guidance will be eligible for police grant.
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS


3.   An officer who is the subject of a public prosecution for an
alleged offence committed while carrying out his duties as a police
officer is in the same position as any other defendant and must be
expected to bear the costs of his defence. If he is acquitted, he
should, like any other defendant, look to the court for
reimbursement of his expenses. If the costs are not paid, or not
paid in full from central funds, the police authority are in a
position to decide, on the full facts, whether or not to make a
payment to the officer or to the Police Federation if they have
provided the funding.   There may be cases where it is proper to
provide legal advice and/or legal representation even where the
officer is found guilty. This may arise for example in test cases
where the officer has been carrying out a practice hitherto
approved of but is found guilty as a result of that practice being
found unlawful by the court in the light of the circumstances of
that particular case.                                            ■



4. A police ©ffjle«sr should be agrifts to carry out his dutiair
confidence that*‘.-if.., ha acts I* good            and
judgement               hi* pelida^authorl           support hi
in a case where"a aaA$ar of tha public
an officer, the authority is satisfied that the officer has acted
in this way, the authority should provide or fund legal vadvice
and/or representation.                                   v ■
5.   Where "a court decides that a prosecution brought? agaSist an1
officer was not brought in good faith, it^JMgr order tha proiicntor
to pay tha whole or any part of tha eostsvlaeiirrod by tha-"diYatMaay

the police authority providing financial support to tha officer *ay
not arise.    However, where the costs of an acquitted officer are
not awarded by tha court or awarded only in part, the police
authority should consider whether to reimburse any costs not
covered, taking into account the reasons, if any, given by the
court for failing to award all costs claimed.

CIVII. SR0CSEDX1IG8
civil    Actions Against   the   Chief Officar   for Mrongfttl Acts of
fia n ttiM fti
6.   Under section 48(1) of the Police Act 1964, the chief officer
of a force is liable in respect of torts committed by constables
under his direction and control (which includes special constables
and officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutual aid arrangements)       in the performance or purported
performance of their functions. Under section 48(2) any damages or
costs awarded against the chief officer in such proceedings, any
costs he incurs himself, and any sun paid in connection with the
settlement of a claim, provided the settlement is approved by the
police authority, must be paid out of the police fund.      In such
cases, therefore, the police authority's discretion extends only to
whether or not to approve a proposed settlement of the claim.




7. Alternatively, the plaintiff may be awarded damages against an
individual police officer, though he cannot recover tha damages
twice over against the chief officer as well. Section 48(4) of the
Police Act 1964 specifically ampowers a police authority "to auch
extent as they think fit" to pay out of the police fund any damages
or costs awarded against an officar, any coats ha incurs himself,
and any aums paid in connection with tha aettlament of a claim.
This provision applies to actions against officara of the
authority's own force, officara of another force serving tha police
area under mutual aid arrangements, and apecial constables for tha
police area.   In considering whether t o .giva financial assistance
the authority will wish to consider in particular whether the
officer concerned acted in good faith and axarcisad his judgement
reasonably. Where the court finds for tha officar, ha may aaek his
costs from tha plaintiff; ahould th&*':eosts not ba awarded or
awarded only in part, the police mitliortty ahould consider r^ether,:.
to reimburse any costs not covered, ’talcing ’ into accouat^.Jdia"
reasons, if any, given by the court for failing to award all Seosts
claimed.
8.   Joint actions naming both tha chief officar and an individual
police officer may be brought in some cases. In such cases it is
important that any discussion of the merits and quantum of the
proposed settlement should involva all tha partiaa named in the
claim together with advisers avan if thay are rapraaantad by
different advisers.
                                                                M.



9.   under sections 22 and 23 of tha Data Protection Act "If84 an
individual who suffers damage as a result of tha ±naccuraey£-t£oss
or unauthorised      disclosure of personal -data ia entitled" to
compensation from the data uaer. In the absence of any case law on
these provisions, it is unclear whether the acta covered -by
sections 22 and     23 amount to torta, to which the        guidancein
paragraphs 6 and 7 above applies. If not, section 48 of the Police
Act 1964 does not apply. However, the position       is broadly the
same.    Under section 38(3) (a) of the 1984Act      conatables are
treated as servants of the chief officer for the purposes of the
Act.   A chief constable is therefore liable for the acta of his
officers falling within aections 22 and 23 in the aame way as ha is
liable for their   torts under section 48(1). The position of non­
police officers is less clear but it is possible that in some cases
the chief constable might be regarded as having liability for their
acts. It follows that it would be proper for the police authority
to meet all costs, including any award of compensation, arising
from this liability. It should be noted that the liability of the
"data user" under the Act is not vicarious but his personal
liability. Therefore his own care in having instituted a system of
obtaining, checking and racording data which would reasonably guard
against error and loss under section 23(3) of the Act should meet
his responsibility under section 22(3) and he should not be held
liable if one of his officers disregards the system established.
10.   Where compensation is sought from an individual officer, the
police authority will wish, in considering whether to asst the
costs which would otherwise fall on the officer, to take account of
the same matters as in exercising their power under section 48(4)
of the Police Act 1964 (see paragraph 7).        Police authorities
should apply the same broad principles and in particular, Beet the
costs of any compensation awarded against a chief constable where a
non-police officer is at fault and the chief constable is found to
have liability for the actions performed.



11.   There may be occasions when financial assistance is ./*
from a police authority to enable an officer to bring or
bringing a civil action for defamation.          An aut'
discretion to give such assistance but it will be elig
police grant only if the following criteria are all mets-
      (a)   the defamation is serious;
      (b)    it relates to the actions of an officer acting
      said to be acting in the discharge of his duty?               ■
      (c)   it has attracted public attention?                  /
      (d)   to bring the action is considered to be in the
      interests of the force or of the police service as a
      whole; and
      (e)   the action stands a reasonable chance of success.
Criterion (d) is central. If only the reputation of the individual
officer is in question, he is in the same position as any other
citizen and must be expected to seek his own remedy.         But an
allegation against a particular officer may well reflect on the
reputation of the whole force or be an example of wider allegations
against the force or a significant section of it.     Zn such cases
the police authority, provided the other criteria are satisfied,
may reasonably be expected to help to defend the reputation of the
force.
    INQUESTS, PUBLIC ENQUIRIES AMD TRIBUNAL


    12. Any interested arty nay be legally represented at an inquest
    but at his own expense since expenses are payable only to witnesses
    and jurors.   An interested party will normally be entitled to be
    legally represented at a public enquiry or other public tribunal.
    Where the interest of the force is affected, it will be appropriate
    for the police authority to provide at its expense for the chief
    officer to be legally represented on behalf of the force.



    13.       Separate representation for individual officers whose interest
    is involved nay be necessary. For exanple, there will be occasions
    when (a) the chief officer's legal representative cannot reasonably
    be expected to represent the separate interests of such officers
    and (b) the police authority considers that such interests should
    be represented. In such cases t h m authority should give -finafiglal
O   assistance to the officers.        In considering (b) above, tht
    authority will wish in particular to assess whether the officirs
    are at risk of being held to blame for actions in connection *ith
    the death to which the inquest relates and whether any such t iatf|af
    might give rise to legal proceedings for the costs
    police authority would be liable under section 48(1) of the
    Act 1964 or for which financial assistance might be appropi
    within the terns of this circular.

    A W M C A I I O I S FOR FINAMCZAL ASSXSTAHCS
    14.    m  officer wishing to seek financial assistance fretful*
    police authority should have the opportunity in advance of as wall
    as on the conclusion of the proceedings to submit to the chief
    officer an application for financial assistance. The chief officer
    should put this, together with his own recommendation to the police
    authority for decision.    The officer should noxmilly be given the
    opportunity by thci pollen authority to &&kt riprtMRtit 1ons to tbti
Q   if he wishes to do so.                                          .-
    15.    if it decider to give financial assistance, thm authority
    should inform the officer concerned that, if the information on
    which they based their decision to grant the assistance is shown in
    subsequent legal proceedings to be inaccurate or incomplete, the
    authority will normally expect to recover the money unless it i*
    satisfied that no cilpable misrepresentation was involved and that
    to recover the money would involve the applicant in substantial
    hardship.   On the other hand, if an authority refuses financial
    assistance and then discovers in the light of subsequent events
    that such assistance would have been warranted, then financial
    assistance should be granted in order to meet the reasonable costs
    incurred by the officer in seeking legal advice or assistance.


                                                                      5
16. Under Regulation 19 of the Police Federation Regulations 1969,
as amended, Federation funds may be used to defray legal charges
incurred by a member in v .onnection with criminal proceedings
brought against him     for an offence under     the road traffic
enactments (other than offences involving driving when impaired by
drink or drugs or taking a vehicle without authority), or for
offences of causing the death or injury of any person, or for any
assault, or in connection with his action for libel or slander. An
officer seeking financial assistance in circumstances covered by
Regulation 19 should seek such assistance from the police authority
in the first instance. If the police authority does not consider
the request to fall withinthe terms of          this circular, the
Federation may then consider the application within the terms of
Regulation 19.   If the officer receives legal assistance from the
Federation the terms of Home Office Circular No 26/1967 will
continue to apply.      *

    To:       The Chief Constable                               Date:           24 August 1989



              SUBJECT:      APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE


               The interim report of the Inquiry by the Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor into
               the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster that occurred on the 15 April 1989 was
               published at 1100 hours on Friday 4 August 1989. The report was very
               critical of the South Yorkshire Police in general and, in particular, myself
               and a number of other police officers.

               National media interest   and comments followed publication and, in view of
               the extensive criticism   in the report regarding my handling of events on
               the day of the disaster   and the possibility of actions of criminal
               negligence/disciplinary   proceedings, I was suspended from duty on the 4
               August 1989.

               The Director of Public Prosecutions was, I understand, requested      to examine
               Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and subsequently instructed      the West
               Midlands Police to carry out a full criminal investigation, 'not      limited
               to the criminal culpability of the police alone' into the events      that
               occurred at Hillsborough on the 15 April 1989.

               Whilst no criminal charges have been brought to date against me, the
               possibility of charges being brought exists and I will, no doubt, be
               interviewed by the West Midlands Police during the course of their criminal
               investigations. There is also a possibility of interviews in respect of
               disciplinary allegations made against me for which a Regulation 7 Notice
               has been served.

               I was authorised to obtain independent legal advice from Hammond Suddards
               resulting in being advised by them to obtain further private independent
               legal advice as Hammond Suddards could not assist me personally as no
               criminal charges had been m a de . I am now obtaining independent legal advice
               through a personal Legal Protection Insurance Policy.

               The policy gives a maximum cover of £50,000. If I need legal representation
               at interviews with the West Midlands Inquiry Team regarding possible
               criminal or disciplinary matters and at protracted inquest hearings, which
               are unlikely to take place until early 1990, then there is little doubt
               my legal costs will be very much in excess of this figure.

               If any criminal proceedings are brought against members of the South
               Yorkshire Police (and manslaughter charges are possible), it is imperative,
               in the interests of the force, the Police Authority and any individual
               officer, that those concerned have had the benefit of the best possible
               legal advice and representation at any forthcoming judicial hearings.

               Whilst the force has been, and continues to be, legally represented matters
               are very complex and conflict of interest can arise in areas concerning
               different individuals.




Gen/2
Attached is a copy of Home Office Circular No.77/1987 - 'Financial
Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings'. I draw your attention
to paragraphs 1, 2, 12 - 15 inclusive. In accordance with paragraph 13,
I therefore respectfully request that application be made to the Police
Authority for financial assistance in order that I am properly advised and
represented at any future criminal or disciplinary hearings.
As indicated at paragraph 2 of the circular, any payments made toofficers
in accordance with the guidance are eligible for police grant.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

1.     Matter for Consideration

       The provision of financial assistance to police officers involved In
       legal proceedings arising from the event at Hillsborough Football Ground
       on 15 April 1989.


2.     Background Information

2.1    Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, published on itgteceaber 1987, froviii*
       guidance to Police Authorities on the exercls* of their discretion In
       considering applications, on behalf of police-^officers» .fOf ''-financial
       assistance towards the cost of legal advice     "rapresantation arising
       fron involvement in legal proceedings which result 'fftom the pursti
       good faith, of their duties or where the Interests Of the Force
       whole, "ara involved. A m m of the Circular is attached.

2.2    Arising from the publication of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Tay
       into the Hillsborough Disaster, the subsequent appointment of the Chief
       Constable of the Vest Midlands Police to enquire into the justification
       for criminal proceedings arising from the disaster and the forthcoming
       Coroner’s Inquest into the deaths, an application for assistance has been
       received from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield who was involved in -:
       command of the policing arrangements for the football Semi-Final i«(i
       similar applications from other officers similarly involved might bit
       anticipated.                        '          '~


3. - Comment

3 .1   Following the disaster and throughout the Public Inquiry the interests of
       the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and all officers of the Force
       have been represented by legal officers appointed by the Police Authority
       insurers. The legal officers appointed by the insurers have indicated
       that in relation to criminal proceedings they would be unable to provide
       representation for individual officers who should seek independent legal
       advice and representation.

3.2    It will be seen from the Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, that the
       central principle which should guide consideration of individual cases is
       that, where a Police Authority considers that an officer has acted in
       good faith in pursuance of his duties or that where the interests of the
       Force as a whole are involved, the officer should have the support of the
       Police Authority to ensure that he has the services of a lawyer and that
       he should not be out of pocket.


3.3    It will be further seen that in respect of criminal proceedings pursued
       by the Crown Prosecution Service against an individual officer he should
       be expected to bear the costs of his own defence and the Police
         Authority, at the conclusion of the proceedings, are able to consider, on
         the full fact8 » whether or not to reinburse any expenses incurred toy the
         officer and not awarded by the trial court, even where proceedings have
         resulted in conviction in certain circumstances. It will be noted from
         paragraph 14 of the Circular that an officer wishing to seek financial
         assistance should have the opportunity to submit to the Chief Officer an
         application for financial assistance, upon receipt of which the Chief
         Officer should refer the application to the Police Authority together
         with his own recommendation. It will be further seen that the applying
         officer should normally be given the opportunity by the Police Authority
         to make representations to them if he wishes to do so. At this stage
         Chief Superintendent Duckenfield wishes to reserve the right to so appear
          at a future date if necessary.

3    4   The events at Hillsborough were unique in respect of the potential
         criminal liability of police officers involved. The officers were acting
         in good faith in accordance with well established practices and any
         criminal proceedings will largely constitute a test case similar to th®
         example provided in paragraph three of the Home Office Circular. llgt.

    4,    Financial Implications

          It is not possible at this stage to assess the financial implications of
          this matter which will depend entirely on the course and extent of the
          criminal enquiry and the ultimate outcome, and the duration of the
          Inquest proceedings. There is no specific provision in the Revenue
          Budget for this expenditure.


    5.    Recommendation

          The Committee is recommended to approve a commitment to provide financial
          assistance for legal representation to the officer(s) concerned in
          accordance with the central principle of Home Office Circular No.

 Dear David

 Hillsborough

 As you are aware, we are obtaining Counsel's Advice as to your personal
 position in relation to the forthcoming civil hearing in Manchester
 commencing on 2nd October and the Coroner's Inquests which are due to
 resume on 19th November 1990.

 In addition to representing your interests at the above, your position
 will also need consideration and yourself possible representation at the
 disciplinary hearing, as and when this commences.

 Finally,   there is,   of course,   the spectre                                              of        a      possible              private
 prosecution which may arise at some stage.

 It seems likely that the present funds available under the Allianz
 Personal Law Plan may well be exhausted by one or both of the Civil and
 Coroner's hearings. Can we impress upon you, therefore, that you make the
 strongest representations both to the Home Office and to the Chief
 Superintendent's Association to ascertain the availability of funds to
 assist you with legal representation. This must be carried out as a
 matter o f priority /for you, based on the time scale for the various
 hearings.

Dear S i r ,

We have been n o t i f i e d by Her M a je s ty 's Coroner of h is i n t e n t io n t o resume the
In q u ests in the deaths of t h e 95 people on th e 15 April 1989 a t Hillsborough
Stadium, which Inquests are t o resume on t h e 19 November 1990.

We would r e f e r to previous correspondence and, in p a r t i c u l a r , t o our l e t t e r of
t h e 6 April 1990, addressed t o t h e Chief Constable, and to your response of th e
11 April 1990. We would ta k e t h i s o p p o rtu n ity t o r e p e a t our r e q u e s t f o r f i n a n c i a l

pu rsu an t t o the p rov ision s of t h e Home O ffic e C i r c u l a r No 77/87.

 I t i s our i n te n tio n t o provide r e p r e s e n t a t i o n by Counsel on b e h a lf of two
p o l i c e constables in p a r t i c u l a r , P o lic e Constable David Alfred Illin g w o r th and
P o lic e Constable P e te r Edward Smith. I t i s our firm view t h a t t h e s e o f f i c e r s

or Counsel on behalf of r e l a t i v e s of th e deceased, which may be p r e j u d i c i a l to
t h e o f f i c e r s . There a ls o remains t h e t h r e a t of d i s c i p l i n a r y proceedings,
a r i s i n g out of the i n v e s t i g a t i o n by West Midlands P o lic e . Again, as long as

    From:    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield               Station/Dept:
    To:      The Chief Constable                            Date:           21 September 1990



            SUBJECT:   Hillsborough Disaster - Funding for Legal Representation

            On 24 August 1989 I made application under Home Office Circular
            No 77/87 for yourself and the Police Authority to give due
            consideration for funds to be made available for my legal
            representation in connection with any proceedings which may arise
            from the Hillsborough Disaster.

            These proceedings are currently the Civil Hearings due to begin in
            Manchester on 2 October to be followed by the Coroner’s Inquest on
            19 November 1990. There is also the possibility that Discipline
            Proceedings may follow at a later stage.

            Whilst the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect
            of Criminal Matters has been favourable it is not unreasonable to
            assume that if further evidence came to light he would reconsider
            the position with regard to myself and other officers.

            There is also the stated intention, admittedly via the media, by
            families of the deceased that they intend to launch a private
            prosecution for manslaughter against officers of South Yorkshire
            Police.

            It is therefore of paramount importance that the best independent
            legal advice possible is available for myself and other officers.

            My previous application for financial assistance was, as I understand
            it, ’left on the table’ in the knowledge that I had insurance cover
            for my legal defence up to the sum of £50,000.

            If I require legal representation at the Civil Hearings and Coroner’s
            Inquest it is likely that my defence costs will exceed the sum assured
            and I will require additional funding (bearing in mind Discipline
            and Private Prosecution).

            I ask for urgent reconsideration of my request in the hope that a
            contribution could be made towards my legal defence costs or an
            agreement to meet all reasonable expenditure over and above the sum
            assured.

            I have attached a letter from my solicitor and copies of previous
            papers.

           Sir

           Through my solicitor, Mr Vincent Hale, of Nash House, 140 Upperthorpe,
           Sheffield, I have received intimation of the resumed inquests into the
           deaths at Hillsborough.    I shall be required to give evidence at this
           inquest which resumes on 19 November 1990.

           You will perhaps be aware that Ihave been represented throughout the West
           Midlands Police enquiry into thedisaster by Mr Hale and that his costs to
           date are subject of a claim upon private insurance effected by myself
           through my membership of the Superintendents Association.       Mr Hale has
           submitted an interim account upon the insurers, which has not yet been met.
           I wi§hOtherefore, to make formal application under the terms of the Home
           Offite j/ir^ular 77/87 to the South Yorkshire Police Authority for financial
                        towards Mr. Vincent Hale's costsin connection with his

            SUBJECT:     FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR LEGAL REPRESENTATION




            I attach all previous papers together with correspondence recently
            received from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Russell Jones and
            Walker on behalf of Constables Smith and Illingworth.  Also attached
            is a request for financial assistance from Superintendent Marshall
            and you can reasonably assume that both Superintendents Greenwood
            and Murray, who are on leave, will also wish to be conjoined in any
            application to the Police Authority.

             I have attached a first rough draft of a proposed Police Authority
             agenda paper for your consideration.  You may feel that the need for
             continued independent representation could be better argued although
             I feel that the simpler the description of the circumstances the
             better.

             Stephen Walker will be concerned to see a copy of the final draft
             and will wish to discuss with you the method of approach to the Police
             Authority.   I am sure he will wish to persuade you that from now on
             the interests of all can be undertaken by Peter Metcalf.

             This interim submission relates of course to expenses incurred (known)
             for representation during the criminal enquiry, and to a promise for
             the future in relation to subsequent expense incurred during the
             Inquest and any civil proceedings.     At least, on this occasion the
             Authority can agree to fund in advance.

             You may feel that the accrued bill to date for each individual should
             be disclosed in order that the Authority can know what they are being
             asked to pay for the criminal enquiry representation.        This is
             currently unknown to me and will need to be obtained and included
             in the 'Financial Implications'.

             On the last paper for Chief Superintendent Duckenfield the existence
             of personal insurance was mentioned.   Do you feel that should be
             repeated?




             Chief Superintendent
             (Management Services)



             PS:   Depending upon the decision on submission to the Authority the
                   letter   from Russell  Jones  and Walker    will  need  to  be
                   acknowledged.

    From :     Superintendent Murray                          Station / Dept:Rawmarsh
    To         Deputy Chief Constable                         Data:    1 October 1990


             SUBJECT:         application for financial assistance




               In connection with the Hillsborough tragedy of 1989 and allegations
               made against me, I have been taking legal advice from Walker, Morris,
               Scott and Turnbull, Solicitors of Leeds, and in particular Mr Richard
               Manning of that company.      The finance for this advice has been
               available through my own private insurance.    Although the Director of
               Public Prosecutions has stated that proceedings will not be taken
               against any Police officer, there are still many matters unsettled and
               I may still require significant legal advice and assistance.

               I have been informed that the Coroners Inquest is to start on 19
               November 1990, and that this will be a lengthy enquiry and it is
               probable that my legal costs will exceed the limit of my Insurance,
               particularly if other matters follow the Inquest, e.g. criminal or
               disciplinary proceedings.

               Accordingly under Home Office circular No. 77 of 1987, I ask that an
               approach be made to the Police Authority to give consideration to
               making funds available for my Legal Representation in connection with
               the forthcoming Inquest, civil hearing and any criminal proceedings
               which may arise, which wDuld allow me to maintain the services of Mr.
               Manning, who with his existing knowledge of my particular
               circumstances, I feel is the best person to represent myself.

         REQUEST FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR LEGAL SUPPORT
         RE. HILLSBOROUGH

         I refer to our nesting on Monday.

         You will recall that when I handed r.o you the draft Police
        .'Authority sniper artd original reports from the officers making
         requests for financial assistance as above, one such request
                               Roger Greenwood was not available.

         His request has now been received and I shall                            be pleased if
         you will attach it to the background papers.

      Dear

       FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      Your r e c e n t l e t t e r t o Bob has been passed t o me f o r c o n s i d e r a t i o n . I
      a cc ep t , t h e r e i s a p o t e n t i a l c o n f l i c t of i n t e r e s t between a t l e a s t some of
      t he o f f i c e r s which would n e c e s s i t a t e s e p a r a t e l eg al r e p r e s e n t a t i o n .
      However, you wi ll r e c a l l th e i n s u r e r s re served t h e i r p o s i t i o n when we
      o r i g i n a l l y r a i s e d with them the i ss ue o f legal r e p r e s e n t a t i o n and I have
      w r i t t e n t o c l a r i f y t h e i r p r e s e n t t h in ki n g on t h i s i s s u e . I have no doubt
      t he Auth or ity would wish t h i s t o be s e t t l e d before they co n si d er d i r e c t
      reimbursement o f legal expenses.

      Having considered the papers I am of the view t h a t th e a p p l i c a t i o n s by the
      o f f i c e r s should be regarded as a p p l i c a t i o n s f o r c o s t s over and above the
      level o f t h e i r own insur anc e. I r e a d i l y accept in saying t h i s t h a t the
      Federated ranks have t o be t r e a t e d d i f f e r e n t l y .

      In t he second paragraph o f your l e t t e r you mention th e imperative in
      paragraph 13 o f the Home C i r c u l a r and I t h i n k a few words on t h i s are
      a p p r o p r i a t e . I t i s o f course d i f f i c u l t t o as ses s whether the o f f i c e r s are
      a t r i s k a t th e i n qu es ts of being held t o blame f o r t h e i r a c t i o n s . The
      D i r e c t o r of Public Prosecutions has alr ead y made h is d ec is io n and unless
      f r e s h evidence emerges a t th e inquests in the normal way of t h i n g s , i t would
      be d i f f i c u l t t o envisage blame a t t a c h i n g which would lead t o criminal
      proceedings. In saying t h i s , I th i n k i t re asonable to assume t h e r e wi ll be
      no f u r t h e r c i v i l proceedings, the co s ts of which th e Po lice Auth or ity would
      be l i a b l e f o r under Section 48 (1) of the Police Act 1964. I say in the
      usual way of t h i n g s because th e r e has alr ead y been some t a l k o f p r i v a t e
      pr o se cu ti o ns and I am a c u t e l y aware o f the r e c e n t i nq ues ts i n t o the Clapham
      Rail D i s a s t e r where the j u r y brought in a v e r d i c t o f unlawful k i l l i n g
      d e s p i t e the f a c t t h a t the DPP had p r ev io u sl y i n d i c a t e d no-one would be the
      s u b j e c t of criminal proceedings.
  I t i s t h e r e f o r e perhaps not an easy m at te r t o a s se s s r i s k but in the s p i r i t
  o f th e C i r c u l a r t h i s co n s i d e ra b le u n c e r t a i n t y probably provides q u i t e a
  stro ng argument t h a t t he Police Autho ri ty should support the o f f i c e r s .

  The only f u r t h e r concern I have i s the e x t e n t o f the c o s t s i f the Authority
  agrees t o reimburse. I th i n k i t would be a p p r o p r i a t e i f you were t o find
  out what level o f r e p r e s e n t a t i o n i s envisaged, will i t be by Counsel,
  L ead er/ Ju ni or or simply by a s o l i c i t o r alone and how long would t h a t
  r e p r e s e n t a t i o n continue f o r ; in t h i s regard I am mindful of the f a c t t h a t i t
  has been es tim a te d t h e inqu es t may take as long as t h r e e months and t o have
  counsel or even a s o l i c i t o r s i t t i n g a t the in qu es ts f o r th e whole o f t h a t
  time would amount t o a very l a r g e b i l l .

  Taking account o f th e s e r e s e r v a t i o n s I agree t h a t in general your reading of
  th e C i r c u l a r i s a cc ur at e and t h e r e f o r e the r e p o r t which accompanied your
  l e t t e r can be submitted to the Po lice Auth or ity f o r c o n s i d e r a ti o n a t i t s
  next meeting on the 19 October

Dear Mr Hayes,

I am replying to your letter of the 10th

I have discussed the matter with ray

he has forwarded a written reply for your

application is considered

Dear David

Hillsborough - Coroner's Inquests

Thank you for sending me a copy of the letter from the Deputy Chief
Constable enquiring as to representation at the forthcoming resumed
Inquests.

I have spoken with our Counsel, Paul Isaacs, and we are agreed that you
ought properly to be represented by a combination of Junior Counsel and
Solicitor for the entire duration of the forthcoming Inquests.

As you are only too well aware, there remains outstanding the question of
the discipline notices and also the chance of a possible private
prosecution. Certain representatives of the Hillsborough Action Group
have made clear their displeasure at the result of both the present
decision of the DPP not to commence any criminal proceedings and further,
the undisclosed settlement between the parties in the civil action in
Manchester.   It is quite likely,      therefore,   that these or other
individuals, may seek to exploit the opportunity presented by the resumed
Inquests, which may have possible implications for your own position.
Further, as you know, Mr L Sharp, as the investigating officer, made it
clear to us that "any new or additional evidence which comes to light,
for example, that which may arise out of the civil actions, or in the
Coroner-'s Inquests,  would have to be sent to the DPP for further
consideration of the criminal matters."

It is for these reasons, that our advice, together with that of Counsel,
is that you should have the facility to be represented throughout the
Inquests.

Both Counsel and myself do not envisage that either Counsel or Solicitor
would be in attendance on every day throughout the hearing.   We may deem
it reasonable not to attend on days when the evidence to be given is
unlikely to have any direct bearing on your personal position.   Equally,
it may be that on certain days it will be necessary for both Counsel and
Solicitor to be in attendance, depending on how we assess the situation.

CONTINUATION


     I trust the Deputy Chief Constable will appreciate that at the present
     time,  we are not aware of which witnesses or evidence the Coroner
     proposes to call, and until such time as this has been made clear to us,
     I cannot be anymore definite as to the time that we need to be in Court.

     As a final point, both Counsel and myself consider it would be in your
     best interests for this representation to be available to you even if you
     are not to be called personally to give evidence, as the potential for
     prejudicial evidence to be given which could effect your position
     remains, irrespective of whether or not you give oral evidence.

                                                    any points, then would they please

       Dear Mr. Hayes

       Thank you for your letter of the 10 October 1990.

       In respect of my application for financial
       support at the forthcoming inquest proceeding, I
       have been advised by my solicitor that the
       envisaged level of representation is by Junior
       Counsel and that it is intended that my represen­
       tative would be at the hearing each day.

       Yours sincerely

            SUBJECT:                     APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT


            I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 10 October 1990 relative to my
            application for financial support in connection with the forthcoming
            Inquest.

            I have been in contact with my solicitor, Mr Manning, by telephone and
            he has advised that he would see me represented by Single Counsel,
            supported by himself as solicitor.

            He would see Counsel being in attendance at the commencement of the
            Inquest and maintaining a permanent presence as long as necessary, which
            may well be to the conclusion. He, as solicitor, would attend only on
            those days when he considered it relevant. He feels that he is unable
            to estimate the length of the Inquest due to the final list of witnesses
            not yet having been fixed.

            On days when it is obvious that any evidence given would not be relevant
            to my particular circumstances, e.g. when evidence is confined to the
            relatives of deceased persons, he would not see either himself or Counsel
            attending.

            He has said that he will forward me a copy of his advice in writing and
            if this is received prior to 19 October 1990 I will forward a copy for
            your attention.

   17th October 1990

  Superintendent B. Mur r a y ,




  Dear Superintendent Murray,

  Thank you for your letter of the 12th with enclosure. Insofar as
  it may be necessary, may I support your application to the Police
  Authority to provide funds for your legal representation in relation
  to the forthcoming Inquest and any possible proceedings that may
  follow.

  First, whilst we appreciate the confidence indicated in our Mr.
  Manning, from an objective point of view it would be difficult,
  if not almost impossible, for any person to come into this case
  at such a late stage, and without very full previous knowledge,
  and second it would add considerably to the overall cost in any
  new person seeking to come into this case now.  Aside from costs,
  it would in our view be to your possible detriment for Solicitors
  to be changed at this stage.

  A question may be raised about whether it is necessary for you
  to be separately represented.     There are clearly different roles
  adopted by the different Officers, and we can quite clearly      see
  in terms of areas    of responsibility alone, how we would  turn to
  others in certain    respects and understand why some may   look at
  you. There is a clear conflict and it would be impossible for one
  Solicitor to represent more than one person in our view.

 Lastly, as to the request itself, it does seem to us that the Authority
 ought to be prepared to accept responsibility to ensure that Senior
 Officers who have provided many years of loyal service, and who
 now find themselves in a most grave situation, arising during the
 course of service,       should  have the necessary legal assistance.
 One bears in mind that the burden has thus far been taken up from
 private Insurers, and that to an extent the Police Authority are
 only now being asked to stand alongside the Insurers, and indeed
 so far as you ar/e\ concerned, there is quite a lot of cover left
 under the terms <o i l our own Private Insurance Policy

 Yours faithfully

       Dear Sirs

       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - INQUEST

       I refer to your letter of 19 September in which you ask that
       the Police Authority be requested to make available financial
       assistance for legal representation at the forthcoming inquest
       proceedings for both Constable David Alfred Illingworth and

       Once the outcome of the deliberations is known I will contact
       you again.

       If I can be of any further assistance simply ask» and in view
       of the time-scale I will be happy to discuss these issues with
       you by telephone if it seems expedient to do so.

       Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs

I refer to my letter of 10 October 1990, concerning the request
to the Police Authority for financial assistance to provide legal
support  at   the  forthcoming  Inquest   proceedings  for Police
Constables David Alfred Illingworth and Peter Edward Smith,

In view of the time-scale and to avoid, if possible, the Police
Authority deferring the application for additional information/
I am asked by the Secretariat's solicitor to discover from you
v/hat level of representation is envisaged - will it be Counsel,
Leader/Junior or Solicitor alone, and for how long would such
representation continue.   If we assume the Inquest may take three
months, would it be your intention that your representative(s )
would be at the hearing each day or for a lesser period?

As indicated in my letter of the 10th, the Police Authority
meeting is on 13 October and if I am able to answer questions
raised by members it will be helpful to everyone, so X would
appreciate an early reply please.

Yours faithfully

I wrote to you on 21 September 1990, to inform you of the contributions
hearing to be held at Manchester which was to begin on 2 October 1990.
You were put on notice that the evidence which you could give might be
relevant to the contributions hearing.

 I wrote subsequently to inform you that Hammond Suddards, the solicitors
 representing South Yorkshire Police, would not be calling for you to
 give evidence in person but that other parties might seek to do so.

You will now be aware that an out of court settlement has been reached
with the other parties to the proceedings and the contributions hearing
has folded prematurely.    You will not therefore be required to give
evidence and any earlier warning is hereby removed.

 I turn now to your application for financial support at the forthcoming
 inquest proceeding.   In view of the time~scale and to avoid, if possible,
 the   Police   Authority   deferring   your  application   for   additional

       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - APPLICATION BY POLICE OFFICERS FOR
       REPRESENTATION AT INQUESTS

       When we spoke l a s t week about t h i s , I had w r i t t e n to MMI I n su r er s to
       e s t a b l i s h whether they would fund the in di vidual r e p r e s e n t a t i o n o f the
       o f f i c e r s a t the in q u e s ts under the Police A u t h o r i t y ’ s p o l i c y . You will
       r e c a l l when we di sc us se d t h i s you were going t o e s t a b l i s h the e x t e n t to
       which those o f f i c e r s who were re p re s en t ed by the S u p e r in te n d e n t ’ s
       As soc iat ion had in cu rre d c o s ts under the A s s o c i a t i o n ’ s po li cy o f insurance
       so t h a t t h i s information could be provided to the Police Auth or ity next
       Friday.           Youwere a ls o to f in d out what level and e x t e n t of r e p r e s e n t a t i o n
       was r e q u i re d f o r the i n q u e s ts .

       The MMIInsurance Company r e p l i e d i n d i c a t i n g they are not convinced t h a t the
       po li cy ought t o address t h i s p a r t i c u l a r problem, although they s t i l l remain
       open to argument. To enable them to co n si d er the m at te r f u r t h e r they have
       asked what i s involved f o r each o f the o f f i c e r s we have i d e n t i f i e d and to
       give them some i n d i c a t i o n of the p r o t e c t i o n t h a t i s a v a i l a b l e from the
       S u p e r in te n d e n t ’ s A s so ci at io n : they have al so asked what p r o t e c t i o n i s
       afford ed by the Federation but as I alr ead y know, the answer to t h i s is
       none.

       I would hope the que st ion o f indem ni fic ati on under the Police A u t h o r i t y ’ s
       insurance p o l i c y can be resolved before the meeting on Friday, t h e r e f o r e can

REPORT BY THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


1.        Matter for Consideration

1.1       The provision of financial assistance to police officers involved i
          legal proceedings arising from the events at Hillsborough Football
          Ground on 15 April 1989.


2.        Background Information

2     1    Home Office   Circular No. 77/1987, published on 4 December 1987 and
          adopted by this Authority on 8 April 1988, provides guidance to Police
          Authorities in considering applications, on behalf of police officers,
          for financial assistance in legal proceedings.

2.2       The central principle which should guide consideration of individual
          cases is that, where a police authority considers that an officer has
          acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that   the interests
          of the force as a whole are involved, the officer should      have the
          support of the police   authority to ensure that he has   the services
          of a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket.

 2 3      After the publication of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor
          into the Hillsborough Disaster the Chief Constable of the West Midlands
          Police was      appointed to enquire into    the possibility of    criminal
          proceedings     arising from the disaster.    At that time ,an application
          for   financial   assistance  was   received   from   Chief  Superintendent
          Duckenfield, the officer in command at Hillsborough on the day of the
          disaster.

 2 4      At the time of that application it was acknowledged that similar
          applications for assistance, under the t.r». o£ Home Office Circuiar
          No.77/1987, could be anticipated from other officers directly involved
          in legal proceedings arising from the Hillsborough Disaster.

 2.5 The application from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was considered
      by the Finance and General Purposes Committee on 15 September 1989
      when the matter was deferred for further consideration of the role
           of the Authority's insurers.

    2 6    Following advice from the Authority's insurers and solicitors, Chief
           Superintendent Duckenfield obtained independent legal reP*eS*nt* ^ ° "
           from solicitors engaged through his staff association and financed
           by his personal legal insurance.

    2.7 The funds available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield under this
         policy amounted to £50,000.   His solicitors have advised him that that
         amount may be exhausted     by one or both of the pnrgoing__Civil
         rretributions Hearing and the forthcoming Coroner's Inquest.  J

                     Constable and all officers of the Force were represented by legal

            the subsequent criminal enquiry and possible proceedings the insurers
            of'   con?l-aV*         S°Uth Yorkshire Police officers that a possibility
            of    conflict could arise between the interests of the Force and each
            of    them independently.    The question of separate legal representation
            was    considered, one officer continued to be represented by the insurers
            and    the six applicants obtained independent representation.

3.6   The eventsat Hillsborough were extraordinary in respect         of the
      potential  individual  liability of police officers involved.       The
      officers were acting in good faith in accordance with established
      practice. The nature of the various investigation into the Hillsborough
      Disaster also means that the interests of the South Yorkshire Police,
      as a whole, are involved.    For these two reasons (see para 2.2 ante)
      it is recommended that these officers should have the support of the
      Police Authority to ensure that they each have the services of a lawyer
      representing their individual interests, at the forthcoming Coroner's
      Inquest.

3.7   It would be sensible for the officers concerned to retain the services
      of those lawyers who currently represent them throughout subsequent
      proceedings.


4     Financial Implications

4.1   The cost of independent representation has to date been met by personal
      legal insurance arranged through TheSuperintendents' Association for
      Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendents Marshall, Murray,
      and Greenwood.   Constables Smith and Illingworth, meanwhile, have been
      represented by Messrs Russell Jones and Walker, the Police Federation
      solicitor, paid for by central Police Federation funds.

4.2   The extent of future costs will be determined by the time taken to
       conclude the Inquest.   There is no specific provision in the Revenue
       Budget for these costs.


5     Recommendation

5.1   The Authority   is recommended to approve a commitment to provide
      financial  assistance   for  legal representation at the forthcoming
      Inquest, to the officers concerned, in accordance with the principles
      of Home Office Circular No.77/1987.

NOTE FOR FILE:


HILLSBOROUGH - LEGAL REPRESENTATION COSTS


Meeting held at Police Headquarters this date with Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield, Superintendents Greenwood, Marshall and Murray and Constable
Illingworth, to discuss the above. Constable Smith sent his apologies.

At the conclusion of the meeting      it was agreed that in terms of making a
personal representation to the 2     November Police Authority special meeting
the probability is that none of      the officers would wish to do this but,
having taken legal advice, if this   changes I will be informed.

The four officers (three supts and chief supt) agreed they will be present
at Force Headquarters (Conference Room) that day so as to be available to
answer questions directly or indirectly if I find myself in difficulty.

In terms of insurance cover, it was agreed I would emphasise all have been
self-supporting  so   far  in   relation  to   the criminal/discipline/civil
proceedings - and after the Inquest may require further legal advice or
representation not least in terms of the anticipated discipline matters
- and in these circumstances it may be appropriate for the Authority to
consider support outside the insurance provision.




Deputy Chief Constable
               SPECIAL POLICE AUTHORITY MEETING - 2 NOVEMBER 1990


Introduction

This meeting is considering an application from six officers (a chief
superintendent, three superintendents and two constables) for financial
support to provide them with legal representation at the forthcoming Inquest
Hearing into the Hillsborough tragedy.

They have all been investigated by the West Midlands Police, acting for
the Director of Public Prosecutions, in relation to the question of criminal
liability.   The Director    has  announced  that  at this    time there  is
insufficient evidence on which to bring criminal proceedings.

All the officers continue to see themselves to be at considerable risk and
consider independent legal representation absolutely essential for each
of them.

The risks arise from the following factors

   1.   The possibility   at   the   Inquest   of   a   verdict   of   unlawful
        killing.

   2.   Of additional evidence being given at the Inquest which
        may cause the Director of Public Prosecutions to further
        consider the question of criminal liability.

   3.   Recently in a similar case where the Director of Public
        Prosecutions    decided   against    criminal   proceedings,
        representatives of the deceased instigated a Judicial Review
        of the Director's decision.      The officers see this as
        possible in this case.

   4.   Private criminal prosecutions may be brought.

   5.   The officers face possible disciplinary proceedings where
        dismissal, requirement to resign or reduction in rank are
        all possibilities.


Relevant Considerations

All the officers thus far have provided for their own legal advice and
representation and the application today is concerned solely with costs
likely to be incurred at the Inquest Hearings.

To help you with your decision clear advice is             provided     in Home   Office
Circular 77/1987 which is included in your papers.

This Circular refers to a central principle:   this is "that where the Police
Authority considers that an officer has acted in good faith in pursuance
of his duties or that the interests of the Force as a whole are involved
(and both of these considerations are fully satisfied in this case) the
officer should have the support of the Police Authority to ensure that he
has the services of a lawyer and that he should not be out-of-pocket".
I wish to emphasise that all these officers were "acting in good faith in
pursuance of their duties" and undoubtedly "the interests of the Force as
a whole are involved".   Also, the further risks these officers fear are
very real.

Paragraph 13 refers specifically to "Legal Representation for Individual
Officers"  particularly to  occasions when  "the Chief Officer's   legal
representative cannot reasonably be expected to represent the separate
interests of officers".

This issue has been considered on your behalf by the lawyers representing
the Authority and the Chief Constable in this matter.   Their advice is that
independent  legal  representation  is appropriate   for all the officers
concerned.

In the Circular reference is specifically made to the Authority "wishing
in particular to assess whether officers are at risk of being held to blame
for actions in connection with the deaths to which an Inquest relates and
where any such finding might give rise to legal proceedings for which the
Police Authority would be liable or for which financial assistance might
be appropriate".   It will be seen therefore the advice in this Circular
relates very precisely to our situation.


Finance

The Circular makes it clear      that   expenditure   incurred   in   this   regard   is
eligible for police grant.

When this Committee last considered these applications questions were raised
about the private insurance available to the chief superintendent and three
superintendents.  I can now inform you that:-

   a.     Through the insurance provided by Allianz Cornhill each
           officer has a financial limitation of £50,000 which after
          VAT is taken into account amounts in fact to £42,500 each.

  b.      The policy does not specifically cover Inquest Hearings
          but my understanding is that the insurers are prepared to
          provide cover in this instance.

  c.      In relation to future risks the officers may need further
           legal advice and representation after the Inquest Hearings
          have been concluded, for example, in relation to criminal,
          private or discipline proceedings.  If the Director of Public
          Prosecutions were to bring criminal proceedings, in the
          first instance the Police Authority could not - even if
          they so wished - fund the officers' legal costs. Also there
          is    no  provision   for  the   Authority   to   fund  legal
          representation at discipline hearings.    Therefore, in terms
          of the insurance provision, such possible future requirements
          must be borne in mind.
                                    - 3 -


Some information is now available as to the extent these officers have
already incurred legal costs and their estimate of costs likely to be
incurred through representation at the Inquest Hearings. I can provide
you with the details as you wish.

In relation to the two constables, they do not have private insurance but
to date have been supported from Police Federation funds. Their application,
as with the chief superintendent and three superintendents, is for Police
Authority funding in relation to legal costs incurred by them at the Inquest
Hearings.


Separate Representations

The Circular, at paragraph 14, makes clear that officers should normally
be given the opportunity by the Police Authority to make representations
to them if they so wish.

With the exception of Constable Smith,     all   the officers and some legal
advisors  are in close attendance.    Some of them have intimated they may
wish to exercise their right to appear before you today and make their own
representation as to their application for financial assistance.


Recommendation

South Yorkshire Police officers must be able to go about their normal duties
secure in the knowledge that provided they act in good faith and to the
best of their ability they will always     bedeserving of and receive    the
support of this Police Authority, including financial provision for legal
representation when that is appropriate.

I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending to you that the proper course
of action is for these applications to be fully supported.

               SPECIAL POLICE AUTHORITY MEETING - 2 NOVEMBER 1990


                                                                                  Iff1

Introduction
                                                                                   tfSf   .       mS.
This meeting is considering an application from six officers
superintendent, three superintendents and two constables) for n n a n c i
support to provide them with legal representation at the forthcomi m , y
Hearing into the Hillsborough tragedy.
                                                                   *08
                                                                              »cno« BY
They have all been investigated by the West Midlands Police,
the Director of Public Prosecutions, in relation to the question of criminal
liability.   The   Director  has  announced  that at    this  time there  is
insufficient evidence on which to bring criminal proceedings.

All the officers continue to see themselves to be at considerable risk and
consider independent legal representation absolutely essential for each
of them.

The risks arise from the following factors

   1.   The possibility   at   the   Inquest   of   a   verdict   of   unlawful
         killing.

   2.   Of additional evidence    being given at the Inquest which
         may cause the Director    of Public Prosecutions to further
         consider the question of criminal liability.

   3.   Recently in a similar     case where the Director of Public
         Prosecutions    decided    against    criminal    proceedings,
         representatives of the deceased instigated a Judicial Review
         of the Director's decision.       The officers   see this as
         possible in this case.

   4.   Private criminal prosecutions may be brought.

   5.   The officers face possible disciplinary proceedings where
         dismissal, requirement to resign or reduction in rank are
         all possibilities.


Relevant Considerations                                                                       i

All the officers thus far have provided for their own legal advice and
representation and the application today is concerned solely with costs
likely to be incurred at the Inquest Hearings.                                                             ‘

To help you with your decision clear advice is             provided     in Home     Office
Circular 77/1987 which is included in your papers.                                                         f
                                                                                                           |
This Circular refers to a central principle:   this is "that where the Police                              1
Authority considers that an officer has acted in good faith in pursuance                                   ?
of his duties or that the interests of the Force as a whole are involved                                   \
(and both of these considerations are fully satisfied in this case) the
officer should have the support of the Police Authority to ensure that he
has the services of a lawyer and that he should not be out-of-pocket".
                                           - 2 -

    I wish to emphasise that all these officers were "acting in good faith in
    pursuance of their duties" and undoubtedly "the interests of the Force as
    a whole are involved".   Also, the further risks these officers fear are
    very real.

    Paragraph 13 refers specifically to "Legal Representation for Individual
    Officers"  particularly to occasions  when  "the  Chief Officer's  legal
    representative cannot reasonably be expected to represent the separate
    interests of officers".

    This issue has been considered on your behalf by the lawyers representing
    the Authority and the Chief Constable in this matter.  Their advice is that
    independent  legal  representation is appropriate   for all the officers
    concerned.

    In the Circular reference is specifically made to the Authority "wishing
    in particular to assess whether officers are at risk of being held to blame
    for actions in connection with the deaths to which an Inquest relates and
    where any such finding might give rise to legal proceedings for which the
    Police Authority would be liable or for which financial assistance might
    be appropriate".   It will be seen therefore the advice in this Circular
    relates very precisely to our situation.


    Finance

    The Circular makes it clear      that expenditure   incurred   in this   regard   is
    eligible for police grant.

    When this Committee last considered these applications questions were raised
    about the private insurance available to the chief superintendent and three
    superintendents.  I can now inform you that:-

       a.     Through the insurance provided by Allianz Cornhill each
              officer has a financial limitation of £50,000 which after
              VAT is taken into account amounts in fact to £42,500 each.

       b.     The policy does not specifically cover Inquest Hearings
               but my understanding is that the insurers are prepared to
               provide cover in this instance.

       c.     In relation to future risks the officers may need further
               legal advice and representation after the Inquest Hearings
              have been concluded, for example, in relation to criminal,
              private or discipline proceedings.   If the Director of Public
              Prosecutions were to bring criminal proceedings, in the
               first instance the Police Authority could not - even if
               they so wished - fund the officers' legal costs. Also there
               is   no  provision   for   the   Authority   to   fund  legal
              representation at discipline hearings.     Therefore, in terms
              of the insurance provision, such possible future requirements
              must be borne in mind.

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

19    october   1990   AND 2 NOVEMBER 1990
REPORT BY THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


1.      Matter for Consideration

1.1    The provision of financial assistance to police officers involved in
       legal proceedings arising from the events at Hillsborough Football
       Ground on 15 April 1989.


2.      Background Information

2.1    Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, published    on 4 December 1987 and
       adopted by this Authority on 8 April 1988, provides guidance to Police
       Authorities in considering applications, on behalf of police officers,
       for financial assistance in legal proceedings.

2.2    ®ie central principle which should guide consideration of individual
       cases is that, where a police authority considers that an officer has
       acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that the interests
       of the force as a whole are involved, the       officer should have the
       support of the police authority to ensure that he has the services
       of a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket.

2.3    After the publication of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor
       into the Hillsborough Disaster the Chief Constable of the West Midlands
       Police was appointed to enquire into the        possibility of criminal
       proceedings arising from the disaster.     At that time an application
       for   financial assistance   was  received   from Chief    Superintendent
       Duckenfield, the officer in command at Hillsborough on the day of the
       disaster.

2.4    At the time of that application it was acknowledged that s i m i l a r
       applications for assistance, under the terms of Home Office Circular
       No.77/1987, could be anticipated from other officers directly involved
       in legal proceedings arising from the Hillsborough Disaster.

2.5    The application from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was considered
       by the Finance and General Purposes Committee on 15 September 1989
       when the matter was deferred for further consideration of the role
       of the Authority's insurers.

2.6    Following advice from the Authority's insurers and solicitors, Chief
       Superintendent Duckenfield obtained independent legal representation
       from solicitors engaged through his staff association and financed
       by his personal legal insurance.

2.7    The funds available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield under this
       policy amounted to £50,000.   His solicitors have advised him that that
       amount may be exhausted by one or both of the on-going Civil
       Contributions Hearing and the forthcoming Coroner's Inquest.

2.8   A further application has npw been received from Chief Superintendent
      Duckenfield for his original application to be re-considered and, as
      anticipated,   similar  applications   have  now   been received from
      Superintendents Marshall, Greenwood and Murray; and an application
      has also been received from Russell Jones and Walker, solicitors, on
      behalf of Police Constables Smith and Illingworth.

2.9   All officers making application have been the direct subject of
      enquiries by the Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police arising
      from allegations of criminal conduct received from third parties.


3     Comment
                       •

3.1   Following the disaster and throughout the Public Inquiry conducted
      by Lord Justice Taylor, the interests of the Police Authority, the
      Chief Constable and all officers of the Force were represented by legal
      officers appointed by the Police Authority insurers.       In relation to
      the subsequent criminal enquiry and possible proceedings the insurers
       indicated to seven South Yorkshire Police officers that a possibility
      of conflict could arise between the interests of the Force and each
      of them independently.    The question of separate legal representation
      was considered, one officer continued to be represented by the insurers
       and the six applicants obtained independent representation.

3.2   Members will be aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions, having
      considered the evidence resulting from the enquiry by the West Midlands
      Police, announced on 30 August 1990 his decision that there was
      insufficient evidence to justify criminal proceedings against any South
      Yorkshire Police officer.    There are, however, certain civil actions
      under-way and the Coroner's Inquest into the deaths at Hillsborough
      will resume on 19 November 1990.

3.3 At the Coroner's Inquest the officers concerned are likely to be called
     upon to give evidence.   It is acknowledged that cross examination by
     Counsel representing other parties may be prejudicial to the individual
     officers in respect of their personal liabilities.      These officers
     consider it necessary to continue to be independently represented at
     this hearing where the Chief Constable's legal representative cannot
     reasonably be expected to represent the separate interests of each
     of them.

3.4 It will be seen from paragraph 13 of the Home Office Circular that
     separate representation should be provided at a Coroner's Inquest where
     (a) the Chief Officers legal representative cannot reasonably be
     expected to represent the interests of such officers and, (b) the Police
     Authority considers that such interests should be represented.        In
     such cases the authority should, in the terms of the Circular, provide
     financial assistance to the individual officers concerned.

 3.5 It will be noted at paragraph 14 of the Circular that an officer wishing
      to seek financial assistance from his police authority should have
      the opportunity in advance of the proceedings to submit to the Chief
      Constable an application for financial assistance.   The Chief Constable
      is obliged to put such application to the authority for decision.
       It will be further seen that the applying officer should normally be
      given the opportunity by the police authority to make representations
       to them if he wishes to do so.

3.6   The events at Hillsborough were extraordinary in respect of the
      potential  individual   liability  of police officers    involved.   The
      officers were acting in good faith in accordance with established
      practice.  The nature of the various investigation into the Hillsborough
      Disaster also means that the interests of the South Yorkshire Police,
      as a whole, are involved.     For these two reasons (see para 2.2 ante)
      it is recommended that these officers should have the support of the
      Police Authority to ensure that they each have the services of a lawyer
      representing their individual interests, at the forthcoming Coroner's
      Inquest.

3.7   It would be sensible for the officers concerned to retain the services
      of those lawyers who currently represent them throughout subsequent
      proceedings.


4     Financial Implications

4.1   The cost of independent representation has to date been met by personal
      legal insurance arranged through The Superintendents' Association for
      Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendents Marshall, Murray,
      and Greenwood.   Constables Smith and ^Illingworth, meanwhile, have been
      represented by Messrs Russell    Jones and Walker, the PoliceFederation
      solicitor, paid for by central Police Federation funds.

4.2   The extent of future costs will be determined by the time     taken to
       conclude the Inquest.   There is no specific provision in the Revenue
       Budget for these costs.


5     Recommendation

5.1   The Authority is recommended to approve a commitment to provide
      financial  assistance   for  legal representation at the forthcoming
      Inquest, to the officers concerned, in accordance with the principles
      of Home Office Circular No.77/1987.

                SUBJECT:     Hillsborough Disaster - Funding for Legal Representation

                On 24 August 1989 I made application under Home Office Circular
                No 77/87 for yourself and the Police Authority to give due
                consideration for funds to be made available for my legal
                representation in connection with any proceedings which may arise
                from the Hillsborough Disaster.

                These proceedings are currently the Civil Hearings due to begin in
                Manchester on 2 October to be followed by the Coroner's Inquest on
                19 November 1990. There is also the possibility that Discipline
                Proceedings may follow at a later stage.



•
                Whilst the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect
                of Criminal Matters has been favourable it is not unreasonable to
    -           assume that if further evidence came to light he would reconsider
                the position with regard to myself and other officers.

                There is also the stated intention, admittedly via the media, by
                families of the deceased that they intend to launch a private
                prosecution for manslaughter against officers of South Yorkshire
                Police.

                It is therefore of paramount importance that the best independent
                legal advice possible is available for myself and other officers.

                My previous application for financial assistance was, as I understand
                i t , 'left on the table' in the knowledge that I had insurance cover
                for my legal defence up to the sum of £50,000.

                If I require legal representation at the Civil Hearings and Coroner's
                Inquest it is likely that my defence costs will exceed the sum assured
                and I will require additional funding (bearing in mind Discipline
                and Private Prosecution).

                I ask for urgent reconsideration of my request in the hope that a
                contribution could be made towards my legal defence costs or an
                agreement to meet all reasonable expenditure over and above the sum
                assured.

                I have attached a letter from my solicitor and copies of previous
                papers.

Dear David

 Hillsborough

As you are aware, we are obtaining Counsel's Advice as to your personal
position in relation to the forthcoming civil hearing in Manchester
commencing on 2nd October and the Coroner's Inquests which are due to
resume on 19th November 1990.

 In addition to representing your interests at the above, your position
 will also need consideration and yourself possible representation at the
 disciplinary hearing, as and when this commences.

 Finally,   there is,   of course,   the spectre                                           of        a         possible            private
 prosecution which may arise at some stage.

 It seems likely that the present funds available under the Allianz
 Personal Law Plan may well be exhausted by one or both of the Civil and
 Coroner's hearings. Can we impress upon you, therefore, that you make the
 strongest representations both to the Home Office and to the Chief
 Superintendent's Association to ascertain the availability of funds to
 assist you with legal representation. This must be carried out as a
 matter of priority for you, based on the time scale for the various
 hearings.

                SUBJECT:      APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE


                 The interim report of the Inquiry by the Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor into
                 the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster that occurred on the 15 April 1989 was
                 published at 1100 hours on Friday 4 August 1989* The report was very
                 critical of the South Yorkshire Police in general and, in particular, myself
                 and a number of other police officers.

                 National media interest   and comments followed publication and, in view of
                 the extensive criticism   in the report regarding my handling of events on
                 the day of the disaster   and the possibility of actions of criminal
                 negligence/disciplinary   proceedings, I was suspended from duty on the 4
                 August 1989.

                 The Director of Public Prosecutions was, I understand, requested         to examine
                 Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and subsequently instructed         the West
                 Midlands Police to carry out a full criminal investigation, 'not         limited
                 to the criminal culpability of the police alone' into the events         that
                 occurred at Hillsborough on the 15 April 1989-

                 Whilst no criminal charges have been brought to date against me, the
                 possibility of charges being brought exists and I will, no doubt, be
                 interviewed by the West Midlands Police during the course of their criminal
                 investigations. There is also a possibility of interviews in respect of
                 disciplinary allegations made against me for whidh a Regulation 7 Notice
                 has been served.

                 I was authorised to obtain independent legal advice from Hammond Suddards
                 resulting in being advised by them to obtain further private independent
                 legal advice as Hammond Suddards could not assist me personally as no
                 criminal charges had been made. I am now obtaining independent legal advice
                 through a personal Legal Protection Insurance Policy.

                 The policy gives a maximum cover of £50,000. If I need legal representation
                 at interviews with the West Midlands Inquiry Team regarding possible
                 criminal or disciplinary matters and at protracted inquest hearings, which
                 are unlikely to take place until early 1990, then there is little doubt
                 my legal costs will be very much in excess of this figure.

                 If any criminal proceedings are brought against members of the South
                 Yorkshire Police (and manslaughter charges are possible), it is imperative,
                 in the interests of the force, the Police Authority and any individual
                 officer, that those concerned have had the benefit of the best possible
                 legal advice and representation at any forthcoming judicial hearings.

                 Whilst the force has been, and continues to be, legally represented matters
                 are very complex and conflict of interest can arise in areas concerning
                 different individuals.

Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings'. I draw your attention

I therefore respectfully request that application be made to the Police

REPORT BY THE CHIEF CONSTABLE        Act 1972 as amended.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

1.      Matter for Consideration

        The provision of financial assistance to police officers involved in
        legal proceedings arising from the event at Hillsborough Football Ground
        on 15 April 1989.


2.      Background Information                                     .

2.1     Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, published on 4 ©ncenber 1987, provides
        guidance to Police Authorities on the exercise of their discretion in
        considering applications, on behalf of police officers, for financial .
        assistance towards the cost of legal advice and representation arising
        from involvement in legal proceedings which result fro* the pursuance, in
        good faith, of their duties or where the interest* of the force a » :;^|,
        whole are involved. A copy of the Circular is attached.

2.2      Arising from the publication of the Interim Report of Lord Justice taylor
         into the Hillsborough Disaster, the subsequent appointment of the Chief
         Constable of the Vest Midlands Police to enquire into the justification
         for criminal proceedings arising from the disaster and the forthcoming
         Coroner's Inquest into the deaths, an application for assistance has been
         received from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield who was involved in
         command of the policing arrangements for the football Semi-Final and
         similar applications from other officers similarly involved might be
         anticipated.


 3.      Comment

 3.1     Following the disaster and throughout the Public Inquiry the interests of
         the Police Authority, the Chief Co».t.bl. and all ofiEicers of the Force
         have been represented by legal officers appointed by the 1
         insurers. The legal officers appointed by the insurers have indicated
         that in relation to criminal proceedings they would be unable to provide
         representation for individual officers who should seek independent legal
         advice and representation.

 3      2 It will be seen from the Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, that the
          central principle which should guide consideration of individual cases is
           that, where a Police Authority considers that an officer has « ed in
           aood faith in pursuance of his duties or that where the interests of the
                    ? i h o L .re Involved, th. officer should hsve t h . ^ u p p o r t o th.
           Police Authority to ensure that he has the services of a lawyer and that
          he should not be out of pocket.


 3      3 It will be further seen that In respect of criminal proceedings pursued
 3- 3      l y tie C r o i Prosecution Service « . l » t . m . d l v i d u . offlc.rhe should
           be expected to bear the costs of his own defence and the Police
         Authority, at the conclusion of the proceedings, are able to consider, on
         the full facts, whether or not to reimburse any expenses incurred by the
         officer and not awarded by the trial court, even where proceedings have
         resulted in conviction in certain circumstances. It will be noted from
         paragraph 14 of the Circular that an officer wishing to seek financial
         assistance should have the opportunity to submit to the Chief Officer an
         application for financial assistance, upon receipt of which the Chief
         Officer should refer the application to the Police Authority together
         with his own recommendation. It will be further seen that the applying
         officer should normally be given the opportunity by the Police Authority
         to make representations to them if he wishes to do so. At this stage
         Chief Superintendent Duckenfield wishes to reserve the right to so appear
         at a future date if necessary.

3.4      The events at Hillsborough were unique in respect of the potential
         criminal liability of.police officers involved. The officers were acting
         in good faith in accordance with well established practices and any
         criminal proceedings will largely constitute a test case similar to t m
         example provided in paragraph three of the Home Office Circular.
         unique nature of the circumstances of this particular criminal enquiry
         with its wide Implications for the interests of tip force as a vhol« is
         such that the Police Authority may wish to c o n # i # « at this ‘tage, •
         commitment to the funding of independent legal advice for the officer(s)
         concerned. The financial commitment of the officers is likely t O g ^
         commence with advice and representation prior to end during I n t a m i W
                                                                                   tv•
         undertaken by Vest Hidlands Police officers in the course of their
         enquiry. It would be prudent for that representation to continue
         throughout the enquiry and any subsequent criminal proceedings and to
         extend to representation at the Coroner's Inquest which will ultimately
         be held.

3    5   At this stage it is anticipated that representation in any civil actions
         subsequently pursued will be provided by the Police Authority insurers.

3.6       It should be noted that there is available, t0 ^    officers of
          superintendent and chief superintendent rank who       chosen to
          contribute, a measure of personal liability insurance arranged by the
          Superintendents* Association of England and Vales. The individual
          liability limit of this insurance cover is £50,000.


 4.       Financial Implications

          It is not possible at this stage to assess the financial i d e a t i o n s of
          this matter which will depend entirely on the course and extent of the
          criminal enquiry and the ultimate outcome, and the duration of the
          Inquest proceedings .    There it no specific provision I n the levenue
          Budget for this expenditure.


    5.    Recommendation

          The Committee is teco-ended to approve a co»it»ent to provide financial
          assistance for legal representation to the
          accordance with the central principle of Home Office Circular So.

            Sir

            Through nty solicitor, Mr Vincent Hale, of Nash House, 140 Upperthorpe,
            Sheffield, I have received intimation of the resumed inquests into the
            deaths at Hillsborough.    I shall be required to give evidence at this
            inquest which resumes on 19 November 1990.

            You will perhaps be aware that I have been represented throughout the West
            Midlands Police enquiry into the disaster by Mr Hale and that his costs to
            date are subject of a claim upon private insurance effected by myself
            through my membership of the Superintendents Association.      Mr Hale has
            submitted an interim account upon the insurers, which has not yet been met.
            I wish, 7therefore, to make formal application under the terms of the Home
            Office Circular 77/87 to the South Yorkshire Police Authority for financial
            assistance towards Mr Vincent Hale's costs in connection with his
            representa ;ion of my int ests at the forthcoming inquest.

SUBJECT:         A P P L IC A T IO N FOR F IN A N C IA L A SSISTA N CE




  In connection with the Hillsborough tragedy of 1989 and allegations
  made against me, I have been taking legal advice from Walker, Morris,
  Scott and Turnbull, Solicitors of Leeds, and in particular M r Richard
  Manning of that company.      The finance for this advice has been
  available through my own private insurance.    Although the Director of
  Public Prosecutions has stated that proceedings will not be taken
  against any Police officer, there are still many matters unsettled and
  I may still require significant legal advice and assistance.

  I have been informed that the Coroners Inquest is to start on 19
  November 1990, and that this will be a lengthy enquiry and it is
  probable that my legal costs will exceed the limit of my Insurance,
  particularly if other matters follow the Inquest, e.g. criminal or
  disciplinary proceedings.

  Accordingly under Home Office circular No. 77 of 1987, I ask that an
  approach be made to the Police Authority to give consideration to
  making funds available for my Legal Representation in connection with
  the forthcoming Inquest, civil hearing and any criminal proceedings
  which may arise, which would allow me to maintain the services of Mr.
  Manning,   who  with   his   existing   knowledge   of  my    particular
  circumstances, I feel is the best person to represent myself.

           Emanating from the 'Hillsborough Disaster' certain proceedings require to

           will commence on the 19th November.

           I hereby make formal application, through you,to the Police Authority for
           funding in respect of such legal advice and representation as is deemed
           necessary by my legal advisors.

           I am represented in this matter by Messrs Barlow, Hyde and Gilbert,

   There is statutory authority in section 48 of the Police Act 1964 for
   payments to be nade from the police fund to meet expenditure incurred
   by police officers in defending proceedings in tort^ Also, acting in
   pursuance of its general statutory duty to maintain an adequate and
   efficient police force for its area, the police authority.lias
   discretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers in all kinds ’of
   legal proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in
   pursuance of their duties, or the interests of the force as a whole
   are involved.   The purpose of this circular is to give guidance to
/-^police authorities to help then in considering requests on behalf of
''•^officers for financial assistance. This guidance has been discussed
   and agreed with the local authority and with the police staff
    issociations.
 *2.    The central principle which should guide consideration of
  individual cases is that, where a police authority considers that an
  officer has acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that
  the interests of a force as a whole are involved, the officer ahould
  have the support of the police authority to ensure that he has the
  services of a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket. The
  following paragraphs provide general guidance to the different
  classes of proceedings. Payments Bade to officers in accordance with
 this guidance will be eligible for police grant.



                                                                                                 1
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

£ms_ecution by the Crown Prosecution Service

 2.  An officer who is the subject of a public prosecution for an
alleged offence committed while carrying out his duties as a police
officer is in the same position as any other defendant and must be
expected to bear the costs of his defence.   If he is acquitted, he
should, like any other defendant, look to the court for
reimbursement of his expenses.   If the costs are not paid, or not
paid in full from central funds, the police authority art in a
position to decide, on the full facts, whether or not to make a
payment to the officer or to the Police Federation if they have
provided the funding.   There may be cases where it 'is proper to
provide legal advice and/or legal representation even where the
officer is found guilty. This nay arise for example in test cases
where the officer 'has baen carrying out a practice hitherto
approved of but is found guilty as a result of that practice being
found unlawful by the court in the light of the circumstances of
that particular case.



4.  A police officer should be able to carry out his duties ihjtibe
confidence that, If he acta in good faith and exercises             '
judgement reasonably, his police authority vifill support him. If,
in a case where a member of the public brings a prosecution against
an officer, the authority is satisfied that the officer has acted
in this way, the authority should provide or fund legal advice
and/or representation.
5.   Where a court decides that a prosecution brought against an
officer was not brought in good faith, it may order the prosecutor
to pay the whole or any part of the costs incurred by the defence ,*
again, if the officer is acquitted on indictment, his costs may be
met from central funds. In either of these cases, the question of
the police authority providing financial support to the officer may
not arise.   However, where the costs of an acquitted officer are
not awarded by the court or awarded only in part, the police
authority should consider whether to reimburse any costs not
covered, taking into account the reasons, if any, given by the
court for failing to award all costs claimed.

Civil   Actions   Against   the   Chief Off i c T — ler_MgfingfuL-Afitl— ftf

6. Under section 48(1) of the Police Act 1964, the chief officer
of a force is liable in respect of torts committed by constables
under his direction and control (which includes special constables
and officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutual aid arrangements)       in the performance or purported
performance of their functions. Under section 48(2) any damages or
costs awarded against the chief officer in such proceedings, any
costs he incurs himself, and any sum paid in connection with the
settlement of a claim, p r o vided the settlement is approved by the
p o lice authority, must be paid out of the police fund.          In such
cases, therefore, the police authority's discretion extends only to
w h e t h e r or not to approve a proposed settlement of the claim.


Civil Actions A g a i n s t -Individual ..Pollca Qiflfiir*
7. Alternatively, the plaintiff may be awarded d a m a g e s against an
individual police officer, though he cannot recover «ie damages
twice over against the chief officer as well. Section 4f (4) of the
Police Act 1964 specifically empowers a police authority to such
extent as they think fit" to pay out of the police               f
or costs awarded agajlnst an officer, any costs he incurs hissair,
and any sums paid in connection with the settlement of * claim.
This provision applies to actions against officers of th®
authority's own force, officers of another force serving           J®1*®®
area under mutual aid arrangements, and s p e c i a l constables for the
police area.   In considering whether t o 9 iv« financial assistance
the authority will wish to consider in particular
officer concerned acted in good faith and
reasonably. Where the court finds for the officer, he
costs from the plaintiff! should t h r ceiti                 4rf
awarded only in part, the police authority should
to reimburse any costs not covered, taking into accwmt th
reasons, if any, given by the court for failing to award all costs
claimed.

8.   Joint actions naming both the chief officer   Jn
police officer may be brought in some cases. In «uch «*•••
important that any discussion of the merit* <              in the
proposed settlement should involve all the parties named in the
claim together with advisers sven if they are represented by
different advisers.                                      ,

from this liability. It should be noted that the liability of the
•'data user" under the Act is not vicarious but his personal
liability. Therefore his own care in having instituted a system of
obtaining, checking and racording data which would reasonably guard
against error and loss under section 23(3) of the Act should ®eet
his responsibility under section 22(3) and he should not be held
liable if one of his officers disregards the system •stablished.
10.   Where compensation is sought from an individual officer, the
police authority will wish, in considering whether to Beet
costs which would otherwise fall on the officer, to take account of
the same matters as in exercising their power under •action 48(4)
of the Police Act 1964 (see paragraph 7).        Police authorities
should apply the same broad principles and in particular, Beet the
costs of any compensation awarded against a chief constable where a
non-police officer is at fault and the chief constable is found to
have liability for the actions performed.



11.   There may be occasions when financial assistance is sought
from a police authority to enable an officer to bring or cons idler
bringing a civil action for defamation.          Jto authority - f s
discretion to give such assistance but it will be eligible for
police grant only if the following criteria are all met:*
     (a)    the defamation is serious;
     (b)     it relates to the actions of    an officer actingor
     said to be acting in the discharge of his duty?
     (c)   it has attracted public attention;
     (d)   to bring the action is considered to be in the
     interests of the force or of the police service as a
     whole; and
     (e)    the action stands a reasonable      chance of success.
Criterion (d) is central. If only the reputation of the individual
officer is in question, he is in the saae position as any other
citizen and Bust be expected to seek his own remedy.           But an
allegation against a particular officer Bay
                                               of 1w M m r
reputation of the whole force or bs an •xaaplo '
        the fnret or a significant section of it.       In such cases
the police authority, provided the other criteria are satisfied,
Say reasonably be expected to help to defend the reputation of the
force.

Dear David


Hillsborough - Coroner's Inquests

I refer to our recent discussion and the letters from South Yorkshire
Pol ic e re l a t i n g to the q u e s t i o n of the funding of your legal
representation at the forthcoming Inquests.             A number of specific
questions have been raised and I set out below my comments:-

1.       ALLIANZ/CORNHILL COVER

As you know, the total cover available for all matters arising out of the
Hillsborough disaster, and subject to prior Allianz approval, inclusive
of costs,   VAT,  Counsel's fees and other disbursements,     amounts to
£50,000. I estimate that the total monies expended to date are in the
region of £34,000, which leaves approximately £16,000.

The outstanding known issues arising from Hillsborough for which we
believe you require legal advice/representation, are the Inquests and
discipline hearing, together with related matters. There is, of course,
the possibility of a private prosecution.

2•       COSTS OF REPRESENTATION AT INQUESTS

Counsel's Fees:

Brief Fee                                             £7,000 with Refresher at £750 per day plus
                                                      VAT.

Solicitors costs                                      £80 per hour, say £700/£800 per day plus
                                                      VAT, together with travelling expenses.

Articled Clerk                                     £45 per hour, say £400 per day plus VAT,
                                                    again, with travelling expenses.

It is envisaged that representation at the Inquest will be primarily by
Counsel with an articled clerk, but also by myself on days when Counsel
is unavailable or when matters are perhaps less contentious. We envisage
attendance will be on each day necessary to protect your interests which

CONTINUATION


    mav result in representation on every day. We understand the Inquests may
    last several weeks. In addition, there will be the Solicitors' costs in
    preparing for the Inquests to include the Brief.

    You will see from the above that if the Allianz cover was to be expended
    first, this would provide you with cover for approximately one week,
    leaving no funding available for advice and representation in respect of
    any other matters which might arise, and in particular, the disciplinary
    hearing and related matters.

    As you know,     we cannot incur    costs   without   prior   approval   from
    Allianz/Cornhill in any event.

    I trust this makes the,position clear, but should you, the Deputy Chief
    Constable or any meraJfe^ of the committee require any further information,
    then pl^asjar7 d y 7 iot/^esitate to contact me.

      30th October 1990

      Superintendent B. Murray




      Dear Superintendent Murray,

      Attached is a copy of the letter by fax that I                                                                          have received
      from Allianz Cornhill this morning, together with                                                                       a copy of my
      reply.

      This letter is being written in advance of the preliminary hearing
      this afternoon and as yet I have no reason to believe that we
      shall not be well within the limit of your indemnity with Allianz
      i J the Inquest does not last any longer than 8 weeks, and indeed
      we shall still have quite a bit in hand.

      You will see that Allianz Cornhill suggest that the Police Authority
      make "at least some contribution to the funding of representation
      at    the Coroner's Inquest".   That was a    point that I had made
      off   the record to       you, namely to wonder whether they would perhaps
      deal with this on an equal basis.

      My   only concern is to ensure that you have sufficient funding
      for whatever action there may be taken against you.          We know
      that the Police Authority would not fund in relation to disciplinary
      proceedings. We have no idea whether t h o ^ disciplinary proceedings
      are likely to continue or not, and if' they are to continue the
      length of them.    Therefore it makes sense at least to have some
      reserve for those proceedings. Equally, as I have said, if the
      Police Authority are not going to fund for your representation
      at the Inquest, what will they provide funding for?

     I think we have a duty to investigate       whether the cover that
     the Police Authority have under their own Insurance Policy would
     extend to cover individual Police Officers attending at the Inquest.
     You will see that I have raised with Allianz Cornhill what limitation
     there would then be on their liability.



                                                                                                                           Continued

Of course we have not to forget that part of the purpose of this
correspondence  is that Allianz Cornhill would like to reduce
their own exposure to costs.   It is most unusual to say the least
that one incurs legal costs of anything like the extent of £50,000
and to have a number of claimants all likely to reach that level
of costs, is going to make a nasty dint in their anticipated
expenditure against the premium income. Therefore they are looking
after themselves as far as they can.      Perhaps we may have the
opportunity to discuss this when we meet after the Coroner's
preliminary hearing.

   Dear Sirs,
   Re: Your Policyholder/Our                         Client:              Chief   Superintendent                       Hurray

   We acknowledge your letter of the 30th October by fax and refer
   to our telephone call to your 3anet Hall in the absence of Eileen
   Gardner.
   First, you have in fact confirmed authority to continue to represent
   your Insured at the Coroner's Inquest as indicated in your letter
   of the 11th October.
   We confirm that we have made our Client aware of the limit of
   indemnity. We further confirm that our Client has made represen­
   tations to the Police Authority for funding for legal representation.
   We have no knowledge as to whether the Insurance Policy or the
   Police Authority would, or could, be argued to extend to individual
   Police Officers attending the Inquest, but our reaction is that
   this is unlikely, for otherwise why would there need to be a
   provision for the Police Authority to find for legal representation.
   Nonetheless, we will check that point as well. We would invite
   clarification from you as to the limit of liability which you
   suggest would apply should there be another Insurance Policy
   under which the Insured could claim.

    We would intend    to contact you after the preliminary hearing
    this afternoon   to advise of any further relevant     information
    and we have already made you aware of the basis upon which we
    will charge for attendance at that hearing.   We assume therefore
    that yours is a standard letter that has been addressed to all
    Solicitors, some of whom may not have qiven you that information.

    Ycxir'. faithfully,

    WALK! H MORRIS SCOTT TURNBULL

Dear Sirs,

R»: Our Policyholder / Your Client: Chief Superintendant Murray

 We refer to the above and to the forthcoming Coroners* Inquest, for which we
 have already confirmed authority to attend the Pre-Hearing Review ■*•*.* we
Understand takes place tomorrow.

There are a number of points which we feel we should make perfectly clear to
our policyholders with regard to limits of indemnity which following
representation at the inquest will be seriously affected should an internal
investigation and/or disciplinary proceedings take place.      We must seek
assurances from yourselves that the policyholder is fully aware of the
implications with regard to the exhaustion of the limit of indemnity and the
possibility that private funding may be necessary to meet the legal costs
incurred over the £50,000 limit.

Staying on this point, we understand that representations have been     by
some of the police officers with regard to the Police Authority at least
making some contribution to the funding of representation the Coroners*
Inquest. We must add our voice to this request, as surely the interests of
the Police Authority are also very much at stake here.

We also understand that civil claims have already been intimated against the
relevant Police Authority, with the Chief Constable being named as the
defendant, and that a separate insurance policy operates in this regard. We
understand that the insurance policy would cover the Police Authority for
representation at an inquest, we wonder whether it could be argued that cover
should should also be given to individual police officers attending the
inquest. We await your connents. We should however point out that under the
terms of our policy, should there be another insurance policy under which the
Insured can claim, then our liability would be limited.

We look forward to receiving confirmation froa yourselves that the Insured is
fully aware of the implications with regard to mounting costs following the
inquest, and your views as to the funding of the inquest itself.
-rurs sincerely.

     Re:          HILLSBOROUGH

     Following     our   conversation  yesterday,  Superintendent  Bettison
     t e le phoned me to say the statements you are sending over would take
     longer to collate than was first anticipated and would not be
     d e livered to us today.

     I am therefore enclosing with this letter my note on the
     Pre-Inquest Review.

     Pe t er is absent from the office today due to illness, but I have
     spoken to h i m about the matters we d i s c u s s e d , and he will telephone
     y ou tomorrow.

|The Coroner outlined for the benefit of non-lawyers present that
 this      hearing was not part of the Inquests.     The purpose of; the
m ee ti n g was   to meet   legal   representatives  an d to deal jwith
 procedural matters.      It w a s to be treated as a private meeting
jbetween the Coroner and Lawyers, but a meeting at which 4 ^ er
!interested parties were free to attend.      The Coroner then requested
!legal representatives to identify themselves.

 T im King of Counsel said he represented a number of the PR's of the
 deceased.      He was unable to give definite numbers (although h4 had
jbeen instructed by 26 families to d a t e ) , and he hoped that witKin a
 w eek a definitive list of those families being represented by him
!could be available.         The m a x i m u m number was likely to be 42.1 He
 said      that th e re may be individuals who had not instructed him, but

    Christopher Russell of Co u ns e l said he had been instructed                          by
    B a rlow Lloyd and Gilbert to represent Superintendent G r e e n w o o d j

    Stuart Catchpole of Counsel said he had been instructed by Davies
    A r nold Cooper (Peter Doyle of that firm also being present) to
    {represent Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.
    i                                                                  i
    !Vincent   Hale,        Solicitor,     said    he    represented       Superintendent
     Marshall.                                                                          i

    R ichard     Manning,     Solicitor,    said    he   represented       Superintendent
    Murray.

        Paul   Issacs of Counsel said he was instructed by Hepworih &
        Chadwick   (Chris Coughlin of that firm also being present)  to
        r epresent Chief superintendent Duckenfield.
                                                                   i
        T o n y Gregory of Keeble Hawsons, Solicitor,        said he represented the
        insurers of Sheffield C ity Council and               was accompanied by a
        Solicitor from the Council.
                                                                                        i
        At this point the Coroner established that one individual in <|ourt
        was a member of the press and he aBked the person to leave oh the
        basis that the meeting not a public meeting and not r e po rtable<

        B elinda Norcliffe,   Solicitor,   said she          represented          The   (jhief
        Constable of t he South Y orkshire Police.                                       ;
 P et e r      Jackson,      Solicitor,       said  he   represented   Th e Football
 Su p po r t er s Association.             H e stated   it w ou l d be unlikely the
 A s s o c i a t i o n would be u n ab l e to have a representative throughout the
 I nquest because of funding problems.                 He made the comment that if
 h e could obtain undertakings regarding comments made on Liverpool
 s u p p o r te r s from some parties, then attendance may not be necessary
Iin any event.
I
IT h e Coroner then invited Mrs.            O'Brien to speak who confirmed she
jwas    representing herself  as            the mother of the de c eased John
:O'Brien.
i
I                                                                    ;
IT h e Coro n e r then asked all representatives to write into him with
it h e names of all those w h o would be representing or likely to
!r ep r e s e n t  during the c ou r s e of the hearing, as he would be
 p r o v i d i n g name tags to h e l p both himself and the Transcribers
 i d entify representatives.
f

 T i m K ing indicated that on some occasions he would be lead by Ben
|Hytner or indeed that Ben H y t ne r would be the sole representative.

|T he C oroner stated this w o u l d not present any problem at all and
It h a t he would be as r e a s o n ab l e as possible regarding changes of
Irepresen t at i v es so long as the party they were representing did
 h a v e locus standi.
                                                                                   i

 T h e C o r o n e r said the venue for the Inquests would be the Sheffield
|Council Chambers, this b e i n g the same venue as for the Public
'Inquiry.          He stated the v e n u e may change depending on the numbers
|attending.
i


IA t this stage,             Mr. H o l r o y d arrived at   the meeting   and   said   he
 r e p r e s e n t e d the Police Federation.
I
jThe C o r o n e r said he had been asked whether there would be space to
 st o re pa pers and that there w a s a room in the Town Hall called the
 "safe** w h i c h would be m a d e available for this purpose.    Security
'would be at the risk of the individual representatives and th# key
.would be in the custody of the City Council.            The room would be
.o p e n e d for access at re a s onable hours, e.g. 9 to 10 in the mornina
|and 4 to 5 in the afternoon.

|The Coroner anticipated that he would sit from                    10 in the morning
 till about 12.45, wou l d t h e n recommence at 1.45               or 2 o'clock and
 r i s e at about 4          p.m.   T h e r e would be a short     break in t h e motning
 and afternoon.              The reason h e was not sitting        longer       hours was Ithat
 he h a d t o consider the                J ury who    were not     as used    to such
 p r o c e e d i n g s as Lawyers.

Th e C o r o n e r said if p oints of law were raised he would deal jwith
Jthem as a n d when n e c e s s a r y , but as he did not wish to w as t e •fiury
itime" t h e n he would try t o deal with these after 4 p.m. in the
afternoon.
   With regard to the scope of the Inquests, the Coroner said he had
   already dealt with three questions being who, when and where and
   the remaining question to be considered was Mho w " . This is wh»t he
  iwill be concentrating on.   Clearly he was dealing with 95 separate
  |Inquests but it would be impossible to recount the evidence 95
  'times and the evidence would therefore be taken together on all of
  Ithem.  He was aware there were differences, for instance there were
   two enclosures involved, but he did not think that would affect the
   validity of dealing with the evidence in that way.           Specific
   evidence, for instance in relation only to enclosure 4, would be
   dealt with appropriately.

  |The Coroner said he wished to remind everyone that the Inquests
   were not the Public Inquiry.     They should not expect therefore,
   because there had already been an Inquiry, that there would be a
Jfcrepeat of all that the Taylor Inquiry had done, although there
   would be some duplication and replication.

  The   Coroner    then  outlined  that  witnesses  did have   certain
  privileges    especially the right not      to answer  incriminating
  questions.     If any witnesses wished to exercise their right they
  would be entitled to do so.

  iThe Coroner said his present intention was to take evidence orally,
  jbut at least one witness had died and there may be others whq for
  imedical or other reasons would be unable to come.        There was
  however a huge pool of witnesses to cover relevant points.

  Tim King at this stage rose to say he had a number of submissions
  on the nature and ambit of the evidence, in particular the starting
  ipoints of events and the cut off point.
  j
   'The Coroner said he took the view that the cut off point was the
   jarrival of the first ambulance on the pitch which was about 3.15
Jfcjp.m.   This was a convenient marker, the time beyond this l?eing
^^outside    the scope of the Inquest.        The beginning was more
   jdifficult.  Clearly it would cover the events of the day and also
   'previous occurrences in evaluating the situation.   In principle it
   {would start on the day with events outside, would work into the
   'ground and more and more witnesses would be called as matters got
   jclo6er to the event itself.   As an example he might for instance
   jwant a summary of traffic conditions but would not be calling a lot
   jof evidence on that point.
  i
  He said he intended calling a number of categories of witnesses,
  the first being supporters, but that he would be sympathetic if
  they refused to attend. A supporter covered relatives, friend* and
  other contacts of the deceased and indeed anyone who could shed
  light on the events of the day.      The second category was local
  residents, the third were shopkeepers etc., the fourth were other
  independents, for example those professionally present such jas a
  media people, the fifth category were club employees, for example
  turnstile operators and stewards and the sixth category was of
  course the Police.   With regard to these there were a few [Police]
  and at least one other person whose statements were CJA Statements
  under PACE.  It was his normal practice at the moment if there was
such a Statement, to have it read out or played on an audio tape.
He said he would do that here and we would therefore hear those
|statements on audio tapes.

'The Coroner then said he would not circulate a list of witnesses in
 advance because

 1) This was an inquisitorial inquiry conducted by the Coroner.   The
•   books available to him indicated that it was quite proper for
j   him not to circulate them and he did not intend to do it.

 2) In relation to statements he certainly did not have the
j   administrative capacity to deal with the circulation of them.

(3)   He had circulated summaries at the first hearings and felt that
|     this had "bounced back” on him as representatives were not happy
!     that evidence actually given always coincided with what appeared
|     on the summaries.

|h « was therefore not prepared to circulate statements in advance
jfout would make available ^ names of proposed witnesses for i the
(following 1 to 3 days to give representatives some idea as to what
iw aB coming.   Also, witnesses would be allowed to refresh their
Memories from statements on the day, but he would not expect
witnesses to take statements with them into the witness box.

Regarding Lord Justice Taylor's Report, he did not intend to admit
Ithat report as part of the evidence at the Inquest.  To get it in
jas evidence he would have to read it in toto and this would not
;serve any useful purpose and would cause problems.

Similarly, the Transcripts would not be used.     He was fully aware
jthat all parties had and would have access to the Transcripts and
Jie would fully expect parties to look at them.    He  did  not mind
questioning on them so long as that questioning was relevant.     He
would not however permit a witness wh o wanted to exercise the right
hot to answer questions to have quotations put to him from the
Transcript.    He wanted representatives to use their common sense
and they would be allowed to ask legitimate questions.     There may
be odd occasions when he would have to breach what he had said
above and the Transcript would have to be used,       but he thouqht
jthis would be a rarity.

                to exhibits, he wished to restrict the number of
iocuments put in as exhibits.    He did not want hundreds of pages to
3* put before the Jury if they could not absorb them.     What he had
Ln m i n d was for example the Green Guide, which could be introduced
is an exhibit but he would not expect the Jury to read it from
sover to cover.        It would however be appropriate perhaps for
representatives to make reference to certain paragraphs.
 Tim King said in relation to the "mini Inquests” he had a growing
Inumber of instructions on individual cases, particularly as to
 factual matters.  He wishes to have the liberty to rectify factual
■omissions and inaccuracies from the earlier hearings, and asked if
|the Coroner would consider how best to deal with these if they were
 listed for him in writing.

The Coroner said that he did not intend re-opening all 95 on that
basis, although he himself had received correspondence on a number
of individual cases.    If the matters Mr. King was talking about
could be put properly to him and if he could consider them and as a
result felt a point was justified and legitimate and proper to deal
with, he would consider it sympathetically.

Tim King then said in relation to the cut off point, he wished to
make a submission that that should be extended to 4 p.m. as a
number of those represented felt the Inquests should go into the
medical attention given to those crushed in relation to the
allegation that there was an absence of proper medical care and
facilities which may have lead to death or indeed quicken the death
of those who had died.

 The Coroner said this was getting into legal submissions.  All had
jheard  what he had to say and that he could not give a ruling
Ibecause he was going beyond procedural aspects.   At the moment he
 was not pursuaded that he would want to go down that particular
 road.

 Tim King said he was equally concerned at the decision not to
 circulate the names of those the Coroner intended to call. He said
 the great advantage to having a list was that it would give an
Iopportunity to ask for further witnesses to be called.
i
jThe Coroner said he had already pre-empted this suggestion, as he
;had written to every represented body or individual asking if they
 had people to be considered as witnesses and had had only two or
 three replies.   The mere fact that a list was not circulated did
 not stop anyone suggesting someone should be called as a witness.

Tim King said there were a vast number of statements available and
he had been looking at it from the point of looking who would be
called and seeing if there were any ‘'omissions'* and not visa versa.

IThe Coroner said he would reconsider the point, but he did not know
 if he could oblige on it.

Tim King said that in relation to the Taylor Report there should be
certain paragraphs as to fact which could go before the Jury which
would help them and save time.  He outlined the underlining process
that he understood had been done for the Contribution Hearing and
suggested that that might be appropriate.
              90 11/01 12:13               S 02 74 735884     HflMMQNC SUDDfiPD               S1




                                    -6 -


The Coroner said one of the reasons why he was reluctant to do this
was because putting a paragraph before the Jury did not mean that
jit was necessarily accepted by everyone.

Tim King them asked whether the Taylor Transcript could be used in
jcross examination.

Th e Coroner said that was correct within certain limits.        His
■difficulty was, that the Public Inquiry had taken place on sliqhtly
different premises than his hearing and he was reluctant to ude it
ifor that reason.
!
i*Tim King then also queried whether video evidence would be used.

iThe Coroner said it was his intention            to use the Compilation \fideo
•and indeed one or two other videos,              for example the 1988 video.
iHe also stressed he had no facilities             for providing copies of any
Ivideos and would not distribute them.              If that was not acceptable
Jhe would rather not use videos, but he           did wish to do so.

Stuart Catchpole stated that in relation to the Taylor Report, it
would    be beneficial   if  the  Jury  could  see certain   agreed
paragraphs.    He indicated that he would be more than willing to
 participate in an attempt to agree certain paragraphs to go before
|the Jury.

5The Coroner said that may be an answer to the question and he would
ileave it up to the parties.  If they could all agree on some of the
iparagraphs going before the Jury then that would be acceptably, if
 they could not agree then the Taylor Report would not go before
ithem.
f
i
'Christopher Russell queried whether the categories outlined by the
ICoroner was the order in which they would be called.
!
 The Coroner stated he was not intending that being the case,                          that
’the evidence would effectively be taken chronologically.

    Christopher Russell queried whether the new matters relating to the
    earlier hearings mentioned by Tim King would be circulated to other
    parties, as these were questions which should be made public.

jThe Coroner said he would consider the point.

    Christopher Russell    made   the point that            providing    the      Jury with
    selected  parts  of     the   Taylor  Report             was  not     in      his  view
    satisfactory.

    The Coroner confirmed that if it could not be agreed between the
    parties then he would stick to what he had originally said.
  Vincent Hale said that Mr. Jackson for The Football Supporters
  Association had raised the question of undertakings and that he
  would be happy to give such an undertaking but may not be able to
  if other parties failed to go along with it.
  I
  iThe Coroner then asked for authority to circulate to all parties a
  jlist of the legal representatives and all agreed.

  -Paul Issacs then raised the following points:-
  !
  ID   Whether the video evidence was for instance to be shown at the
  I    beginning of the Inquest or to be shown to clarify certain
       points.

            The Coroner said he was   hoping that video could   be shown and
            that would be it as the   purpose was to give the   Jury an
            overview.  It was to be   used in that respect as   an aid but
            there may be times when   the video would have to   be re-examined.

            If the Taylor Report could not be used at all unless certain
            facts could be agreed by all parties, how far was it to be
            used at all.

       3)   Could the Taylor Transcripts be used for cross-examination
  i
  j
            purposes.

   Paul Issacs specified that he wished to make          legal submissions on
  !this point.

     The Coroner did not answer the second question but in relatipn to
     question 3. he said once again he knew all parties had copies of
    'the Transcripts but he would not allow the Transcript to be used to
    |put witnesses in a position where they would say that they would
A n o t answer a question, i.e. he would not allow anyone to pursue a
    'point which would be oppressive.   In certain other cases it may be
    !easier to use the Transcript to put points to them and that he
     wanted to be flexible and that he may Indeed have to modify his
    .stance on the Transcript.
  i                I
   ipaul Isaacs specifically asked the question if a witness said a, b
   land c on giving evidence but had previously to the Taylor Inquiry
    said x , y and z would he be able to cross-examine on that basics.
   !

    The Coroner said it would depend entirely on what the a, b and c
    and x , y and z was.   He then stated that on the point he would
   |clearly have to have a session on legal submissions.

      {Paul Issacs then raised the question of recalling witnesses after
      ithey had completed their evidence.
      i
      l
                                                         i
       The Coroner said he may have to do this from time to time.
 Belinda Norcliffe then asked whether the Coroner would permit
 documentation sent to him to be placed before the Jury, the
;intention not being  for the Jury to read Bundles from cover to
 cover, but for documents to be available for the Jury to "dip
Ii n t o 1*
I
i
              .
The Coroner said he was still considering this point.

!Christopher Russell then queried what the documents were and why
jthey had not been circulated to other parties.

 Belinda Norcliffe explained the documents were three volumes, the
 first two of which were volumes 1 and 2 of the South Yorkshire
!Folice documents to the Inquiry, and that volume 3 was a selection
Iof documents available at the Public Inquiry and the recent Civil
;Contribution Hearing.  There were no new documents as such.   They
 had not been sent to other parties but simply to the Coroner as it
|was his decision as to whether they were to go before the Jury or
inot.

|The Coroner again said he was still considering the matter and had
;not decided whether any party could put documentation in in the
 form of Bundles or whether he wished representatives to produce
|individual documents as and when they were referred to.      In any
|event he said 20 copies of items would be in his view required.

!Peter Jackson said with regard to undertakings he would be happy to
!liaise with any party.

jThe Coroner said he foresaw problems in anybody giving undertakings
jand that the matter may not be resolved.

 Peter Jackson then queried further whether the witness list would
 be available three full days in advance.
|
:The Coroner said he was hoping to do this showing at least those
 who had provisionally been called.

'peter Jackson then queried whether a daily transcript would be
Iavailable and the Coroner said he would refer to that point later.
I
jMrs. O'Brien stated she was very concerned about the cut off point.
|The Coroner pointed out that she was attempting to make a legal
 submission and that would have to be reserved for later.

jThe Coroner then established that no party had any other procedural
|points to raise and stated that he did intend to have Transcripts
javailable on a next day basis.      He requested that any party who
 wanted   daily   transcripts   should  write   to  him   before  the
Icommencement of the Inquests, but parties would of course be
 charged.   He would also happily arrange for odd days to be provided
 on that basis but he would have to have sufficient notice of this
 for it be possible.
!With relation to the length of the Inquests, the Coroner said he
 was unable to specify how long they would last, but that the
 hearing would end for Christmas on the 18th or 19th December.   He
;did not think the Inquests would have finished by then and theplan
 was   to resume on the 7th January and to continue until they were
 finished.   He pointed out that illness, for instance amongst the
jJury, may lead to adjournments.
i

IWith regard to witnesses, he is going to try and group them
;together and further he would be surprised if there were     less
 witnesses to be called than at the Taylor Inquiry (174) and there
 could possibly be more.

   On the 28th November, 6th December and 9th January it would not be
   possible to use    the Council's Chamber as Council meetings  were
>1taking place and       in relation to the 28 th November, he was
 i considering taking the Jury out for a further site visit to
   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.
    i
     The Coroner said he did intend to call a few expert witnesses right
     at the end of the Inquests but he wished to make it clear that
     their   evidence would be restricted to what is relevant to an
    !Inquest and would not therefore be the same as evidence which would
     be given at a Civil Trial.

                He then pointed out that the press would of course be entitled to
        S        be present throughout the Inquests themselves.
        i
        i
        !In relation to   running order, he intended to ask questions first
        1and the only other rule was that if any witness was the witness of
        ia particular party then they would question the witness last.
        1Apart from that the representatives should agree amongst themselves
         the order for questioning witnesses.

            IThe   Coroner  said   it appeared    there would be various legal
              submissions made to him and these would have to be dealt with at a
            I further meeting which was set for the    morning of the 19th November
            j and he would arrange   for the Jury to attend only on the afternoon
             |of that day.

            iStuart Catchpole queried whether the list for the first three days
            !witnesses would be available for Monday the 19th and the Coroner
            Iconfirmed this would be sent through to representatives.

            !T i m King asked the Coroner to consider again the question of
            !circulating a full witness list.   The Coroner said if he decided to
            {do this prior to the 19th, he would circulate it to parties, and if
            j not representations should be made again on the 19th.   The Coroner
            ! at this stage said another reason      for him being reluctant to
            j circulate the list was that it could be that once evidence, gets
            ! under way certain witnesses on the list could effectively come
            j superfluous and would be removed and he was wary of the parties
              relying on his original list as definitive.
Tim King ^aid he appreciated the point the Coroner was making but
it would still be easier for all if a list was available.

The Coroner said he would give serious consideration to the point.

     D ea r Sir,
     Police A u t h o r i t y Funding for Legal Repres en ta t iv e
     I w rite in r esponse to p revious c or re s po nd e nc e and y o u r various enquiries
     c o n c e r n i n g financial a ss istance at the f or th coming Inquests.
     F o l lo w in g the pre -i n qu es t s rev ie w of the 30 October I confirm my view that
     r e p r e s en ta t io n by j u n io r Counsel will be required t h r o u g ho ut the full period
     of the Inquests, subject to variation, as the Inquests progress. I am happy
     to adv is e you that Miss Add le m an 's brief fee is £ 3 , 50 0 and for each day
     f o l lo w in g the 19 Nov em b er her fee will be £ 3 5 0. 0 0 per day. As you may now be
     aware, the j ury will rise on the 18/19 D e c em b er and will resume on the 7 January.
     If the Inquests con ti n ue beyond the 14 Janua r y 1991, then I have agreed provision
     for Cou ns e l' s d aily ret ai n er to be increased to £400 per day. T here will, of
     course, be this firm's fees in addition and for gui da n ce only I would not
     exp ec t these to exc ee d £7,000.
    I hope the said information is of some assistance and I take this o pp or tunity

 Dear Mr. Hayes,

re: Police Authority Funding for Legal Representation

I refer to our telephone conversation of the 1st November.     As I understand
matters you are now in possession of all the information that you need prior
to making representations to the Police Authority with regard to the provision
of funding for legal representation for the various Officers involved in the
Hillsborough inquest.

Following our discussion I have had some further thought with regard to relevant
matters and I would ask that if at all possible a full investigation be made
with regard to the policy cover provided to the South Yorkshire Police bv
their Public Liability Insurers.

It is clear that the Officers    involved who require representation at the
inquest were acting in the course of their employment when   the Hillsborough
disaster occurred.     Enquiries should therefore be made to see whether any
existing policies provided to the Constabulary provide cover for individual
Officers should they be involved in an inquest arising out of the course of
their employment.

I am of course not aware of the policy terms applicable but do however know
from my personal experience that many motor policies and employers' liability
policies provide cover for representation at Coroners inquests.          I do not
know whether such cover should extend to providing cover for individuals as
potentially there might be conflict between an employer and an employee.

The   above       queries         are      relevant because                     the Allianz               Cornhill have written to


                                                                                                                         /Cont1d
                                                         Offices also at Lloyd’s and in Hong Kong
                                        Regulated by the Law Society in the conduct of investment business
                                      .2.


me saying

"We also understand that civil claims have already been intimated against
the relevant Police Authority, with the Chief Constable being named as the
nominal Defendant, and that a separate insurance policy operates in this regard.
We understandthat the insurance policy      would cover the Police Authority for
representation    at an inquest, we wonder whether it could be argued that cover
should also be given to individual Police Officers attending the inquest___
We should also however point out that under the terms of our policy, should
there be another insurance policy under which the Insured can claim, then
our liability would be limited".

As we would wish if at all possible to preserve as much of Mr. Greenwood's
fund as is available for his own private representation at potential future
private prosecutions, disciplinary proceedings or other relevant proceedings,
I am sure you will understand the reason that I raise the above questions.

I am sure that all the Officers concerned are extremely worried with regard
to their positions.      It would appear to me that if the Officers concerned
are not able to take advantage of the existing Force insurance policies, the
Police Authority, with the assistance of Home Office funding, should provide
an indemnity in respect of future costs that may or may not be incurred.

I am aware of the fact that there has been considered the possibility of a
lump sum    being provided.   This however would not be satisfactory as unless
it was a     very substantial sum it could not be said to be potentially fully
adequate.      If however theAuthority left the question of the exact sum open
but confirmed that the Officers concerned would be indemnified over and above
the £50,000 for funding of legal representations for any claim, civil or
criminal    court proceedings or internal  disciplinary proceedings, this would
be equitable     in the current circumstances.     Benefits to the Authority in
such a proposition is that they may well not be called upon to make any payment
if no such proceedings occur.

I trust the above comments are of assistance to you.    If you need any further
advice please do not hesitate to contact me.

NOTE FOR FILE:


SPECIAL POLICE AUTHORITY - 2 NOVEMBER 1990


The  purpose of the meeting was for the Authority to consider a request from
six   police officers involved  in the Hillsborough tragedy for financial
assistance for legal funding.

The    Police Authority     papers    attached      hereto     were circulated           before    the
meeting.

The document headed 'Special Police Authority Meeting - 2 November 1990'
was used by me, read out word-for-word and then copies immediately circulated
to members in order that they could be precisely aware of what I had just
told them.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield together with Superintendents Greenwood,
Marshall and Murray all made personal submissions to the Authority.

Mr   Stephen Walker (MMI) thenaddressed members                on    the     position     regarding
the Force insurance cover.

A discussion then followed.

Councillor Whitfield raised doubts as              to   the aspects     of    "good faith".          I
gave her strong advice on this point.

Councillor Cromar expressed doubts as to whether the officers had exercised
their judgment reasonably.

Councillor Gallimore - from          the   Chair    - made     it    clear    he   would     not    be
supporting the application.

Mr Stephen Walker (Joint Secretariat) advised that potential conflict clearly
existed sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Circular.

In terms of risk he said that unless significant or substantial new evidence
emerged at the Inquest it was unlikely the Director of Public Prosecutions
would change his decision that insufficient evidence existed for criminal
proceedings.   That if private prosecutions are brought the Director will
take them over and offer no evidence.   That the Marchioness Judicial Review
had been dismissed - what he did not say was that this decision had been
further appealed but he concluded that clearly the risk factor does exist.

The meeting,     on   a   recorded   vote,   decided     not    to    support      the    officers'
application.

The magistrates were supportive throughout.

                                                                                   RELEASE FOLLOWING P.A.
                                                                                   DECISION OF 2.11.90
     It    would    be     hard    to   pretend     that       I'm     not       very    disappointed

     at    our     Police       Authority's       decision.            My    view       is     that    the

     officers       were        performing       public        duty     on       the     day    of     the

     Hillsborough          tragedy.        Any    acts    or    decisions          they      made     were

     therefore      unequivocally           in the public         domain.           My request for

     assistance         with     funding    does    not       relate        to   some    activity       in

     their private lives, but their action as public servants, acting

     in good faith under the most trying of circumstances.                                      I think

     it is a legitimate use of public                     funds        to allow such officers

     adequate       legal         representation         at      the        forthcoming          inquest




••
     hearing, to ensure that the fullest and fairest body of evidence

     is    available       to the       public    advantage.           The       private       insurance

     they have is likely to be insufficient to promote that advantage

     and       should    not,     anyway,    be    allowed       to    divert          attention      from

     the fundamental principle of public funding.




     As    a    result     of    today's     decision      the       officers          are   likely     to

     be    less     well        represented       than    other        organisations            with    an

     interest       in    the     outcome    of    the    proceedings.             That      cannot     be

     right.


••
At    a    special    Police    Authority       meeting        held   on    Friday       2 November       1990,      the
Authority was requested             to consider the payment of the legal costs of four of
our members and two constables who were involved in the Hillsborough tragedy at
                   m>—   ^ b Ui "T*         I“T •11•fa .
the friiP44rrMii*Bg inquest.     The submission of the Deputy Chief Constable fully
recommended approval and pointed out that the four members of the superintending
ranks had       funded    themselves      up    to now       through a locally negotiated voluntary
legal      insurance     package     which,       in    some      cases,    is     in    real    danger    of    being
exhausted.


The Police Authority refused the application.


In a statement         issued inmediately following the meeting,                         the Chief Constable of
South       Yorkshire,     Mr      Richard       Wells,        issued       a     statement       expressing         his
disappointment at the decision and pointing out that it cannot be right for the
officers      involved    to be     less well          represented      than other organisations at                  the
forthcoming inquest.


At a special meeting of the South Yorkshire Police Superintendents' Association
today,      members    echoed      the   views     of    the Chief         Constable       in expressing          their
surprise and disappointment at the Police Authority's decision.


It    is   appreciated      that    in    these       days   of    increasing        accountability when             all
expenders       of   the public      purse      are     constrained,        all    bids    for expenditure           are
subjected to the most careful scrutiny.


At the same time it is most important that commanders of large numbers of police
officers      should     face   their     daily       responsibilities          confidently,        secure      in   the
knowledge that         their Police Authority is supporting than, providing, of course,
that they do their duty in good faith.


Police officers are not political animals and do not wish to become embroiled in
any    public    slanging match          with    the Police Authority.                   In     these most      trying
circumstances,        however,     we    feel     that we       ought      to make       public our       feeling of
being let down and somewhat isolated by those whose job it is to support us.


We can do no better than quote an extract from the speech of the Home Secretary,
Mr    David   Waddington,       Q.C.,     to    the     National      Meeting       of    the    Superintendents'
Association held in Blackpool as recently as the 25 September 1990 when he said:
"In     the      aftermath    of   a     nunber    of    major       and   tragic    incidents,    including
Hillsborough, your members have been put under the microscope and you have asked
me    to   look into    the arrangements           for     legal representation of police officers
vrfien litigation arises.              You point     out      that the relevant Home Office Circular
does not require police authorities to provide legal representation,                               but gives
than discretion         in this        area.      In that      respect     the circular      reflects,   as it
must,      the    statutory    position.          But    it   does    encourage     police    authorities   to
exercise      their discretion wherever              the guidelines are met.              I very much hope

that authorities will do this."

            Dear Mr Johnston

             I refer to the Police Authority meeting held on 2 November 1990 regarding
             the funding of legal representation for four members of this branch of
             the Police Superintendents' Association.

             I write to you on behalf of these officers, and request that you forward
             to me, as a matter of urgency, the full reasons for the refusal of that
             application.

            Yours sincerely

   SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY DISCUSS HILLSBOROUGH LEGAL COSTS

      A special meeting of South Yorkshire Police Authority will be
   held on Friday (November 16) to reconsider the position on meeting
   the legal costs of police officers involved in legal proceedings
   arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy.
      The meeting was called following representations made by
   solicitors acting for one of the officers involved, Superintendent
   David Duckenfield.
     The Authority stressed today (Monday, November 12) that the
  decision to call a special meeting had been taken prior to the
  news that the Su pe r i n t e n d e n t s ’ Association intends to apply for
  leave for a High Court judicial review of,the Authority’s earlier
  decision to refuse to meet the o f f i c e r s ’ legal costs,
     Stephen Walker, Assistant Chief Officer (Legal), for the
  Authority, said today : "It comes as no surprise to us that the
  Association is following this course of action , though we have as
  yet received no official notification of proceedings. We had
  already heard from the Police Federation that they Intended to
  seek a judicial review on behalf of their members, though again we
  have not received any papers.
     "As far as the proceedings themselves are concerned, the
  Authority does not wish to make further comment pending the
  outcome of F riday’s meeting."

     Six   officers   applied to the Authority to exercise its
  discretion under Home Office guidelines to meet their legal costs
  arising out of the Inquests on the Hillsborough victims which are
  due to be heard in Sheffield later this month. The Authority
  decided at that stage to refuse to meet their costs.
     The special meeting of the Authority will take place at 10.00
  am on Friday at South Yorkshire Joint Secretariat, Regent Street,
  Barnsley.

D ear   Sir,

                     occasioned      by the Hi 11sborough tragedy.
Our clients made an application to the Police Authority for financial
                       them with le9al representation at the forthcoming
h n l t i ’ u ’" application was made in the light of Home Office circular,
      3 d i 6 u"derstand that their request was denied, at a special meeting
of the Police Authority held on the 2nd November.                           9
We believe that the decision of the Police Authority was unreasonable and
we have instructions to challenge it by means of an application for
judicial review. We intend to make that application early next week        It
seems to us that the Home Secretary, as the author-of..the circular in : :

the committee which met, and if you will supply us with the-reasons which

Chief Superintendent 0 G Duckenfield -
Hillsborough Inquests

As you are aware, we represent Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in
respect of his position in connection with his personal legal position
arising out of the Hillsborough disaster. You know that the Sheffield
Coroner is due to resume the Inquests on the 19th November 1990. It is
our view, and one shared by our Counsel, that" Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield is at risk if not properly legally represented at the
Inquests.

We have received a note of the reasons for the decision not to provide
funding from Mr S Walker.

As you will know, both the South Yorkshire .Chief Constable,: ^Richard.
Wells, and the Deputy Chief Constable, Peter Hayes, wholly Buppertfi
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's application. You are aware of the
submissions in support. There is no question that our Client was acting
other than in good faith in the performance of his public duty on the day
of the tragedy.

So far as we are aware, ftM the other main interested .parties,
to be legally represented throughout the heading, . ..i»e,..toow                                                     *

CONTIM ATIuN




    1.

           It has been made clear to us, in writing, that notwithstanding
           that the DPP has decided that at present there is "insufficient"
           evidence to support a prosecution, the door remains open such that
           any new or additional evidence which comes to light in the
           Coroner's Inquests will be sent to the DPP for further
           consideration of the criminal matters.

    2.

           We attach extracts from the press relating to the possibility of a
           private prosecution following in the wake of the DPP's decision.
           It seems to us that there is every likelihood that such a private
           prosecution may be attempted if fresh evidence’ comes to light
           during the course of the forthcoming Inquest.

    3.

               Chief Superintendent Duckenfield is subject to five such Notices
               and the question of disciplinary proceedings will follow the
               conclusion of the Inquests.

    It seems to us that one thing is certain which may affect the above,
    that nobody can foresee what evidence mav arise out of the Inquests. We
    have today received from the Coroner a provisional list of the witnesses
    who the Coroner may decide to call. The list exceeds 200 in number.    We
    are told that the great majority of those witnesses did not give evidence
    at the Public Inquiry. They mav not have given evidence in the DPP
    investigations. There is, therefore, quite likely to be new evidence
    which emerges and which is likely to come to the attention of the DPP.

    The risks are very real. Your assessment of the risk to Chief
    Superintendent Duckenfield is "small", whereas, our view is that the risk
    is considerable. Without the appropriate legal representation, any risk
    cannot be adequately guarded against. You are aware that the legal
    representatives of the Chief Constable have confirmed that there exists a
    potential conflict of interest between the Chief Constable and Chief
    Superintendent Duckenfield, .and that. ..accordingly, be ,rtquiir*®,-:fepa!ra%e,
    representation.

    The effect of the decision to reject the application, ' is that Chief.
    Superintendent Duckenfield will not have the representation which he
    requires in order that his interests are protected. Our Client has been ,
    at risk since the tragedy and hence his private funds have been seriously
    depleted. The funds-.'left-available to him under, the temsy.ef ..Ms private .

   In all the circumstances, therefore, we would ask you to take immediate
   steps^ to reconvene a meeting of the Authority to reconsider their
   decision and exercise their discretion in his favour for the reasons set
   out above. As time is of the essence, may we please hear from you within
   the next 48 hours.

   Would you please not hesitate to contact the Writer, Mr Coughlin, should
   you require any further information and should any personal

    • Dear Member
       APPLICATION BY POLICE OFFICERS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT IN CONNECTION
       WITH THE INQUESTS INTO THE DEATHS OF PEOPLE AT THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
       Further to the meeting of the Police Authority on 2 November, when it was
       resolved to reject the applications at that stage. I enclose a copy of a
       letter I have since received from the Solicitors acting for Chief
       Superintendent Duckenfield and in the light of the information in that
       letter, I have decided to reconvene the Police Authority to reconsider the
       applica t ions.
       You will no doubt see and hear through the media in the next few days if
       this has not already been brought to your attention, that both the Police
       Federation and the Superintendents Association are to make application to
       the court for a judicial review of the A u t h o r i t y ’s decision on the 2
       November. Copies of the correspondence I have so far received in this
       connection are also enclosed and it will be my intention to update members
       on this at the meeting on Friday.
       For m e m b e r s ’ assistance, also enclosed is the original report of the Chief
       Constable in support of the applications.

     The Police      Authority      reconsidered        their   previous        decision    not     to
provide financial support to six police officers at the C o r o n e r ’s Inquest in
the light of new information.


     After receiving legal representations on behalf of Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield   and        the Superintendents Association and the Police Federation,
the Authority reaffirmed this decision having considered the terms                         of     Home
Office   advice     to     police   authorities in 1987 but are prepared to consider
retrospective application as envisaged             in    the    advice     if    events     at    the
Coroners inquest showed such assistance should be granted.

The    Police       Authority        had       a     lengthy       and     serious      debate     about

what they regard as a most important issue.                                   They have decided,

at     least    for      the    time         being,     that        they    cannot       support       the

officers' application for public funding.



The     threat      of      further          legal    proceedings           in   respect      of       this

decision       is     now    reactivated,             and     that       prevents     any    statement

in detail about this morning's discussion.



I am naturally              very     disappointed that                representation from the

officers'        advocates,          added         to by my         personal     representations,

have     not    met      with       the      success        I had     hoped      for.       The    Police

Authority        has        left    a     door       ajar     of    reviewing        their    decision

once inquest proceedings have reached conclusion on the evidence

 available.



 Our    position         was    always         that    the     best        evidence     would      emerge

 for the public good - whether beneficial or otherwise to South

 Yorkshire          Police      -       in    assisting        those        conclusions,          if    the

 financial          backing         of       the     Police        Authority      was       immediately

 assured.        That instant backing will not now be available.

Councillor Sir John Layden
Chairman
South Yorkshire Police Authority


Rotherham




May I record my grave disappointment at the most recent decision of the
Police Authority, at their special meeting on 16 November, not to support
in respect of financial aid our officers who are at risk of legal
proceedings arising out of the Hillsborough disaster.

I quite appreciate how seriously the straitened circumstances of the
police budget are felt by your members and they do have to consider how
best to deploy those limited funds on behalf of the community charge
payer.

Nonetheless, Friday's decision will appall South Yorkshire's police
officers and civil staff alike.    The previous day, Colin Sampson as HMI
was describing to the Police Authority members who were able to attend
the luncheon which marked the end of the Inspection, just how well the
Force was performing; we are, he said, leading the table of 10 Forces
for which he has inspectoral responsibility, and he takes away many
aspects of good practice to share with other Forces.       All of this is
achieved with, in the same group of Forces, the lowest level of per capita
financing and the lowest investment in technological support.

The link between this high achievement and the low financial input is
called, simply, goodwill.     I am afraid that  the Authority'sdecision
not to support the officers at risk will make a serious inroad into that
goodwill and I for one will readily understand such damage.  I have been
restrained in my public comments but I am alarmed at the decision and
the clear implications it has for our morale.

The opportunity for the Authority to review its decision at the end of
the   inquest can  provide   little  comfort  to  the   likes  of  Chief
Superintendent David Duckenfield, whose funds are, even now, almost
completely spent; he faces a further five or six weeks minimum - may
be as long as 12 weeks - at real risk.    In the light of your decision,
he must now look to defend himself, though I have - I am most sad to
report - authorised a national collection to provide him with immediate
help.
I cannot say how the process of judicial review will work out, but it
may well support the Police Authority, for you have clear discretion
whether or not to award support.     'Success* for your Authority in thi
r e ^ d will not, : fear, much detract from the public feeling aroused
by Friday's decision.    The Authority could so easily, and with ample
justification, have decided to support the officers and could have at
the same time, as advised by the advocates, sough* to have the lawyers
fees 'taxed' to reduce the burden falling on the taxpayer.

I will be encouraging the Force to overcome their bitter disappointment
but felt that you should know, more in sorrow than in anger, how very
badly I feel about what has happened.

 19   o c t o b e r 1990   AND 2 NOVEMBER 1990
 REPORT BY THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


 1*     Matter for Consideration

1.1     The provision of financial assistance to police officers involved in
        legal proceedings arising from the events at Hillsborough Pootball
        Ground on 15 April 1989.


2.      Background Information

2.1     Home Office Circular No. 77/1987, published    on 4 December 1987 and
        adopted by this Authority on 8 April 1988, provides guidance to Police
        Authorities in considering applicatiohs, on behalf of police officers,
        for financial assistance in legal proceedings.

2.2     The central principle which should guide consideration of individual
        cases is that, where a police authority considers that an officer has
        acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that the interests
        of the force as a whole are involved, the       officer should have the
        support of the police authority to ensure that he has the services
        of a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket.

2.3     After the publication of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor
       into the Hillsborough Disaster the Chief Constable of the West Midlands
       Police was appointed    to enquire into the     possibility of criminal
       proceedings arising from the disaster.     At that time an application
       for   financial assistance   was  received   from  Chief  Superintendent
       Duckenfield, the officer in command at Hillsborough on the day of the
       disaster.

2.4    At the time of that application it was acknowledged that similar
       applications for assistance, under the terms of Home Office Circular
       No.77/1987, could be anticipated from other officers directly involved
       in legal proceedings arising from the Hillsborough Disaster.

2.5    The application from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was considered
       by the Finance and General Purposes Committee on 15 September 1989
       when the matter was deferred for further consideration of the role
       of the Authority's insurers.

2.6    Following advice from the Authority's insurers and solicitors, Chief
       Superintendent Duckenfield obtained independent legal representation
       from solicitors engaged through his staff association and financed
       by his personal legal insurance.

2.7    The funds available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield under this
       policy amounted to £50,000.   His solicitors have advised him that that
       amount may be exhausted by one or both of the on-going Civil
       Contributions Hearing and the forthcoming Coroner's Inquest.
                                    - 2 -


2.8   A further application has now been received from Chief Superintendent
      Duckenfield for his original application to be re-considered and, as
      anticipated,   similar  applications   have   now  been received from
      Superintendents Marshall, Greenwood and Murray; and an application
      has also been received from Russell Jones and Walker, solicitors, on
      behalf of Police Constables Smith and Illingworth.

2.9   All officers making application have been the direct subject of
      enquiries by the Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police arising
      from allegations of criminal conduct received from third parties.


3     Comment
                       •
3.1   Following the disaster and throughout the Public Inquiry conducted
      by Lord Justice Taylor, the interests of the Police Authority, the
      Chief Constable and all officers of the Porce were represented by legal
      officers appointed by the Police Authority insurers.     In relation to
      the subsequent criminal enquiry and possible proceedings the insurers
      indicated to seven South Yorkshire Police officers that a possibility
      of conflict could arise between the interests of the Porce and each
      of them independently. The question of separate legal representation
      was considered, one officer continued to be represented by the insurers
      and the six applicants obtained independent representation.

3.2   Members will be aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions, having
      considered the evidence resulting from the enquiry by the West Midlands
      Police, announced on 30 August 1990 his decision that there was
      insufficient evidence to justify criminal proceedings against any South
      Yorkshire Police officer.    There are, however, certain civil actions
      under-way and the Coroner's Inquest into the deaths at Hillsborough
      will resume on 19 November 1990.

3.3 At the Coroner's Inquest the officers concerned are likely to be called
     upon to give evidence.   It is acknowledged that cross examination by
     Counsel representing other parties may be prejudicial to the individual
     officers in respect of their personal liabilities.      These officers
     consider it necessary to continue to be independently represented at
     this hearing where the Chief Constable's legal representative cannot
     reasonably be expected to represent the separate interests of each
     of them.

3.4   It will be seen from paragraph 13 of the Home Office Circular that
      separate representation should be provided at a Coroner’s Inquest where
       (a) the Chief Officers legal representative cannot reasonably be
      expected to represent the interests of such officers and, (b) the Police
      Authority considers that such interests should be represented.        In
       such cases the authority should, in the terms of the Circular, provide
       financial assistance to the individual officers concerned.

3.5 It will be noted at paragraph 14 of the Circular that an officer wishing
     to seek financial assistance from his police authority should have
     the opportunity in advance of the proceedings to submit to the Chief
     Constable an application for financial assistance. The Chief Constable
     is obliged to put    such application to the authority for decision.
     It will be further seen that the applying officer should normally be
     given the opportunity by the police -authority to aake representations
     to them if he wishes to do so.
3.6   The events at Eillsborough were extraordinary in respect of the
      potential  individual  liability  of police officers    involved.   The
      officers were acting in good faith in accordance with established
      practice. The nature of the various investigation into the Hillsborough
      Disaster also means that the interests of the South Yorkshire Police,
      as a whole, are involved.    For these two reasons (see para 2.2 ante)
      it is recommended that these officers should have the support of the
      Police Authority to ensure that they each have the services of a lawyer
      representing their individual interests, at the forthcoming Coroner's
      Inquest.

3.7   It would be sensible for the officers concerned to retain the services
      of those lawyers who currently represent them throughout subsequent
      proceedings.


4     Financial Implications

4.1   The cost of independent representation has to date been net by personal
      legal insurance arranged through The Superintendents' Association for
      Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendents Marshall, Murray,
      and Greenwood.   Constables Smith and Illingworth, meanwhile, have been
      represented by Messrs Russell Jones and Walker, the Police Federation
      solicitor, paid for by central Police Federation funds.

4.2   The extent of future costs will be determined by the time taken to
      conclude the Inquest.   There is no specific provision in the Revenue
      Budget for these costs.


5     Recommendation

5.1   The Authority is recommended to approve a commitment to provide
      financial  assistance   for  legal representation at the forthcoming
      Inquest, to the officers concerned, in accordance with the principles
      of Home Office Circular No.77/1987.

        From:       Chief Superintendent Duckenfield                Station/Dept:
        To:         The Chief Constable                             Date:       21 September 1990



                SUBJECT:     Hillsborough Disaster - Funding for Legal Representation

                On 2M August 1989 I made application under Home Office Circular
                No 77/87 for yourself and the Police Authority to give due
                consideration for funds to be made available for my legal
                representation in connection with any proceedings which nay arise
                from the Hillsborough Disaster.

                These proceedings are currently the Civil Hearings due to begin in
                Manchester on 2 October to be followed by the Coroner's Inquest on
                19 November 1990. There is also the possibility that Discipline
                Proceedings may follow at a later stage.

                Whilst the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect
                of Criminal Matters has been favourable it is not unreasonable to
                assume that if further evidence came to light he would reconsider
                the position with regard to myself and other officers.

                There is also the stated intention, admittedly via the media, by
                families of the deceased that they intend to launch a private
                prosecution for manslaughter against officers of South Yorkshire
                Police.

                It is therefore of paramount importance that the best independent
                legal advice possible is available for myself and other officers.

                My previous application for financial assistance was, as I understand
                it, 'left on the table' in the knowledge that I had insurance cover
                for my legal defence up to the sum of £50,000.

                If I require legal representation at the Civil Hearings and Coroner's
                Inquest it is likely that my defence costs will exceed the sum assured
                and I will require additional funding (bearing in mind Discipline
                and Private Prosecution).

                I ask for urgent reconsideration of my request in the hope that a
                contribution could be made towards my legal defence costs or an
                agreement to meet all reasonable expenditure over and above the sum
                assured.

                I have attached a letter from my solicitor and copies of previous
                papers.

Chief Superintendent D G Duckenfield




Dear David

Hillsborough

As you are aware, we are obtaining Counsel's Advice as to your personal
position in relation to the forthcoming civil hearing in Manchester
commencing on 2nd October and the Coroner's Inquests which are due to
resume on 19th November 1990.

In addition to representing your interests at the above, your position
will also need consideration and yourself possible representation at the
disciplinary hearing, as and when this commences.

Finally,   there is,   of course,   the spectre                                               of             a   possible   private
prosecution which may arise at some stage.

It seems likely that the present funds available under the Allianz
Personal Law Plan may well be exhausted by one or both of the Civil and
Coroner's hearings. Can we impress upon you, therefore, that you Bake the
strongest representations both to the Home Office and to the Chief
Superintendent's Association to ascertain the availability t>f funds to
assist you with legal representation. This must be carried out as a
matter of priority for you, based on the time scale for the various
hearings.

              SUBJECT:       APPLICATION FOR FIMAMCIAL ASSISTAMCE


                The interim report of the Inquiry by the Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor into
                the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster that occurred on the 15 April 1 9 8 9 was
                published at 1100 hours on Friday M August 1989. The report was very
                critical of the South Yorkshire Police in general and, In particular, myself
                and a number of other police officers.

               National media interest    and comments followed publication and, in view of
               the extensive criticism    in the report regarding my handling of events on
               the day of the disaster    and the possibility of actions of criminal
               negligence/disciplinary    proceedings, I was suspended from duty on the 4
               August 1 9 8 9 .

               The Director of Public Prosecutions was, I understand, requested       to examine
               Lord Justice Taylor’s Interim Report and subsequently instructed       the West
               Midlands Police to carry out a full criminal investigation, ’not       limited
               to the criminal culpability of the police alone’ into the events       that
               occurred at Hillsborough on the 1 5 April 1989 .

               Whilst no criminal charges have been brought to date against me, the
               possibility of charges being brought exists and I will, no doubt, be
               interviewed by the West Midlands Police during the course of their criminal '
               investigations. There is also a possibility of interviews in respect of
               disciplinary allegations made against me for whidh a Regulation 7 Notice
               has been served.

               I was authorised to obtain independent legal advice from Hammond Suddards
               resulting in being advised by them to obtain further private independent
               legal advice as Hammond Suddards could not assist me personally as no
               criminal charges had been made. I m now obtaining independent legal advice
               through a personal Legal Protection Insurance Policy.

               The policy gives a maximum cover of £50,000. If I need legal representation
               at interviews with the West Midlands Inquiry Team regarding possible
               criminal or disciplinary matters and at protracted inquest hearings, which
               are unlikely to take place until early 1990, then there is little doubt
               my legal costs will be very much in excess of this figure.

               If any criminal proceedings are brought against members of the South
               Yorkshire Police (and manslaughter charges are possible), it is Imperative,
               in the interests of the force, the Police Authority and any individual
               officer, that those concerned have had the benefit of the best possible
               legal advice and representation at any forthcoming Judicial hearings.

               Whilst the force has been, and continues to be, legally represented matters
               are very complex and conflict of interest can arise in areas concerning
               different individuals.

     FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     I.   Hatter for Considerstion

          The provision of financial assistance to police officers involved la
          1*1*1 proceedings arising fro* the event at Hillsborough Football Ground
          on 15 April 1989.


 2.       Background Information                                                    V . ,
                                                                                     ✓

 2.1      Hone Office Circular Ho. 77/1987, published on 4 December 1987, provides
          guidance to Police Authorities on the exercise of tfcair discretion in
 I        considering applications, on behalf of police officers, for financial
 W        assistance towards the cost of legal advice and representation arising
          from involvement in legal proceedings which result from the pursuance, in
          good faith, of their duties or where the interests of the Force as
          whole are involved. A copy of the Circular is attached.

 2.2      Arising from the publication of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor
          into the Hillsborough Disaster, the subsequent appointment of the Chief
          Constable of the Vest Midlands Police to enquire into the justification
          for criminal proceedings arising from the dissster and the forthcoming
          Coroner'a Inquest into the deaths, an application for assistsnce has been
          received from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield who was involved in
          command of the policing arrangements for the football Semi-Final and
          similar applications from other officers similarly involved might be   ■ '
          anticipated.


 3.       Comment

          Following the disaster and throughout the Public Inquiry the interests of
IP        the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and all officera of the Force
          have been represented by legal officers sppointed by the Police Authority
          insurers. The legal officera appointed by the inaurera have indicated
          that in relation to criminal proceedings they would be unable to provide
          representation for individual officera who should seek independent legal
          advice and repreaentation.

 3.2      It will be seen from the Borne Office Circular Bo. 77/1987, that the
          central principle which should guide consideration of Individual cases is
          that, where a Police Authority considers that an officer tea actod in
          good faith in pursuance of his duties or that where the lntereats of the
          Force aa a whole are Involved, the officer should have the support of the
          Police Authority to enaure that he haa the aervicea of a lawyer and that
          he ahould not be out of pocket.


 3.3      it will be further seen that in respect of criminal proceedinga puraued
          by the Crown Proaecution Service againat an individual officer he rtould
          be expected to bear the coata of hie own defence and the Police
      Authority, at the conclusion of the proceedings, art able to consider, on
      the full facts, whether or not to reimburse any expenses Incurred by the
      officer snd not awarded by the trisl court, oven where proceedings have
      resulted in conviction in certain clrcuastsnces. It will be noted fro*
      paragraph 14 of the Circulsr that an officer wlahlng to seek financial
      assistance should have the opportunity to submit to the Chlsf Officer sn
      spplication for financial aasistsnce, upon receipt of which the Chief
      Officer should refer the spplication to the Police Authority together
      with his own recommendation. It will be further ssen that ths applying
      officer should normally be given the opportunity by the Police Authority
      to make repreaentationa to them If he wlahea to do so. At this stage
      Chief Superintendent Duckenfield wishes to reserve the right to so appear
      at a future date If nacssssry.

3.4   The events at Hillsborough were unique in respect of the potential
      criminal liability of.police officers Involved. The officers were acting
      in good faith In accordance with well eatabllahed practicea and any
      criminal proceedings will largely constitute a teat case similar to the
      example provided in paragraph three of the Home Office Circular, fha
      unique nature of the circumstances of this particular criminal MqpijrJ
      with its wide implication for the interests of tl^k force as a whole is
      such that the Police Authority may wiah to conslg^i* at this stage, a
      commitment to the funding of Independent legal* MWice for the offlcer(a)
      concerned. The financial commitment of the officers is likely to#C
      commence with advice and representation prior to amd tfurlng interviews
      undertaken by Vest Midlands Police officers in the eourss of thelr*^^;:*>
      enquiry. It would be prudent for that repreaentatlon to continue ~'A
      throughout the enquiry and any subsequent criminal proceedings and to
      extend to representation at the Coroner's Inquest Which will ultimately
      be held.

3.5   At this stage it is anticipated that representation in any civil actions
      subsequently pursued will be provided by the Police Authority insurers.

3.6   It should be noted that there is available, to all officers of
      superintendent snd chief superintendent rank who liave chosen to
      contribute, a measure of personal liability Insurance arranged by the
      Superintendents’ Association of England and Vales. The individual
      liability limit of this insurance cover is £50,000.


4.    financial Implications

      It is not possible at this stage to assess the flnsndsl impllcstlons of
      this matter which will depend entirely on the courae and axtent of the
      criminal enquiry and the ultimate outcome, and the duration of the
      Inquest proceedings. There la no specific provision in ths fcevsnue
      Budget for this expenditure.


5.    lecommendatiop

      The Committee la recowended to approve a commitmsnt to provide fimsncisl
      assistance for legal reprasentstion to the officer(s) concerned in
      sccordance with the central principle of Home Office Circular lo.
      77/1987.

A jo in t report of the Clerk and Financial Officer and the Chief
Constable was submitted on the guidelines contained in Home Office
Circular No. 77/87 on the responsibilities of Police J a m i e s In
respect of legal costs arising from the Involvement of police officers
and non-police employees of Police Authority in legal proceedings.

The Circular both confirmed and expanded current policies within the
South Yorkshire Pol le t and recommended c rite ria to assist Police
Authorities in considering whether financial assistance sihould be
approved in any particular proceedings. I f followed, the c rite ria
would ensure that any payments authorised in consequence to be «et
from the Police Fund would qualify for Home Office grant.

RESOLVED - That the Police Authority adopt the procedures in Home
Office Circular No. 77/87 and enclose the current policies d e f i e d
in the report now submitted relating to legal costs                 K*

                   In connection with the HiHsborou^i tragedy of 1989 and allegations
                   made against me, I have teen taking legal advice from Walker, Morris,
                   Scott and Turnbull, Solicitors of Leeds, aid in particular M r Richard
                   Manning of that corpany.        Hie finance for this advice has been
                   available throut^t rny own private insurance.  Although the Director of
                   Public Prosecutions has stated that proceedings will not be taken
                   against any Police officer, there are still many matters unsettled and
                   I may still require significant legal advice and assistance.

                   I have been informed that the Coroners              Inquest is to start on 19
                   November 1990, and that this will be a              lengthy enquiry and it is
                   probable that my legal costs will exceed            the limit of my Insurance,
                   particularly if other matters follow the            Inquest, e.g. criminal or
                   disciplinary proceedings.

                   Accordingly under Home Office circular No. 77 of 1987, I ask that an
                   approach be made to the Police Authority to give consideration to
                   making funds available for my Legal Representation in connection with
                   the forthcoming Inquest, civil tearing and any criminal proceedings
                   which may arise, which would allow me to maintain the services of Mr.
                   Manning,   who   with   his   existing knowledge   of my      particular
                   circumstances, I feel is the best person to represent myself.

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough Disaster - Inquest
We have been notified by Her Majesty's Coroner of his intention to resume the
Inquests in the deaths of the 95 people on the 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough
Stadium, which Inquests are to resume on the 19 November 1990.
We would refer to previous correspondence and, in particular, to our letter of
the 6 Apri1 1990, addressed to the Chief Constable, and to your response of the
11 Apri1 1990. We would take this opportunity to repeat our request for financial
assistance for separate legal representation out of Pol ice Authority Funds,
pursuant to the provisions of the Home Office Circular No 77/87.
It is our intention to provide representation by CounseJ on behalf of two
police constables in particular, Police Constable David Alfred Illingworth and
Pol ice Constable Peter Edward Smith. It is our firm view that these officers
remain open to substantial criticism, despite the decision of the Director of
Public Prosecutions not to bring criminal proceedings. As you will fully
appreciate, there is sti11 a threat of private prosecutions by individual
complainants. We are satisfied that if called to give evidence before the
Inquests, these officers are reasonably likely to face examination by solicitors
or Counsel on behalf of relatives of the deceased, which may be prejudicial to
•
the officers. There also remains the threat of disciplinary proceedings,
arising out of the investigation by West Midlands Pol ice. Again, as long as
that threat remains, we feel that representation can be justified.
You w ill no doubt appreciate that the allegations made against these particular
o fficers, are of a serious nature and include abuse to members of the public, a
fa ilu re to act with speed, which individual complainants w ill say, had a direct
bearing upon the deaths of individuals and further, allegations of assault. . In
the case of Constable Illingworth, there are a number of allegations, but in
particular there is a complaint by Edward Spearritt, father of the deceased
Adam Edward Spearritt, who alleges that the o fficer faile d to open Gate 4 in
the perimeter fencing, despite loud appeals directed to him, his position being
in such close proximity to the complainant which, i t is alleged, had a direct
bearing on the death of his son and the cause of injuries to himself. In the
case of Peter Edward Smith, he faces allegations by a David Anthony Lackley to
the effect that the o fficer failed to open Gate 3 when asked, which had he done
so, would have saved the l i f e of some supporters and when the gate was opened,
Pol ice Constable Smith pushed one person back into the crowd.                                                                                                                           This presents a
                                                                                                                                                                         Cont/d.                     -----

K ;              ? direct bearing upon the deaths of a number of unnamed supporters
Additionally, he faces an allegation by Stephen Paul Hendry to like effect, in
I i i *is said he failed t0 open Gate 3, despite protestations and ordered
people uO push back. I t is also alleged against this o fficer that he assaulted
an unknown person by pushing him back over the fence, into Pen 3.

We anticipate that you w ill see from these allegations, that these officers are
at risk and the interests of justice require them to be represented.

We would maintain that in this instance, the officers were acting at a ll times
in good fa ith and in pursuance of their duties. We would also maintain that
tne particular interests of these officers are such that they could not properly

constable. We are sure that you w ill give our above comments f u l l consideration
ana we would ask that appropriate recommendations be made to the Police Authority.
We thank you in anticipation.

officer is in the same position es any other defendant and Bust be
expected to bear the costs of his defence.   If he la acquitted, he
should, like any oth er defendant, look to the court for
reimbursement of his expenses. If the costs are net paid, er not
paid in full from central funds, the police authority are in a
position to decide, on the full facts, whether er net to Bake a
payment to the officer er to the Police Federation if they have
provided the funding.   There Bay be cases where it is proper to
provide legal advice and/or legal representation even where the
officer la found guilty. Thia Bay ariae for axaaple in test eases
where the officer *has been carrying out a practice feltherto
approved of but is found guilty as a result ef that practlea being
found unlawful by the court in the light ef the circumstances ef

confidence that, if he acts in good faith and exercises »i»
judgement reasonably, his police authority frill support        If,
in a case where a Bember of the public brlnga a prosecution against

     and jurors.   An interested party will normally be entitled to be
     legally represented at a public snquiry or other public tribunal.
     Where the interest of the force is affected, it will be appropriate
     for the police authority to provide at its expenss for tbs chief

      are at risk of being held to blame for actions in connection with

     police authority should have the opportunity in advance of as veil
     as on the conclusion of the proceedings to submit to ths chief
     officer an application for financial assistance. The chief officer
     should put this, together with his own recommendation to the police
     authority for decision.    The officer should normally be given the

         he wishes to do so.
     15.   If it decide* to give financial assistance, ths authority
     should inform the officer concerned that, if the information on
     which they based their decision to grant ths assistance is ahown^in
     subsequent legal proceedings to be inaccurate or incomplete, the
     authority will normally expect to recover the money d a a s it is

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS FOR LEGAL REPRESENTATION
IN PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


1      Matter for Consideration

1.1    The provision     of   financial   assistance     to    the   following     police
       officers:-

                  Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
                  Superintendents Murray, Greenwood and Marshall
                  Constables Smith and Illingworth

        under the terms of Home Office Circular No. 77/1987.


2      Information

2.1    Members have already   received a report by the Chief Constable which
        is dated 19 October 1990/2 November 1990.

2.2    This date they also     have for theirconsideration              a    new   report
       prepared by the Clerk & Financial Officer.

2.3    This report should beread in conjunction with            those previous papers.


3      The Risk Factor

3.1    All the officers subject of this application consider                  themselves
       at significant risk due to the following factors

        1.   The possibility at     the   Inquest   of   a    verdict   of
             unlawful killing.

        2.   Of additional evidence being given at the Inquest
             which may cause the Director of Public Prosecutions
             to  further  consider   the question of criminal
             liability.

       3.    Recently in a similar case where the Director
             of Public Prosecutions decided against criminal
             proceedings,   representatives of  the   deceased
             instigated a Judicial Review of the Director's
             decision.   The officers see this as possible in
             this case.

       4.    Private criminal prosecutions may be brought.
5.   The officers face possible disciplinary proceedings
     where dismissal, requirement to resign or reduction
     in rank are all possibilities.

The officer at greatest risk and therefore most      in    need   of   your
support is Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield.

In the case of Mr Duckenfield his financial provision has already
proved   insufficient to     provide proper    and   adequate   legal
representation for himself at the on-going Inquest proceedings.
Often he is to be seen       sitting unrepresented at the Inquest,
conserving the scant resources he does have for those times when
personal representation is absolutely necessary.    From every point
of view this is totally unsatisfactory and, in my view, undesirable.


Legal Representation

Counsel representing the Force is,of course, responding to the
evidence given at the Inquest as appropriate to ensure that the
interests of the Force and the Police Authority are properly
represented and to a small degree he is, at the same time,
representing the interests of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.
This is not sufficient to allow for evidence to emerge to best public
advantage.

The other officers who are represented, and who are funded through
private insurance, have already made significant in-roads into that
provision.  The Inquest is proceeding slowly and so their financial
problems will become greater over time.


Good Faith and Reasonable Judgment

In the case R. -v- Derbyshire Police Authority ex-parte Wilson and
Dalton (an extract of this is contained in the Clerk & Financial
Officer's paper) it was said "...a Police Authority if satisfied
of good faith on the part of the officer(s) would normally act and
be pleased to act on the central principle stated in the Circular..."
- (HOC 77/87).     It was held in that case that this "...meant that
there is a presumption that if an officer is shown to have acted
in good faith in pursuance of his duties (this has already been
accepted to be the case by this Authority at their meeting on
16 November 1990 ), he should be entitled to reimbursement of his
reasonable   costs    and that   a  refusal  to  reimburse   in  such
circumstances must be a bad decision unless there is some relevant
factor which could reasonably justify the refusal.      Without such
justification the Police Authority must be taken to have failed
to have had proper regard for the central principle."

The Clerk & Financial Officer advises that a Police Authority
satisfied the officers acted in good faith may consider further
the extent to which those concerned in an application for such
assistance are subject to evidence of negligence possibly substantial
negligence or of any failure to exercise judgment reasonably.
                                   - 3 -


5.3    The Chief Constable advances the view that there is no doubt all
       the officers on the day were acting in pursuance of their duties
       and in good faith.

5.4    These officers were faced, in terms of what occurred and the
       difficulties  which   emerged,  with  a situation which in their
       experience, and probably everyone else's was unique.

5.5    There was real concern at one point in time for the lives of
       spectators, including many children and young people, outside the
       turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough football
       ground.

5.6    The decisions which were made and which have been and are still
       the subject of protracted enquiry, were made to save life and for
       no other reason.

5.7    The enormous management, logistical problems and experienced stress
       which was present at the relevant time needs to be taken into
       account.

5.8    It may be said that the worst decision would,            at that   time,   have
       been to make no decision.

5.9    All the officers, including Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, were
       acting in accordance with their duties, in good faith, and, despite
       what occurred, were exercising their judgment to the best of their
       abilities in the circumstances.

5.10   The Clerk & Financial Officer       has   drawn   your    attention   to    the
       question of reasonable judgment.

5.11   If the issue of negligence or the exercise of judgment is a relevant
       consideration in your deliberations there must be clear evidence
       of negligence, possibly substantial negligence.      Your attention
       has been drawn to the    report of Lord Justice Taylor.   It must be
       remembered that Lord Justice Taylor was acting as the chairman of
       a Public Inquiry which is not a judicial hearing and that the
       witnesses were not giving evidence in the strict sense that applies
       in normal legal proceedings.

5.12   The Director of Public Prosecutions when considering the question
       of criminal liability against all or any of the officers concerned
       in this application of course could do so only on the basis of clear
       evidence.   He utilised the services of the West Midlands Police
       to investigate and compile a report which was based on the evidence
       available.   His conclusion was, after considering the West Midlands
       Police report, there was insufficient evidence to justify proceedings
       against anyone.

5.13   It may be concluded that what this means is that there was
       insufficient evidence of negligence or failure to exercise judgment
       reasonably, on the part of any police officers, which would amount
       to criminal culpability.
The on-going Inquest is again concerned with evidence concerning
these same issues.    It would probably be imprudent of the Police
Authority to come to judgmental conclusions on the questions of
negligence or reasonable judgment in advance of the Inquest findings.


Finance

The Circular makes it clear that expenditure incurred in this regard
is eligible for police grant.

When this Committee last considered these applications questions
were raised about the private insurance available to the chief
superintendent and three superintendents. The position is:-

a.   Through the insurance provided by Allianz Cornhill
      each officer has a financial limitation of £50,000
      which after VAT is taken into account amounts
      in fact to £42,500 each.

b.   The policy does not specifically cover Inquest
      Hearings but it is understood that the insurers
      are prepared to provide cover in this instance.

c.   In relation to future risks the officers may need
      further   legal   advice  and representation after
      the Inquest Hearings have been concluded,         for
      example,   in relation    to criminal,    private or
      discipline proceedings.    If the Director of Public
      Prosecutions were to bring criminal proceedings,
      in the first instance the Police Authority could
     not - even if they so wished - fund the officers'
      legal   costs.    There  is no provision for the
     Authority     to    fund  legal   representation    at
     discipline hearings.      Therefore, in terms of the
      insurance     provision,    such   possible    future
     requirements must be borne in mind.

In relation to the two constables, they do not have private insurance
but to date have been supported from Police Federation funds.   Their
application,   as   with   the   chief   superintendent   and   three
superintendents, is for Police Authority funding in relation to
legal costs incurred by them at the Inquest Hearing only.

The Clerk & Financial Officer in his latest paper has drawn attention
to the fact that the Derbyshire case is authority for the proposition
that, when deciding whether or not to provide financial assistance,
alternative funding should not be taken into account.      Certainly,
the continuing needs of the officers as described above must be
considered.

Whilst it is difficult to assess the amount of money involved in
these applications, the position in respect of each officer at the
        time of the 2 November meeting, was made available       to   the   Clerk
        & Financial Officer and may be helpful in this regard.

6.6    A third decision by the Authority not to support any or all of the
       officers will have a significant detrimental impact on Force morale.
       South   Yorkshire Police  officers   go about   their daily   duties
       performing difficult and often dangerous tasks in the sincere belief
       that they have the full support of the Police Authority who as part
       of their function strive to provide such support and not the
       converse.


Conclusion

If funding for legal assistance is denied to any of the officers, the best
needs of natural justice will be neglected, allowing the real risk of less
evidence emerging in the public interest - whether to the credit or detriment
of the Force.

       officers
       Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
       Superintendents Murray Greenwood and Marshall
       PCs Smith and Illingworth

2      Information
2.1    Members have before them areport from the Chief Constable
       which gives the background to the applications and recommends
       the Authority to approve a commitment to provide financial

       related to the inquests but, as can be seen from the written
       applications which are appended to the Chief Constable’s
       report, in certain cases the applications are much wider.

       Constable’s Report)
       This provides guidance to Police Authorities when considering
       applications for financial assistance to police officers.
       The central principle which should guide such consideration
       is that where a Police Authority considers that an officer
       has acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties, or that
       the interests of the Force as a whole are involved, the
       officer should have the support of the Police Authority.
2.3    There is judicial authority for the proposition that this
       creates   a presumption that an officer is entitled to
       reimbursement of his reasonable costs and this can only be
       rebutted if there is some relevant factor which could
       reasonably justify the refusal. This is the case of R V
       Derbyshire Police Authority ex parte Wilson and Dalton. The
       transcript of the judgment in this case will be available at
       the meeting for reference purposes.
Proceedings to which the Applications relate
Civil Action
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in his application dated 21
September 1990, Appendix A to the Chief Constable’s report
referred to in paragraph 2.1, requests financial assistance
from the Authority in connection with the civil hearings due
to begin on 2 October 1990. These proceedings concern the
principle of contribution to the damages awarded or agreed in
civil claims arising out of the disaster, by Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club and their engineers, Eastwood and
Partners.   No civil action has been brought against Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield or any other individual officers
and therefore the application for financial support in
connection with civil proceedings need not concern members at
the present time.
Criminal Proceedings
Superintendent Murray has requested financial assistance for
legal representation in connection      with   any criminal
proceedings   which   arise.    (Appendix    C to the Chief
Constable’s report). There are none at present but paragraph
3 of the Home Office Circular deals with this situation. The
guidance given is that in a public prosecution the police
officer is expected to bear the costs of his defence. If he
is acquitted the Police Authority are in a position to decide
on the full facts, whether or not to make a payment to the
officer or to the Police Federation.
As there are no criminal proceedings, this         particular
application could stand adjourned in accordance with the
Circular until after such proceedings have been completed.
Discipline Proceedings
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in his application makes
reference   to the possibility of discipline proceedings
following the Inquests.   It is not clear whether he is
seeking financial assistance from the Authority in connection
with any such proceedings but as it is well settled principle
that the Authority should not provide assistance in these
proceedings this can be rejected.
Inquests
All of the officers make application for financial assistance
to be separately represented at the inquests which are
presently ongoing. Paragraph 13 of the Circular provides the
necessary guidance in this situation and it reads as
follows:-
      "Separate representation for individual officers whose
      interest is involved may be necessary. For example,
      there will be occasions when (a) the chief officer’s
      legal representative cannot reasonably be expected to
      represent the separate interests of such officers and
      (b) the police authority considers that such interests
      should be represented.   In such cases the authority
      should give financial assistance to the officers. In
      considering (b) above, the authority will wish in
      particular to assess whether the officers are at risk of
      being held to blame for actions in connection with the
      death to which the inquest relates and whether any such
      finding might give rise to legal proceedings for the
      costs of which the police authority would be liable
      under section 48(1) of the Police Act 1964 or for which
      financial assistance might be appropriate within the
      terms of this Circular.
The question to be answered under this paragraph is whether
separate representation of the officers is necessary.
Paragraph 13 asks the Authority to consider this question in
two parts.
(a)   Can the Chief Officer’s legal representative reasonably
      be expected to represent the separate interests of the
      officers and;
(b)   Does the Police Authority consider that   such   interests
      should be represented.
The answer to (a) in this case is straightforward. The Chief
Constable’s legal adviser has already advised that he cannot
represent the separate interests of the officers.
In determining (b) the Circular asks a Police Authority to
consider the following factors:-
(i)   The risk of the officers being held to blame for actions
      in connection with the deaths to which the inquests
      relate
      and
(ii) whether any such finding might give rise      to legal
     proceedings for which financial assistance might be
     appropriate within the terms of the Circular.
There is little doubt that some if not all officers run the
risk of being held to blame for their actions. It has to be
further considered whether there is a risk of further
proceedings   which   might    be the subject of financial
assistance under the Circular.
8    The Director of Public Prosecutions has already decided there
     is   insufficient evidence to bring criminal proceedings
     against any of the officers but fresh evidence may come out
     at the inquests and the Coroner has already alluded to this
     fact; this might give rise to a change of mind on the part of
     the Director of Public Prosecutions. From press statements
     which have previously been made, there isobviously a risk of
     a private prosecution but in all       of this it would be
     unreasonable in the view of the Authority’s legal adviser, to
     speculate.
     Good Faith and Reasonable Judgement
1 A decision of the Divisional Court in the case of R v
  Derbyshire Police Authority ex parte Wilson and Dalton
  clearly establishes that it is reasonable for a Police
  Authority to have regard to these two matters in deciding
  whether or not to provide financial assistance in any
  proceedings, whether covered by the Circular or not.
     In his judgment, Lord Justice Ralph Gibson said:-
     " I f therefore there was, on the part of an o ffic e r,
    ^negligence ie fa ilu re to exercise such care as was reasonably
     to b e re q u ire d in the circumstances of ano ffic e r of his rank
     and experience doing his job in the Force, then, in my view,
     the Police Authority is en title d to have regard to i t i f such
     negligence was so connected to the subject matter of the
     legal proceedings or to the causing of the legal proceedings
     to be taken that i t can fa ir ly be regarded as a substantial
     cause of the incurring of the costs. I have no doubt that a
     Police Authority, i f satis fie d of good fa ith on the pa rt of
     the o ffic e r, woul dnorm aTTy^^                           to act, on
     the cj^ tral^ jacip ci Pie ~^ate^r^ T n t h e Circular: but the
     discretion is given to thelftTEfioritjTaind^                          in
     my view, to hold that once good i a i t h i s £ s t a b l i s h e d , a
     Police Authority must disregard clear evidence7of negligence
                                     iKtgjenen-t Yeasonsbfy"

     So to hold would mean that a PoVicfu,Autimr.ity„._jHuUd be
     required to disregard acts of^substantial negligenci^such
     that it could fairly be said that, a T t ho ugfracqutttM'of bad
     f a i t h , ^ t h ^ officer had "brought the proceedings on himself."
     The decision whether evidence of such negligence in a
     particular case justifies withholding reimbursement, wholJy
     or in p a r t , i s o f cours^^entrusted to the Pol i c e Authority."
3   The Police Authority should, when considering the two matters
    of good faith and reasonable judgement, have regard to the
    information that is available.   The only real information
    that is available in this connection is that contained in
    Chapter 18 of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor which
    is appended.
4.4 It is important at this juncture to remind members that each
     officers application should be considered separately.
5     Financial   Implications
5.1    Derbyshire case which has previously been mentioned in this
                      also    authority   for the p ro p o s i t i on that
      <^Tternative funding should not be taken into a c c o u n O b v the
       AimioTTty wtren deciding whether or not to provide financial
       assistance.   However,    this   particular  case         concerned
       reimbursement of the Police Federation.
5.2    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendents Murray,
       Greenwood and Marshall have policies of insurance which can
       and are being used to finance legal representation at
       present. In the view of the Authority’s legal adviser, a
       decision to provide financial assistance to PCs Smith and
       Illingworth must cover the full cost of legal representation,
       whereas support for the other officers could be by way of a
       contribution to the extent that the policies of insurance do
       not cover the full cost of representation.—    Cz/yo r-
5.3 It would     also be reasonable for the Authority to determine
     the level of representation, whether it is solicitor, alone,
     solicitor and counsel, etc. However, again, <3ji the view of
     the Authority’s legal adviser, in the event that financial
     assistance is granted, this decision should be left to the
     individuals concerned but with the condition f c h a t y ^ a i T i n ^
     agreement on the amount of the costs^""they should be taxed.

6     Refusal of Application
6.1 Paragraph 15 of the Circular provides that if the Authority
     were to refuse an application for financial assistance and
     then discover in the light of events at the inquests that
     assistance shoul dhave been given, it should meet the
     reasonable costs incurred by the officer. If an application
     is refused for proper reasons the Authority would be acting
     reasonably if they made it clear to the officer(s) that this
     would not preclude a further application which would be
     considered in the light of events at the inquests.
3     Recommendation
      That the Authority consider the applications.

110   FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
      Further to minute 90 of the meeting of the Authority on 16 November 1990
      further consideration was given to the previous decision not to provide
      financial support for legal proceedings to the six officers who so applied
      in connection with the Hillsborough Disaster.
      The Authority considered a report of the Clerk and Financial Officer and a
      report by the Chief Constable.
      The Authority considered the most recent legal advice available to them as
      well as judicial authority on the entitlement to reimbursement of such
      costs in the light of Home Office Circular 77/87.
      RESOLVED

      1    That the applications for financial assistance in connection with
           legal proceedings from the officers now named be approved in relation
           to the inquest into the disaster.
      2    That the level of representation be left to be determined by the
           Officers but is not to extend to Leading Counsel.
      3    That in relation to those officers of Superintendent rank who have
            insurance policies covering costs of this nature, the Authority meet
           their legal costs only once such insurance cover is exhausted, except
           that they each be allowed to retain £10,000 from such insurance for
            legal representation in connection with any disciplinary proceedings}
            in the event that Police Authority monies are required by an officer
           for representation at the inquests the whole or any part of the
           retained sum not used in disciplinary proceedings is to be repaid to
           the Authority to the extent that such representation has been funded
           by the Authority.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS FOR LEGAL REPRESENTATION
IN PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER- - - - - -


REPORT OF THE CLERK AND FINANCIAL OFFICER

1     Matter for Consideration
1.1   The provision of financial assistance to the following police
      officers
      Chtef Superintendent Duckenfield
      Superintendents Murray Greenwood and Marshall
      PCs Smith and Illingworth
      under the terms of Home Office Circular No 77/87.
2     Information
2.1   Members have before them a report from the Chief Constable
      which gives the background to the applications and recommends
      the Authority to approve a commitment to provide financial
      assistance for legal representation. The recommendation is
      related to the inquests but, as can be seen from the written
      applications which are appended to the Chief Constable’s
      report, in certain cases the applications are much wider.
2 *2 Home Office Circular                 No       77/87     (Appendix   F to the Chief
     Constable’s Report!
      This provides guidance to Police Authorities when considering
      applications for financial assistance to police officers.
      The central principle which should guide such consideration
      is that where a Police Authority considers that an officer
      has acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties, or that
      the interests of the Force as a whole are involved, the
      officer should have the support of the Police Authority.
2.3   There is judicial authority for the proposition that this
      creates   a presumption that an officer is entitled to
      reimbursement of his reasonable costs and this can only be
      rebutted if there is some relevant factor which could
      reasonably justify the refusal. This is the case of R V
      Derbyshire Police Authority ex parte Wilson and Dalton. The
      transcript of the judgment in this case will be available at
      the meeting for reference purposes.


        NO T F O R P U B L I C A T I O N a s i t
        co n ta in s   exempt         information
        within p a ra .   . . J . Z i ...............   of
        Sch.l2A to the Local Government
        Act 1972 as amended.
    Proceedings to which the Applications relate
    Civil Action
    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in his application dated 21
    September 1990, Appendix A to the Chief Constable’s report
    referred to in paragraph 2.1, requests financial assistance
    from the Authority in connection with the civil hearings due
    to^ begin on 2 October 1990. These proceedings concern the
    principle of contribution to the damages awarded or agreed in
    civil claims arising out of the disaster, by Sheffield
    Wednesday Football Club and their engineers, Eastwood and
    Partners.   No civil action has been brought against Chief
    Superintendent Duckenfield or any other individual officers
    and therefore the application for financial support in
    connection with civil proceedings need not concern members at
    the present time.
1 Criminal Proceedings
    Superintendent Murray has requested financial assistance for
    legal representation in connection with        any criminal
    proceedings which     arise.    (Appendix C to the Chief
    Constable’s report). There are none at present but paragraph
    3 of the Home Office Circular deals with this situation. The
    guidance given is that in a public prosecution the police
    officer is expected to bear the costs of his defence. If he
    is acquitted the Police Authority are in a position to decide
    on the full facts, whether or not to make a payment to the
    officer or to the Police Federation.
    As there are no criminal proceedings, this         particular
    application could stand adjourned in accordance with the
    Circular until after such proceedings have been completed.
2 Discipline Proceedings
    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in his application makes
    reference   to the possibility of discipline proceedings
    following the Inquests.   It is not clear whether he is
    seeking financial assistance from the Authority in connection
    with any such proceedings but as it is well settled principle
    that the Authority should not provide assistance in these
    proceedings this can be rejected.
3   Inquests
    All of the officers make application for financial assistance
    to be separately represented at the inquests which are
    presently ongoing. Paragraph 13 of the Circular provides the
    necessary guidance in this situation and it reads as
    fol1o w s :-
         "Separate representation for individual officers whose
         interest is involved may be necessary. For example,
         there will be occasions when (a) the chief officer’s
         legal representative cannot reasonably be expected to
         represent the separate interests of such officers and
         (b) the police authority considers that such interests
         should be represented.   In such cases the authority
         should give financial assistance to the officers. In
         considering (b) above, the authority will wish in
         particular to assess whether the officers are at risk of
         being held to blame for actions in connection with the
         death to which the inquest relates and whether any such
         finding might give rise to legal proceedings for the
         costs of which the police authority would be liable
         under section 48(1) of the Police Act 1964 or for which
         financial assistance might be appropriate within the
         terms of this Circular.
.4 The question to be answered under this paragraph is whether
   separate representation of the officers is necessary.
.5 Paragraph 13 asks the Authority to consider this question in
   two parts.
   (a)   Can the Chief Officer’s legal representative reasonably
         be expected to represent the separate interests of the
         officers and;
   (b)   Does the Police Authority consider that   such   interests
         should be represented.
.6 The answer to (a) in this case is straightforward. The Chief
   Constable’s legal adviser has already advised that he cannot
   represent the separate interests of the officers.
   In determining (b) the Circular asks a Police Authority to
   consider the following factors
   (i)   The risk of the officers being held to blame for actions
         in connection with the deaths to which the inquests
         relate
         and
   (ii) whether any such finding might give rise to legal
        proceedings for which financial assistance might be
        appropriate within the terms of the Circular.
7 There is little doubt that some if not all officers run the
  risk of being held to blame for their actions. It has to be
  further considered whether there is a risk of further
  proceedings   which might      be the subject of financial
  assistance under the Circular.
3.8 The Director of Public Prosecutions has already decided there
    is   insufficient evidence to bring criminal proceedings
    against any of the officers but fresh evidence may come out
    at the inquests and the Coroner has already alluded to this
    fact; this might give rise to a change of mind on the part of
    the Director of Public Prosecutions. From press statements
    which have previously been made, there is obviously a risk of
    a private prosecution but in all of this it would be
    unreasonable in the view of the Authority’s legal adviser, to
    speculate.
4     Good Faith and Reasonable Judgement
4.1   A decision of the Divisional Court in the case of R v
      Derbyshire Police Authority ex parte Wilson and Dalton
      clearly establishes that it is reasonable for a Police
      Authority to have regard to these two matters in deciding
      whether or not to provide financial assistance in any
      proceedings, whether covered by the Circular or not.
      In his judgment, Lord Justice Ralph Gibson said:-
      " I f therefore there was, on the part of an o ffic e r,
      negligence ie fa ilu re to exercise such care as was reasonably
      to be required in the circumstances of an o ffic e r of his rank
      and experience doing his job in the Force, then, in my view,
      the Police Authority is entitled to have regard to i t i f such
      negligence was so connected to the subject n atter of the
      legal proceedings or to the causing of the legal proceedings
      to be taken that i t can f a ir ly be regarded as a substantial
      cause of the incurring of the costs. I have no doubt that a
      Police Authority, i f satisfied of good fa ith on the part of
      the o ffic e r, would normally act, and be pleased to act, on
      the central principle stated in the Circular; but the
      discretion is given to the Authority and i t is impossible, in
      my view, to hold that once good fa ith is established, a
      Police Authority must disregard clear evidence of negligence
      or of fa ilu re to "exercise judgement reasonably".

      So to hold would mean that a Police Authority would be
      required to disregard acts of substantial negligence such
      that i t could fa ir ly be said th at, although acquitted of bad
      fa ith , the o ffic e r had "brought the proceedings on him self.”
      The decision whether evidence o f such negligence in a
      particular case ju s tifie s withholding reimbursement, wholly
      or in part, is of course entrusted to the Police Authority.”

4.2 The Police Authority should, when considering the two matters
    of good faith and reasonable judgement, have regard to the
    information that is available.   The only real information
    that is available in this connection is that contained in
    Chapter 18 of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor which
    i s appended.
4.3 It is important at this juncture to remind members that each
    officers application should be considered separately.
5     Financial Implications
5.1   Derbyshire case which has previously been mentioned in this
      report,    is  also    authority   for the proposition that
      alternative funding should not be taken into account by the
      Authority when deciding whether or not to provide financial
      assistance.   However,    this   particular case    concerned
      reimbursement of the Police Federation.
5.2   Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendents Hurray,
      Greenwood and Marshall have policies of insurance which can
      and are being used to finance legal representation at
      present. In the view of the Authority’s legal adviser, a
      decision to provide financial assistance to PCs Smith and
      Illingworth must cover the full cost of legal representation,
      whereas support for the other officers could be by way of a
      contribution to the extent that the policies of insurance do
      not cover the full cost of representation.
5.3   It would also be reasonable for the Authority to determine
      the level of representation, whether it is solicitor, alone,
      solicitor and counsel, etc. However, again, in the view of
      the Authority’s legal adviser, in the event that financial
      assistance is granted, this decision should be left to the
      individuals concerned but with the condition that, failing
      agreement on the amount of the costs, they should be taxed.

6     Refusal of Application
6.1   Paragraph 15 of the Circular provides that if the Authority
      were to refuse an application for financial assistance and
      then discover in the light of events at the inquests that
      assistance shoul dhave been given, it should meet the
      reasonable costs incurred by the officer. If an application
      is refused for proper reasons the Authority would be acting
      reasonably if they made it clear to the officer(s) that this
      would not preclude a further application which would be
      considered in the light of events at the inquests.
7     Recommendation
      That the Authority consider the applications.

                     ? LePPings Lane end. But, cogent as their complaints were, they amounted to reasons for
                       gr T n alt°Sethe[- G,ven Hillsborough as the venue, I think the police were right to
 allocate the sections o f the ground as they did. The direction of arrival and the need for segregation made it
 sensible and to reverse the 1988 arrangements would have made for confusion. As with choice of venue I do
 not consider choice of ends was causative o f the disaster. Had it been reversed, the disaster could well have
 occurred in a similar manner but to Nottingham supporters.
 Police Planning
         HhC ? peratl0nal ° rder for i 989 left much unsaid. Apart from the lack of any provision for late or
 congested arrivals, or any provision for the avoidance o f overcrowding on the terraces, there was a number of

 Liverpool oflirere to assist in marshalling their own fans. The duties o f Superintendents (especially Mr
 Greenwood and Mr Marshall) were not defined so as to achieve clarity and efficiency. By an oversight, the
 provision requiring mobile (Tango) patrols to assist the emergency services was omitted from the text.

    274. The 1988 Order was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the number of officers deployed in
                      ? ! mp      s<: in capltal letters the embaigo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
  i    ' i       ,event led.10 complacency. That some thought the pens overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was
 closed off on that occasion did not figure in or influence the plan for 1989.

    275. MrDuckenfield was promoted and put in chaige of F Division only 21 days before this semi-final The
 pre-planning was already in progress under Mr Mole who had been in command both in 1987 and in 1988 It
 might have been wiser to have left Mr Mole in chaige of this operation. On the other hand, it is quite
 understandable that Mr Duckenfield should have been expected to take command of events in his Division
 from the date of his promotion. In view of his lack of experience at Hillsborough and of a semi-final match
 however, it was imperative that he be fully briefed and that he should also brief himself.

             7
   2?t ^He ? * ™ ' inf?rmed of the crushing incident in 1981 nor did he make inquiries which would have
revealed it. He did not know the arrangement as between Club and police for monitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. He did not visit and tour the ground before approving the Operational Order. Although he attended a
match on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control of the game to the Superintendents.
Policing on the Day
   277. One of the regrettable features of the football scene as it has developed is the enormous expenditure of
money, time and effort in employing large numbers of police all over the country to guard against the sort of
disorder and misbehaviour which have become endemic. Police management of a game of football has become
a military operation The problems faced and the responses received must be disheartening and may have
tended to harden police attitudes to supporters in general.

  278. It is fair to state that over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. They have handled crowd problems sensitively and successfully at a large number of football games
including major matches, during strikes in the coal industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts.
Unfortunately their policing on 15 April broke down in the ways already described and, although there were
other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control.

   279 In all some 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most
part the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank. There were many young Constables
who as witnesses were alert, intelligent and open. On the day, they and many others strove heroically in ghastly
circumstances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victims. They inspired confidence and hope.
  280.     By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses, p e i r feelings of grief and sorrow were obvious and genuine. No doubt those feelings were
intensified by the knowledge that such a disaster had occurred under their management. But, neither their
handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be
expected of their rank.


                                                       49
   281. Mr Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray's experience. Between them they misjudged the build-up
at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received Mr Marshall's request to open the gate. They did not.
for example, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the
numbers still to come. They did not alert Mr Greenwood to the situation at the fringe o f his area o f command.
They gave no instructions as to the management o f the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they declined to
postpone kick-off.

  282. When Mr Marshall's request came, Mr Duckenfield’s capacity to take decisions and give orders
seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening o f the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the emergence o f
fans from pens 3 and 4. When he was unsure o f the problem, he sent others down to “assess the situation"
rather than descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd.

   283. Most surprisingly, he gave Mr Kelly and others to think that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful. It set off a widely reported allegation against the
supporters which caused grave offence and distress. It revived against football fans, and especially those from
Liverpool, accusations o f hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from Europe too. I can
only assume that Mr Duckenfield’s lack o f candour on this occasion was out o f character. He said his reason for
not telling the truth was that if the crowd became aware o f it there might be a very hostile reaction and this
might impede rescue work. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell Mr Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although Assistant C hief Constable Jackson was at hand, Mr Duckenfield did not disclose the truth to h jfl|
until much later.

  284. The likeliest explanation o f Mr Duckenfield’s conduct is that he simply could not face the enormity o f
the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom. That would explain what he said to Mr Kelly, what
he did not say to Mr Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control o f the
disaster situation. He froze.

The Police Case at the Inquiry
  285. It is a matter o f regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. Mr Duckenfield, under pressure o f
cross-examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police
case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to monitor the pens. It was
argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C but was due to barrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would
have been more seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

        spectators, including many children and young people, outside the
        turnstiles at the Leppinga Lane end of the Hillsborough football
        ground•

 5.6   The decision* which were s«de and which have b M a m A are etill
        the subject of protracted enquiry, were made to save life and for
        no other reason.

5.7    The enormous management, logistical problems end experienced stress
        which was present at the relevant time needs to be taken into
        account.

5.8    Jt       b® said that the worst decision would, at that time, have
        been to make no decision,

5.9    All the officers, including Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, were
        acting in accordance with their duties, in food faith, and, despite
        what occurred, were exercising their judgment to the best of their
        abilities in the circumstances.

5.10   The Clerk k Financial Officer has             drawn    your   attention    to   the
        question of reasonable judgment.

5.11   If the issue of negligence or the exercise of judgment is a relevant
        consideration in your deliberations there must be clear evidence
        °f negligence, possibly substantial negligence. ~ Your attention
        hta been drawn to the report of Lord Justice Taylor, it must be
        remembered that Lord Justice Taylor was acting as the chairman e
        a Public inquiry which i» not a judicial hearing and that the
       witnesses were not giving evidence in the strict tense that applies
        in normal legal proceedings.

8.12   The Director of Public Prosecutions when considering the question
        of criminal liability against all or any of the officers concerned
        in^this application of course could do sc only on the basis of clear
        evidence.   He utilised the services of the West Midlands Police
        to investigate and compile a report which was based on the evidence
        available. His conclusion was, after considering the Nest Midlands
        Police report, there wee insufficient evidence to justify proceedings
        against anyone*

5.13   it may be concluded that what this means is that there was
        insufficient evidence of negligence or failure to exercise judgment
        reasonably, on the part of any police officers, which would aaount
        to criminal culpability.

      5.14          The on-going Inquest is again concerned with evidence concerning
                    these same issues.    It would probably bo imprudent of the Police
                    Authority to come to judgmental conclusions on the questions of
                    negligence or reasonable judgment in advance of the inquest findings.


     6            Finance

     6*1          The Circular Mikes it clear that expenditure incurred in this regard
                   is eligible for police grant.

    6.2           when this Committee last considered these applications questions
                  were raised about the private insurance available to the chief
                  superintendent and three superintendents. The position is:*-

                   a.       Through the insurance provided by Allianz Cornhill
                            each officer has a financial limitation of €50,000
                            which after VAT is taken ,into account amounts
                            in fact to £42,500 each.

                  b.      The policy does not      specifically cover inquest
                           Hearings but it is understood that the insurers
                           ate prepared to provide cover in this instance.

                  c*      In relation to future risks the officers may need
                           further legal advice and representation after
                           the Inquest Hearings have been concluded, for
                           exaaple, in relation to criminal, private or
                           discipline proceedings. If the Director of Public
                           Prosecutions were to bring criminal proceedings,
                           in the first instance the Police Authority could
                           net - even if they so wished - fund the officers'
                           legel costs.     There is no provision for the
                           Authority   to    fund   legal   representation   at
                           discipline hearings.    Therefore, in terms of the
                           insurance    provision,    such   possible    future
                           requirements must be borne in Bind.

   «.3           In relation to the two constables, they do not have private insurance
                 but to       have been supported from Police Federation funds. Their
                 application,    ass  with   the   ehi.f   .^int.ndent      12   thz m

                      EX PARTE WILSON AND DALTON



                                    JUDGMENT


 LORD JUSTICE     RALPH    GIBSON:            This is       an     application     for

 judicial review    of     the     decision     of    the        Derbyshire     Police

Authority of 26th July           1988 not to     pay any part of            the legal

expenses incurred on behalf of the applicants.                       The applicants

are Inspector     Wilson      and Sergeant      Dalton       of the        Derbyshire

Constabulary.      They claim an order of             certiorari to quash the

decision of the Authority not to meet                the expenditure incurred

by the applicants     in the costs          of legal representation at             an

Auditor's Inquiry into allegations of illegal                     expenditure upon

various matters, and        in particular       upon the refurbishment             of

the office of the then Chief Constable at Police Headquarters.


      The decisions of       the District Auditor            were given in        his

report dated 26th June 1967.            He held that no police officer,

whose actions     had been investigated,             had been       shown to     have

been guilty of     wilful misconduct          although the expenditure             on

the refurbishment had been shown to have                been unauthorised and

was   therefore    illegal.           The      amount       was     some    £28,000.
                                                                                                   4



   Inspector Wilson          and        sergeant        Dalton         had   been       represented

   throughout the       15 days of             the District            Auditor's inquiry               by

  counsel upon the instructions of a solicitor.                                  The total cost

  of their representation was in                       the region of £17,000.                other
  parties interested          had also            been        represented,       including     the

  county Council.            The        services of             solicitor and counsel          had

  been made available for Inspector Wilson and Sergeant Dalton by

  the Police Federation without any stipulation                                that they should

        P rsonally liable to repay the Federation.                             when the result

 Of the inquiry        „as known the              Police Federation, on                  behalf of

 the applicants, applied to                 the Police Authority for                     the costs

 to be paid,       or for a        payment of a                contribution towards them.

 It is common ground that the Authority had                              legal power to make

 payment out of police funds.                     The Authority decided to make no
 payment.


         That decision is          attacked on               three main        grounds.       The

 first ground       was called           by Hr.        Underhill         the ''rubber       stamp

 submission .          It     was        said     that the          Police      Authority,         a

committee of which the full membership was 24,                                 did not make the

decision but wrongly left the making of the decision to a panel
of 5 members appointed             by             the Author- -i*
                                                Authority to do no more ' than to
hear submissions and          to report.                     The second ground,           called

"the inadequate report submission",                          was that if        the Authority

made the decision          themselves, they did                   so upon an        incomplete

report from the panel.              m     particular, the panel, appointed to

receive the representations of the officers                             seeking payment of
their     costs,    failed         to     t»i i        *-u      „ ,,

            power was     given, it        was submitted        that the decision             to

  reject the       application           was one    not    reasonably open          to    the

  Police Authority.            m    addition,      it was said that the Authority

  took into account various               matters to which it should              have had
 no regard.


            It is necessary first to describe the nature and powers of

 the Police        Authority        and    of     the   Secretary    of      state       with
 reference to these matters.


 The Police Authority


            The Police Act 1964 by section 2 provides                that the Police

 Authority for a          police area           consisting of a     non-Metropolitan

 county shall        be    a   committee of          the   Council of       the     County

 constituted in accordance with                  the provisions of        this section

 to be known       as the      Police Committee.               The Police     Committee

consists of such number of persons as may                      be determined by the

Council of the County and, of that number, two thirds are to be

members of the County Council appointed by that Council and one

third shall        be appointed from             among the     magistrates for           the
County by those m a g i s t r a t e s .


       By section 4(1) of the              1964 Act "it shall be the              duty of

the Police        Authority        ...    to      secure the    maintenance of           an

adequate and        efficient       police         force for the     area,        and    to

exercise for       that purpose           the     powers conferred      on a Police
Authority by this Act".
          Section 8     d e a ls    with        financial         provisions:        "...     all

 receipts of the           Police Authority              ... shall     be paid into           the

 Police fund and           allexpenditure of             anysuch Police         Authority

 sha11 be Pa i d out of            that     fund.”          Then by sub-section            (3 ) of
 section 8:        "...     an     account to be known              as the police account

 shall be kept        of all        expenditure and           receipts of the             Police

 Authority                 and by     sub-section (4) "No sum shall                   be paid

 out of the Police Fund ... without the                         approval of the Council

of the County ..."            except in certain cases irrelevant                      to this
c as e.


        Part    II    of     the    Act     deals        with      central     supervision,

direction and         facilities.               By    section 28       the Secretary           of

State      shall exercise his powers under this Act                          in such manner

and to such extent as              appears to him to be best                 calculated to

promote the efficiency of the                    police".          By section 31 :          "The

Secretary of         State       may make        grants       in respect      of     expenses

incurred for police purposes                    ... (a)      by any     Police Authority

..." and       ...    "grants       under this           section      shall be       of     such

amounts,       ...    and    subject        to       such    conditions       ...     as     the

Secretary of State           may with           the approval         of the Treasury          by

order determine           ..."        The        court      has     been told       that,     in

substance, under the regulations 51 per cent of the expenditure

of a      Police     Authority       is     provided         from     central       funds     as

directed by        the Secretary           of State         and     49 per    cent by        the
County Council out of rates.


The Home Office Circular


       Home Office Circular            No. 77/87, dated              4th December 1987,

is the foundation of the              case for the applicants.                     Section 4

                                    - 4     -
 °f the 1964 Act'          cited above, defines         the duty of the        Police
 Authority and the         purposes for        which    the Authority mayspend

 the money       provided, namely          to secure     the    maintenance of     an

 adequate and efficient         police force.            The circular      provides

 guidance to police         authorities with reference            to one form     of

 expenditure.        The    first two paragraphs          must be    set out      in
 full:

      -I.* .       »   statutory authority in section 48 of the
      Police Act 196 4 for payments    to be made from the police fund
       ° meet expenditure incurred     by police officers in defending
      proceedings in tort.       Also,   acting in pursuance of its
      general statutory duty to maintain an adequate and efficient
      police force for its area,                         -

      proceedings v h e x e :;
                of their duties,
                .involved.  The purpose of this circular is to give
      guidance to police authorities   to help them in considering
      requests on behalf of officers for financial assistance.
       his guidance has been discussed and agreed with local
      authority and with the police staff associations.

      2.   ^       central principle which should       guide consideration

                                                        police

          he s h o u l d b e . out of pocket.        The following
     paragraphs provide general guidance to the different classes
     of proceedings.   Payments made to officers in accordance with
     this guidance will be elegible for police grant".



     The rem ain in g five pages of the circular, to some passages

in which       ^tailed     attention       will    be   given    later    in   this
judgment, contain        passages      under      the   headings:        "Criminal

Proceedings, Prosecution by            the Crown Prosecution Service            and

Private    Procecutions;         Civil      Proceedings:         Civil    Actions

against the      chief     Officer for      Wrongful     Acts of    Constables,
Civil Actions against Individual Police Officers, Civil Actions

under the Data      Protection Act         1984, Police Officers         bringing

Civil Actions for Defamation;              Inquests, Public       Inquiries and

 Individual Officers;          Applications            for    Financial Assistance;
 and Assistance from Police Federation Funds".


         No issue has been raised as to the lawful authority of the

 Secretary of state to         issue guidance to police              authorities in

 the form and in         the terms of the         circular.        The    circular is

 not a regulation and does not              have the force of statutory law.

 The circular clearly assures authorities that use                       of the money

 supplied    in    the    police     grant       for     purposes     within        those

envisaged by       the    circular        will   not     be    questioned      by     the

Secretary of       State.           it     is also      common    ground that         the

circular contains guidance            with reference to           a power to        make

payments and did not create a specific duty to make payments.


     The court was referred to Bristol                   Council v. Clark [1 9 7 5 ]

1 W.L.R. 1443 (Lord Denning MR, Lawton and                     Scarman LJJ .) where

the appeal concerned the validity of a notice                     to quit given by

the Council to       a tenant of a          council house.           Reference was

there made to two joint circulars emanating from the Department

of the    Environment and       the       Department of         Health and     Social

Security:    Circulars       74/72 and       18/74.           Scarman LJ. at        page
1450H said this:

                    from.**- two circulars 74/72 and 18/74 that local
     i n v i S £0S !£erC1Sing functions under the Housing Act are now
     invited by the central government to have regard to the
    llrtluTsllthomelessness, the alternatives to eviction and the
    various statutory weapons available to their relief such as
    Act 197?      ser^ ^ es legislation and the Attachment of Earnings
    Act 1971.        i do not think it possible to rely on those
                 as.1lpos±n^ any direct statutory duty upon a housing
    authority, but I think they are a good indication as to the
    purposes to be served by the Housing Acts and as to what are
    re evant matters within the language of Lord Greene HR in
    fiednesbury case t1948]1 k.B. 223, 233, to be t X L into



                              - 6     -
         account by a local authority serving a notice to quit                 upon a
         council tenant in arrears of rent."


It was, as I understood it, common ground in                        this case, and in

my view it is correct, that the court can properly approach the

Home Office Circular No. 77/87 upon the same basis.                                   That is

not   to      say      that,      in considering             an     application            for

reimbursement of            costs by an     officer, a        Police Authority              is

necessarily limited to             factors listed          in the        Circular.          in

this case, however, it has not been suggested that any relevant

matters arose         for    consideration         outside        the     ambit       of   the
Circular.


The Police Federation.


      It is      necessary        to return       to     the Act    of        1964 for      an

understanding         of    the    role     and        functions    of         the      Police

Federation.          Part    III of the       Act by section 44               provides for

the continuance of           a Police Federation            for England and              Wales

... "for      the purposeof representing                  members        of the         police

forces in England andWales ... in all                     matters affecting their

welfare and       efficiency,       other       than questions           of        discipline

affecting individuals, except as provided by sub-section (1)(A)

below,     and   questions        of promotion affecting                individuals".

Sub-Section       (1)(A),      inserted     by     the      Police           and    Criminal

Evidence Act 1984,           permits representation of              a member of            the

police force at        any disciplinary proceedings                 or on          an appeal

from any such proceedings.


      The Secretary of State by section 44(3) may by regulations

prescribe      the    constitution        and     proceedings           of    the     Police

Federation and, in particular, may make                    provision with respect
  to    the    raising   of   funds        by    the    Federation         by    voluntary

  subscription and the use           and management of funds derived                     from

  such subscriptions.         The court was informed                that the funds of

  the Police Federation        derive only from               private gifts and           the
 subscriptions of policemen.


        The     Police   Federation        regulations         1969     No.      1787,     as

 amended, were put before the court.                    it    is necessary to refer

 only to Regulation 19:         Use of Federation Funds.                      it is there

 provided that Federation funds                 shall not, without            the consent

 of the       Secretary of    state,       be used       otherwise         than for       the

 purposes       mentioned      in      paragraphs             (3)     to        (7)      and,

 notwithstanding anything in those paragraphs, shall not be used

 ••• (c)      in connection    with the defence of a member                     or former

 member of      the   Federation       against         whom    civil,      criminal       or

 disciplinary proceedings are              brought except           as authorised         by

 paragraphs (4)(h),      (5) or (7).            The construction of Regulation

 19 is not, in my view, free of difficulty.                      The submission for

the applicants, who are supported by the Police Federation, was

that the decision of the            Federation to pay the legal                  costs of

the applicants incurred in the auditor's inquiry was made under

paragraph 3(3) of Regulation 19 which provides as follows:

       "Federations funds may be used to defray expenses lawfully
       incurred for the purpose specified in section 44(1) of the
       members^of  1964, namely for the purpose of representing
       members of the police forces and police cadets in England and
                     matters affecting their welfare and efficiency,
       other than, subject to paragraph (7) questions of discipline
       and promotion affecting individuals".


It was not suggested on behalf of the police authority that the

Federation's decision had been made without proper authority.

  The Inquiry by the Auditor


        he inquiry arose       out of an        investigation by the        County

  reasurer into the police accounts.                Disciplinary proceedings
 were taken against     the Chief Constable,             Mr. A .s . Parrish    ^
 they did not     proceed to       a             .
                          to       a hearing     because of the      retirement
 upon grounds of ill health of Mr           Parris o
                                             arrish on 5th November 1985.

      The Police Committee, which
                                           is another name for the Police
 Authority,   (see section     2 of      the 1964       Act), resolved on      4th

December ,985 that the accounts and other documents                 be sent to
the auditor for consideration by him     The
                                         The auditor was invited
to hold his inquiry in public.    The Clerk of m     o
                                    e   Lerk of the Council was
instructed to retain counsel to represent thp p r
                                represent the Police Authority
before the auditor.


     The nature    of   the proceedings          thus     initiated, and      the
powers which the auditor could use, if the facts justified such
                               9     -
action, are sufficiently described by reference to                           sections 19

and 20 of the Local          Government Finance Act 19 8 2 .                  By section

19, where   it     appears to         the    auditor ...           that     any item     of

account is contrary          to law     he may       apply to           the court for     a

declaration.       On his application the court may make or refuse

to make the declaration asked for and, where the declaration is

made, then the court may also order that any person responsible

for incurring or authorising any               expenditure declared unlawful

shall repay it in whole or             in part.           Such an order        is not to

be made if the     court is satisfied that the                     person responsible

for   incurring    or    authorising          any        such      expenditure      acted

reasonably or in the belief that the expenditure was authorised

by law.     So far      as concerns section                19 , the inquiry by          the

auditor was thus preliminary                to other proceedings             which might

be taken.        By section      2 0 , however, where              it appears to        the

auditor that a loss          has been incurred or deficiency                   caused by

the wilful misconduct of any person, he shall                           certify that the

loss or deficiency is due             from that person and, subject                  to an

appeal, that sum may be recovered                from the person responsible.

A right of appeal       is provided to           the court which may              confirm

vary or quash the decision.


      Ifc-is necessary to        describe in some detail the                   result of

the auditor's     inquiry.            Hit#   applicants say             that they      were

       -exonerated      by     the auditor          of     any wilful        misconduct.

Th%vl#lice Authority did          not share that                view.     IIP-•'••the•sense

that, the-, auditor held that there was no basis



jurisdiction     against   the    officers to            direct     them to make       any

payment towards the sums          unlawfully paid away,                   the applicants
      The inquiry extended            over 15     days between 11th          November

 1986 and 10th March       1987*           There was a mass         of documentary
 evidence introduced before and            during the hearing.               The main

 issue was the     refurbishment of the           Chief Constables's office.

 There were in     issue other        small amounts           of money which        were

mainly the     concern of       the Chief       Constable        only.       From     an

examination of      the    documents and         the     results of        interviews

conducted by officers assisting the auditor, it appeared to him

that, in     addition to       Mr. Parrish, the          Chief Constable,           four

other persons were        "at risk" of         the auditor•« special          powers

under sections 19 and          20 of the 1982          Act.     They     were Police

Chief Superintendent Wendy Stock, Chief                  Administrative Officer

F * YatSS and the two applicants, Inspector                   Wilson and Sergeant
Dalton.          During        the    course      of      the    inquiry      Police

Superintendent Keeton          also came       into that category.                chief

Superintendent Stock was            represented by       separate counsel           and

Mr. Keeton was legally represented on two days of the hearing.


     The     following    is    a    summary     of     the     findings     of     the
Inspector:


     {i)       In and before the year 1982 consideration had been
    given by     senior officers         at Police        Headquarters to          the

    making of     changes in         the arrangement          and allocation        of

    °ffices on the executive corridor.                    Chief Superintendent
                                                                              t




   Wendy stock proposed to Mr. Parrish, then chief Constable,

   that the   Chief Constable's        lounge should     be changed      so

   that it might be used as a conference room, and that a new

   desk be provided for       the Chief Constable's office.             Mr.
   Parrish agreed.       The work involved the       installation of a
   movable soundproof partition.


   <ii>   The money was, it „as sai<J fay ^                        ^     ^

  available "by way of virement".           That means an authorised

  change in the purpose       for which sums have      been allocated

  in approved annual estimates.           The authority's financial

  regulations permitted transfers from one estimate            head to
  another with   the approval of            m
                       pproval of the       Treasurer.     There       was
  never in fact any such approval.


  (iii)   The money was      spent on the    refurbishment without
 authorisation     bythe    Police Committee     and was    therefore
 contrary to law.       The amount was £28,022.


              Parrish said that        he was unaware of     the lack

 of proper approval.         „ lss   Stock said that she    believed

 that Mr. Yates, the chief Administration Officer, had told

 her, by an oral message conveyed to her by Mr. Wilson (one

of the applicants,,        that he   would arrange     for virement.

    Yates denied     sending the      message.     Mr. Wilson      was

uncertain and confused as        to the message he gave      to Miss
Stock.


              Keeton,      Police    Superintendent,     identified
amounts totaling £,6,808 in the 1982/83 accounts which had

been underspent on      certain estimates.       Mr. Daiton     (the


                     - 12 -
 other applicant)          prepared          a list of fourfirmsand amounts

 totaling £16,807with order               numbers.                 In March       1983

 orders were placed with those four firms for the supply of

 goods to the value          of £16,747.               No goods were       supplied

 before 31st        March 1983       but invoices          were requested          and

 obtained from the firms.                 Mr. Dalton certified             that the

 goods had      been received         and the          prices verified.             He

 passed them to the police administrative                       department where

 Mr. Wilson        certified       them     as    authorised       for     payment.

 Payment was then made without further check                       by the County
 Treasurer's Department.


 (vi)       one set of invoices contained three items totaling

 £2,396 (part        of    the £16,747)          for    which the        individual

amounts did         not correspond          with any      actual        item to    be

supplied.          By this       means, the total paid was              brought to

the amount due for all the goods, delivered                       over a period

up to    August 1983         but supplied under            the invoices         sent

before 31st March            1983; and the full               amount    underspent

before      1983     was     made     available         for       the    payments.

Further, Mr. Dalton in the certification                       slip attached to

the invoices wrote the              code symbol for           expenditure heads

appropriate to the heads of the unexpended amounts and not

to the heads appropriate for the goods supplied.


(vii)       Further       orders     were    placed       between       April     and

September 1983.            Mr.     Dalton certified related               invoices

with a   code       inserted       relating to         "house-furniture           and

fittings" and not to the purpose for which                       the goods were

supplied.      No     application had been made for                    virement in
                                                                                 I



 1983/84 to alter the purpose for which the                       money had been

 allocated.         Miss Stock said that Mr. Keeton told her that

 the spending was in the revenue budget.                         Mr. Keeton said
 that he had not said that to Miss Stock.


 (v i i i )   No one had      made any personal            monetary gain         from

 any of the transactions relating to the refurbishment.


 (ix          The auditor         considered       whether the      unauthorised

expenditure had been               caused by       the wilful misconduct             of

any person.         He     referred to section 161 of the                 1972 Act

and section        2 0 ( 1 5(b)     of       the 1982   Act.       He     directed

himself that "wilful misconduct'1 meant ''deliberately doing
ftftiw&thing which is         wrong knowing it            to be wrong or        with

^feckless      indifference as to             whether it is      wrong or      not":
see Horabin v. B.O.A.C. [1952] 2 All E.R. 1016, 1022;                            and

Lloyd v. McMahon [1987] 2 W.L.R. 821, 841 per Lawton LJ.

<x)           None of the         persons concerned, said          the auditor,

was    an     accountant.               If   the accounting      irregularities

which occurred         were        undertaken in        the    belief that       the

refurbishment had           been        properly    authorised         then    their

wrongfulness was          less serious.             There      was n o ■ evidence

that Mr. Dalton, Mr. Wilson or Mr. Keeton knew at the time

that the refurbishment had not been approved.


(xi)          Miss Stock, Mr. Keeton, Mr. Wilson                 and Mr. Dalton

said that they thought it was correct                     to code expenditure

to the expenditure head                 which had been underspent.               The

practices       adopted           may    well    have     been    an      innocent

misunderstanding on           the        part    of the    particular         police


                            - 14 -
 officers, although it          did have   the effect of       concealing

 the expenditure on          refurbishment from      any one who      might

 review actual expenditure with estimates.


 (xn)      In the view       of the auditor      none of the     officers

 had been shown to       have been guilty        of wilful misconduct.

 It was the auditor's opinion that the parties acted in the

 belief that their actions         were authorised by law         for the

 reasons explained in         the report so      that it would not      be

 proper to seek an order for repayment.


 (xiii>    As to Mr. Wilson, he was aware on his own evidence

 of the improper      certification by       Mr. Dalton on       invoices

 that goods not yet      received had been        received.      He    was

aware that the purpose was to secure the              payment of those

 invoices before the end of March 1983 and the debit of the

expenditure to the 1982/83 accounts.              Since     he was aware

of those     irregularities       it was   his    duty to     refuse    to

certify the invoices and          to prevent the purpose        of those

acts being     achieved.         But   Mr. Wilson     did certify      the

invoices and     he    did    not report    the     irregularities      to

anyone.       it seemed, however, likely that he acted in the

belief that approval for         the expenditure had been          or was

in the    process of     being obtained.           it probably     never

occurred to him that he was doing anything wrong.


(xiv)     As to Mr.     Dalton, who was       a police sergeant,        he

said that all his      actions were in consequence           of general

or specific    instructions to         him by Miss    Stock, a     Chief

Superintendent, or Mr. Keeton, a Superintendent.                 He had

discussions with suppliers and obtained invoices               which he
       certified, including        the irregular        invoices.        He    said

      that he questioned       the propriety of          his actions but        was

      reassured by Miss Stock.            Miss Stock denied that she had

      reassured him.         Mr.     Dalton acted      wrongly in       obtaining

      irregular invoices       and     in certifying      them      as t o ^ go od s

      received when goods had not been received;                 and it was no

      answer to say that he was acting under              instructions.          He

      had, however, only       been in the' department ror two                years

      and there was no evidence that he knew the expenditure had

      not been     properly approved.            His    evidence was         honest
      sounding and convincing.


      (xv)       Additional costs      incurred by       the County       Council

      over the question       of unauthorised payments including               the

      disciplinary       proceedings    were,     at     the   time     of     the

      auditor's inquiry, already in excess of £200,000.


      (xvi)    Even if it were to be decided that              there had been

     wilful misconduct it could not logically be                 said that any

     loss had been incurred          by the charging of        expenditure to

     the wrong year nor did it seem that               it could logically be

     said that     the    irregular    submission of       invoices       caused
     loss.


The Process of the Decision of 26th July 1988


     By letter     of    26th February    1988     the Police       Federation

requested the Police Authority         to meet in full,        or contribute

to, the legal costs of the applicants.              Reference was made to

the circular   No. 77/87      and to    those aspects       of the      inquiry

which justified and required legal representation.
                 On ,2th April ,988            the application was considered                    by the

                    uthonty.               At this point          the powers        of the       Police
         Authority      must       be    described         as     to     delegation         of    their

         functions.         By section ,07 of the Local Government Act ,972 it

         is provided that           sections ,0,,          ,02, ,03 and         ,06 of that           Act

         shall apply to a Police Authority (such as that for Derbyshire,

         as they apply         to a      local authority.               This Police      Authority

         therefore could lawfully              arrange for the            discharge of any              of

         its functions       by     a      committee,      or      a    sub-committee,           or     an
         officer.
   t




                on this occasion there was before the                      Authority, of which

        the full membership was, as I have said,                         24, a report prepared

        by   the     then      Clerk to the          Authority.         The report     (page      ,3 0 ,

        showed     that,     in       addition       to     the        application     of        these

        applicants.        Chief      Superintendent         stock        and      Superintendent

        Keeton had      also       applied     for    reimbursement           of     their       costs
        incurred at the inquiry.               The report continued:

  point later in this judgment.


          The Police Authority              did not delegate,           as it might           have

  done,    the function         of deciding          the applications but              resolved

  that     "a panel            ... be        appointed         ...     (to)          ...      hear

  representations from Hiss Stock and/or her                          representatives and

  report back to this committee;                 and that an opportunity to make

  oral representations to the panel also be offered                            to the other
 applicants and/or their representatives".


         The panel     was duly            established.         it     consisted of           the

 Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Police                       Authority, Councillor

 Barnes and     Councillor            Dentith,       respectively,         together          with

 Councillor     B.M.       Bookbinder,           the     Leader       of      the.    council.

 Councillor Mellors, and Mr. John JP, a magistrate.


         On 8th July 1988 submissions were made to the panel.                                 The

 submissions made for           these applicants              were presented by              Miss

 Blackburn a solicitor.                There is at page 34 a full account of

her submission.            m     very brief summary              she relied upon              the

following matters:             (i)     the applicants had             provided full co­

operation in     the       investigation             at all    stages;         (ii)          the

inquiry posed        the    risk       of     grave consequences           for       the     two

officers concerned;            (iii)        they had both been acting under the

orders of senior       officers;              (iv>     the    nature of the           inquiry

gave rise to problems of evidence and the handling of a mass of

documents and     legal        representation           was therefore          necessary;

(v)   both had been totally cleared of misconduct;                            (vi)         their

claim to reimbursement or contribution fell                          clearly within the

main principle       of the      circular;           (vii)     it     would serve           the

         It will be     necessary to refer            later in this judgment                  to

  the evidence of       members of          the Panel as      to the grounds             upon
  which each formed his conclusion.


         A report was    prepared by the             Panel and submitted to               the
 Police Authority.             It ls    at page       „6 ^                         Qf     ^

 the Police     Authority.      „r .    Reg „ace       and       the Head     of      Legal
 Services, Mr. David Tvsoe              mu. _
                                            purpose of           the report was "to
 report the     considerations         of     the Panel      established         by      the

 Committee to hear representations ...                     Under "Information and

Analysis" it referred to the setting up of the Panel and to its

 eeting on 8th July to hear representations on                      behalf of Chief

Superintendent     stock,      on    behalf      of    these       applicants,           and

wrxtten representations made by Superintendent Keeton.                             it was

said that the applications           were considered in            accordance with

the circular;     that consideration was given to the principle of

making payment in full, or contribution and not                     to the details

of any payment;       that     detailed submissions              were made by           the
respective parties;      and     that the Panel took into                account the
 findings of the Auditor and the fact that the Auditor concluded

 that no one      involved in      the matter       of the refurbishment              was

guilty of wilful misconduct albeit the expenditure was declared
to be contrary to law.


        T h e r e was then reference to the         central principle pointed

out in     the    circular,     which     should       guide     consideration         of

individual       cases,   namely        that    where     a     Police        Authority

considered that an officer had                 acted in       good faith ...,         the

officer should        have the support         of the     Police Authority            and

should not       be   out of pocket.             There then          followed      this

statement:        Members considered carefully all                  of the arguments

which had been put forward          ... by the applicants but                 were not

persuaded that the circumstances of any of the                       cases were such

as to     justify     the Police Authority          paying          the costs    or    a
contribution towards them".


     Next, under the heading "Personnel Considerations", it was

noted that Chief Superintendent Stock and Superintendent Keeton

had incurred        their own    costs.          The     Police Federation            had

exercised its discretion to represent the applicants, Inspector

Wilson and       Sergeant Dalton,        and "any       reimbursement of         costs

would in effect be a reimbursement to the                  Police Federation of
its costs".


     Under "financial considerations"                  it was noted       that Chief

Superintendent        Stock1s   costs      were     £30,500;            the     Police

Federation's costs        amounted to      £16,975;           and    Superintendent
Keeton's costs amounted




                                - 21 -
        Under "legal       considerations"        it was     said     that "if      the

Police Authority were          so minded the          costs, or a      contribution

towards them, could legally be paid.                     However, whether or not

to do     so is    a matter     for the       discretion of         the Committee".

That was followed by          "Panel's unanimous recommendation:                   that

the Police Authority          do not       provide any financial         assistance

... for the applicants".


        It is necessary to comment at this point upon this report.

On first looking at these papers it                  seemed clear to me that the

authors of the        report, the Clerk to the            Authority and the Head

of Legal     Services, neither          of whom       had been      present at      the

meeting of the         Panel, were unaware of or in               a state   of     some

confusion     as      to     what    the     Panel had     been     instructed      or

authorised to do.            It was set up to hear           the representations

and to report.         It has not been argued that               the Panel was not

entitled to add a recommendation as                  to its own view.            For my

Part I think that it was so entitled.                    All those on the Panel

were, of course, members of             the Authority;         but, if it     was to

do what it had been          instructed to do, it          was, in my judgment,

essential to report fairly the substance of the representations

which it    had heard.              It is,    for that     purpose, useless         to

recite that "all the arguments have been carefully considered".

That is not a       "report" in the meaning            of that word as        it was

used in the       resolution of the          Police Authority in setting            up

the Panel.        The apparent explanation for what occurred appears

to be    that the     five Panel       members       were led      to believe,      or

believed    without        advice,    that     the    Police      Authority      could

properly act simply on their view of                 the representations which

had been made.        It is clear that there was               no intention       that
                should      be any    further report           or    explanation of            their

         recommendation upon submission              of their        report to the            Police

         Authority nor was anything of            that nature done.                 That seemed

         to me to    be a mistaken         belief and one           which they should            not

         have been advised         or prepared to       entertain.            The       applicants

         seemed to      me to be     entitled        to have        their     representations

         considered by the         Police Authority itself.                   some of the            ,9

         other members might have seen more force in                    the arguments than

         the members     of the      Panel could       see.          Mr.     Newman, for         the

        respondents, has, however,           contended that            that view is           wrong

        and that the Police Authority was entitled to act as it did.


             Little remains to be told as to the process                          of the making

               decision.           The "report"       was considered by the                Police

        Authority on 26th July 1988 and the Authority decided to refuse

        the applications.          The minute is at page 138.                 it recites the

        fact that      the Panel     had     carefully        considered          all    of    the

        arguments      put forward     for     the     applicants           but    unanimously

        recommended that no payment            be made.         The resolution not               to

       provide financial assistance was recorded.                      Twenty one members
‘.rJ
       of the Police Authority were            present at the meeting.                    it was

       one only of     a substantial number           of other items              of business.

       It is common ground         that there was       no discussion and that                  no

       explanation of the representations made for                    the applicants was
       given to the Police Authority.


            On 29th July 1988 notice            of the decision was sent                 to the

       applicants.     No    reasons were given.               On 2nd September               1988

       the applicants by         their solicitors asked             for the reasons           for

       the decision.        On    23rd September 1988           Mr. Reg Race,            county

  Director, replied, as Clerk to the              Police Authority (page 41).
  The following passage should be noted:

          Y°ur letter consistently refers to your clients but ... the
         Federation undertook to meet those costs        and therefore
         Sergeant Dalton and Inspector Wilson are not personally liable
         to meet them".


 Mr. Race then dealt          with the allegation put forward               on behalf

 of the     applicants       based    upon a     press       release made     by   the

 Chairman of       the Police Authority,          "that the       decision of      the

 Committee was based         upon irrelevant              Incprreet ^conclusions

 and that the quotations             ... indicate that the decision            of the

 Committee was        ... irrational".           Mr.     Race saw                      to

 place      the     matter      before     the         Police     Authority        for

 The Proceedings for Judicial Review


         Application for leave         to apply was          made on 26th    October

 and leave was granted          by Mr. Justice Webster on            16th December

 1988.     The affidavit in support was provided                 by Mr. Webber, a

 partner of applicants' solicitors.                    It included   reference to

 the public comments made by Mr. Albert Barnes,                   Chairman of      the

 Police Authority, to         which reference has            been made above,      in

 support of the       contention that the         decision had been made           by

 the Panel and not by         the Police Authority, and that               in making

the decision the        Panel had      had regard to          irrelevant matters.

M r - Webber      referred to    a    report in        the    edition of     "Police

Review" for 19th August 1988.              There is          now before the court

a c°Py of a       Press release, upon which             that article was based,

issued by Mr.       Barnes after       the final        decision of the       Police

Committee on 26th July 1988 in            response, as Mr. Barnes put it,

        The applicants complained that, if the Police Authority is

to be        treated as         having made              the decision     by accepting           the

decision        orrecommendation of                      thePanel, the decision          was     bad

because the            Panel had            taken into        account irrelevantmatters

namely,        (i)      the ratepayers who had brought                    the matter to the

attention of            the Auditor           had not        sought the       costs of         legal

representation;                 (ii)              the     refurbishment       of      the      Chief

Constable's office                  was found        by the     District      Auditor to          be

contrary to law;                (iii)        Mr.     Wilson's and Mr. Dalton's                 costs

had been met by the Police Federation;                           and (added by amendment

at     the    hearing)               (iv)          Mr.    Wilson’s      and    Mr.      Dalton's

application for reimbursement                        was a     "late” application,             made

only after the            costs had           been incurred,         and that the           Police

report above to the effort-
                    effect that since the Police Authority had
                                             -     26   -
        been in     effect the       complainant in      the audit       inquiry it       was
        inappropriate for the Authority to make any payment towards the

        costs.     As I have said, Mr. Newman            has acknowledged that this

        was in error*         Ifc    is necessary to       explain why it        was error
        and, in my       view, a    serious error.           The expectation of           the

        applicants to be paid         their costs, if they were            fairly within

        the central principle stated             in the circular,        cannot sensibly

        be affected by       the fact that       the Police Authority, which              has

        the task    of    considering      their        claim,   was,     to    an extent,

       responsible for causing          the inquiry,       in which the         applicants

       had been put at risk, to be set up and carried out.                        The role

       of the Police Authority          as complainant, in the sense                 that the

       County Council,       of which     the Police       Authority is         in form     a

       committee,     had      suffered         the     "loss"    which        was     being

       investigated, was, on the contrary, a fact in                    respect of which

       the Police Authority was required, in my judgment, to call upon

       its powers of objective detachment so that,                in considering the

       applications for reimbursement of               costs, it would         have regard

       only to     matters    relevant to        the    conduct of      the     individual

IjlS   applicants, in the light          of the       guidance   in the terms of         the

       circular, and       not to any      senseof      general indignation            based

       upon its view of the          "loss" suffered by the County             Council as

       contributor to the police          funds.         There is nothing to            show

       that the members of          the Police Authority were later             told that

       that first advice from         their Clerk was misconceived but,                 as I

       have said, the point has not been relied upon;                    if it had been

       there might have been further            evidence directed to it;               and I
       therefore put it on one side.

        Secondly, it is necessary            to refer to Mr.          Barnes's press

 release.        It    contained     the statement          that "in     exceptional

 circumstances the Authority has the discretionary                      power to pay

officers costs".           It is to be hoped that it is exceptional, in

the work of       a Police Authority,            that consideration has to             be

given to an application of this nature.                      If an application is

made' however, and if the applicant's circumstances fall fairly

within the       guiding       principle    of    the   circular,       no      further

question of       "exceptional circumstances"               then    arises and



d#S:e:r©t.ion. to be exercised properly for the                purposes for which

ttovfRwet* was        given.       This point also          forms no part of          the

case for the applicants and I lay it on one side also.                           I will

return to the         question whether the          Panel had regard           to other

irrelevant matters after dealing with the applicants' main case

which was       that the       Police Authority       did     not consider        their
applications.


The Applicants' first two Submissions


        The first two of Mr, Underhill's main                 submissions can, as

he said, be taken together:           they are the "rubber stamping" and

the "inadequate report"           submissions.          The    force of the           two

submissions is         that    there was     no     proper decision       upon        the

application for reimbursement of costs by the Police Authority.

The Panel was not         given authority to         decide the applications,

although the Police Authority had full power                   to have delegated

the decision to        the Panel if        it had    wished to do        so.          The

Panel took upon itself           to make a decision on             the applications

as to    what    the    Panel     would    do     and to     report     that     as    a
 recommendation.           in reporting back to the Police Authority, as

 it had been       instructed to           do, the Panel        did recite the         main

 factors according to which                their recommendation was m a d e .                I

 accept Mr. Newman's submission that the report was not a "bare"

 recommendation as Mr.             Underhill called it.              The report        made

 reference to the          fact that there            was under consideration           the

 principle of making             any payment         and not the     question of        how

 much payment might be made;               to the      central finding that there

 had been no       wilful misconduct            but with       the comment that         the

 expenditure had          been held       contrary to       law;      to the       central

 principle       stated     in      the    circular;           to    the    fact       that

 reimbursement would             amount    to   reimbursement        of    the     Police

Federation;       and to the fact that there was full legal power to

make payment.         But the report did not describe the submissions

trade for the -applicants;- or indicate their relevance,                         or refer

t° the availability of an account of them, if any member of the

fWlilee- Authority wanted to know                what they were.            The report

was placed       before     the     Police      Authority.            There      was     no

discussion.        The     decision was made.              If it was the         duty of

the   Police      Authority        to      consider      the    substance        of     the

submissions       made      for     the     applicants         in   deciding          their

application then it is clear that as to 16 of the 21 members of

the Police Authority, who               were present on that          occasion, they

faiied to do so because they did not know what they were.


      Mr. Underhill submitted that                   the nature of the       powers of

the Police Authority, and               of the decision required to              be made

upon the application,             was in     each case such         that it was        the

diity of   the     Police        Authority      to     consider     the    applicants'

submissions.        He     referred to the discussion               of discretionary

                         Mr. Newman did         not contend that      the Police Authority            on

                 the facts heard or considered the applicants' submissions.                           He

                 argued that in considering             these appeals the         Police Authority

                 was    exercising     a    purely      administrative         function      and    was

                 entitled to delegate responsibility for hearing submissions and

                 then to act upon the recommendation of                  its sub-committee which

                did hear those submissions.               Next, he said,         the report of the

                Panel was      a "reasoned        recommendation".             in the    case of     an

                administrative discretion it              is usually       sufficient, and         here

                was     sufficient,        to     act    upon     a   "bare      recommendation".

                Reference was made          to Goddard v.        Ministry of Health [1958]            1

                W.L.R. 1151;       to the judgment          of Woolf J., as      he then     was, in

                R.     v.   Chester    Borough      Council,      ex parte       Quietlynn     Ltd.,

                unreported,     14th October        1983;       and to     R. v. Race      Relations

                Macinnes v. Onslow Fane, Megarry VC [1978] 1 W.L.R. 1520.


                        I am unable to accept           this submission.         It is     true that

                Jeffs case was concerned           with an authority which had             nopower

                to delegate      the   making of        the     decision in      question.           in

                Selvarajan s case,         Lord Denning         distinguished      Jeffs on        that
#               ground:     see page 2Oh.         Lord Denning at page 20e said:

                        The most troublelsome point is that several members of the
                       board did not have all the papers.   Four of them had only the
                       summary of a "clearly predictable case" of one and a half
                       pages and a recommendation that the committee should form the
                       opinion of no unlawful discrimination.   it may reasonably be
                       inferred that these four were not in a position to form an
                       opinion of their own.   They must have gone by the opinion of
                       the other three members who had received all the papers and
                       had read them.

                          If this had been a judicial body, I do not think this would
                       be right.   Every member of a judicial body must have access
                       to all the evidence and papers in the case, he must have heard
                           the arguments, and he must come to his own conclusion.
                       The maxim delegatus non potest delegare applies strictly to
                       judicial functions.   But it is different with a body which is
                                                 - 31 -

conduct of its             business.                 There         was, it          was there held,       a

decision by the Board,                      with sufficient information                        upon which

to deal fairly with the case.                               The Board was not                acting as a

judicial body in the                   sense that would have attracted                          any need

for the     Board         as      a     whole         by      individual             members    to   have

                                            - 32 -
         In   this       case        the    Police     Authority    had,      as     I    have

  explained, full power to                  delegate;      but   it did not choose             to

  use that power.           i t was, I agree, exercising an administrative
  discretion;       but it was not such as to be described properly as

  "purely administrative", whatever that may mean.                           The power to

  consider, and if thought                  fit, to award reimbursement            of costs

  arose under       the     general          administrative       powers     given       under

 statute;      but, once         a particular claim by             an officer is made,

 it seems to me that,                in dealing with it, the             Police Authority

 is    deciding      a    claim             to financial       redress      based upon         a

 reasonable expectation of having                    theclaim to    reimbursement

 considered in       accordance with the                principles set       out in       the

 Home Office circular.                 it may raise, as it did here, questions

 as to    the conduct           of         the applicant.         That     nature of      the

 decision required the body,                  to which was entrusted          the task of

 making it, to       hear properly the               case made for        the applicant.

 I do not say that an oral hearing was necessary                          but it was, in

 this case, clearly appropriate                  as the Police       Authority itself

recognised.         The Police Authority in this case decided that it

would retain to           itself the         decision upon        these applications.

That     is   not         surprising:           they     had     arisen     out    of     an

investigation of the conduct                  of senior police officers             in the

handling of public          money which          had, inevitably          and properly,

received much publicity.                    Having made that decision,             and not

having altered it, the members of the                      Police Authority present

were required, in          my judgment, to             decide the applications            by

their own decisions.                 we     do not have     to consider whether            a

retrospective delegation is possible.                      There was no attempt to

effect such     delegation.                  There     was, also,        no attempt      to
describe the submissions made               for the applicants.          There was

not even a summary of them.             I have well in mind the fact that

the five members of         the Panel were        present, and the        16 other

members of      the Police      Authority present          knew     that the        five

Panel members could, if asked, have reported upon what had been

said.     The Police       Authority was plainly content to              rely upon

the judgment of the five.              That is, in my        view, no answer to

the point.       I am content to rest my           decision upon this ground

of failure by      the Police Authority           to consider and to           decide

the applications but, since the argument was made,                      I would add

that this is not, in my view, a merely technical point of legal

analysis.       The 16 members did not know               upon what matters they

might usefully        ask for       further information        unless they          were

given the substance of the submissions made for the applicants.

In particular, they          might have asked        whether the Auditor              had

held that the applicants             had acted in good faith,           and whether

there     was      any      ground      of      distinction         between         Chief

Superintendent Stock          and     Superintendent        Keeton, on        the     one

hand, and       Inspector     Wilson        and Sergeant     Dalton,     as     junior

officers, or either of them, on the other hand.


        I would, therefore, hold             that the decision of        the Police

Authority must be quashed and the applications                      remitted to the

Police Authority to be considered in the light                      of the judgment

of this court.


The Wednesbury Submission


        It is   now      necessary     to     consider the     third     ground        of

application:       the Wednesbury           submission.      Both     sides invited

the court, if the applicants should succeed upon                      the first two
                           grounds, to deal with the third ground also so that the opinion

                           of this court upon the issues raised would                              be available to the

                           parties     when,       as        is     now    necessary,        the     Police     Authority

                           considers the applications again.


                                For this        purpose, it               is necessary        to     refer to     further

                           parts of the        evidence filed               for the       respondents.            It     has

                           been, as I have said,                  common     ground that some of the matters,

                           irrelevant considerations.                       The main        issue has been        whether
        -C -e ^ p ?

/'     I-' -   ^           and to     what     extent             findings of       the     Auditor amounted           to     a

                           "complete exoneration" of the applicants and whether there was,
: '• '      v.
               £      vy   in his     findings, any               basis upon        which     the Police        Authority

                           could reasonably             conclude          that     no     reimbursement        should        be

                           provided for the applicants.                          The next issue was           whether, if

                           there was        such a       basis for          decision, the           decision made           was

                           nevertheless vitiated by the taking into                           account of irrelevant
                           matters.


                                Mr.     Allsop          is         the    Committee         Administrator        of         the

                           Derbyshire County Council.                        He attended           the meeting of           the

                           Panel on 8th July and took notes.                        There was (page 141) "never

                           an intention to         reproduce the             notes but         simply to prepare              a

                           recommendation".             From his notes he was able to summarise what

                           he called "the main points of the Panel's                          consideration of the

           Mr. Newman for the Pol    »„i.u
                          the Police Authority                    submitted that, while

 different members of the Panp]        .,
                           anel, the evidence showed that the
 decision of           the      Panel     itself,     as opposed     to     the    separate

decisions of             the members,       was based        upon the      fact that    the

Auditor's report               did    not exonerate         the   applicants and       that

                  set out m          the report to the Police Authority which
in brief, referred to the conclusion of the                         Auditor that therl

                                                           0n the evidence, I accept
that each         of     the     five    ambers       of    the   Panel     included    in

recognisable form the »„o exoneration', point as                          the matter, or

                                        - 36 -
        as one of the matters, which "weighed most heavily" with him in
         deciding as he did.        Their evidence     can be summarised thus.

        Mr. Barnes, the Chairman, and Mr. Mellors each           gave that point

        as the one   factor which weighed most        heavily with him.       Mr.

        Dentxth gave that point, and the fact that the applicants costs

        had been in fact paid by the Police Federation.              Mr. John and

        M r * Bookbinder each gave as the first fact,         which weighed most

        heavily with him, the      fact that the application was ' "late" so

        that the Police Authority         had not had opportunity    to consider

        the scale and level     of representation, but they each        gave the

         no full exoneration" point as the second factor.




                                                                            such


       relevant, factor    which   could

Jill   W&i'fchout such justification th<
UP7
       Underhill, be taken to have f;

       the central   principle.       Foi                                   that
       submission.


            Mr. Underhill next submitted that the         evidence shows that

       the members of the Panel did not correctly         understand what the

       central principle was.       The      report, said Mr. Underhill,    did

       establish that     the applicants     had   acted in   good   faith and,

       moreover, it wholly exonerated them of        wilful misconduct which

       was the only issue    with which, as regards the        applicants, the


                                     37
Auditor was      concerned.        The    accounting irregularities               were

committed, on the       Auditor's findings, in           the belief that           the

methods used      represented the        proper way      to    proceed.             In

particular Sergeant          Dalton had been     expressly so        told:         see

paragraph 57 of the report.


        Mr. Newman firstly attacked this          submission on the facts:

the report clearly established, he said, lack of                   good faith on

the part of the applicants in addition to a                   failure to act "in

pursuance of their duties".              He added that the         report showed

them to have      told lies.        I have     no hesitation in        rejecting

this submission on the facts.            The Auditor          at paragraph 66 of

his report said this:

        "It is my opinion that the parties acted in the belief that
        their actions were authorised by law for the reasons given in
        this (report) ..."


In my    judgment     that    was a finding    that these applicants              had

acted    in good faith.        We do not have to      consider in this case

whether the Police          Authority would have      been entitled to             act

upon other material          with reference     to the    good faith of            the

applicants.       For my     part I think that they could           properly do

so but, if they were going to do so, I have               no doubt that they

would, and should from the requirements of procedural fairness,

have told the applicants of the substance of                  such material and

given    them an opportunity of dealing with it.                 But nothing of

this nature arose.The Panel claimed to                decide and did decide

on the     findings    of    the Auditor.         Those findings,            in    my

judgment, exclude both bad faith and lying.


        But Mr. Newman's next submission was more formidable.                      He

argued that, accepting, as he says for             this argument the Panel
did, that the      applicants had           been acting        in good faith,                 the

members of the Panel were entitled within the guidance provided

by the Circular        to rely       upon the:: negligence arid breaches                       of

duty of which the applicants had been guilty.                            For the reasons

which follow,      I would         accept this       part     of the          respondent's

case.      The Circular is not drafted as a set of regulations and

it does     not have        the force      of law     of regulations.               ' After

statement of the central principle in paragraph 2 it continues:


"The following      paragraphs            provide    general        guidance        to        the

different classes           of    proceedings".               Paragraph         1   of        the

Circular     had   pointed         out     that     "the     Police       Authority           has

discretion to      meet          expenditure incurred          by     officers in             all

kinds of     legal proceedings where                the officers          have acted           in

good faith     in pursuance           of their       duties".            No    one of         the

following     paragraphs            was     specifically        directed            to        the

particular sort        of        proceedings      under consideration               in    this

case, namely an investigation by an                   Auditor.           In paragraph 4,

under the     heading        "Private Prosecutions",                it    is said:             "a

police officer should be              able to carry          out his duties in                the

confidence that, if              he acts    in good        faith and exercises                his
                                                                                          ,    ,,

                             c a t ^ o ^ ^ ^ t h e r e f o r e ^j^spite... the % existence

of good faith, a failure to exercise                   judgment reasonably would

plainly provide a ground              for not awarding          reimbursement under

th§,„,,central principle.             Next, under          paragraph 7, beneath the

heading "Civil      Actions          against      individual Police             Officers",

there is a similar reference:                "in considering             whether to give

financial assistance              the Authority       will wish          to consider           in

v °r ,sPecifically)considered under                any of the paragraphs           in the

  Circular l see        no reason     why the        Police Authority should           be

  regarded as     required      to exclude          from     its consideration        the

  question whether ^the police            officer          "exercised his        judgment

 reasonably".                             : there was, on            the part of      the

 officer, negligence, i.e. failure to exercise such                         care is was

 reasonably to be required in the circumstances of an officer of

 his rank and experience, doing                his job in the force,             then, in

 my view' the Police Authority is entitled to                       have regard to it
 if such negligence        was so connected              to the subject         matter of

 the   legal    proceedings,        or    to       the     causing     of   the     legal

 proceedings to be taken,           that it can          fairly be regarded as             a

 substantial cause of the           incurring of the            costs.      1    have no

 doubt that a       Police Authority, if            satisfied of good faith           on

 the part of the officer, would normally act,                       and be pleased to

 act, on the central principle stated in the                       Circular;     but the

 discretion is given to         the Authority and it is                impossible, in

 my view, to hold that, once good faith is established, a Police

 Authority must      disregard       clear evidence           of    negligence or      a

 failure to "exercise judgment reasonably". ^                       So to hold would

mean that      a Police Authority         would be         Required to      disregard

acts of substantial         negligence, such that             it could fairly         be

said that,     although acquitted of               bad faith,       the officer      had

"brought the proceedings            on himself".            The decision        whether

evidence of      such    negligence in         a     particular case        justifies




                               - 40 -
           withholding reimbursement, wholly                     or in       part, is,     of course,
           entrusted to the Police Authority.


                   I have      set out          extensively the findings           of the       Auditor

           earlier       in    this       judgment.             Those        findings      provide       a

           sufficient basis for the view of each member                          of the Panel that

           there had been in              this case actions           which were "not          a proper

          observance of what               was required-          see     the affidavit          of Mr.

          Allsop reporting the main points                     considered:       page 1 4 1 .       The

          five Panel members have expressed the point                          in different terms
-    '

•y               the     point      was     the same.            As    members of        the    Police

          Authority they were, in my judgment, entitled to act upon their

          own knowledge            of     the    working of      the     police force       and     the

          standards of judgment reasonably required                          from officers in it.

          For my       part I      would not, therefore,              have held     that, if       the

          decision had been otherwise valid, it was rendered                             void on the

          ground that, because              there had been         a finding of          good faith,

          the findings of           the Auditor provided              no basis upon which          the

          Police Authority,              acting    reasonably,         could refuse       to     grant
         reimbursement.


                 Before leaving the point I would add only                       this.         Because

         the submissions made for these applicants to the Panel were not

         summarised in the Panel’s report to the Police Authority, there

         was no need for those who drafted the report to deal with those

         submissions          or    to    mention        any   distinction        between       these

         applicants and the              other two applicants,           Chief Superintendent

         Stock     and    Superintendent            Keeton.            The     question    whether

         irregularities in              the accounting         procedures constituted            such

         negligence as justified refusing to reimburse                         costs, wholly or


                                                - 41 -
   in Part,       despite        a        finding of   good       faith,       „as one         to     be

   answered with reference                  to each    individual applicant and                      the

   position of the junior officers, acting on                              the instructions of

   senior officers, might                  reasonably be regarded as                sufficiently

   different      to     justify           consideration        of     making       a    different

   response to the applications of the junior officers.                                       whether

     does, of course, is a matter for the                            judgment of the Police
  Authority.


          I    turn     then         tn
                                                  remaining          matters       of      alleged
  misdirection.            The first is the               submission that the                 Police

  Authority could not properly                   have regard to the fact                 that the

  ratepayers, who had brought the matter to the                             attention of the
 Auditor, had not sought the cost nf ^    i
                           6Cost of le9al   representation.                                      Mr
 Underhill submitted             that there was            no evidence          that the         two

 ratepayers had incurred                  costs becausethey were not represented

 at the inquiry.               They       had   attended       and had at      most incurred
 the   expense         of so     attending.               In     any       event,       sald    Mr

                  the     fact        that those       ratepayers            did     not       seek
 reimbursement, assuming there                   to be some          power in the          County

 council to pay if a request had been made, cannot reasonably be

 a ground for not granting an application for reimbursement made
by a   police         officer.               M r . ,leMnan,     as     r    understQO;J         his

submission, conceded that                   this would     have been an             irrelevant

factor, if it had          been relied upon,              but he contended               that it

was not relied upon.                 I think he was right so to concede:                       the

absence       of any     claim        from the      two    ratepayers          is,       in    my
judgment, clearly irrelevant-          .
                y irrelevant to the merits of the                             claim by the
applicants.           As to whether

   Mr. Newman argued that that principle
                                    P nciple has n° application in the
  context of the
                            °ry P°Mer of the Police Authority and of
  the guidance given in
                                      Circular;          and that a Police
  Authority is entitled to refuse             r«,- k
                                           to reimburse the costs on the
  ground that the officer
                                 is not personally liable for those
  -sts.      F o r m y parfc/ x h a v e n o d Q u b t t h a t M r underhiii.s

 primary submission is correct and that,  having regard to the
 terms of the C i r c u l a r
              Circular, the mere fact that an officer has been
 Provided     with   legal    representation    by     the   rederation    is

 irrelevant    to    the     question   whether an     application        for

 reimbursement should be       granted.        It is    clear that insome

 cases the question whether reimbursement should             be granted can

 only effectively be       decided by the    Police Authority when        the
result of the proceedings is known.            Prior application by the
officer to the  Police Authority      isnot in *

condition of reimbursement       t +-
                    sement.       it seems clear to me that the
Home Office, in giving the guidance               ,
                                    ce, and the local authority's
association and the police staff «          •
                     p o n c e staff associations, with whom the
terms of the Circular were aorB^
                                    / as is recited in paragraph 1
of it, contemplated that      in
                                      cases, the Federation might

                             - 44 -
 agree to provide representation in the first place and that the

 individual officer would be free to seek reimbursement when the

result is known.        That conclusion does not           mean that a Police

Authority could in no case whatever have regard to                   whether the

Federation had provided the legal representation                or whether it

had been paid for by        the officer personally.            An application

might be   very finely balanced,            having regard     to the     various

factors requiring to be weighed.              If, in     a particular case, a

Police Authority was minded to take into account, in support of

a plea based     upon severe financial          hardship, that an        officer

was personally     liable      for    the    costs, I     consider     that     the

Authority would be       entitled to        have such regard     to it as        it

would think    proper     in    the circumstances.             In this        case,

however, it is clear on the evidence that                the Panel, viewed as

a whole, did take       into account the fact that           reimbursement in

respect of these applications would "in fact be a reimbursement

to the Police Federation of its             costs".      It was, accordingly,

in my judgment thus      taking into account            an irrelevant matter.

One last point should be mentioned.               A Police Authority is not

bound to make reimbursement according to the scale                   and cost of

representation incurred by an officer, or by                the Federation on

his behalf, in    a case where           the Police Authority        judges that

reimbursement is proper.             a    Police Authority may decide           to

authorise reimbursement to           the extent       that was, in    its view,

having obtained proper         advice and     information, reasonable           in
the circumstances.


     The final point was        that added by amendment,         namely that

it was a misdirection       on the part of the          Panel to have regard

to the   fact that the      application for        reimbursement by       these
   applicants was           •'late";     that is to         say made    only after             the

   costs had been incurred,              so that the Police Authority                  had    had

  no prior       opportunity of          considering the            scale    and level            of

  representation.            Hr. Newman conceded,             and rightly in my view,

  that this      was    a      "bad"     point      but he     argued       that,      on     the

  evidence, only Mr. John and Mr. Bookbinder had had regard to it

  although, with        them, it         was      given as     the     first factor           and

  before that of negligence and breach of duty.                             The point was

  bad, I think,        because it did            not matter that the             application

  was in that      sense and to           that extent "late".               i„    the first

  Place it    could         not    effectively        have been       made       before      the

  inquiry was concluded because the Police Authority did not know

 what the outcome would be and any decision                         on their part would

        had to    have included provisions                  preserving the right              of

 ultimate decision quite unfettered;                   and,     secondly, the Police

 Authority     had,     as        explained       above,     full      power      in    their
 discretion      to    reiert
                         a _i=        , ,
                         a claim lf          should appear that
 representation was unnecessary   o r that  *
                             t y' or that, if necessary at all,
 at a    much reduced         level.            It could,     in such       a case,       make

 reimbursement only of such costs as should reasonably have been
 incurred.


        What, then,     should be the             result having        regard to        such

attention as was paid to matter which were                      conceded to be, and

which I have held to be, irrelevant, assuming that the decision

was otherwise valid?                   The position        can be     summarised thus.

Mr. Barnes, the        chairman, took into             account, and referred                 in

his press release           to, the irrelevant             fact that the         reporting

ratepayers had        not     claimed their          costs.          Next, the         Panel

generally took into account the fact,                   irrelevant in this case,

                                   -     46 -
r
      that any reimbursement would            be for the benefit of                the Police

      Federation although it was for            all the members of the                Panel a

      subordinate reason.           Finally,     two out      of five members              took

      into     account     the    irrelevant      fact     that         the       applicants'

       pplication was        late .           Mr. Newman      submitted that              these

      irrelevancies      should     be     ignored:       there        was    a    good     and

     sufficient ground for the             decision, which was foremost                in the

     minds of all members of             the Panel, and the decision               should on

     that ground be upheld.             No authority      on this particular point

         cited to us.            it must, in my judgment, in each                  case be a

        **er      degree    depending upon all           the circumstances of               the

     case,     including    the    nature      and    apparent         weight        of     the

     irrelevant factors, and the proportion to                the whole membership

     of the     deciding body      of     those who    paid    attention to               those

     factors, and the probable weight and influence                     of the decision

     of those members.            if the attention        paid to the             irrelevant

     factors is shown       in probability to         have played a           significant

    part in the making of the decision then, in                   my    judgment, it is

    sufficient to render the decision             bad.      on the facts            of this

    case I     would have    held, if        the decision     had been            otherwise

    valid, that it was rendered void on this ground also.




    MR. JUSTICE NOLAN:           I also agree

  I f therefore there was, on the part of an o ffic e r,
 negligence ie fa ilu re to exercise such care as was reasonably
to be required in the circumstances of an o ffic e r of his rank
and experience doing his job in the Force, then, in my view,
the Police Authority is e n titled to have regard to i t i f such
negligence was so connected to the subject matter of the
legal proceedings or to the causing of the legal proceedings
to be taken that i t can f a ir ly be regarded as a substantial
cause of the incurring of the costs. I have no doubt that a
Police Authority, i f satisfied of good fa ith on the part of
the o ffic e r, would normally act, and be pleased to act, on
the central principle stated in the Circular; but the
discretion is given to the Authority and i t is impossible, in
my view, to hold that once good fa ith is established, a
Police Authority must disregard clear evidence of negligence
or of fa ilu re to "exercise judgement reasonably".

So to hold would mean that a Police Authority would be
required to disregard acts of substantial negligence such
that it could fairly be said that, although acquitted of bad
faith, the officer had "brought the proceedings on himself."
The decision whether evidence of such negligence in a
particular case justifies withholding reimbursement, wholly
or in part, is of course entrusted to the Police Authority."

POL 92 2()       POLICE COMMITTEE                                12 February 1992



FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS: HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 77/87

1. Purpose

To acquaint the Committee with developments in the Police Advisory Board (PAB).

2. Recommendations

That the Committee consider their comments at this stage so far as possible in anticipation
of the joint Police Staff Associations paper and encourage member Police Authorities (who
have not already done so) to let the Secretariat have a note of their practice for the
information of representatives on the PAB Standing Committee on Conditions of Service.

3. The PABSCCS: 21 October 1991 (AMA representatives: Councillor Bundred and
Councillor Bramfitfl

At the above meeting, the Association of Chief Police Officers complained that the contents
of HO Circular 77/87 did not give adequate support to an officer faced with substantial legal
costs. Taking out insurance policies to cover expenditure was not satisfactory. Support for
the ACPO statement was expressed by the two other police representative bodies. Councillor
      vho was attending as a substitute member suggested that the Hillsborough case provided
an example of the problems which could arise. Some local authority members, he said,
particularly those from South Yorkshire, felt very strongly that the matter would need to be
discussed within the Association before adequate comment could be made on their behalf.
It was agreed that a paper along lines suggested by ACPO, including examples of cases
where there have been problems, together with any specific thoughts on the Home Office
circular would be useful. The next meeting is due to take place on 6 April. Reference was
made to the subject at the PAB itself on 9 December when it was said that the Police Staff
Associations would present a joint paper on 6 April. Early sight was called for.

4. The Practice of Member Police Authorities

The Secretariat has canvassed practice amongst member police authorities.

5(a). West Yorkshire have sent a full description of their procedures. That Authority were
impressed by the deep concern entertained by staff following Hillsborough. It should be
stressed that none of the Staff Associations expect support for the "rogue officer". Following
discussions with the Staff Side, they agreed the following:-

(i)    That all members of the Force be assured that, when the Police Authority is
       considering an application for legal assistance for an officer who has acted in the
       course of his/her duty and in good faith, it will start from the premise set out in
       paragraph 2 of Home Office Circular 77/87 and that, where any doubt exists, it will
 (ii)   That, where the relevant Staff Association requests, ft^ u T d ’^ a y ir t^ ^ n iiitte d to
        make representations either in writing or orally, as it wishes, to the appropriate
        Committee of the Authority making the decision.

The Committee also agreed in the interests of equity, that the Staff Associations be given
sight of the written submission which was being made to members by the Chief Constable
and/or the Solicitor.

West Yorkshire report that the procedure has been operated satisfactorily in practice whilst
acknowledging that they have not had to face the difficulties which occurred for South
Yorkshire following the Hillsborough disaster.


(b) South Yorkshire point out that the overriding factors enunciated by the Circular in
determining whether to meet such expenditure are:

(i)     good faith and in pursuance of duties
or
(ii)    the interests of the force as a whole are involved.

 They go on to say that in all cases except a criminal prosecution, these issues can be
considered in advance of the costs being incurred by the officer and in practice invariably
are because the officer’s application to the Police Authority is anticipatory. There is in fact
judicial authority in R v Derbyshire Police Authority ex p Wilson and Daltnn for the
proposition that the terms of the Circular create a presumption that an officer is entitled to
reimbursement of his reasonable costs in the situations postulated in the Circular; this can
only be rebutted if there are some relevant factors which could reasonably justify the refusal.
It is suggested that this would be a difficult onus to discharge in most cases.

(6) South Yorkshire then go on to refer to Hillsborough where the Police Authority agreed
to fund the cost of representation beyond the limit of money available under the applicable
policy of insurance and, where no insurance existed, funded representation pound for pound.
The Authority wanted to reimburse legal costs concerned with disciplinary proceedings
because the insurance limit had been exceeded and legal representation was indicated in the
interests of natural justice. The Home Office, however, confirmed that in their view
disciplinary proceedings were not covered by the Circular so that grant would not be
available which led to the Authority’s rejecting the application.

NOTE FOR FILE:-


HILLSBOROUGH LEGAL COSTS


Announcement this date that MMI have suspended trading.

Considerable media hype about Police Authority having to find millions in as yet unpaid compensation.

Spoke with Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards. There are circa 50 compensation claims outstanding
involving the most seriously injured. MMI reached its pay out limit many months ago and outstanding
claims are with the re-insurers and there should be no difficulty in these being settled.

With regard to the 50 officers claiming, this is a separate employers liability action and on-going legal
costs re this will not now be met by MMI. Stephen Walker, Secretariat, has instructed Hammond
Suddard to continue acting for South Yorkshire Police.

MARK WARD




PC 2205

South Yorkshire Police




I am a Police Conatable with 5i years service, presently stationed at Doncaster.

At 8.30 am Saturday 15th April 89 I commenced duty at Doncaster Police Station,

at this time I attended at the Magistrates car park where the briefing was held

by Inspector Townend.           I was informed that I was in Sgt Dolan's Serial No. 24.

On   completion      of   the   briefing    we    were   transported      by    double     decker     bus   to

Sheffield    Wednesday's        Hillsborough      Ground.   At    this   time    I   attended     the   main

briefing held by a Chief Supt Duckenfield.

At 11 a.m. I commenced duty in company with PC 1741 Sowerby on Middlewood Road,

between the junctions of Minto Road and Hillsborough precinct.                            At this time the

number of supporters from both teams in attendance were making their way to the

ground    and were    asking      directions     to off licences and cafes etc,              all appeared

good humoured.        General      patrol   of Middlewood Road supervising                arrivals,     small

groups of youths making their way towards the grounds some with cans of alcohol.

At 3p.m. in company with Sgt Dolan and PC 1741 Sowerby, one drunken violent youth

by the name of Hodgkinson transported to cell area Hillsborough ground.

Upon leaving the cell area PC Sowerby and myself were immediately directed onto

the pitch "there's trouble at the Leppings Lane end."

I then ran to the entrance and onto the pitch,                    once on the pitch I saw at the

rear of the Leppings Lane end goal area members of the crowd spilling onto the

pitch and police officers were scaling the fence.                    Together with other officers

we ran towards the goal area at this time we were following one of the ambulances

I ran towards the Leppings Lane end to the left of .the centre of the pitch.                            As I

reached    the   6   yard   box    I   could     see   officers   and    members     of    the   St   John's

attempting to revive what appeared lifeless members of the public, these bodies
were strewn around the goal area.                           Supporters were starting to make stretchers

from nearby advertisement hoardings.                         I assisted in removal of bodies to suitable

nearby sites for resuscitation.

Members      of the emergency services were now arriving with oxygen etc and re-sus

was commenced by them.

There    were     numerous       supporters          on the pitch shouting abuse.                   They were saying

"This is your fault you murdered us, you fucking bastards."                                       "We should have had

the big      end."           "I hope        you're    fucking       happy,     you bastards       caused this,          South

Yorkshire Police the Merseyside murderers."

I    could      see    that     one    youth        had    picked     up   a   length   of 2"      by     2"    green     wood

discarded        from    one     of     the    hoardings,        he    was     agitated     and   waving        it   towards

officers.         I took the wood from him and took it to the touch line where a club

official took it from me.

I returned to            the    pitch where          I passed a Chief Inspector walking towards                               the

halfway      line,       I     asked        "What    is    the   plan?"         He   replied      "Just        contain        the

situation."           I then returned to the goal area where I found a youth in light blue

coloured jeans, he was laid on the floor and screaming.                                   His legs were obviously

injured.        I assisted in placing him on an advertisement hoarding.                                    At this point

two officers pulled a large heavy built male and placed him next to the youth

with the damaged legs and commenced re-sus.                                The man was blue in colour and was

wearing brown trousers which had slipped around his thighs.                                       On seeing this the

youth with the damaged legs began to scream hysterically.                                   At this point both the

officers        giving       resuscitation           and    myself     were    run   into    by    a    large â€žgroup           of

supporters        carrying an advertisement                  hoarding.          I then got other supporters to

carry    the youth with               the    injured legs on a hoarding out of the goal area and

across the pitch.

At   this point I became aware of large numbers of supporters who were obviously

upset,    charging down the pitch towards the Nottingham Forest end.                                       I saw that a

long     line     of    police        officers       had    formed     and     was   bringing      them    back      to       the


                                                                                                                 7c 2 2 ^ x
Leppings Lane end.

I spoke     with      numerous      distressed         fans    and ^tried      to console           them.          I saw one

supporter      take      down the       goal    netting        to    assist    the       removal        of    bodies    other

supporters      were        now carrying         hoardings          with   people     on numerous people               on the

hoarding       had     their     head     and       shoulders        covered        with    articles of            clothing,

presumably dead.

I   could      still        see bodies      laid       around       lifeless,        with     people         attempting      to

resuscitate them.           Others were laid on the floor because people had left them for

dead.

I was then directed to form part of a second line on the pitch "again to contain

the situation."          This line of officers was eventually filed off the pitch through

the directors area and outside to the rear of the Leppings Lane end.                                               On passing

the entrance to the pitch I saw PC 3011 Clifton who was pale faced and obviously

somewhat upset about the situation.                       Ambulance officers were attempting cardiac

massage on a body at the end of the stand.

I then took up duty to assist                    in the removal and evacuation of supporters.                                 I

could see men leaving the stand area crying and again the shouts of abuse were

directed towards the police.

Adjacent    to the river I could see a" set of barriers,                                   within this area were a

number    of    bodies.         I   could       see    Inspector       Millet       in     this    area       dealing      with

enquiries from possible friends and relatives.                             As the fans were leaving I saw PC

Jane    Crapper      (A2)      breakdown       in     tears,    she    had     to    be     taken       to   one    side    and

consoled.

We were     then all        directed      to return        to the North Stand,                we were subsequently

debriefed      and     directed      to    Claywheels          Lane    where        we -had       our    meal,      prior    to

returning to Doncaster.

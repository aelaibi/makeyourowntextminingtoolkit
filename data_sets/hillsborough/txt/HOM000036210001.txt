REVISED MEDIA ARRANGEMENTS FOR LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH

My note of 9 July covered the planned photo-call and short briefing for the judge running the
Hillsborough scrutiny, due to be held on Monday 14 July. You ( Home Secretary ) would
prefer the judge not to get led into answering questions.

CD therefore propose to issue an operational note tomorrow ( Friday 11 July) inviting
photographers and film cameramen for “ wallpaper “ shots of the judge at QAG.( in the desk
setting we have in the TV studio here ) We will issue an agreed statement on his behalf on
Monday morning ( first draft below ) but make it absolutely clear that the judge will be
making no comments at the photo/film session.



DRAFT STATEMENT BY LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH

“ I have today started work on the scrutiny into possible new evidence relating to the
Hillsborough stadium disaster. My work will involve looking at evidence which it is said was
not previously available to Lord Taylor’s enquiry, or to the prosecuting or disciplinary
authorities. I will also be taking written representations and will then decide who I wish to see
in person, but I can confirm that after the summer I will go to Liverpool to meet the relatives
of those killed, and the relatives’ legal representatives.

“Such meetings as I have will be held in private and I will not be making any public
comments on the evidence or representations which are made to me during the course of the
scrutiny. I hope to report my findings to the Home Secretary towards the end of the year.

Anyone wishing to submit material to me can do so via Room xxxx Home Office, 50 Queen
Anne’s Gate etc “

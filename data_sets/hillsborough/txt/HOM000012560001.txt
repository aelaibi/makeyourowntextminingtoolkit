    Mr Jack Straw MP
    House of Commons
    London

    Dear Sir
    I wrote to you recently regarding the Hillsborough tragedy. I
    asked for a personal reply but - as expected - someone else
    replied on your behalf. I understand that you are a busy man but
    when voters - the people who elect you - receive replies from
    assistants they get the impression that the person they have voted
    for is no longer interested in their problems.
    One of the main attributes of a politician is to avoid an issue
    he/she cannot answer directly, so - in plain english - please
    answer yes or no to the following questions. All I am asking for
    is YOUR opinion, Mr Straw, from all that you know about
    Hillsborough.
    1.   Do you think Hillsborough should have been used for this
         match?
    2.   Do you think that police crowd control at that end of the
         ground was badly organised?
    3.   Do you think that a person trained in crowd control should
         have noticed a dangerous situation building up long before
         3.00pm (I was there at 2.30pm and it was desperate then)?
    4.   Do you think that it was (I can't find a word strong enough)
         idiotic to allow thousands of anxious fans to surge into
         an already packed area, with no escape?

    5.   Do youbelieve that the man in charge is ultimately
         responsible when things go wrong?  After all that's what
         he's there for.
(2 )

Mr Jack Straw MP
House of Commons
20 April 1998




6.     Do you think that JUSTICE has been done?

Remember Yes or No and signed by yourself or a reply will mean
nothing.


Yours sincerely
                                                                  <




Tony Blair MP
Prime Minister,
House of Commons,
Westminster,
London.


                                                                            18th February, 1998.
Dear Sir,
                                      HiUsborouah Decision

I grew up just inside N. Wales with an adopted family from Liverpool. From this background I
developed a keen interest in supporting Liverpool FC and became very active within the Labour
Party. I campaigned for the Labour Party throughout the 1970's and 1980's and became a
Constituency Party Secretary and later a Clwyd County Councillor.

Above all I supported Labour since, without reading any great political thesis, I believed simply
that the Labour Party was the Party most keenly interested in fairness and social justice.
Although my activism in politics declined as my business demands increased my sense of
frustration with the previous government, and my desire to see it replaced by a Labour
Government, always remained strong. Above all I hoped that a new government, a Labour
Government, would set about righting the injustices that had been inflicted upon so many groups
and individuals by the Tory regime over so many years.

Fortunately, for myself, I missed the tragic game at Hillsborough. I have nevertheless remained
touched by the tragedy and have felt very concerned about the original inquiry. The arbitrary
decision of the Coroner in disregarding events after a set time, the discrepancies within police
evidence not to mention their absolute failure to admit liability and their decision not to raise any
disciplinary action is beyond my comprehension. For goodness sake Ninety-six people died!

As a manager of a chemical company safety is of paramount importance to employees and me.
Regrettably, I have had cause on occasion to discipline a few employees when they have failed
in their duty or have acted negligently and risked a breach of safety standards. I have even had
to dismiss one chap. However, their actions have never got close to injuring anyone let alone
result in multiple deaths. The potential to cause injury was sufficient to justify action. What on
earth can be said to justify such an absolute abdication of responsibility by the Police and
Emergency Services in the case of Hillsborough?

Surely, after such a tragic event of this magnitude we have a right to get to the real truth and
ensure that every possible aspect surrounding the events are thoroughly dealt with to everyone's
satisfaction. Justice cannot be served, and will not be seen to be served, whilst there are so
many unanswered questions. I am absolutely ashamed o f the decision announced by the
Home Secretary today.




                                                                                                        J
It is only a token gesture on my part, but for what it is worth I absolutely promise that I shall
never ever again vote or support your party. You have today so clearly failed to act On this
miscarriage of justice. There appears to be little or nothing between you and your predecessors.

I'm sure you will, with the arrogance of power and given the size of your majority, be tempted to
dismiss such letters as mine. You would do well to remember that such contempt would
ultimately and absolutely end your Government's term of office just as surely as it did with that
personification of intolerance and arrogance herself, Margaret Thatcher.

As one who spent a significant part of my life supporting Labour and encouraging others to do
the same - 1can only say I feel utterly and totally betrayed.

                                        Yours sincerely,                 a

Dear Mr. Blair,

1 am 'writing to express my




or disciplined for their lack o f actions'and unprofessional conduct leads one to support
the change which is obviously needed in Police Complaints procedure, so that the situation
no longer prevails where the police investigate themselves. Legislation is urgently required
for independent police judicial enquiries so that justice can be seen to be done,

I would Mke to guess that a© Sealer Police Officer has ever been prosecuted, resulting in a
custodial sentence, for misconduct in these kind o f circumstances.

As motorists we are often reminded that ignorance is no defence, however, this does not
seem to apply to the police!

What is criminal is that Jack Straw and the Government had the opportunity to right this
terrible injustice-but has chose not to and it seems this investigation was merely a token
gesture, a sham and nothing more.

What was that about a fair and just society?

    HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY




    Like a!! other Merseyside Districts, there were families in W est Lancashire who were tragically
    bereaved as a result of this disaster. W hilst you may be satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-
    Smith may consider that he received sufficient information from South Yorkshire Police, the
    Hillsborough families remain convinced that documentation which may have assisted the
    presentation of their submissions has been withheld from them by the police.


    of the previous judicial proceedings has been more than "adequately demonstrated, "as a
    result, the Council has now instructed me to write to you to call upon you to reconsider your
    decision not to reopen the Hillsborough inquiry and no doubt you will consider this request by
    this Council and the other Merseyside local authorities accordingly.
                                                                                                 .
    I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

    Yours sincerely,

There w as a slogan I remember fr om the 1930's                                       The Tories y ou cannot trust

the Independants you can never find w h e n needed.                                        Vote L a bo ur the party of

the people"           Is Labour n o w onl y the party of the pr iv il e g e d few?.

Rem em be r "HILLS BO RO UG H " 9 years ago 96 people                            lost their      lives and to date

not one perso n has b ee n brought to book.                                There have b e e n m a n y disasters

trains, planes,         coaches,    always persons or p e r s o m re sponsible have been

eit her disc ip li n ed or g i ve n a cu st odial sentence.                                 But not Hillsborough.

I like m a n y thousa nds of others              sat and w a t c h e d that TE R RI B LE                tr age dy u n f o l d

M y first reac tion ut ter an gu is h an d h el p lessn ess at not be i ng able to help


the victims.           The n anger at h o w this was a l l o w e d to h ap pe n w i t h so ma n y

pol ice and surveillance eq uipment available.                                    Someone so mewhere was u l t i m a t e l y

r espo n si bl e    for this awaful carange causing the deaths of 96 innocent people.
                                                                          t>L
The m a n at the he ad of se curity of this wiraja o p e r a t i o n "Mr.                            Du ck enfield"

" Retired on h ealth grounds*' h o w v e r y convenient,                                no r ep ri m an d not even a slap

on the wrist,         just a nice fat p e n s i o n and a h a p p y retirement,                        ve ry neat

and tidy.          Others w e r e gi ve n c o mp en s i o n for their part in the tragedy.

A lmost   like a pat on the b a c k for a "job wel l done".                                    N o w w e have a Lab our

Govern me nt       "New Labour" great hopes,                     a promise that if e l e c te d a n e w enquiry

w o u l d be launched, w i t h the n e w evidence that the g r i ev in g relatives had found.




                                                                                                                      Contd/ ov er

     f*
          So wh at has h a p p e n e d "NOTHI NG" Oh yes you a p p o i n t e d a Judge to look at the n ew

          evidence, w h i c h h ad b e e n c on v ie n tl y gone m i s si n g during the first e n qu i ry along

          w i t h w it ne ss 's w h o w e r e ne ver cal le d the first time around.       The Judge m e t h i nk s

          h ad an op ini on a l r e ad y formed w h e n he ma de a so ca lle d "joke" on m e e t i n g some of

          the relatives     for the first time,         about L iv e rp ool   fans turn ing up   late.

          That if you remem ber w as one of the m a n y slurs ma de against these un fo r tu n at e

          people.    Not a r emark you w o u l d expect       from a p e r s o n a p pr oach ing an enqu iry
                                                . a/
          w i t h an open mind.     Mr Strawifa the light of recent events the p re - el e c t i o n

          talk of a new enqu i r y w as to my m i n d ve r y cruel and cynical.             "H I LL S BO R OU G H"

          wil l ne ver go away,    until a full and open e n q u ir y is held,         ther e are m a n y

          ques tions that must be answered,            by the peo pl e w h o we r e involved.     The n m ay b e these

          peopl e the b e r e a v e d familys' wi l l be able to grieve and truly lay their               loved

          ones to rest.

          I have been a strong La bour supporter for m a n y years,              havi ng cast m y firstimp o rt an t

          vot e in the General E l e ct io n in the 1 9 4 0 ' s      But I n ow feel that I cannot S u p po rt a

          P arty that has so c ruely let down some of its staunches supporters.

          One vote ma ybe not m u c h in the overall electorate,              but these things have a n as ty

          ha bit of sno wballing.        I w as always told that e v er y vote w a s       important.

          So come on Mr Straw get this enq u i ry underway,             you have bo th the       power

          and au t h or i ty to do so.

Dear Mr Blair. '                '                 \
           I am currently a student at the Wigan & Leigh College
stjidying^coinguter course, I also happen to behfCudying the
Hillsborough disaster?^)
                  noticed that Mr Jack Straw has turned down the
chance for another inquest, when they were told that they are able
to have another inquest if Labour got into power. Now I find this
unfair and very unreasonable, does he have a specific reason on
why he is breaking this promise?.
           I don’t mean to sound too blunt but there are people who
have voted for your party and all the promises that you have made
to them so far have been broken or nothing has been done about it.
My Father has been a Labour voter ever since he was able to vote,
and has told me that they are the best party that keep to their
word. Every demonstration that he has been on I’ve been with him
but now we are both appalled by the behaviour and the way that
the Labour Party have reacted in most cases. Even I’ve wanted to
vote for Labour ever since I was a little girl. I could not wait to vote
for the best party but now I’ve seen them in power, like others, I’ve
changed my mined.
           My friends, family and myself are very disgusted by the
way yourself and Mr Straw are handling the Hillsborough case. I
found it very apparelling and very upsetting to see that A L L the
evidence is there and you are not allowing another inquest. Would
you please care to explain your reasons for this? I would also like to
know that if your children were killed in the disaster would you
feel different? what would you do then?. Why won’t you see that all
the parents of the deceased need is one more chance to prove what
really happened and that A L L the evidence needs to be brought
forward.
           I may not have been there but I have studied closely and you are
able to see that it could have been prevented even with the old evidence
not just the new. Many people are disgusted at the way you have handled
many cases not just Hillsborough for example things like Benefits, the
D.S.S., Jobs, Schools E.T.C.


                   Yours Sincerely

 6 March 1998.
                           Letter has been acknowledged.
                        Please arrangefor your Department
 Dear Mr Blair,             to deal with as they thinkfit u


 I write as a disillusioned member of society disheartened by the efforts of this administration in
 governing this great country. Like millions I was encouraged by the prospect o f a Labour
 government, but am disappointed that it appears that this administration is compounding the
                                                    igovernment.

There are a number of questions that I, and I am sure the majority of the country, would like
answered.

Being Welsh, a main concern is the advent o f the Assembly. Now that the population of Wales
have demonstrated their desire for a separate parliament for this principality, there comes the
issue as where to locate the Assembly. I am interested to learn why it is that the Secretary of
State for Wales and the Welsh Office appear to feel that Cardiff has the divine right to play


Would it not be more prudent to locate the Assembly in a city such as Swansea that is in
desperate need o f the Assembly than simply place it in Cardiff at the convenience o f the Welsh
Office ?. The City and County of Swansea is in desperate need of attracting investment in
order to improve the infrastructure. This has proven to be difficult with Swansea receiving
only a fraction o f the amount of investment as Cardiff. The Assembly situated in Swansea
would facilitate an increase in investment and lead to an improvement in the infrastructure o f
the City and surrounding areas and facilitate a badly needed facelift for the City itself.

 As Cardiff have received so much more funding than Swansea it is no surprise that it is a much
bettor and nicer city than Swansea. However to redress this balance, Swansea would benefit
 from the Assembly far more than Cardiff, and would be able to reduce the                 in quality,
                                                                                  c h a s m


job opportunities and appearance that is apparent between the two cities. Surely it is more
logical to attract investment and develop those areas of Wales in need of improvement and not
just focus attention in the capital. After all this is an Assembly for Wales, and not all the Welsh
live in Cardiff.

Unemployment is another topic of concern, particularly from my viewpoint as a graduate. I
graduated just under two years ago and spent 9 months on benefit until entering my current
post, which does not require nor utilise my degree level knowledge. This is a common state of
affairs amongst graduates in this countiy. I therefore ask why it is that this country pays tuition
fees and grants to students for 3-4 years in order for them to be trained and educated to such a
high standard in the achievement of a degree, only for these graduates upon leaving university
to enter a world that treats them with suspicion, envy and disdain. It is also a world in which
graduates commonly spend 1-2 years, if not more, on income support before getting a job
which requires them to possess nothing more than GCSE’s. It is frustrating for graduates to
work so hard and achieve an excellent qualification only for employers not to suitably
recognise their efforts, knowledge and skills.

It is also frustrating to see the “graduate slack” apparent in this countiy. It is a waste of this
country’s resources in paying for these people to reach degree level only for them to end up in
a job filing papers or answering phones. This is a waste of the graduates knowledge and an
under utilisation of a large segment of the available workforce. This is a loss to the country in
not making best use of those people whom the country has paid for to reach the degree level
standard. In not utilising these graduates, is it not a case of cost inefficiency in incurring the
costs of training these individuals to reach these standards only for these resources to remain
idle or under used ?.

Would it not be prudent therefore to address this problem of under utilisation of resources for
the prosperity of the countiy as well as for the good of the individual in ensuring that suitable
employment opportunities exist that fully utilise the huge pool of resources at the country’s
discretion. This, after all, is a more cost effective and efficient utilisation of these graduates
and would result in a more appropriate input back into the country of the knowledge that has
been passed on to these graduates.

If this were to be addressed, most graduates, if asked, would simply wish for there to be a job
available for them that would utilise their skills, abilities and knowledge, provide them with a
challenge, pay them a wage that reflects their intelligence and skills/abilities and most
importantly allows them to experience job enrichment and job fulfilment.

The increase in Prescription Charges is another concern. With all the publicity of the last few
years regarding the actual cost of these drugs and the profit made on them, I am dismayed that
this administration feels it necessary to make yet more money from the people whose
misfortune it is to be ill. Why should it be that the population of this country have to pay so
much in order to remain healthy ?. Is this not also discriminatory towards those on low
incomes ?. It is not fair that the amount of income a person has determines whether they can
afford to purchase drugs they need to remain healthy. Health should not be something that
only the better off members of this country can afford. Health should be widely available for all
regardless of their financial position. This increasing of prescription charges was a mistake
when the Conservatives were in power just as it is a mistake now. In fact when increases were
made when the Conservatives were in power, these were denounced by your party. Why is it
then that a move across the floor of the House has suddenly led to this drastic U-turn in the
policy of the Labour Party ?.

Finally, I was disappointed to hear of the decision of the Home Secretary re : Hillsborough.
Not only have the families of those killed on that tragic day lost loved ones and been deceived
by the Yorkshire Police regarding video evidence, but now that the video evidence has
surfaced it appears that the government is all the more determined to protect the Police. This
government, and any government for that matter, should be acting in a manner that has the
best interests of the citizens as its main priority, and has the duty to protect the people of this
country. The government should not be protecting the actions of an institution whose duty it
was in April 1989 to ensure the safety of those supporters at Hillsborough, a duty it failed to
perform. The priorities being demonstrated by this government are directed towards the wrong
camp. In refusing this new evidence and protecting the gross negligence of the Yorkshire
Police on that tragic day, this administration is not only insulting and causing upset to the
families of those who died, but also trampling on the graves of those supporters who never
returned from Hillsborough. For their sake, please reconsider this whole case. This cover up
and upset caused to the families of the supporters has gone on for too long.

I look forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely

Subject: Home Office handling of the enquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster.
To: gen.ho@gtnet.gov.uk

Dear Sir or Madam,
         I am writng to you as a disillusioned British citizen who
voted for
your Government in the last general election.
         I was always under the impression that after a full inquiry
into the
tragic events of April 15 1989, justice would finally be carried
out. I
beleived the Labour party when they promised the families of the
victims
of Hillsborough justice.
         It now appears as though you have "laid the matter to rest"
following
last month’s press release. Is this the case? What are you actually
doing now, on behalf of the people who rely on your office solely
to put
right one of the greatest injustice’s of the century?

         I personally ignored the people who, prior to May 1 1997,
dismissed
this Labour government, saying it would be the same as any
Conservative
one. However, your promises are just as empty as the previous
government’s always were.
         Everybody who was at the ground that day, or who knows the
complete
facts of the disaster, appear to have been ignored from the
beginning.
Your Home Office appears to be quite content to continue to ignore
the
cries for justice.
         The nightmare just continues. The families don’t want
sympathy. They
don’t want money. All they want is for someone to actually admit
that
they were wrong and that they didn’t do their jobs properly that
day.
They only want somebody to accept the conseqences of their
failings.
         Until you yourselves insist that this is done, you will
continue to be
included on the long list of people who let these families down.
You
know that they are no different from any of your families. They are
normal people who had a relative go to a normal football match, at
a
normal football ground, to be treat so abnormally and so

negligently by
the people who controlled their safety that they lost their lives.
        You wouldn't allow the injustice to continue for your own
family.
Please do not allow it continue any more for these families.

        Thank you for your time,

07 March 1998

Mr Tony Blair
The Prime Minister
10 Downing Street
LONDON


Dear Tony and Prime Minister,



Myson.                                                                           on the
day of the tragedy.

Lite many other parents I waited on the platform at Lime Street Station not knowing
whether my son was alive or dead.lt was not until 10pm on that Saturday night that I saw
my son walking down the platform and I could breath a huge sigh of relieve.

There must be countless thousands of other families who experienced similar trauma
but have said nothing and trusted in Justice.

The Government has spoken and .regardless of politics,we feel humiliated and cheated
by the legal system.and I have written to Jack Spriggs,the Chair of Liverpool Council’s
Hillsborough Disaster Working Party.asking him to plead our case.

I ask you Id reconsider the case with Jack Straw




When will they ever learn?



Yours sincerely

                                             Please arrange fo r your Department
                Dear Mr. Straw,                  to deal wUh as they think fit
                                 I                        am writing to you to express my grave concerns a
        governments decision not to allow a fresh and open inquiry into the Hillsboroucih
        disaster.
                                 I                        am writing as someone who has no connection w
        disaster or the support group, but as a Labour voter who feels very strongiy that Lord
        Smith's report must be set aside to allow for a new inquiry which involves fully all
        parties.
                                Why is always the question,* for justice, for fairness, for equality,
        for openess, all these values and perspectives are things that this government holds
        dearly and was I believe elected on.

                                 Why then did the recent interview and discussion on ITV
        following the second showing of "Hillsborough * leave me knowing there is so much
        more. Of ail the issues that were discussed that night, a significant fact to me was that
        the chief constable of South Yorkshire had seen Lord Smith's report well before Mr.
        Hicks and therefore had very detailed knowledge to argue with.

                                  Yet what is important is that Mr. Hicks and the families have
        already identified significant factors in the report that they believe to be untrue /
        inaccurate, despite the fact that they had not been allowed as much time to prepare.
        Why were the families not given copies of the report at same time as the chief
        constable?

                                   if matters are open and fully involve all parties this would not
        have happened. It therefore appears to me that Lord Smith's report has to be set aside
        as it clearly has not aiiowed for full involvement and leaves significant factors /
        questions that are still to be highlighted by the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

                                                        Yours faithfully,




        cc Mr. T Blair, Pime minister.*

 Dear Sir

I wish to express my disapproval at the so called ‘New Labour Government’ and the
handljng_Qf_the appeal for a fresh inquest into the tragedy at Hillsborough nine years
ago. Everyone else can see freslfevidence. However, Jack Straw on the advice of
a High Court Judge has said “there is no fresh evidence”.

I feel, like most people, that Labour has let the victims and the families down. If my
memory serves me right, jeers of disapproval where shown at the original verdict
and we all know that the 96 victims did not die an accidental death that day.
Someone was accountable for the tragedy.

I find it so hard to believe that one man could say accidental death and it has got to
be accepted. He was employed for and on behalf of the Tory Government and
therefore in my opinion would obviously have been biased somewhat in their favour.

 Having no direct involvement with the families of the victims or their support group. I
feel that more people like me should shout in support of what was a travesty of
justice. I feel that one of the following verdicts would have been more appropriate.
Involuntary Manslaughter or at least Misadventure though the latter would still be a
let off.

Below are examples of situations which would be of an equal comparison.

1.    A driver sneezes violently and looses control of his car for a second. He
      mounts the kerb and kills a pedestrian. He would be charged with one of the
      following. Causing Death through Reckless Driving or Death through
      Dangerous Driving.

2.    A person is set upon in the street and defends himself. He knocks the
      assailant to the floor, he cracks his head and later dies of a brain
      haemorrhage. The person being assaulted would be charged with
      Manslaughter.
3.     A Hotel Manager is not aware that someone has blocked one of his fire exits
       and a fire breaks out, people are trapped and killed. He would be charged
       with Involuntary Manslaughter.

In all of these cases, though not directly or intentionally killing people, they would all
be accountable for the deaths and would appear in front of a Judge and Jury before
they could be admonished of responsibility. The Senior Police Officer in charge
of CROWD CONTROL that day did not intentionally or directly kill the 96 fans.
However, his actions led to their deaths and therefore in the eyes of the law he must
be accountable.

The ‘Herald of Free Enterprise’ was a recent tragedy in which people were held
accountable.

Ps     I enclose a verse communicating my personal feelings towards the incident.

Yours sincerely

                Hillsborough
                   A Day To Remember

         They went to watch their favourite team
         another FA Cup Final, A Wembley Dream
     No one could have predicted what was to happen
       people in Authority must have been napping

       The skies where blue as the teams came out
           the Fans they roar, scream and shout
      Penned into a closure at the Leppings Lane end
     we hope and pray nothing like this happens again

       The joyous shouts become a terrifying scream
      some people would not see that Wembley dream
            Sighs and gasps faces become numb
      the people in Authority looked extremely dumb

      Fans kept coming on a Senior Officers direction
           a fatal mistake was his in indiscretion
         96 innocent fans lost their lives that day
     one things for sure they'll be remembered always

          The plight of the families still goes on
        until they get Justice, "Thy will be done"
     The Tory enquiry was a cover up or so it seems
    When Labour cried out, families saw a radiant beam

     Labour came to power and Jack Straw led the way
         no one could believe what he said today
He read out a statement, the guidance of a High Court Judge
             another enquiry has been fudged

            To the 96 who lost their lives that day
       the fight for Justice will never be swept away
          Justice for the suffering the hurt and pain
        those 96 lives will not have been lost in vain

                                                              9.02.98

Dear Sir,

     This letter is probably the most difficult one I have ever had the misfortune to put together.

I am writing with reference to the events yesterday, and your subsequent decision not to launch a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster in April 1989.

You will not be surprised to learn, that I am a Liverpool season ticket holder, and was present at the
Hillsborough disaster on that fateful day. By pure chance, I was able to exchange my standing ticket
for a seating ticket only hours before the game. However, this does not detract from the horror I bore
witness to.

To say I am apalled at your decision, would be an understatement. Before last years election, you
made it very clear to everyone, that you were fully behind a complete investigation. Now firmly sitting
in Government, its simply amazing to see both yours and Labour’s attitude “cool” completely.

I was proud to vote Labour at the last election, to finally be rid of the “corrupt-ridden” previous
Government, was a blessing in more ways than one. I firmly believed, wrongly as it now turns out, that
we had a Government committed to finding the truth about the Disaster.

Before the so called new inquiry began, I had serious misgivings about the new Judge taking over the
investigation. Judge Stuart-Smith's outrageous comments towards the family’ s: “being late, like the
Liverpool supporters” , hardly instilled confidence in anyone. Rightly, as it turned out.

However, I find it unbelievable, that no new inquiry is to be launched despite:
(a) Vital evidence & witnesses were withheld from the original inquest...So how on earth can the
      original inquest be “accurate"?
(b) Everyone knowing the Police lied about events that happened.
(c) Video tapes being “stolen" by persons unknown...(Yet only the Police having anything to gain
      by them going “missing”. )
(d) Missing tapes not being “significant”....how do you know, if you haven’t seen them?!
(e) The Police being held accountable for the disaster....But no one being prosecuted?!
( f ) The original Inquest having a cut off point of 3.15pm...even though people were still capable of
      being saved after this point.
    (g) The Emergency Services being praised          What for? their delay is weii documented, including
        sitting outside the ground in lines of vehicles!
    (h) Evidence provided of Police tampering with evidence....How can this NOT effect an inquest?!

    These are just some of the points that need answers to, it cannot be brushed under the carpet.

    The Police were guilty of gross negligence on a grand scale. You have a duty to the people of this
    country, to find out the truth and in doing so, prosecute those responsible.

    As you have failed to do this, 1believe you should take the families advice and resign. However, I
    doubt for one minute you will do so, but I hope you can live with your conscience.

    As Trevor Hicks accurately said yesterday: “New Government, new whitewash.”




    Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Straw,


   We were devastated at your recent decision
not to hold a public inquiry into the
Hillsborough Disaster.
   To us, it was evident that the men, women
and children that suffocated on that day were
victims of police incompetence at its very
worst. They were also victims of an ambulance
service that failed to put an emergency
action plan into action, and that didn't seem
to know the meaning of the word
'triage'. That has been stated by an
ambulanceman that was present on the day, so
it's not a unjustified statement. Also, only
14 of the vicims made it to hospital; that is
unforgivable.
   The families of those who died, have had 9
years of false accusations, with their loved
ones being accused of drunken behaviour,
robbing the dead, and to quote 'The Sun',
"urinating on the dead." Even today, there
are still those who seem to think it was all
the Liverpool fans' fault.
   96 men, women, and, don't forget, children
died in horrific circumstances. 96 families
were destroyed, 96 families will never be
able to come to terms with what happened
unless the guilty parties are made to pay. 96
lives were wiped out, and no-one seems to
care.
   We, as members of the public, feel we have
the right to demand an inquiry. We urge you,
Mr Straw to reconsider. Be courageous, make a
stand, and give not only the relatives and
friends of the victims, but the survivors who
have to live with the horror of Hillsborough
every day, the peace of mind they deserve.

Yours sincerely,
      AVIREX*

Dear Mr.Howarth,
                  Thank you for your letter,in reply to mine,on the subject of the
Hillsborough disaster.
I am bound to say that,interesting though your long missive to your constituency party
might be,it does not satisfy me in any shape or form.
Everybody on Merseyside and the vast majority of the rest of the country knows that
the verdict of accidental death is a vile travesty and must be overturned.
The next step along the way to achieving this objective must be a full parliamentary
debate and the people of Merseyside are looking to their own MP’s to ensure that one
takes place.
Towards the end of your long communication to your constituency you say that you
don’t know how to help.
I would respectfully suggest that you simply throw your weight behind the campaign
for justice    this is all that is being asked of you.


                                             Yours sincerely,

6 February 1998

The Rt. Hon J Straw MP

Dear Sir                           ,
                                       RECE!\/ p I
I feel I must write this letter      twb«wjl«Lq™11      'faster. I myself went to this
game, aged sixteen, on a properly organised supporters’ coat|h. I will try to give you
my account of what happened that day.

I arrived at roughly 1.30pm in plenty of time for the 3.00pm kick-off. After buying
some sweets etc. my companion and I decided to enter the ground. On our approach
to the Leppings Lane end, a crowd was already gathered. As you will know from
reports etc. this end of the ground was like a funnel and you have to queue to enter - 1
still remember this being a bottle-neck prior to entering the main turnstile area to gain
entry to the terraces. This was some sixty minutes before kick-off and not what I
would call a sudden rush of people arriving late to gain entry. At this stage I was
already being pushed. I remember thinking, even at sixteen years of age, that one
Policemen on a horse wouldn’t be able to deal with this already growing magnitude of
people. My rather limited experience of football matches had told me that much.

I come from a good solid working/middle-class family in a nice area of rural Cheshire).
I mention classes because I still feel to this day I have to justify my being there, my
behaviour and that of my fellow supporters. To certain people, the truth could not be
simpler. I do not want revenge, but justice, hopefully in a moderate way to banish
people’s pre conceived views on what happened that day. As I feel the frustration of
the families who lost people that day, I can’t help but feel that the Government, past
and present, wish this would just go away - a drunken load of Liverpudlians arriving
late for a football match. I was neither of these. In fact, if it was not for one of these
pre-judged Liverpool fans, I would not be here today. It was him that pulled me out
from the front of the Lepping Lane End terracing, after being almost pushed back in by
a Policeman. To be fair, the look on that Police Constable’s face was one of sheer
shock. I don’t think he knew what to do - should he let us onto the pitch or not - that
could have been his dilemma. Somewhere along the line his actions must have been
orchestrated by a superior. Why the lack of communication , the endless melee of
confusion, the faulty camera, only one mounted Policeman? Why was kick-off not
delayed - questions we keep asking and asking. The list is endless.
    Please let the truth come out.

    Yours faithfully
         X




    P. S. Never at the time of the disaster or after have I had counselling or seeked
    compensation because I just wanted to forget it all. please help me to do that.

Westminster, London,    WS,
                    :                  ■    Dear sir,
                                                  With all the recent T/v & News paper
coverage of the "Hillsborough disaster",! find that every one of my acquaintance ,to whom 1
have discussed it with are of the opinion that "Hicks" is only out to try and obtain as much
money as it is possible to get!
                                                  Has it been at all voiced ,o r, the matter
raised as to how many of that "MOB" that "Forced" the gates to be opened at Hillsborough
on that fatefull day had TICKETS..?!!, from what my knowledge is of that kind of mob that
attends those "Special Matches" they go with "Intent & with Malice afore thought" to get into
the Ground with or with out tickets.
                                                Of all the the people that 1have ever seen,
wheather in life or on T/v screens "Hicks" has shown the least remorse for the loss of Loved
ones, I for one can not talk about my family tragidy even after twenty four years with-out
showing remorse s till!. If he was so concerned about his girls ,...Why wasn't he with them at
the moment the Disaster started, what is his exuse..?!! But..giving him the benefit of some
loss , it does seem that he is taken more up with Revenge than with Remorse .
                                                Should there be any reason or cause that
"Hillsborough" is brought again into Public notice ...USE MORE SHOTS OF THE MOB
OUTJ3IDE THE GATES. Jll.it’s GENERAL PUBLIC that will be the only way to CLOSE the
Issue of "Hillsborough" once and for all.


                                                Sincerely,
        The Rt Hon Jack Straw MP
        House of Commons
        Westminster
        London                                                                              21st February 1998

        Dear Home Secretary,

        I am not a Labour supporter and have never voted Labour but, somewhat to my surprise, since 1st
        May I find myself approving policy after policy, applauding decision after decision. The Government
        seems to be getting most things right in these first months and I have been particularly impressed by
        what the Home Office is achieving.

        I write to mention two recent matters. Firstly your refusal to re-open the Hillsburgh enquiry into the
        tragic deaths of the football fans. That is unquestionably the right decision and I hope you will not be
        moved by the howls of dismay which have followed.
        However, amidst the technicalities of video evidence, times of death, police action or inaction, etc,
        there is one central fact which has been more or less lost sight of and which I think you do a disservice
        not to point out to football fans everywhere. This is that in the last analysis it was not the police, nor
        the people running Hillsburgh nor the Football Association nor the Government who killed the fans.
        This was done by people behind pushing and pushing until other people were killed.
        I go regularly to Murrayfield, which is somewhat bigger than Hillsburgh in capacity I think, and there
        is never any sense of danger in the vast crowd of some sixty thousand. I was even there on the
        infamous occasion when the SRU blocked off the two massive gates leading from the car park into the
        stadium, usually kept wide open, and replaced them with four turnstiles. The resulting build up of
        people trying to get in was incredible and after half an hour in this jam none of the people in it were
        too happy to hear "Flower of Scotland" being sung and the game starting. But there was no undue
        shoving - people realized that this would just be counter-productive.
        And this is the real message of Hillsburgh which I think has become obscured by all the attempts to
        blame the authorities. The fans must take responsibility for conducting themselves properly, otherwise
        such accidents will happen whatever steps are taken to improve the organization of such events. This
        message seems almost completely lost unfortunately in a welter of technicalities and blaming the
        authorities.

       f The second matter which I would like particularly to applaud is the new policy towards the freemasons.
        There is no place in an open society for an organization which operates in such a secretive manner -
        and here the problem may well be what they are suspected of doing or not doing because of their
        secrecy and their perceived influence rather than what they are actually doing. You are on exactly the
  -i    right lines in encouraging anyone in a position of authority to expose membership of the freemasons,
        only I would make it obligatory not voluntary as I understand you are recommending.

'Sw.    But well done New Labour on many, many initiatives which have my total, if surprised, support.

                       15:38 25/02/98 +0, FOR THE ATTN OF MR. JACK STR

From:
Date: Wed, 25 Feb 1998 15:38:00 +0100
Subject: FOR THE A T T N OF MR. JACK STRAW
To: gen.ho0gtnet.gov.uk

        Dear Mr. Straw,
        No doubt when you see the word Hillsborough you will probably
want
     to simply stop reading this message        (if you ever get it in the
     first p l a c e ) . However I would urge   you to read on just to
hear the
     point of a normal football fan.

     I understand that you in fact only carried out your job by
ruling
     out a new inquiry into the TRAGEDY after the Lord Justice
     Stuart-Smith's report you received. Well - I would like you to
do
     "more than your job" and have the decency to investigate ALL
the
     evidence (especially the evidence after the 3.15pm cut-off)

        Accor di ng to numerous eye witness reports there were people
        "vomiting" and "having convulsions" on the pitch at 3.20pm. I
don't
        want to bore you with old evidence but how can a court of law
in
        any democratic country take evidence from policemen down the
far
        end of a pitch and IGNORE evidence from family and friends who
held
        their dying loved ones in their own arms???????

     I am not going to go into detail about the obvious bad
policing
      (I'm sure you'll personally/unofficially agree with this
statement)
     but surely it should be made clear that it was this bad
policing
     that definitely led to the deaths of 96 people and this
tragedy
     could have been avoided.   Yes there was fans traveling without
     tickets and there was fans that were drunk - but is this a
crime???
     I have been to hundreds of games where this IS ALWAYS THE CASE
but
     there is always adequate policing to deal with this 'problem'.

     The evidence goes on and on - please please please have the
decency
     look into this matter further.

        Before the election   last year - Labour vowed to do

                   "everything in their power"
        to bring about justice.  Well please see that everything in
their
        power means everything in their power -   and not everything in
        their job.

     One last thing if you get the chance read Dr. Ed Walker's
report in
     the Telegraph dated 18/02/98.

        I hope the voice of one normal person merits a reply.

        Thank you for your time.

Dear Sir                                      V

As I write this letter  tonight, I can only say, I hope you are
fully satisfied with what you have done. Tonight you have only
protected the guilty and punished the innocent.

You have no feelings for the families of the disaster or for the
fans like myself who were present. You have brought shame on the
british Justice system, and you are giving your blessing to say
that i t i s ok for the Police to murder who they like,in any way
they like and they wont be punished. I bet you would have felt
different if your own child or wife had been a victim?


This Labour Party should be ashamed of itself. New Labour, New
Cover up. I sugest you take a long look at the evidence and then
put it to the British people to decide, and they will qive you
their answer.

How many more people have to die through police mistakes and
negligence before the Government sit up and take notice.

I hope that for the sake of this country, which, to the world is
a laughing stock, Labour fall at the next Election.


Please reconsider your verdict on this matter before it gets any
worse

    A FORMER ambulance driver in the front line
    at the H illsborough disaster has backed
    bereaved relatives’ bid for a private prosecution.

    to help the injured and dying.
      Speaking exclusively to The Sunday

    surprised, that the Home Secretary has
    decided against holding an inquiry.
      “While his investigations were under way

       “The ambulance and emergency services
    should hold up their hands and say, This is         Tony now runs a bike hire business and is
    where we went wrong’.                            rebuilding his life with his wife, Laura, and
                                                     20-month-old daughter, Rosa.
       “It would have helped the families if they
    had already done so, but now relatives are          “When I came here I was in a state and

Dear M r S t r a w

                  ACCOUNT A B I L I T Y FOR THE HIL LS BOROUGH DISA ST ER

I am w r i t i n g to you in the sincere ho pe that in some small w a y I may add
w e i g h t to the c a m p aig n for an o f f i c i a l st atement of a c c o u n t a b i l i t y for the
tragic events that lead to the d e at hs of 96 p e o p l e on the fateful 15th
April.

De s p i t e the fact that you a pp ear to have admitted in p r i v a t e to m e m ber s of
the vi cti ms families th at you feel th ere was gross n e g l i g e n c e on that day
on t he part of the police, you were still abl e to tell th e Commons and
th e r e f o r e the n ation th at the c u r r e n t v e r d i c t takes into accou nt all the
e v i d e n c e . D o you b e li eve that gross neg lig enc e is 'a c c i d e n t a l '? Wh at
reasons do y o u have for m a i n t a i n i n g the agony of t he v i ct ims families? A r e
you aware tha t they m e r e l y seek the t r u t h to e n abl e t h e m to p u t this
horr ifi c t r a ge dy and e v e n mo re hide ous w h i t e w a s h b e h i n d them?

As a lif elo ng L a b o u r supporter, I a m g r owi ng mor e d i s i l l u s i o n e d by the day.
It a l mos t appears that the Tories have left the ir h e a r tle ss and immoral
me n t a l i t y b e h i n d to be a s sum ed by tho se in office, and all the c a r i n g and
un d e r s t a n d i n g words of y o u r p art y in o p p o s i t i o n have b e e n t e m p e r e d by the
fact th at n o w y ou AR E the e s t a b l i s h m e n t .

Just b e c a u s e you have lost the nee d t o fight those in p o w e r , p l e a s e I beg
you do no t b e c ome the p o w e r the n a t i o n needs t o fight for justice, for
tr u t h and for d e c e n c y .

            DEAR'MI|V‘STRAW,
                      I FEEL I HAVE TO WRITE TO YOU
CONCERNING YOUR DECISION NOT TO ALLOW A NEW
INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.
                     AS YOU HAVE PROBERBLY
GUESSED I THINK YOUR DECISION IS WRONG AND I
KNOW THIS LETTER WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO THIS
DECISION BUT I JUST CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
AND YOUR PARTY SEEM TO BE TURNING YOUR BACKS ON
THE VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO STUCK BY YOU IN THE
DARK DAYS OF THE EIGHTIES.THE FAMILIES OF THE
DEAD AT HILLSBOROUGH DESERVE TO BE TOLD THE
TRUTH ABOUT HOW THEIR LOVED ONES DIED,JUST AS
ANYBODY SHOULD,BUT IN THIS DECISION YOU HAVE
ONCE AGAIN DENIED THEM THIS,JUST AS THE LAST
GOVERMENT DID. IT DID NOT SURPRISE ME WHEN THE
TORIES TURNED DOWN A NEW INQUIRY BUT YOU HAVE
SURPRISED ME AND YOU HAVE DISSAPOINTED ME IN
THIS DECISION.
                 I URGE YOU TO RECONSIDER THIS
DECISION AS I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU ARE THE
PARTY OF TRUTH AND HONESTY,THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE
HAD MY VOTE IN THE PAST. I ALWAYS BELIEVED YOU
WERE THE PARTY OF DECENCY AND FAIRNESS BUT
SURELY YOU WILL AGREE THAT IT DOES NOT SEEM FAIR
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LOST LOVED ONES STILL DONT
KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT HOW THEIR LOVED ONES DIED
WHILE THE MAN WHO WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF THE
SAFETY OF THESE PEOPLE NOT ONLY TOLD LIES TO TRY
AND PUT THE BLAME ON INNOCENT PEOPLE BUT IS ALSO
RETIRED ON A FULL PENSION.
IS THAT JUSTICE MR. STRAW ?

                 Ua)
Hillsborough Disaster

I realise that, in all probability, you will not personally see this letter, but I would
really appreciate it if you would read it and, with that in mind, will keep it as
concise as possible.

M ay I start by saying that I am sorry that my letter is not more articulate - I'm
sure you have had much correspondence on this subject from people who are far
more eloquent and know much more about the subject.

However, having watched a BBC1 news report at approximately 5 .3 0 am on
Sunday 1 March 1 9 9 8 , I felt I just had to write to you (something I have never
felt moved to do before).

It was an interview with tw o relatives of victims of the Hillsborough Disaster.

I am not a football fan (nor a mother) but I can obviously remember the horrific
scenes all those years ago. I do w atch the news and current affairs programmes
and have seen further coverage about the disaster over the years, including your
recent decision about not re-opening the enquiry (apologies if th a t terminology is
incorrect).

However, nothing      has moved me as much as listening to these tw o ladies, who
were so dignified     in their grief. (Unfortunately, I did not see the start of the
coverage but the      older lady was talking about her son - I am not sure of the
relationship of the   younger lady).

Watching the older lady really struck a chord with me as she reminded me so
much of my mother who was devastated by the sudden death, from a heroin
overdose, of my cousin about eighteen months ago. The similarity between
them was remarkable - their hands are never still, their faces etched with
incredible sadness and disbelief over w hat has happened.

From the coverage I have seen, there are so many anomalies surrounding so
many facts that I find it unbelievable that there is to be no further invs
The older lady said that you had admitted that there had been gross negligence.             j
If that is an accurate quote, how can you not w an t to attribute that negligence
to someone? Are you not obliged to?                                          1 6 MAH 1998
The knock-on effect of the loss of her son is enormous and on-going. She is
scared to let her other son out of her sight in case anything happens to him. She
has recently found out that many of the victims suffered - having previously
been told that they had not. Imagine how this must torm ent her (and others)
who may previously have had some small comfort from believing that many of
the deaths had been very quick and that there had been little suffering.

She said that she does not trust the police. Whilst w e all know that there are
some members of the police force (as in all walks of life) who indeed cannot be
trusted, thankfully most ordinary people believe that these are in the minority. If
the maintenance of law and order is as important to the Labour Party as you say
it is, it is vital that the public do trust the police. Incidents such as this, where
that trust is called into question, can do nothing but harm.

The loss of a child in such circumstances is the most traum atic thing a parent
could ever have to face. After the initial anguish, you would w an t answers and
reasons. The feeling that you have then been let down (indeed, some would say
betrayed) by the very people who have the power to help and support you and to
answer your questions must make the situation even more unbearable.

There are a great many injustices in the world and with the majority, it is not
possible for one person to make a difference. However, in this case, I believe
that it is possible for you to make a difference. I would ask you to ask the BBC
for a tape of this programme. I cannot believe that, having watched it, your
conscience, as a parent if not as an MP, would allow you not to reconsider your
recent decision.

The people who died deserve justice and their families and friends deserve
whatever peace of mind that justice can bring them.

With many thanks for taking the time to read my letter and in the certain
knowledge that I sadly cannot, but you certainly could, make a difference to the
lives of all the people affected by this tragedy.

Re Hillsborough Inquiry.                                           R E C E IV I d

I have seen and reseen the latest documentary on the above disaster. Whilst
the general public cannot be sure of being aware of all the relevant facts in
the matter I am sure you must be aware of the feeling of unease that an
injustice could be being done and, regrettably to myself and many others, our
own Government is now being seen as yet another group of people assisting
in providing a cover up for the apparently obvious failures of police on that
tragic day. We were not particularly surprised at the previous Government’s
apparent collusion but we are certainly surprised to see you seemingly
following their line.

I am very much aware that Public Inquiries are at times very expensive and
this one, presumably, would be no exception. However, bearing in mind the
scale of public opinion and the grave doubts expressed by a large cross
section of the public, I find it difficult to reconcile your decision to NOT hold
a Public Inquiry. I would certainly like to believe that the Inquiry costs and
potential damages costs depending on the Inquiry’s verdict played no part in
a decision to not hold the Inquiry.

I firmly believe that you owe the electorate in general and the relatives of the
Hillsborough victims in particular a detailed reasoning of your decision.

I think Labour supporters, apart from anyone else, have the right to see their
Party in Government being seen to be fair and honest. We had too many
years of the previous Government not being so but we believed, rightly or
wrongly, that our new Labour Government would be responsive to the
feelings of the public, honest, open and above board. The result may or may
not change after an inquiry but at least we would be aware that all evidence
had been considered and made available to everyone.

I have no connection with any Hillsborough victims but believe I am echoing
the views of very many reasonable people.

I sincerely hope that you are able to review and reconsider you previous
decision.


Yours Sincerely

Dear Sir

I attended the FA Cup meSCch between Liverpool and Notts Forest
nine years ago.  I arrived at the ground half an hour before kick
off.  I passed many police officers outside the ground and had to
queue for less than a minute to get through the turnstiles.   I
walked unhindered to my chosen section of the terraces, where I
stood without being squashed. This was a football match organised
as it should have been.

Why, why, why then did Hillsborough happen? The above match was,
of course, the rearranged fixture at Old Trafford, not
Hillsborough, where I arrived half an hour before kick off to be
greeted by unbelievable scenes I have never witnessed before - I
was 39 at the time - in all my years of attending football
matches.  TWO policemen on horseback trying to control thousands
of fans who had travelled many miles to watch their teams play an
important game and were - shall we say, anxious - to get into the
ground.

Did the people who organised the game not realise that you can't
get so many thousands of fans through so few turnstiles in so
little time?  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  Could the trained police
officers not see how the situation was developing long before
3.00pm?

Why do pol ice attend football matches?

I thought their main reason for being there was crowd control,
that's their job.  If I didn't do my job properly and it caused
such a disaster, I would expect to be punished and if the disaster
was caused by lack of organisation and bad judgement then those
responsible should be punished.  How can anyone say it was no
one's fault? The people who decided to use Hillsborough.   The
people who organised crowd control outside the ground and mainly
the person who allowed thousands of anxious fans to flood into an
already packed area - SHOULD BE PUNISHED.  Accidents don't just
happen, they are caused.

I don't want a reply from some assistant or secretary.  If you
can't reply yourself, in your own words then I'll know you haven't
got a mind of your own.


Yours faithfully

      - Dear Mr. Straw,             \
                         I am w ritindl^^m cM ^ress my grave concerns about the
governments decision not to allow AfrfSsnand open inquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster.
                         I am writing as someone who has no connection with the
disaster or the support group, but as a Labour voter who teels very strongly that Lord
Smith's report must be set aside to allow for a new inquiry which involves fully all
parties.
                        Why is always the question,* for justice, for fairness, for equality,
for openess, all these values and perspectives are things that this government holds
dearly and was I believe elected on.

                         Why then did the recent interview and discussion on ITV
following the second showing of "Hillsborough" leave me knowing there is so much
more. Of all the issues that were discussed that night, a significant fact to me was that
the chief constable of South Yorkshire had seen Lord Smith's report well before Mr.
Hicks and therefore had very detailed knowledge to argue with.

                          Yet what is important is that Mr. Hicks and the families have
already identified significant factors in the report that they believe to be untrue /
inaccurate, despite the fact that they had not been allowed as much time to prepare.
Why were the families not given copies of the report at same time as the chief
constable?

                           If matters are open and fully involve all parties this would not
have happened. It therefore appears to me that Lord Smith's report has to be set aside
as it clearly has not allowed for full involvement and leaves significant factors /
questions that are still to be highlighted by the Hillsborough Family Support Group.




                                                                            18 MAR 1998

Dear Mr Straw


With reference to the article about the Hillsborough disaster on Page 9 of today’s
Guardian2, will you be taking steps to identify the Woman Police Sergeant who signed as
having witnessed, on each page of the statement he wrote for West Midlands Police, the
signature of Dr Ed Walker, despite his never having seen her, and, if the circumstances are
as reported, will you institute proceedings against her for Peijury, or whatever other
offence she may have committed?

If you really intend to achieve the laudable aim of ensuring the highest standards of
behaviour in the Police as well as local government, it ought never be too late to follow up
allegations of misconduct, still less of criminal behaviour, especially where there is both
documentary evidence and verbal testimony.




Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Straw

I am writing to ask for Justice for those killed and for the families o f those killed at
Hillsborough.

I was one o f the people who voted Labour in the belief that it would end what I
perceived to be the sleaze and corruption and underhand dealings o f those in power
at the time o f the last general election.

Please do the right thing.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr. Straw,

I am writing in concern with your decision relating to the Hillsborough disaster of

April 15th, 1989.

The evidence that has been presented, proves beyond any reasonable doubt that the

incident was not an accident. It is time, now, for the negligence of the police force and

energency services to be publicly recognised.

The disaster destroyed not only the families of the ninety six fatalities, that day had a

much wider effect on many more people. I believe that since that fateful day, the city

of Liverpool, reknowned for its humour and friendly disposition, has carried a more

sombre air. April 15th, 1989, killed part of a city and a people, and what was lost

cannot be replaced.

So, I implore that when you make your decision, you see that                    :. These
                                                                         GB
people have lost so much, please give them something back. Justice.



                       Yours sincerely,




                      OPPU REGISTRY

Dear Mr   .Straw



I am writting to you with the regards to t l ^ ^ ^ l j l ^ b o r o ^ h   situation.


I was horrified to learn through the press that'^^irwill pobably say that
no further action should be taken, I was amazed by this statement and I
hope that the press have got it wrong.           There are so many things about this

whole situation which have since come to light that f feel should be looked into.

I believe that the Tory goverment brushed           a lot under the carpet and I can
see how it would look bad for the Police to be found at least negligent but

surley justice must be done if not for the 96 dead at least for the living.


I look forward the hearing that you have made the correct decision and not
bowed to any pressure from the police.



Yours faithfully,

20th February 1998.

Dear Mr Straw,

RE : HILLSBOROUGH.

I am writing to you to express my bitter disappointment at the decision by Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith not to conduct a fresh inquiry into the avoidable tragedy at
Hillsborough in 1989.

I speak as a long standing fan of Liverpool F.C who spent much of his formative
years standing on the terraces at Anfield. As with most true football fans I built up a
tremendous empathy with the club over this time and this naturally extended to my
fellow supporters. Such feelings compounded my deep shock at what happened on
15th April 1989, and I have continually been haunted by what happened on that day.

You go to a football match with feelings of expectation, eagerness and above all fun.
Indeed for those who attended the match that day these feelings must have been
intensified by the importance of the match. It is utterly beyond my comprehension
how such a day could end in such horror. You don't go to a football match and be
killed through no fault of your own. That is not the way things happen, and it could
never be described as" accidental"

The anguish of the relatives of those who were killed at Hillsborough has not
lesened over the intervening years. The awfulness of losing a loved one in such
circumstances has been successively compounded first by the lies propagated by
the Police and Media immediately after the event, and then by the relentless cover
up to try and protect those ultimately responsible for the deaths of 96 people.

Despite many of the families expected the verdict recorded last Wednesday, it must
have stiii delivered a reeiing biow. The verdict came despite new implicit evidence
and the very real sense of injustice this case invokes.

I ask you to do all you can in support of the Hillsborough Families, so as they can
one day obtain JUSTICE.

Yours sincerely


                                                       c.c Keith Hill M.P
Jack Straw
House of C
London. I




I am writing to you after hearing the news that there is not going to be a new inquiry into
the Hillsborough Disaster. There are several points I would like to make:

1.     The original Taylor Report (which I have personally read) put the majority of the
blame for the disaster on the South Yorkshire police and in particular Duckinfield. Yet
no action was taken against them.

2.   You have stated today that the new report has also put the blame on the South
Yorkshire Police and have actually spoken of the "disgraceful lie” that Duckinfield told.
Yet no action has been taken.

3.    Tonight, live on TV, Richard Wells also said that the South Yorkshire Police and
Duckinfield in particular had to bear (in his words) the lion’s share of the blame. Yet no
action has been taken.

4.    It seems to me that when      a member of the general public is to blame for
something, or when a member of the general public deliberately lies to protect his own
skin when some disaster occurs, then he or she is prosecuted yet it seems that a
member of the police force and indeed that force itself can do whatever they like and get
away with it.

5.     The families of the victims of Hillsborough and Liverpool supporters in general
have had to endure years of being held responsible by the public at large. It took a
television play to give people the true facts.

6.    If the same attitude had been taken after World War II then no war criminals would
have been brought to justice, as the line could have been taken of it’s in the past, they
did what they had to do, they made mistakes but they couldn’t help it.

In closing I just want to say that I feel totally let down by your party and you, I voted
Labour at the last election with the feeling that it would lead to a new society, a society
which held justice in the highest regard, - I am totally disillusioned. I have no faith in the
police force - they do not seem to be able to be held responsible for anything and I have
no faith in New Labour. I will certainly change my vote at the next election along with
thousands of others. I urge you to take heed of ordinary people and do not forget who put

Dear Mr. Straw,
Your decision yesterday regarding the HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER nine years ago is one
with which I cannot agree with.
There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the policing of the event on the day of the
tragedy was inadequate. I used to be a constable 40 years ago and thus have some
understanding of such events and their policing.
The video evidence overlooked or denied represents a blatant ignoring of evidence at the time
which requires correction through a further inquiry.
The cut-off time of 3.15pm by the Coroner when more could have been saved indicates a
blindness on his part which must be dereliction of duty.
I write as a private voter. I have no interest in football; in fact the last match I went to was on
26.12.43.1have only been to Sheffield once in my life. I have no known relative or friend
connected in any way with those who died on that day.
In other words, my perception of the way the situation was dealt with on the day and
subsequent inquiry into the cause of the deaths leaves me with inadequate confidence in
truthfulness and abilities of the authorities in these matters. Confidence in Administration is
diminished, and, simply again reveals itself as inadequate.___

Dear Mr. Straw,
                  You had the chance to ease the pain and suffering o f the Hillsborough families. You also had the
chance to ease the suffering of every football fen in the country by proxy. Few people could imagine what Kegworth,
the Herald of Free Enterprise, the Locherbie bombing or Piper Alpha must have been like but most people in this
country have been in an overcrowding situation at some time or other. That's why this disaster touched a sensitive
nerve in the people of Britain. That’s why we have all taken an interest in this appalling tragedy. Yet you choose to
do nothing.

I can only speculate on your reasons Mr. Straw but you have emerged from this with zero credit. Worse, you have
undermined the faith British people have injustice. To spell it out for you Mr. Straw as you are blatantly unfamiliar
with the word. Just a. giving proper consideration to the claims of all concerned; right in amount etc., deserve.
Justice n. just treatment, fairness; legal proceedings; magistrate; judge. May I also point out, Mr. Straw, that Bloody
Sunday has been apologised for by the British Government. This after twenty five years. Ninety six people died as a
result of Hillsborough, not thirteen as in Bloody Sunday, ninety six! We demand justice (see description above) Mr.
Straw. We will get it, with or without you. Unless we get itfro m you, I will spit every time I hear your name and
turn my back every time I see you.

On your death bed Mr. Straw, you will be called to account for all your actions. At that time, you w ill feel the pain of
those you choose to damn mid victimise further. Sleep well Mr. Straw; and may your victims have mercy on you.


Yours sincerely.

           From

            Subject:      Hillsborough

            Sir,

                  I a m w r i t i n g to express my d i s g ust at your d ecis i o n y e s t e r d a y to
            accept the findings of the original inquest into the H i l l s b o r o u g h tragedy.

                  Like m a n y   other people, I find it u n b e l i e v a b l e that the two reports
            could b lame the     police, emer gency services, the Sheffield club, the local
            council and yet      n o t h i n g has been done to br ing the p eople r e s p o n s i b l e for
            the death of 96      p eople to justice.

                    I was t here that day and saw full well what happened. The c o l la pse
           of po lice control over the situation, p oli ce actu ally p u sh ing supporters
           bac k into the crowd initially, the autho r i t i e s m o s t l y standin g in shock as
           supporters ripped down adv er t i s i n g hoa rdings to ferry the bodie s to the
           eme rgency services outside, who did not even bother to come into the
           s t adi um to help in ambulances or on foot, the coverup wh ich started
           i mmed iatel y from all the authorit ies c o n c e r n e d h i ntin g that the supporte rs
           wer e to blame, l e a ding to the dis gra c e f u l story in the Sun, no ne of which
           has ever been ap olog i s e d for or retracted, causi ng further h a r m and
           d istress to the p e o p l e involved. No w h i t e w a s h will ever hid e the truth.

                    The p ol ice even lied, amended documents. This is over and above the
            neg lig e n c e by all parties, for which there have been no criminal
            prosecutions. Why? If it wer e your son, how wo uld you feel? Both reports
            ha ve c o n d e m n e d the authorit ies concerned, and yet it is a p p a r e n t l y still
            "accidental death" accordi ng to the inquest.

                        I r e alise this letter will have little impact on a m a n who puts
            pol itical e x p e d i e n c y b ef ore family, but I feel so p a s s i o n a t e l y about this
            issue, I feel I have to do something. I will c o n t inue to supp ort the
            H i l l s b o r o u g h families, but can no longer support the curre nt g o v e r n m e n t or
            Labour Party. I a m sure there are m a n y others who feel as I do.

Dear Sir,                    \                              ^
                                      Hillsborough Decision

I grew up just inside N. Wales with an adoptechfTmily from Liverpool. From this background I
developed a keen interest in supporting Liverpool FC and became very active within the Labour
Party. I campaigned for the Labour Party throughout the 1970's and 1980's and became a
Constituency Party Secretary and later a Clwyd County Councillor.

Above all I supported Labour since, without reading any great political thesis, I believed simply
that the Labour Party was the Party most keenly interested in fairness and social justice.
Although my activism in politics declined as my business demands increased my sense of
frustration with the previous government, and my desire to see it replaced by a Labour
Government, always remained strong. Above all I hoped that a new government, a Labour
Government, would set about righting the injustices that had been inflicted upon so many groups
and individuals by the Tory regime over so many years.

Fortunately, for myself, I missed the tragic game at Hillsborough. I have nevertheless remained
touched by the tragedy and have felt very concerned about the original inquiry. The arbitrary
decision of the Coroner in disregarding events after a set time, the discrepancies within police
evidence not to mention their absolute failure to admit liability and their decision not to raise any
disciplinary action is beyond my comprehension. For goodness sake Ninety-six people died*

As a manager of a chemical company safety is of paramount importance to employees and me.
Regrettably, I have had cause on occasion to discipline a few employees when they have failed
in their duty or have acted negligently and risked a breach of safety standards. I have even had
to dismiss one chap. However, their actions have never got close to injuring anyone let alone
result in multiple deaths. The potential to cause injury was sufficient to justify action. What on
earth can be said to justify such an absolute abdication of responsibility by the Police and
Emergency Services in the case of Hillsborough?

Surely, after such a tragic event of this magnitude we have a right to get to the real truth and
ensure that every possible aspect surrounding the events are thoroughly dealt with to everyone's
satisfaction. Justice cannot be served, and will not be seen to be served, whilst there are so
many unanswered questions. I am absolutely ashamed of the decision announced by you
today.
It is only a token gesture on my part, but for what it is worth I absolutely promise that I shall
never ever again vote or support your party. You have today so clearly failed to act on this
miscarriage of justice. There appears to be little or nothing between you and your predecessors.

I'm sure you will, with the arrogance of power and given the size of your majority, be tempted to
dismiss such letters as mine. You would do well to remember that such contempt would
ultimately and absolutely end your Government's term of office just as surely as it did with that
personification of intolerance and arrogance herself, Margaret Thatcher.

As one who spent a significant part of my life supporting Labour and encouraging others to do
the same - 1can only say I feel utterly and totally betrayed.

                                        Yours sir»

Dear Sir,

    This letter is probably the most difficult one I have ever had   L                        ier.

I am writing with reference to the events yesterday, and your subsequent decision not to launch a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster in April 1989.

You will not be surprised to learn, that I am a Liverpool season ticket holder, and was present at the
Hillsborough disaster on that fateful day. By pure chance, I was able to exchange my standing ticket
for a seating ticket only hours before the game. However, this does not detract from the horror I bore
witness to.

To say I am apalled at your decision, would be an understatement. Before last years election, you
made it very dear to everyone, that you were fully behind a complete investigation. Now firmly sitting
in Government, its simply amazing to see both yours and Labour’s attitude “cool” completely.

I was proud to vote Labour at the last election, to finally be rid of the “corrupt-ridden” previous
Government, was a blessing in more ways than one. I firmly believed, wrongly as it now turns out, that
we had a Government committed to finding the truth about the Disaster.

Before the so called new inquiry began, I had serious misgivings about the new Judge taking over the
investigation. Judge Stuart-Smith’s outrageous comments towards the family’ s: “being late, like the
Liverpool supporters” , hardly instilled confidence in anyone. Rightly, as it turned out.

However, I find it unbelievable, that no new inquiry is to be launched despite:
(a) Vital evidence & witnesses were withheld from the original inquest...So how on earth can the
      original inquest be “accurate”?
(b) Everyone knowing the Police lied about events that happened.
(c) Video tapes being “stolen” by persons unknown...(Yet only the Police having anything to gain
      by them going “missing”. )
(d) Missing tapes not being “significant”....how do you know, if you haven’t seen them?!
(e) The Police being held accountable for the disaster....But no one being prosecuted?!
( f ) The original Inquest having a cut off point of 3.15pm...even though people were still capable of
      being saved after this point.
(g) The Emergency Services being praised What for? their delay is well documented, including
    sitting outside the ground in lines of vehicles!
(h) Evidence provided of Police tampering with evidence....How can this NOT effect an inquest?!

These are just some of the points that need answers to, it cannot be brushed under the carpet.

The Police were guilty of gross negligence on a grand scale. You have a duty to the people of this
country, to find out the truth and in doing so, prosecute those responsible.

As you have failed to do this, I believe you should take the families advice and resign. However, I
doubt for one minute you will do so, but I hope you can live with your conscience.

As Trevor Hicks accurately said yesterday: “New Government, new whitewash.”




Yours faithfully

Dear Mr. S tra w ,

I was very disappointed to hear that there would be no new public inquiry into the Hillsborough
Disaster .W hile I did not have the opportunity to read a full list of your reasons the news that I heard
did not explain your actions.

 I do not understand the reasons that the families wish to have the verdict overturned as this will not
bring the dead back . However it is now common belief that there was a concerted effort by figures
who are paid to uphold the Law to ensure that a distorted version of those sad events would be
presented to the c o u rt. This theory must be proved or dashed or it will dam age the rule of law in this
country.

The previous Conservative administration fell , in part , because of the perception that they were
unable and unwilling to protect the institutions of this country because of self interest . This is the
cancer that is eating at our belief that the police are there to protect us and that we can trust them to
do their job without b ia s .




Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                '

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough Inquiry

On 19th February 1998, the Hillsborough issue was debated at a full meeting of Sefton Council,
                                                                                       1. Many


The Councillors expressed the unanimous view that a further Inquiry is required and resolved that
I should write to you, asking that further consideration be given to this issue.

The point was clearly made that the call for further consideration is not intended as a challenge to
the detailed findings of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, nor as a criticism of your acceptance of his
Report. The Council’s view is that the need for a further Inquiry arises from the application of
democratic rather than judicial principles. Put simply, the communities of Merseyside are still

those communities. They know, and it has been acknowledged, that the initial Inquiry was
inadequate, and there is an awareness that a fuller explanation is available which could be secured
by a further Inquiry.

It is the Council’s view that, in such circumstances, government, be it local or central, has no
option but to use every endeavour to produce the fullest explanation available. We trust that you

people of Sefton, and Merseyside in general, believe they are entitled.

Yours faithfully,



Director of Legal and Administrative Services

                                                                             '*»•

De ar Mr.   Straw,

I w r i t e to regist er m y disgu st at your la ck of courage in refus ing to
re-open the H i l l s b o r o u g h inquiry.

W h e n y o u r son wa s charged w i t h an offence r e c ently y o u wa n t e d h i m to be
treated f airly and justly, as he was, yet y o u have denied the same justi ce
or fairness to the families of the H i l l s b o r o u g h v i c t i m s w h o are innocent
of any offence.          H o w therefore can anyon e have confidenc e in a Home
S ecr etary w h o clearl y demons t r a t e s such double standards.           Y o u are doing
the L a b o u r P ar ty no favours b y clinging to your p o s i t i o n and I call upon
y o u to do the h on ourabl e thing and resign.

This m a t t e r can be summed up in one w o r d w h i c h is I N J U STI CE and you, as
Home Secretary, ought to hav e put this dread f u l w r o n g right.            May I
remind y o u that y o u were elected to serve the people, not to prote ct the
Establishment.

W h e n Lord J u stice S tuart - S m i t h a r riv ed in L i v e r p o o l he b e g a n b y i nsulting
the famili es and clear ly d e m o n s t r a t i n g that his m i n d w a s a l read y m a d e up
as to the cause of the tragedy.                 He should have b e e n replac ed immediately.



I a m enclos ing an article f r o m last even ing's L i v e r p o o l Echo which,            if y o u
b othe r to read it, m a y p o s s i b l y e n l i g h t e n you.

Dear Mr Straw,

      This letter is in response to your decision yesterday not to order a fresh
enquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

       The decision, on the back o f all the other whitewashes the families have
been subjected to, is, in my opinion, an abomination. It would appear that
people in authority, such as yourself, are the only people in the country that
believe the original accidental death verdict. Is it a case o f believing this Mr.
Straw or is it just the easy option?

       Obviously the decision has been made, although the families have vowed
to fight on. I hope they win and receive the justice they deserve. In the light of
the latest cover up on this tragedy I would like answers to a number of
questions. Questions that I have not yet seen answered anywhere and I’m sure
I am not alone in wanting to know. I would appreciate your comments on 1)
why was the policing so different On this occasion from twelve months
previous when the same two teams played at the same ground at the same
stage o f the same competition? I was at the game in 1988 and was asked by
police on numerous occasions to show my ticket as I approached the ground.
The purpose o f this being, I presume, to prevent people without tickets getting
near the ground, 2} Why the ridiculous decision to open the gates at the
Lsppings Lane end o f the ground when more suitable alternatives were
available? i) Why not put the kick off time back? An announcement to this
effect over the Public Address system would have been heard outside the
ground and the rush to gain admittance would have subsided, ii) As the
decision was made why was the tunnel into the central pen not closed off
before opening the main gates? 3) Why the 3.15 pm cut off time when
statements from witnesses and I believe, police officers prove people were still
alive well after this time? 4) Why was the fleet of ambulances not allowed
access to the ground? 5) Why have you admitted to the families that there had
been “gross negligence” and yet have failed to reach a decision consistent with
this statement? People need justice Mr Straw, not patronising with statements
such as “that does riot riieari we cannot learn lessons from Hillsborough" arid
“the entire country is united in sympathy for those who lost loved ones at
Hillsborough”. Comments such as-these serve little purpose only to prove that
you know the entire situation was avoidable and yet you are happy to go along
with a whitewash and effectively ‘fob o ff the bereaved families with an
accidental death verdict.

       I was brought up in a home that was Labour through and through. I
have continued to vote Labour into my adult life and believed that New Labour
under Mr Blair was the only way forward for our country, a belief obviously
shared my millions o f other people at the last General Election. Decisions such
as this one do nothing to promote New Labour as a party for the people and
merely cause me and no doubt countless others to question our commitment to
the party. I must say I wholeheartedly agree, in this instance, with a statement
from & father who lost his son at Hillsborough ‘TSfew Labour, new cover up”

      Yours sincerely,




cc Mr. Blair, Prime Minister.

   At ten years of age I was a fun loving young girl with not a
care in the world and only one passion, football. This changed on
the 15th of April 1989. On that day I travelled to Hillsborough
excited at the prospect of watching my first away m a t c h .


   From the moment I reached Sheffield it was apparent that the
safety and security had not been well organised. The Police
officers could not even direct us to the right stand, sending us
to the other three stands first. The words "orderly queue" must
be unknown to the South Yorkshire Police force as we were pushed
and shoved into a cramped crowd.


   I was lucky as I had a seat at the match, otherwise I may not
be here today writing this letter. It was apparent to me prior to
3:06pm that something was not right at the Leppings Lane e n d . It
was also apparent that many of the victims were still alive after
3:15 p m . If a ten year old girl can notice this why can't the
police.


     I stood there and watched the line of bodies grow longer and
longer. They were laid to rest on the touchline just infront of
m e . I can still see those people now, lying there on advertising
hoardings with their coats covering their faces. It is images
like these that haunt me to this day.


   I cannot relate fully to the grief that the victim's families
feel, but I can relate to their anger today as their new inquiry
request is refused. You said on television today that you
"understand the disappointment of the families" and that you can
"understand their anger and frustration". If this is the case
then a new inquiry is the only sensible and logical solution, a
full inquiry showing all of the evidence.


   This terrible disaster could have been prevented and should
never be allowed to happen again. The victim's families will
never be able to grieve properly until justice is seen to be
done. This did not happen today.
   I was lucky I did not lose my life at Hillsborough, but I did
lose part of my childhood on that day. I'm now 19 years of age
but I can still remember every moment of that day, and I will
never forget. It does not get any easier, but justice may help
ease the pain.


   If the Police believe that their actions were right then they
should not oppose another inquiry. New evidence has been exposed
proving gross negligence by the Police. Fresh evidence has been
presented to you in the form of a number of crucial video tapes
which the Police said did not exist and also  in the statements
made by one of the doctor's who treated the dying victims.


   Lord Justice Taylor concluded that failure of Police control
was the main reason for the disaster, yet disciplinary action
against two senior Police officers has been dropped.
The people of Liverpool will not give up until justice is done.
If there is any way that you can go back on today's decision then
I urge you to do so.




                       Yours sincerely,

  DEAR MR. STRAW,
           PLEASE NOTE MY ABSOLUTE DISGUST AT YOUR
DECISION NOT TO OPEN A NEW ENQUIRY INTO THE
HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.
           AS A LIFE LONG SUPPORTER OF THE LABOUR PARTY
I FINALLY HOPED FOR JUSTICE. I ASSUMED THAT OUR PARTY
WOULD DO WHATS RIGHT . NOT WHAT IS ABSOLUTLY LEGAL,
BUT RIGHT. ONE DAY THE TIME OF DEATH OF THOSE WHO DIED
WILL BE FINALLY CONFIRMED AND I WILL BE HERE TO REMIND
YOU THAT YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
            THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT RUBBER STAMPED
THE SYSTEM NOW YOU ARE THE SYSTEM. MAKE A DICISION
WITH YOUR HEART NOT WHAT THE FACELESS BUREAUCRATS
TELL YOU IS LEGAL OR COST EFFECTIVE.
            I WRITE TO YOU WITH NO AXE TO GRIND ,A
NOBODY IN FACT. HOWEVER MY CONSCIENCE WILL NOT
ALLOW ME TO DO NOTHING WHEN NINETY-SIX OF MY
NEIGHBOURS DIE AND I AM NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SURE
THE RIGHT THING HAS BEEN DONE.


                   YOURS FAITHFULLY.

To Jack Straw

               Your statement to the House on the 1 8 / 2 / 9 8 leaves me, and the vast majority of this
country cold You have proved once more that this government elected by-the-populatioH has no
feelings for them or interest in their views. They, in particularly yourself, have again shown they can
not be trusted to defend their rights, or protect them in times of need.

Your election slogan “ Tough on crime, Tough on the causes of crime “ was misleading at the best, a
lie at the worst. You forgot to inform the Nation that this only stood if the perpetrators of the crime
were not the Police, and if the victims of the crime were not football supports.

You are allowing the cover up into the deaths of 96 football supports to continue, you are actively
ignoring the responsibilities that go with your post, WHY ? Would you be doing this if the supporters
had been from Blackburn, the sons and daughters of the people that vote for you ? I doubt it because
you have proved yourself a coward. Don’t misinterpret the above statement, I would not wish what we
went through on that day on anyone, but just think what action you would have taken if the outcomes
effected you more directly,

Jack, the Labour dream of the last 19 yeans is over, the Labour Party is dead, you belong to a
government that must leave people like Barbara Castle with total disgust. 18 years in the wilderness
has made you into a man unfit to govern, and unable to accept responsibility. You sit on a
Government that bullies it’s M.P.s to follow the party line, come what may, but you refuse to take
action against people that you accept were responsible for the deaths of % people, and you state had
shown gross negligence in their duties. I repeat you are a coward and unfit to hold any post that has
any responsibility attached to it.

You should, and must, resign immediately. There is no other line of action for you to take. The fight
to find justice will continue, the % will not be forgotten, the cover up will revealed, and those
responsible, which now includes you, brought in front of the courts.

RESIGN NOW.                                   ^

Dear Mr Straw,

I am writing to you with regard to your decision not t<               quiry into
the events at the Hillsborough football ground                when 96 Liverpool
supporters were killed.

I cannot do or say much that would even make you consider changing your mind
as I am just an ordinary person, much like those who perished on that terrible day.

I would however like to let you know that my wife and I have both cancelled our
membership of the Labour party (we have both always voted for your party). If you
are happy to go along with this appalling travesty of justice we want nothing more
to do with you or the Labour party.


Yours sincerely,

Dear Home Secretary,

          Re: Your statement to the House of Commons on 18/2/98 concerning
          Hillsborough

I wish to express my deep concern at your failure to instigate a new enquiry into the
Hillsborough tragedy. Your intransigence seems to fly in the face of new evidence


The new evidence, additional witnesses and the investigation carried out by the World
in Action programme, raise serious concerns about the conduct of senior police


Why is it acceptable form police officers to conveniently ’lose’the videotape made
from the crucial camera (No.5, 1 think), on that day? Why is it that time and time
again, police officers are caught lying in court, under oath, and are never prosecuted?




                                                                   an Establishment

D e a r M r Straw

I feel I m u s t write to you in the strongest po ssible w a y to    register  my
devastation     and  disgust          about  your decision not to grant a further
enquiry to the H i l l s b o r o u g h Families.

My son was at H i l l s b o r o u g h on 15 April 1989 and fortuna tely for  him  and
me  he was one of the lucky ones w h o came home.           M y heart goes out to the
families w h o were not so fortunate.

I think you have taken a very n a r r o w v i e w indeed of the w hole tragedy and
you     owed   it  to the families to grant them anot her enquiry.      As regards
the inquest verdict, h o w could there be a v e r d i c t of ‘accidental   d e a t h ’,
w h e n Lor d Justice T aylor h i m s e l f b la med the police.

I voted      Labour    on  1 M a y last year, partly in the hope that something
pos itive w o u l d be done for these families and p a rtl y to do away w i t h  the
sickening      spectacle   of field sports.       To say that I feel let down is to
put it m i l d l y - at this m o m e n t in time I do not feel I  could  ever   vote
for you again (and this from a family of formerly c o m m itte d socialists)!

I w i s h the H i l l s b o r o u g h families the best of good fortune   in their fight
for justice.

I have    sent a copy of this    letter to my MP, A u d r e y Wise.

Yours    sincerely

    Dear Mr Straw


    If my reasons for joining the labour party could be condensed into one word. That word would be
    JU STIC E.

    I am very saddened by the fact that your definition of this word appears to be very different from my
    own. I can not comprehend how you were able to stand before parliament last Wednesday and accept
    that the South Yorkshire Police force was guilty of gross negligence on 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough
    and yet in the eyes of the law what happened that day was an accident for which no one is to be
    brought to account.

     I believe you used the phrase ‘Duckenfields Disgraceful Lie.’ What type of JU ST IC E permits a person
;fv* to retire on health grounds (with a pension and cash pay out) to avoid disciplinary action that would
     embarrass the persons permitting the retirement? Would a member of any other profession be able to
     retire on health grounds to avoid JU ST IC E .

    I gave a statem ent to members of W est M idlands Police for the subsequent inquiry. These officers only
    appeared to be interested in how much I had drunk that day (one pint) and did I have a ticket (Yes).

    You acknowledge that statem ents were altered-yet you believe that this was not material enough to
    affect the course of JU ST IC E.

    If you contend that the system has failed the 96 and that is the end of the m atter then I believe it is
    you who have failed the 96 and the party I thought believed in JU STIC E. Now the Labour Party is in
    government you are the system.

    If you believe in JU ST IC E I believe you should order a new Inquiry. Its remit should be to look at
    what happened not ju st at events up to ju st after 3 o’clock but to include the whole of that day, the
    subsequent behaviour of the South Yorkshire Police and the conduct of the W est Midlands Police
    during the first Inquiry.

    Alternatively I have to consider do I want to remain a member of a party whose Home Secretaries
    belief in JU ST IC E is so far apart from my own.



    Your Sincerely

Dear Mr Straw


As Home Secretary I appreciate the difficult tasks you have on your plate, but I
cannot understand why you would not open a new enquiry for the victims of the
Hillsborough disaster It’s seems in this country that the guilty who hold authority
always get away it, weather it is the Police in charge of Guildford four or the Carl
Bridgewater case, they get away time after time scott free.


I have been attending football matches for the last twenty years, I know there has
been a history of trouble at our games but the attitude of the Police leading up to
Hillsborough was always a party to this. Now with the likes of Ken Bates robbing the
true football fans and giving his seat’s to city slickers with more money, it’s always
the innocent that get hurt.


The South Yorkshire Police mucked up badly that day and everyone knows that,
there are many ways they could have prevented this tragedy and the cover up by a
new Government is just as bad as the people who led these fans to their deaths.


Please don’t let football fans down, please re-open the file.




Yours Faithfully

Dear Mr Straw,

My name is ________________         I a m aged __    ,.s lu •iy-i-R's; •f o f 'A -L e ve 1s . I am
what you co uld call part of the future generation.                     I a m h o r r i f i e d at
your so c a lle d "decision" about the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster. You
labelingit an "Accident",            I feel it was most visible that it was not an
"Accident". N e w e v i d e n c e s howed this,   With the Police and A m bulan ce's
at fault.

There s eems to be a v e r y big c over up.   B r i t i s h justice is showing its
incompotence.   Maybe you were t r y i n g to cover up some kind of
embarrassment?  Well h o w ironic, you have a c c o m p l i s h e d in e m b a r r a s m e n t to
yourself, Brit ish justice and the g ove rnment only.

I hope you m a y sle ep at night.    You are not p l a ying a game, t h i s is real
life, real people. Your deci s i o n ' s affect people s lifes.    There future.

My vote, for the f uture of the L a bo ur party counts.    This big mistake is
just one r e a s o n why I will never vote for the labour party.   That is
your future.       To me, pro mises made have not happend,

I will be v o teing in just over a year.              Good luck.     You will need it.

Yours Faithfully,

Dear Jack Straw, Home Secretary,                                             V

              Re: The Hillsborough Football Disaster

      I write to draw your attention to the Motion passed last night by the members of Ab-
ercromby Ward of Riverside Constituency (Liverpool - Louise Ellman MP):

This Ward regrets the decision of the Home Secretary in refusing to order a fresh inquiry
and/or inquest into the Hillsborough Disaster in the light of new evidence which clearly indi­
cates that the correct findings were not reached at the original enquiry and inquest and urges
him to reconsider that decision in view of his own admission that the procedure is faulty and
will be reformed.

Proposer: Christine Sabino

Seconded: Kevin McIntyre

Passed unanimously.

                                                 Yours sincerely,



                                                    Janet Kent

 D ear Mr Straw



 I am writing to express my disappointment at your recent decision not to order a
 new public inquiry into the disaster at Hillsborough. As both a survivor from that
 fateful tragedy and a sociologist specialising in the study of disasters and their
 management, I know that mistakes were made on that day and since which have
 not been fully investigated and accounted for. More worrying still, justice and
 fairness have become additional victims of this disaster as a result of both the
 inadequate systems of inquiry in this country and the determination and ability of
senior police officers to shield themselves behind the very institutions and
procedures expected to represent justice.


I understand that a working party was set up in 1990 to consider the role of
coroners’ inquests and public inquiries in recognition of the inadequacies that have
beset the process of dealing with disasters in this country. I would be interested to
know the outcome of the working party and would be grateful if you could send me
more information about the work that is subsequently being done to improve the
processes of investigation. This includes the status of the discussions about the
introduction of new legislation in the area of corporate manslaughter. As you
yourself have acknowledged, Hillsborough and other disasters have highlighted
serious inadequacies in the role and conduct of coroners’ courts




                                       C O V E N T R Y
                                U N      I    V     E      R     S      I     T   Y               RECE!
 ‘training’ of their personnel. Could you tell me what research and action is being
 undertaken in this area and what plans there are to improve this service?


 As you will appreciate, we are approaching the tenth anniversaries of a number of
 disasters that have occurred in Britain, all of which are likely to be marked by public
 interest and questions about the lessons that have been learned. While there have
 been   many       positive   changes,   the   record   highlights   other similarities   with
 Hillsborough in terms of the continuing sense of injustice and unaccountability of
 those individuals and companies chiefly responsible for disasters. I am presenting
papers on this theme at various international conferences this year and would very
much like to be able to say that this government is actively working on improving
the processes of investigation, accountablity and action in response to disasters
While my disappointment about Hillsborough remains, therefore, I hope I m ay be
able to be more hopeful about the procedures you are putting in place for dealing
with future disasters.


I look forward to hearing from you.


Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Straw,

         As the present Home Secretary you have the power to order a new inquest into
the deaths of the 96 Hillsborough victims. I am deeply disappointed that you did not
see fit to exercise that power and instead chose to hide behind the comments made by
Lord Justice Stewart-Smith.

        By taking the action that you have, you have given every police officer in the
land the impression that they can commit perjury and you will support them. While I
recognise that you have some responsibility to the police, may I remind you that you
are responsible for Justice for all the people of this country and not just 'The
Establishment'. Justice needs to be seen to be done and a fresh Inquest is the only way
to do that. Lord Justice Taylor in his report clearly indicated that the chaos following
the tragedy was badly orchestrated by the police present and that many lives could
have been saved. A fresh look is needed, not to pinpoint blame, but for the whole
truth to be recognised and accepted.

        Lord Justice Stewart-Smith openly showed prejudice against the dead and their
families five minutes after arriving in Liverpool, he should have been asked to stand
down at that time. His comments were an insult to all of the people of Merseyside.

       By not ordering a new Inquest many people have lost confidence in the Justice
for which this Country was once proud. You are OUR Home Secretary, you are
supposed to see that WE THE PEOPLE can expect and get Justice in our own
Country.

        I have no connection with any of the victims or their families, but I can only put
myself in their position and imagine what horrors they must go through not knowing
exactly what happened to their loved ones and what exactly caused their deaths. That
you should be party to a cover-up leaves me in despair. Your actions concerning your
own son's brush with the Law made me think that you were a man of character and
integrity with the courage to stand by your convictions that Justice must be done.
However, I now feel that you are not the man I thought and this is the root of my
deeply felt disappointment.

       I hope that you will reconsider.

Mr. T. Blair,
House of Commons,
Westminster,
LONDON.

Dear Mr. Blair,

1am writing to express my disgust at the decision not to re-open the enquiry into the
Hillsborough Disaster.

The fact that Senior Officers have not been brought to book, dismissed or even demoted
or disciplined for their lack o f actions and unprofessional conduct leads one to support
the change which is obviously needed in Police Complaints procedure, so that the situation
no longer prevails where the police investigate themselves. Legislation is urgently required
for independent police judicial enquiries so that justice can be seen to be done.

1 would like to guess that no Senior Police Officer has ever been prosecuted, resulting in a
custodial sentence, for misconduct in these kind of circumstances.

As motorists we are often reminded that ignorance is no defence, however, this does not
seem to apply to the police!

What is criminal is that Jack Straw and the Government had the opportunity to right this
terrible injustice but has chose not to and it seems this investigation was merely a token
gesture, a sham and nothing more.

What was that about a fair and just society?

Yours sincerely.




                                                                        RECEIVED

Dear Mr. Straw

At the age of ten years and two hundred and three days old, my life was changed forever. I left my
home in Liverpool for what was supposed to be one of the greatest days in my life. I was to attend my
first ever away match at a, football game.

When Liverpool football club played Nottingham Forest football club in the F.A Cup sem i-final in April
1989, I stepped over the divide between childhood and what lay beyond. I was not even old enough to
really know what it was like to live, yet I already knew what it was like to die.

The looks on the faces of the people beside me as they died, the noises that they made as they pleaded
for help, and the cries of torment of those who survived will stay with me for as long as I live. Not a
day goes by when I do not think back to that day, when I remember the tragedy which unfolded before
my eyes. Not a day goes by when I do not think of how lucky I am to be here, to still be able to
remember, in intricate detail, the events of that day. Not a day goes by when I do not pray to God and
ask him to comfort the families of those who did not return home on that day. I still wake up in the
night, fighting for breath, looking for my father and calling out his name. Who knows why we both
survived.

I am not unique, and I am not special. I am just amongst many thousands of people who were present
on that day. I am just one person who will never be the same again. My voice is only small, yet that
does not mean that I do not deserve to be heard. I do not seek revenge. I do not want to place blame
upon those involved, for they could not have prepared themselves for what was to come. I simply seek the
truth, for justice to prevail, and for the memories of those who died and those who were spared to be
laid to rest.

I am writing this letter to you, not for sympathy, not for recognition, and not for self gratification. I am
simply writing to show you that I am a person, and to tell you that the ninety - six people who lost their
lives at Hillsborough are not statistics. They were people, just like me, and just like you. They deserve
respect, they deserve the truth, and they deserve justice. Please give it to them*
Dear Sir'

           On the morning of that ^ayVw^s ^orking in TrafFord
Park and I finished my day just afterone PM. On my way home
I joined the M63 at junction 3 to go towards Stockport and
immediately got involved in a traffic jam in traffic largely
consisting of dozens of coaches obviously loaded with football
supporter

           At that time the M63 terminated at the Portwood
roundabout in Stockport which is where I would normally have
left it on my way to Romiley. This Roundabout was notorious
as a bottleneck but not normally on a Saturday afternoon .

           Subsequently I became tired of the slow progress and
decided to leave the Motorway at an earlier junction and it was
about 1.30.PM when I pulled off at the Turn for Stockport
Centre and made my way via the town streets for home noting
that the jam reached up to the Portwood roundabout.

            I was sufficiently curious at home to check thr
football fixtures to establish what game the coachec could be
going to and was amazed to discover that they must have been
going to Sheffield which meant that they still had to negotiate
congestion in the Woodley area and in Hollingworth
cosequently they had no chance of arriving in Sheffield at a
reasonable time for the game.

           From the reports that I have seen the casualties at
Sheffield would have come mainly from the early comers who
had occupied the front rows on the terraces and the trouble was
caused by the latecomers trying to get position at the back.

            It seems to me that the cause of the problem could
have been due to the transport arrangements in Liverpool with
coaches leaving atb too late an hour probably having to pull
supporters out of Pubs etc. Another factor could have been the
choice of route, it was a silly mistake to go through Stockport
on a Saturday afternoon. The bets way from Liverpool to
Sheffield would have been to take the M62 and transfer to the
A1. Perhaps in future the local police could advise coach
operators of the best routes and departure times.

                                    Yours Sincerely

Dear Mr. Straw,
               I am writing to express my extreme disappointment at your decision
       not to act on the Hillsborough debacle. You have effectively condoned the
      actions of negligent individuals, and the infrastructure, by exempting them
      from any blame. I am appalled that you still found it appropriate for the Judge
      in charge of the investigation to continue, after “ joking “ about the late arrival
      of the Liverpool fans. Is it acceptable to call a coloured person a nigger, if it is
      only in jest? I don’t believe it is. There are still many people in this country
      who believe that Liverpool fans were to blame for the tragedy and this is an
      affront to the men, women and children who died innocently on that day, not
      to mention their families. I am sure you are well informed about what actually
      happened that day so I need not reiterate the fact that the disaster happened
      within two miles of a major hospital and only 14 of the 96 victims made it to
      the hospital, that doctors have corroborated the claims that people were alive
      for much longer than the Coroner’s claim of 3:15pm, etc, etc. I add the “etc”
      because it strikes me that this is exactly how you view the overwhelming
      evidence of what happened that day - as a mere inconvenience.
               This whole affair is indicative of how you have betrayed the electorate
      with your false promises and empty rhetoric. If you are under any illusions as
      to what I am referring to, then can I list a few issues where I believe The
      Labour Party has let us down, The Liverpool Dockers, NHS waiting lists,
      Public transport, etc. I was naive enough to believe that Labour would make a
      difference - that we were rid of the Tories and their ilk. I did not expect them
      to get re-elected in a new guise. I find your hypocrisy appalling and reflective
      of the new Government.
               This has been written using all the self-control I can muster because I
      know it could easily have been me at Hillsborough, and I feel so frustrated at
      your apparent indifference that I really do not know what to do. I know what I
      would like you to do - either get to the bottom of what really happened and
      where the blame lies, or resign because you are not fit to hold office. Please
      do not bother replying to this letter because I believe that actions speak
      louder than words and unlike you and the Labour Party, I am not about to sell
      out mv beliefs.

          Dear Sirs

          I was disgusted to hear on the news yesterday evening of the decision not to allow a fresh inquiry
          into the Hillsborough tragedy.
          The reason behind this decision is ludicrous and just not good enough, the facts of the tragedy
          must be known. It is blatantly obvious that there has been a cover up and the Police have not
          been honest or truthful.
          Ninety six Liverpool Supporters were killed that dreadful day in April 1989 and for them and
          their families JUSTICE must be seen to have been done.
          The papers reported so many lies within days of the tragedy and they came to light as being lies
          and now the truth behind the negligence of the Police must be told.
          My boyfriend was there that day and was one of the one’s let through the gates a couple of
          minutes before kick-off “I7ve never known anything like it, you just couldn’t move1” were his
          words, he had never and has not since been in a situation like it. He and his Mend realised there
          was no other option than to leave and get out of the ground as the situation which was obviously
          beyond control.    There are stories so similar to this and a lot worse.
          This j ust proves one of th e reasons why the Police have been negligent, the situation should have
          been dealt with following the correct procedures and not allowing so many into one area of the
          ground. The Police were wrong not to have realised the repercussions in not controlling the
          ground as the position they uphold in the Community expects. Not one o f the South Yorkshire
          Police have been disciplined over this tragedy. What do we do wait for another incident to occur
          before anything is done ?
          The video tape incident is blatantly obvious, the tape has been conveniently lost. This point must
          be pursued and the truth told.
          Nine years on and still the Government do nothing about it even after Jimmy McGovern’s film
          which was constructed by those who listened to the families and the people at Hillsborough that
          day.
                                                                 Continued

      I am one of so many in this Country who feels strongly about this matter. A tragedy which will
      always be remembered everyday through the loss of family and friends and those mentally
      scarred by witnessing the horrific events of that day.        Many have had and still require
      Counselling, the scale of this will never be laid to rest until an inquiry can be reopened and the
     truth be heard.
     I feel that the decision not to allow an inquiry was made by Jack Straw long before the
     announcement was made yesterday.
     This incident will never be laid to rest by those involved, ever if a full inquiry is not heard.
     Yours faithfully




                                                                \
    Dear Mr Straw,
          Enclosed you will find a copy of a letter I have already sent you regarding your
decision not to reopen the Hillsborough enquiry. I. have as yet received no response and I
re-iterate my request for you to do so. Perhaps the point I did not make entirely clear in
my original letter was that there is no need for “ new evidence ” if the first verdict was
wrong, as it was. Copies of the letter have also been sent to every daily broadsheet, as well
as several tabloid papers. One last point: at the Liverpool / Everton game, on 23.2.98 a
chant for “ Justice for the 96 ” took place before and during the match and though I am no
statistician, I am sure you’d agree some 44,000 votes is quite a sizeable amount.
          Yours Sincerely




                                                                            P

                                                                     18.2.98


   Dear Mr Straw,
        I write to you in a state of intense anger and consternation regarding your decision
not to re-open the enquiry into the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. It is shocking, and
indeed saddening for myself, as an ardent Labour supporter, to have to write to you in
 such circumstances, nevertheless, I feel your announcement necessitates my response.
        Your decision appears to have been based on the criteria that there is “ no new
evidence, ” into the disaster which claimed 96 lives and continues to affect an incalculable
number of others today. I beg to differ. I would not confess to being completely  ctufait
with the intricacies of our legal system, however I would like to draw your attention to
several issues, which, up to the present date have been largely ignored.
      l).The missing video tape, highlighted by the drama documentary “ Hillsborough. ”
          The programme, screened in late 1996 showed how this piece of evidence went
missing, and that it would have proven the police were aware that the disaster was
unfolding. This is supported by the testament of the video technician at the stadium that
day, Roger Holdsworth. On the day of your announcement you spoke ambiguously of a
“ number of suppositions ” that could be drawn as to why the tape disappeared. The most
cynical, and dare I say, obvious one, is that the police procured it to absolve themselves of
any blame. I therefore challenge you to name any other rational explanation for a piece of
vital evidence, in an enclosed police area, going missing, other than the one I have inferred
     2).The coroner’s statement that “ all victims died by 3.15pm. ”
          This would mean that none of the victims died by crush asphyxia, absolving the
police of much blame. This ignores hundreds of eye - witness accounts to the contrary,
and the new evidence of Dr Ed Walker. It also ignores the fact that one victim, Tony
Bland, lay in a permanent vegetative state until 1993, when he had his life support machine
turned off, and another victim, Andrew Devine, who remains in a similar state to this day.
There is also the issue of why only two ambulances were allowed access to the pitch,
suggesting Sheffield Wednesday F.C didn’t have the necessary safety procedures in place.
Such facts are indisputable, and yet they are ignored by the authorities, yourself included,
hence a verdict of “ accidental death.” Why is this the case ?
    3).The question of Lord Justice Stewart - Smith’s impartiality.
           Your representative’s first words on meeting the campaigners were “ Do you
have some of your people with you, or do you turn up late, like Liverpool fans ? ” Such an
insensitive remark perhaps passes some comment on any preconceived ideas he held, does
it not ? I acknowledge the families concerned accepted his apology, however, in light of
his findings, it surely merits some consideration.
  V/
        Apart from these issues, I would like to raise with you the matter of the police mis -
 management of the crowd.
         1). There is a widely held misconception that terraced areas were responsible for the
 disaster. However, the same fixture had been held at the same ground some twelve months
 earlier without a single death, nor any serious injuries. Moreover, why have some forty
lower league clubs retained terraced areas in the intervening nine years, without a single
 fatality? Standing areas therefore cannot be considered as a cause of “ accidental death. ”
 The blame must thus be attributed to police incompetence on the day.
       2).The police lied that drunken, ticketless, fans broke down the gate and entered,
 crushing those already inside. The Taylor Enquiry unequivocally stated that the police
 opened the gate. Apologists for the police like Brian Clough, ex - manager of Notts
Forest, have tepidly spoken of “ probably ” hundreds of ticketless fans whereas police
interviewing relatives of victims on the day of the disaster, asked questions such as
whether they “ liked a drink or not. ” Leaving aside the sheer banal speculation and
insensitivity that these entail, it appears as though the police in particular, had a certain set
of events they wished to portray. Indeed, junior officers have since been forced to change
statements which indicted their superiors.
       3). On entering the stadium the fans had three routes to choose from to enter the
terraced area. The police made no effort to stop them entering the one immediately ahead.
Had they cordoned this tunnel off, fans would have filtered into the side pens. The
Superintendent in charge that day, David Duckinfield abrogated his responsibility at the
original trial as he stated, and forgive me, I paraphrase, “ that fans within the tunnel
should have realised what was happening and turned around and walked back out ”. On
the drama documentary Hillsborough he also remarked, under oath, how he thought fans
would “filter out finding their own space. ” As the terrace was caged off into sections
both of these suggestions would have been physical impossibilities.
         4). The Taylor Enquiry directed the blame at the police and Mr Duckenfield in
particular. It is thus outrageous that he was allowed to escape prosecution by claiming ill
health and retiring on a full pension. The “Cook Report” - which incidentally has been
praised for its work as an investigative body - then found this “ ill ” man strolling around
a golf course some years later. Indeed you yourself passed some blithe comment on the
length of time which has passed between the disaster and the present day and how such a
period of time can obscure facts and colour opinions, thus making it inappropriate to
reopen the inquiry. At a time when your government is launching a new inquiry - and
rightly so - into the “Bloody Sunday ” massacre, this is nothing less than hypocrisy.
Although of course there is far less political capital to be gained from supporting a body of
football fans than there is sympathising with a republicanist movement.
        In conclusion, I hope you re-consider your decision, and reopen the inquiry, bringing
those accountable to justice. As I am sure you have deduced from my address, I am a
Liverpudlian myself, and as I was not present at the disaster, you may be tempted to
categorise this as nothing more than an emotive reaction. I would not dispute that I hold
strong views on the matter, however, this does not disqualify me from holding an
impartial, rational opinion. I would like to leave you with a comment I read in the
“Telegraph ” several days ago. In eighteen months time, it will be the tenth anniversary of
the Hillsborough tragedy. There will no doubt be a proliferation of “ trials by media ”
which if the positive reaction to the 1996 drama documentaiy is anything to judge by, will
be damning towards your decision. Thus it would be equally to your benefit to reconsider
your judgement immediately. I eagerly await your response, the nature of which shall
determine whether I shall continue to support your party.

Sir
             Hillsborough

          Is there somethihg sinister in the fact that we
                         V v'

have not heard one word of condemnation of the horde
of yob fans outside the gates who totally ignored police
telling them that the stadium was full to capacity and
were hysterically clambering over the gates to get in?
I wathed it all on TV.          I saw disaster waiting to happen.
      A
So to,did millions of us.         So why are we blaming it all
on others?
I shall always remember the fright on the face of that
mounted policeman who was desperately trying to control
the mob.     Clearly he was afraid for himself and his horse
and in the certainty that what?'~^ver action he took he
would be in the wrong.
I saw this on TV before the match started,             so the footage
is stowed somewhere.        For sanity's sake,    let us all see it
again.

                                                               I                27 FEB 1S9B
Dear Home Secretary,

I worked for the Labour Party at Walworth Road with Peter Mandelso
have been a solid active member of the Labour Party working within local government and in
my locality for the past nineteen years for the return of a Labour Government.

On Thursday, I called the Party HQ to cancel my membership of the Party following the
Government's announcement not to proceed with a new and full inquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster.

I was surprised myself at the reaction I felt, for I have no connection with Hillsborough.

However, I did attend a Home Office organised weekend in York on Emergency Planning for
officers in local government and emergency services like myself who may have to deal with
similar situations. There, I received a greater insight than I previously had into the Hillsborough
disaster, and into the tortuous judicial and bureaucratic processes undergone by the families of
the Hillsborough victims. Perhaps because I felt more informed than some, I took this particular
story of grief to heart.

You said in the House that we can not take the grief of the families away. That is absolutely
true. But if you had proceeded with a full inquiry, even after all these years, you and the
Government would have been seen to have attempted to reach out to the families. You and the
Government would have gone a long way to sharing the burden of grief Sharing the burden
is what investigating Bloody Sunday in Ireland is all about. It simply shows an acknowledgment
that these in power are willing to understand the pain. The action does not right the situation,
or bring back the dead, or take away grief, but it relieves people of their sense of powerlessness.


Compassion and understanding of how individuals and communities feel at times of loss was
exemplified by the Prime Minister when The Princess of Wales was killed. I do not believe that
anyone truly understands why that loss affected the country so deeply, but the Prime Minister
and his advisors anticipated correctly the nations mood and how they would be required to
respond


But one correct response as was show then, is not enough. Within this country exist large
numbers of people who feel they have been neglected for twenty years by a callous self
interested Conservative Government. To show compassion and to express and act in a way
which shows humanitarian feeling and understanding is not a weakness, but something that
people need, even to the extent that they may not know that they need this. Neglect is not just
a physical deprivation but a spiritual one. And this country is lacking in that kind of leadership.

While this Labour Government struggles to fight the causes of crime, to implement zero
tolerance of those who would make their neighbours lives a misery, to balance the books so
woefully depleted by the policies of the last Government in an effort such things as our Health
Service alive, and while it has a strong chance of offering a new pride and vision to our nation,
I am convinced the Government will lose mass support if it fails to show compassion and to
act on that compassion.

So, up to now, although several other tough decisions on much bigger issues than Hillsborough
may have made me question what the Government was doing, I have been a realist and
pragmatic enough to recognise what a long road ahead Labour has to repair the damage already
done.

The decision on Hillsborough hurt. Maybe it was the straw that broke the camels back.
I don't know. But I felt my principles suddenly became more important To support the
Government on this and say nothing would be dishonest o f me.

Of course I recognise that I have no power. I try to make helpful differences in the lives of those
I meet but I know that my voice alone is not important. The loss of my membership o f the Party
will mean little or nothing, to the Party. It means an enormous change for me though.

But during all the years that I have been involved in promoting policy and arguing for change,
and in helping to get others to vote Labour, I had a keen intuition as to what the mood of the
nation was. I was usually right This country now has a chance of obtaining a new maturity and
to embrace new spiritual values. But, in these secular times, we need Government more than
ever before to take a lead, and to listen. In exalted positions of power; while leading the
incredibly pressured life of a senior politician, (despite however many focus groups you may
employ to assess the temperature of the nation) , the danger is that this Government will lose
touch and the vision will be lost.

    Dear Mr Straw,

                                       Hillsborough

    I don’t suppose you’ll take much notice o f this letter; indeed, you may not even
    see it [the ‘standard response’ may confirm this]. However, in the hope that it may
    have some small effect, I shall continue.

^   As an^tttendee o f The B ra d fo rd fc i^ F ire t am perhaps understandably jaundiced
    in my ^ w C ^ u tT lo p e m yfeelings against injustice will predominate.

    It is hard for me to understand how, when people were certified as dead at 3 .15pm
    by the Coroner, they can then be treated by medics some time later and, in one
    case, brought back to life. Please do explain how you feel able to uphold this
    position.

    My withdrawal o f future support for your party will be put on ‘hold’ awaiting your
    response.


    Yours sincerely,
                                                                          ^     f- . ^

Dear Mr Straw

HILLSBOROUGH

We are not only "united in sympathy with those who lost loved ones at
Hillsborough". We are also united in their quest for justice.

We feel that there is no justice in your decision to rule out a fresh inquiry into the
tragedy. It appears now that New Labour is just as capable of a cover-up as the
Conservative Party. Perhaps this is because you all belong to the very system that
failed these people with such gross negligence.

We will not support nor vote for New Labour in future. There is nothing "new" in
your kind of politics.

Sincerely
                                                                  24 Fi

Dear Sir

When are the families of the 96 supporters who died at Hillsborough
on
15th April 1989 going to finally get justice?

There are still too ma n y questions unanswered regarding that day.

W hy has the FACT   that the S Yorkshire police altered statements
gone
unpunished.

Its all very well for Richard Wells to come out and admit that his
force
was at fault and that they would 'continue to make amends wherever
we
c a n * . This is highly insulting to the families of the victims as
the
police admit liability yet appear to not be liable for any of their
actions on the day. Not one police officer has faced any charge
whatsoever.

The Labour party being elected in M a y '97 was a sign of great hope,
a
new era of open, honest and accountable government. What we are
faced
with again is a government frightened of facing up to its
responsibilities to its people on one of the most basic
cornerstones of
democracy - the right for a fair and proper inquest into an
unnatural
death - the right of justice for all.

Dear Mr Straw,


I feel that I must write to you in order to express my anger and disbelief at the news that
you are not to order a fresh inquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy.


The disaster has left deep wounds not only in the families of the victims but in Liverpool
as a whole, everybody knows somebody who was killed or injured. All we are asking is
for a chance for new evidence to be brought and for the reasons behind such meaningless
and terrible deaths to be explained,if never justified. The chance for new evidence to be
brought and for the events to be re-examined could provide a healing process for many
people and I feel that a new inquiry would do nothing but good.


I would hope that you could change your mind on this subject, Mr Straw, and I am sure
that mine is not the only letter you will receive expressing this opinion. Please listen to us.


Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Straw,

I am writing this letter to you, concerning your statement, this afternoon, regarding the findings of the Hillsborough
Football Disaster.
I find it very hard to believe that, since that very tragic occurrence on 15/04/89, which will remain in countless
peoples minds forever, that there is not going to be a reopening of the inquiry, in light of new evidence existing.
I do most strongly feel that the relatives, families and friends of the people, who became tragic victims, on that day,
now feel, that any hope that they have most surely had, in believing that a satisfactory result for them, has
now seemed to have completely disappeared.
I am writing this letter, with a very heavy heart, because to me, this most distressing chapter has seemed to have
been closed without a most rightful conclusion, in so much as, all these people must surely now feel, that they are
not going to receive justice,which to me, is what they could, and indeed should, receive without question.

I thank you for your time and attention in reading this letter.

Yours faithfully,




                                                                                      OPPU fi£6lcTRv

Dear Mr Straw,

                   Hillsborough Disaster

I was surprised and saddened by your decision not to order a new public
enquiry into the 96 deaths.

As a Labour Party member of some 15 years, a football supporter and a
father of 2 children, I feel that you have NOT honoured the pledge you
made while in opposition and have ‘betrayed’ the families of the victims
of this dreadful but avoidable disaster.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Straw,
                                                                  £ •!   »      .     naimi ai i t m i'wiujwhw

As football supporters ourseives we simply cannot understand how it is possible for9& peoplq to
die at a football match and for nobody to be held responsible. |V e cannot believe that you <|an
so unfeelingly ignore the just demands of the relatives of those! who died at Hillsborough fdr a
new public inquiry.                                             ^

As has been said by the relatives, by TV documentaries and by Phil Scraton, there are many
questions that stilt need to be addressed; hem can it possibly be the case that they can mem
on, when they still do not know tire circumstances surrounding many of the deaths.

We are obviously not barristers or law lords or MPs [fj- we are ordinary people who believe
passionately that we have not been given justice. Whatever the legal case may be, the fact is
that a senior police officer ordered that a gate should be opened [and denied ordering this], that
supporters [quite understandably] surged through this gate, that they were directed [or at least
not stopped from going] down a tunnel leading to a section of the ground that was already
overcrowded and that, a s a direct result of this, 96 people died.

This is not speculation, but feet Should it not be the case, therefore, that those responsible for
making these decisions should, a t the very least, be accountable for these.

You say that there is no new evidence: W hat about the conflicting evidence ewer the video
camera trained e>n the Lepptngs Lane terraces? W hat about the 3.15 pm cut off? W hat about
the complete failure of the emergency services?

W e believe, Mr Straw, that you have made a huge mistake in not ordering a new inquiry into
Hillsborough; unlike many erf our friends we did not expect much from a Labour Government
following very conservative policies. W hat we did expect w as decency and it is a source of great
anguish for us that we do not even get that

We are bitterly disappointed that you have not allowed the relatives and football supporters in
general to achieve natural justice; we believe that you have, by this decision, forfeited the right
to hold high office and that you should resign forthwith; you have refused to treat us with dignity
and respect and deserve none in return.




Yours faithfully,
                                                                                      QPPU REGISTRY

To Jack Straw,

I write to express my disgust and dismay at the decision not to allow a full public enquiry into the
Hillsborough disaster,

I am sure that you and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith have fully acquainted yourselves of the facts
surrounding the disaster which is why I find it unbelievable that neither o f you seems to see the
need for further action. Ninety six entirely innocent people died, and thousands more have been
traumatised because of the negligence and incompetence of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
the Football Association and in particular the South Yorkshire Constabulary. I fail to see how any
honest examination of the facts can lead to the conclusion that these people died accidentally.

Many people have already been let down by New Labour. The friends and families of the
Hillsborough victims simply want the truth of what happened to their loved ones to be publicly
recorded and for those responsible to be brought to justice. I am very disappointed that these
simple and justified requests are being denied to protect a big business and a police force that
seem to lack any regret for what they have done.

Dear M r Straw

I have never written to an M P before, but your decision yesterday with regards to the tragedy of
Hillsborough on 15th A pril 1989, both moved me to write and to tears.

When your party were in opposition, you were deafening in your support for a re-enquiry into the
disaster, a reason why a good number of Liverpool FC fans, and those of other clubs, voted for party,
now^your support is deafening by its’ silence.

The decision has stunned many Liverpool fans I come into contact with on a daily basis, also those of
other teams in the country are completely surprised by your apparent U-Turn.
You claim that the ‘new’ evidence would not be enough to bring about this new enquiry, but surely it is
this evidence of police failure at every level that is the crux of the whole disaster, they were there to
PO LIC E the day, they failed, and as a result 96 Football fans - Human beings, parents, children,
grandparents, students, in fact just about every age group is represented in a way most horrid - D IE D .

The numerous slurs we football fans, and in particular Liverpool fans, have had to put up with over the
past years could have been disproved, even judges in charge of preliminary follow up enquiry’s were
making jokes at the fans expense; I repeat, 96 people died that day, it could have been your children, your
friends, your parents, but you don’t seem to realise this, you give false sorrow, but you don’t know the
pain, resentment of bad policing and cover-ups not seen since the assassination of JFK and the heartache
we have endured these past 9 years like we, the lucky fans who came home after that day, do.

I urge you to reconsider, maybe my one voice won’t be enough, but the strength of opinion is rising
against you and we have people power on our side in the search for the truth.

Rest in Peace, and Justice for the 96.

Yours sincerely

Home Secretary Jack Straw
Houses o f Parliament
Westminster
London
                                                  V
Dear Mr Straw,


I am a student at Cardiff University, and was once a potential Labour voter - but not any longer. I was
dismayed and outraged upon hearing the news that you have decided not to open a new inquiry into the
Hillsborough tragedy where ninety-six innocent people lost their lives. I was not related to any o f those
people who died on that day, but I feel that you need to be informed o f a lot o f people’s feelings on this
issue.


We hear about video tapes going missing, conveniently stolen; about lies told by senior police officers in
order to save their own necks; about the seemingly ridiculous time o f death situation; about the mal­
treatment o f grief stricken witnesses; all o f which were covered up or ignored by the original inquiry. Then
you expect us to believe that the new evidence would add “nothing o f significance” to the previous
inquiry’s findings. Lying in order to get away with negligence is not what I would term insignificant. Video
tape evidence apparently showing that pens three and four were already overcrowded by 14:52 hours seem
highly significant to me, as do many other points which have been raised.


The bereaved families are only asking for justice, for someone to stand up and take some responsibility for
what has happened, for steps to be taken to ensure that such a situation will never re-occur. By taking this
decision, you have ensured that these families’ lives will continue to be one long nightmare. How could
anyone live with him self knowing that they had been responsible for the perpetuation o f so much grief?


As Home Secretary, how can you condone lies by senior police officers? How can you sit back and forget
the gross negligence o f your police force? I f the bereaved families have the guts to go through the torment
o f a new inquiry, then you should be ashamed that you haven’t. In my opinion, if you cannot even try to
protect people’s basic human rights, then you are not able to do your job properly and as such should
resign.
Politicians such as you often question why there is such political apathy in this country. This situation,
which you have caused, is a good example. What is the point in caring, in protesting, in trying to make a
difference? At the end o f the day, things just get brushed under the carpet and nothing changes. People
voted for your party at the last election because they thought that you would bring a fresh outlook to
Government. They thought that things would be more open under Labour, as you promised them it would,
but there is no change. Why should anyone even bother to vote? On this issue, as with so many others, you
have done exactly what the Tories would have done —taken the easiest way out for yourselves.


What little faith I had in your Government has disappeared completely. Although you probably won’t even
read this letter, I am at least trying to do the right thing, which is a lot more than can be said for you.


Yours sincerely
Thank you for your recent letter about the Hillsborough Disaster.

The Home Secretary is very conscious of the strength of feeling surrounding the
Hillsborough Disaster, and he understands that his decision not to hold a fresh inquiry
will be a disappointment to the families of those who died and for many who have
supported the families’ campaign.

As he explained in the House of Commons, one of his first concerns on taking office
last year was to ensure that there should be a thorough and independent investigation
of any material which cast doubt on earlier findings about the disaster. The Home
Secretary, therefore, announced on 30 June 1997 that he had asked Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith to conduct a scrutiny of the evidence and to report his conclusions.

The Home Secretary is satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has conducted a
thorough scrutiny o f the evidence and considered its significance carefully. His report
is comprehensive and sets out clearly the matters he has considered and the reasons
for his conclusions. He has considered all the material allegations about missing or
concealed videotape evidence, the alleged interference with witnesses and witness
statements and concerns about the use of the 3.15pm cut-off time at the Inquest.

It is inevitable with a disaster of this magnitude that evidence will emerge from time
to time which has not been heard publicly before. What the Scrutiny had to consider
was not only whether the evidence put forward was new, but also whether it was of
such significance that it would justify a new inquiry, or further consideration by the
Attorney General (with regard to the inquest) or the criminal or disciplinary
authorities.

The Home Secretary has considered the Judge’s report carefully and accepts the
conclusion which he has reached that the evidence submitted to him does not add
anything significant to the evidence available to and considered by the Taylor Inquiry
and the Inquests.



The Home Secretary has made it clear that he entirely accepts Lord Justice Taylor’s
conclusion that the principal cause of the disaster was the failure of police control.
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith himself condemned what he described as Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield’s “disgraceful lies” that fans had opened Gate C.

The Home Secretary shares the sentiments expressed by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in
Chapter 7 of his Report when he says:

The Home Secretary has indicated that there are profound shortcomings in the present
police discipline system which he intends to address. The Home Affairs Select
Committee recently made some important recommendations about the police
complaints and discipline procedures. The Home Secretary is considering their
comments closely.

The Home Secretary also supports Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s endorsement of the
findings of a Home Office Working Party, published in March 1997, that the role of
the coroner after a public inquiry should be limited. The main change proposed by the
Working Party was to relieve coroners of the need to resume their inquest after an
inquiry has been completed. If this had been in place at the time of the Hillsborough
Disaster, it would have spared the families of those who died unnecessary distress
when the Taylor Inquiry had covered substantially the same ground as the Inquest.

For the families of those who died at Hillsborough the grief will never end, and the
Home Secretary recognises that it will be difficult and painful for them to accept his
decision. The original Taylor Inquiry was very thorough and was unequivocal in
identifying the main causes of the disaster, and the Home Secretary hopes that the
families will accept that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny was equally rigorous.
The Home Secretary has indicated that he is ready to talk to the families further to
explain his decision.

Yours sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH LETTER


I (the Home Secretary) am very conscious of the strength of feeling surrounding the
Hillsborough Disaster, and I understand that my decision not to hold a fresh inquiry
will be a disappointment to the families of those who died and for many who have
supported the families’ campaign.


As I explained in the House of Commons, one of my first concerns on taking office
last year was to ensure that there should be a thorough and independent investigation
of any material which cast doubt on earlier findings about the disaster. I, therefore,
announced on 30 June 1997 that I had asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to conduct a
scrutiny of the evidence and to report his conclusions.


I am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has conducted a thorough scrutiny of the
evidence and considered its significance carefully. His report is comprehensive and
sets out clearly the matters he has considered and the reasons for his conclusions. He
has considered all the material allegations about missing or concealed videotape
evidence, the alleged interference with witnesses and witness statements and concerns
about the use of the 3.15pm cut-off time at the Inquest.


It is inevitable with a disaster of this magnitude that evidence will emerge from time
to time which has not been heard publicly before. What the Scrutiny had to consider
was not only whether the evidence put forward was new, but also whether it was of
such significance that it would justify a new inquiry, or further consideration by the
Attorney General (with regard to the inquest) or the criminal or disciplinary
authorities.


I have considered the Judge’s report carefully and I accept the conclusion which he
has reached that the evidence submitted to him does not add anything significant to
the evidence available to and considered by the Taylor Inquiry and the Inquests.

I do share the sentiments expressed by the Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in Chapter 7 of
his Report when he says:


“I understand the dismay that they (the families) have that no individual has
personally been held to account either in a criminal court, disciplinary proceedings,
or even to the extent o f losing their job


There are profound shortcomings in the present police discipline system which I
intend to address. The Home Affairs Select Committee recently made some important
recommendations about the police complaints and discipline procedures. I have been
considering their comments closely and I will be responding shortly / 1 have recently
announced my response to the HAC recommendations including my intention to
reduce the standard of proof to the civil standard in discipline procedures and to
remove the existing double jeopardy provision which restricts criminal and
disciplinary action on the same facts. I have also endorsed the Committee’s
recommendation that forces should show greater commitment to their powers to
verify claims of sickness and disability and, where appropriate, to postpone a request
to retire on ill health grounds until the completion of disciplinary proceedings.


I also support Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s endorsement of the findings of a Home
Office Working Party, published in March 1997, that the role of the coroner after a
public inquiry should be limited. The main change proposed by the Working Party
was to relieve coroners of the need to resume their inquest after an inquiry has been

I am once again watching the Granada television production called
Hillsborough, in light of your decision not to order a review of
the new
evidence that has become available since the initial investigation.

I am horrified and ashamed at the way in which this whole event has
been
"swept under the carpet".

I believe that Jack Straw, as a father, has an obligation to see
that
justice is done, and that those that should be accountable, or
those whose
negligence and bad decisions were a contributory factor in this
terrible
tragedy are admonished or brought to justice.

I sit here ashamed that our great country, built on    foundations of
justice
and fairness appears to be involved in what appears    to me to be a
cover up
of Watergate proportions and that the memory of the    96 cannot be
laid to
rest until someone in authority is made accountable    for this
avoidable
tragedy.

  Well, well - what a surprise. After years of hollow promises and
  months of some puppet Lord 'Justice' allegedly investigating the
  possibility of a re-inquest into the Hillsborough Disaster, we
  finally hear back that there will be no change.

  We didn't expect anything else - the Labour party are as much a
  disgrace as the last lot. The evidence and facts speak for
  themselves and one day they will be presented in an open forum.
  Until then it is easy for the establishment to let the public think
  that the police do a hard job very well and Liverpool supporters
  are murdering, thieving drunken scum. Of course the public couldn't
  handle the truth - that South Yorks police at the hands of
  Duckenfield, Marshall and Co, murdered 96 helpless men, women and
  children. They packed us in. They stood there and watched us. They
  pushed us back in. They did nothing.

^ If you think this is the end of it then you must be more stupid
  than I thought. What you've got to understand is that we live with
  this every day of our lives. Sometimes I have to look away from my
  laughing children because all I can see is the kids who died next,
  to me and all I can hear is their screams. And that wilTliake TtT~
 reasIeFto harass you for the rest of our lives until justice is
  served.

  You are an absolute disgrace - no better than the scum who
  originally perpetrated this and now part of the cover-up machine

    that day, based on my previous visits to the centre with all the
    crushes                                                             /
    etc. - I looked across at the dying, I came home - That is what I
    live
    with - I wasn't even able to 'help out' on the pitch like the other /
    'heroes'.

    So where I stand on all this is tinged with vindictiveness. If the I
    next
    o p t i o n is private prosecutions, then so be it.                 j
    However I wonder were the smug and very rich Mr Duckinfield gets    j
    his                                                        j
    'payback' in all this. Surely I would be within my rights to      /
    organise some
    kind of legal
    disruption to his daily life ?

    I would like him brought in front of a Live TV chat show audience
    to admit
    his failings. - This would surely make the private prosecutions run
    smoother and less costly.

    Your summing up in the Commons proved that you know he has got away
    with
    it.
    Please help us now by pressuring him to tell the truth, and in
    doing so
    the barristers and solicitors won't be the only ones to gain from
    all this.

    Hoping to receive a reply

I would like to express my disgust at the recent anouncement by
the Home
Secretary, Rt Hon Jack Straw, regarding a new enquiry into the
deaths of 96
people at Hillsborough. It seems that New Labour has failed those
who voted
in only a short period in office. I suppose a resolution
satisfactory to
the families of the 96 who died will only come about when it is
politically
expedient for the Government of the day, as has been seen in the
recent
case of Bloody Sunday.
I only hope that the 96 families do not have to wait that long for
justice.

  Hi/
      I know you are probably being inundated with mails from people
such as
myself, but I'm afraid a cannot stand by any longer and watch the
families
and friends of the 96 fans crushed to death in 1989 being further
hurt and
tormented by the governments decision not to allow the truth to be
explored with a new and independant inquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster.
 You have nothing to fear from an inquiry but the emergence of the
truth,
and surely this is not something to be feared by a Labour
Government
dedicated to ensuring justice and equality for all.
 Might I remind you all that it was a conservative Government which
was in
power at the time of the disaster, and so you have no need to fear
transferance of the blame onto yourslves.
Thank you for your time and patience,
Rg.
  c:t- Wishes,

To whom it may concern,

The whole city of Liverpool is disgraced at the decision made on
the
Hillsborough disaster. Those families of the victims were never
given a
fair trial. Do you honestly believe that a cut off time of 3.15pm
is
adequate when doctors are still saying they treated victims at this
time
and ambulances were not allowed on the pitch after this time also.
We are
not dealing with so called scum Liverpool football fans here we are
talking about 96 lives. If things were conducted correctly first
of all
this may not of happened but at least half of those lives could of
been
saved if ambulances were allowed on the pitch. Lets be fair and
listen to
new evidence what harm will it do, it will be a great comfort for
the
families of those people lost. Please think about it as what would
you
feel if it was your son or daughter,

Subject: To Mr Jack Straw: "Hillsborough Kop Out."

Mr Straw,

In May of 1997 I and many thousands of others supported your party
by
voting for you in the general election and thus provided you with
the
privileged position in which you now sit. On the 18th of February
1998
your repaid the support of me and thousands of others by this
disgusting
cover up.

However hard the survivors and families new it was going to be to
go up
against the "establishment" and win, the setting up of the new
inquiry
gave us all hope. Quite how you as a football fan yourself could be
party to the stubborn protection of the Police is very upsetting.
Having
read your article in today's "Mirror", and always assuming that it
was
written by you, I have become even more angered by the outcome. You
claim that the heart of the nation is with the families, you had
the
opportunity to help and did nothing but build them up to knock them
back
down again. The fact that Lord Justice Stuart Smith recommended no
fresh
inquiry is irrelevant, the man should have been removed from his
position the very second that he made his sick "joke" about the
disaster
in Liverpool last year when meeting the relatives of those who
died. It
was your duty to remove him and you failed in your duty.

I am afraid that this has exposed you and your party for exactly
what
you are and what you stand for. A shameful shadow of your former
selves
who are interested in protecting the beloved "establishment" at all
costs. This action has cost your party one vote in every one of the
next
elections in the coming decades, and I would be willing to place
bets on
it costing you many many more.

The fight for justice will go on, you can not sweep us under the

 Dear(well       ) sirs/madams,

 How on earth can you possibly ignore experts saying that a lot of
 the
 Hillsborough 96 were still alive well after 3.15PM???

 bow can you ignore that after 3.45PM there were
 blood-alcohol-level-tests taken by someone who was very keen to
A prove
  there was alcoholabuse in the game.

 Are you "covering up" for some of your dear friends at the South
 Yorkshire Police???????

 ALL WE WANT IS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT REALLY
 HAPPENED,
 WE DONT WANT MONEY(although it would be nice...), WE WANT THE
 TRUTH, THE
 REAL TRUTH AND NOT THE ONE THE S-YORKSHIRE-POLICE WANT.

Subject: No faith in the British Justice System or Police

I have never been moved to wite a letter of complaint before but on
this
issue I am so disgusted with the outcome that I feel I must let my
grevance be heared.

The decsison given on the Hillsborough inquest has failed the
Familys of
the dead and injured, but more improtantly it has failed the
British
Public. Joe Public is more than aware of who is responsible for
the
tragedy and who should be punished but again the British justice
system
fails them even though the evideance against the Police is
concrete.

Isn’t it about time the British public had a justice system they
can
relay on and Police they can trust? Isn't it about to restore some
faith with the public and stop being so wet that you can’t admit
the
truth.

You disgust me, Labour disgusts me and so do the Police.

We don't stand a chance!

Subject: Hillsborough Inquiry

Dear Jack Straw,

Could you please enlighten myself as to the reasoning behind the
decision
to deny a fresh enquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster.

>From the position I'm in, which I admit is likely to be less
informed of
the real facts, I see no reason to deny a fresh inquiry.  For the
families
involved, they believe they willestablish the truth.  For the
Authorities,
they will have an opportunity to regain their credibility, although
they
also may be held responsible.  For the Government, they have the
opportunity to put the public minds at rest.

Therefore, for the parties involved, it can be to everyones
advantage to
allow a fresh inquiry to settle matters.   This could be achieved,
but will
cost money.  A n inquiry should not be prevented if the sole reason
is
money.

>From recent press coverage, there are a number of reports claiming
that new
evidence is available which was not available for the original
inquiry.

For the sake of the People and Families from Liverpool and
elsewhere and
Public Peace of M i n d please reconsider your decision and grant a
new
inquiry.

As an outsider I can still feel the pain of those involved and

is it so hard to admit that there were people at fault and make

M y granddad -                Labour councilor for Ellesmere Port
is
turning in his grave at the decision not to order a full inquiry
into the
Hillsborough disaster.  He was in regular touch with the late Eric
Heffer
MP and a friend of Fred Venables who also was a councilor.

I am ashamed to be a labour supporter and I am positive that
unless you
use your powers to take the matter further, then, the guilty will
go
unpunished.

If you let this opportunity pass,     it will never be available again.

Please, please agree to re-open this enquiry and afford a measure
of
comfort to the families of the victims, and the members of the
emergency
services who are still living under the cloud of this disaster.

Not m an y disasters happen in a lifetime that touch the general
population to the extent that one can remember exactly what one was
doing at the time.

I remember well the Munic h Air Disaster of 1958 - the Assassination
of
JFK in 1963 - the death of The Princess of Wales in 1997.   On that
Saturday in April 1989, I was travelling home from m y work along
the M67
(Denton to Sheffield road) when I heard the first broadcasts of the
disaster on m y car radio.  I can remember gasping and pulling onto
the
hard shouder, momentarily, to listen more carefully.

This cannot be dealt with as a political issue.  It is a humane
issue
that touches every one of us whether we have families, or not,
whether
we are football fans, or not.

Please help justice to be seen to be done.

Dear Mr Jack Straw,

I was filled with hope when it was first announced that there was
to be a
possible new enquiry into the Hillsborough trajedy.   Certain
comments re
the lateness of the families" just like Liverpool supporters at
Hillsborough" ( or words to the same effect), made me suspicious.
Howether
I ma intained hope from 'New Labour' to be fair and honest, alas
despite
even tonights 'World in Action' programme it seems once again a
miscarriage
of justice is to be further ignored.   I write this in light of
certain
leaked reports and prior to your official announcement but am sure
that
your answer is NO.

Well, if this is the case I would ask this. Why in the light of
such
outstanding evidence is nothing being done? and if no one is to
blame what
have the Police got to hide?

Please give the families and those dead some JUSTICE.

I await your reply

With today's decision not to grant a new enquiry,i feel you have
given the
police the right to not carry out the duty to protect people at

to do when
caught lying is to cry sick,then they can get away with any
incompetance.

For the attention of Mr.     Jack Straw.

Dear Sir;

I learned today that you had ruled out a fresh public inquiry into
the 1989
Hillsborough football ground disaster.

The newspapers tell me that you claimed that a scrutiny of alleged
new
video tape and medical evidence b y Lord Justice Stuart-Smith had
not added
''anything s i g n i f i c a n t '' to the material available to the previous
public
inquiry.

You then proceeded to tell the House of Commons that the findings
of Lord
Justice Taylor's original inquiry were still valid and there were
no
grounds to quash the verdicts of the inquest and that there was no
material
which might cause the Director of Public Prosecutions or the police
disciplinary authorities to reconsider their earlier decisions in
the case.


It seems that now even the Labour party and you as the minister
responsible
have been sucked in to the web of lies and deceit that have
shrouded this
tragedy and protected the criminally irresponsible authorites since
minutes
after the terribly wrongminded decisions were taken that have
caused such
m i s e r y and grief to the thousands of friends and relatives of the
victims
still seeking justice.

Please tell me how the following account of the events surrounding
the
tragedy, which appeared in today Guardian, can pos sibly tally with
your
account to the House of Commons today and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
evidence to you stating that is enquiry had not added ''anything
significant'' to the material available to the previous public
inquiry.

Time for the truth               "The Guardian"

Today the Home Secretary is expected to rule out another inquiry
into the
Hillsborough disaster in which 96 football fans died. Ed Walker, a
doctor,
worked in the hospital emergency department where the casualties
were
taken. This is his story Wednesday February 18, 1998

For a quarter of an hour on that afternoon of April 15,1989, I was
the only
suitably-experienced doctor in the accident and emergency
department of
Sheffield's Northern General Hospital. In the weeks following the
Hillsborough disaster, I gave two written statements/ one for the
hospital,
and one that I wrote out on West Midlands statement paper in m y own
time.
[West Midlands police were the force charged b y the coroner with
gathering
evidence for the inquests.] I kept a copy of the first but not the
second.

A n d then m y life went on, until December 1996, when Granada
Television
broadcast Jimmy McGovern's Hillsborough, a dramatisation of the
e v e n t s . As
a result of this, I got in touch with the families.

I also, at last, got a copy of m y 'police' statement, signed on
every page
by a West Midlands woman police sergeant, in the place that says
"signature
witnessed by..." I never met any police officers, let alone this
one. Then
I found out that I had been referred to as "unidentified" at the
inquests.
I was probably one of the most easily identifiable medics
concerned.
Certainly easier to trace and interview than another volunteer who
lived in
London and was visited three times by police officers, who came on
each
occasion fully armed with photographs for hi m to look at. I only
lived five
minutes away. But no visit. Ever.

After years of legal battles and petitioning, it finally took the
television programme to bring things to some kind of a head. During
the

  Printed for Home Office General Internet Address <gen.ho@mai. . 2
          13:34 18/02/98 -0, No Subject

last half of last year, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, on the
instructions of
the Home Secretary, heard from interested parties who believe they
have
evidence which throws doubt on the original inquest verdict. The
judge has
now presented his report to Mr Straw, who is to give his findings
to the
House of Commons today.

As one of those interested parties, I met the judge last October. I
cannot
disclose the full contents of that meeting but the following is for
those
who have forgotten, those who never knew, and those who thought
they knew
it all.

The Hillsborough disaster took place at a football match between
two big
clubs - Liverpool and Nottingham Forest - at a first division
ground, with
stewards, policing, and video surveillance, and yet still 96 people
lost
their lives. Alt hou gh it happened within two miles of a major
teaching
hospital, only 14 of those who died ever made it that far: 82 died
on the
pitch where friends and bystanders, along with a handful of trained
personnel and volunteers, did what they could with pitifully
inadequate
equipment.

There have been two major investigations - the report by the late
Lord
Justice Taylor, and the inquests held in Sheffield b y the South
Yorkshire
coroner of the time, Dr Stefan Popper. No family member I have met
has
anything other than respect for Taylor.

He heard that in the face of a huge mass of people outside the
ground,
unable to get through the turnstiles in time, and with kick-off
fast
approaching, the order was given to open Gate C. This allowed
around 2,000
fans into already overcrowded pens with no means of escape, and was
apparently preferable to delaying the kick-off time. The South
Yorkshire
superintendent who gave the order to open the gate retired through
"ill
health" before he could face disciplinary proceedings.

Then came Dr Popper's much-criticised Sheffield inquests, and the
verdict
of 'accidental death'. Pre-Popper the police were at fault.
Post-Popper, it
was no one's fault. This is, it seems, what drives the families -
those two
words: accidental death, with their implication of lack of
responsibility
and no lack of care.

The fatal injuries were all remarkably similar, and of such a
unique nature
that they surprised everyone concerned. The victims were crushed to
death.
Squashed until they were unable to breathe and died simply of lack
of
oxygen. It was surprising to hear talk of "instant death" at the
inquests.
Those exact words m ay not have been used, but the impression given
by
pathological experts was that unconsciousness woul d supervene
within
seconds and death within four to six minutes of the beginning of
the crush.


What they meant, of course - and they are right - is that these
estimates
apply if you "turn off the oxygen supply to the brain". But I
simply cannot
conceive that this applies in the case of Hillsborough. There would
be at
one moment agonising pressure, and at the next some slight respite,
allowing you perhaps one last breath.

These poor people were not taken unawares. Like man y others, I
assumed that
the authorities put forward the 'instant death' hypothesis as a
means of
assuaging grief. Now I am not so sure.

The coroner also decided not to let the jury hear evidence of
anything that
happened after 3.15pm - the "3.15 cut-off", reasoning that all
those who
died had received their fatal injuries b y then. That some people
did
survive, (after receiving life-saving treatment in h o s p i t a l ) , and
that they
were in the same crush of bodies receiving similar injuries, was of
no
concern to the coroner. The living are not investigated at

  Printed for Home Office General Internet Address <gen.ho@mai. ♦ A
:           13:34 18/02/98 -0, No Subject

inquests,   only
the dead.

The 3.15 ruling meant that the jury did not hear that dozens of
ambulances
were not allowed onto the pitch, or of confusion which led to delay
in
activating the hospital's "Major Accident Plan". I spent six hours
at the
hospital, but can only recall about 15 minutes-worth of 'action'.
Memories
fade, which is just as well, but some images from that six hours
are never
going to go away.

A twist more suited to a novel b y Kafka follows next. The disaster
occurred
on the same weekend that a conference of pathologists was taking
place in
Sheffield. The system that had been so unable to cope with saving
peoples'
lives swung into full action when it came to dissecting their
bodies. By
2pm the following Monday, 94 bodies had been autopsied b y nine
forensic
pathologists at the brand-spanking-new MedicoLegal centre, the
first of its
kind in the country.

Just, perhaps, to prove their thoroughness, every b ody including a
10-year-old, a 13-year-old, and two 14-year-olds, had samples taken
for
blood alcohol measurement. Quite who took this decision and when,
is
unclear. The 'why' is easier to speculate about. If the intention
was to
prove the existence of a drunken mob, it backfired in two ways.
First,
hardly any of the victims had significant levels of alcohol in
their blood;
second, the sampling was performed in such a wa y as to make the
results
little more than useless.

Alcohol is a by-product of decay and decomposition. It can be
produced from
decaying flesh. This effect is sometimes only modest, but easily
enough to
give a result of 10 mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Such a result
was
found in one 13-year-old. The expert at the time suggested that
such a
level, although negligible, was equivalent to having had "a couple

    Printed for Home Office General Internet Address <gen.ho@mai♦♦5
           13:34 18/02/98 -0, No Subject

of pints
the night before". A n d people wonder why the families are still so
angry.

The problems with the alcohol sampling and testing go much farther.
Ma n y
experts regard the tests as fundamentally flawed, particularly as
no
corroborating samples (usually urine or eye tissue) were taken. On
the
basis of results that were at best inaccurate and at worst totally
misleading, and in full knowledge that the Taylor inquiry had
dismissed
alcohol as a significant contributing factor, it was decided to
spend two
whole days at the inquests on this irrelevancy.

They even got in a statistician, who was forced to speculate, by
using the
post- mor te m results, on how many of the crowd had been drinking.
Local
publicans were called as witnesses and gave evidence of fans buying
and
drinking beer before the match. The significance of this is lost on
me. I
already know that some people have a beer before going to a match.
They do
the same, but with different beverages, when attending Wimbledon
and at the
opera. If dozens were crushed to death on Centre Court, or trampled
during
an aria, I wonder whether the 'alcohol i s s u e 1 would have been
flagged up so
strongly.

At the end of the two days it no longer mat te red that, even using
the
figures presented, hardly anyone had been too drunk to drive. The
mu d had
been thrown, and some of it had stuck.

No one seriously suggests that the deaths at Hillsborough were
deliberate.
But what happened afterwards, the monumental arrogance displayed by
some,
and the "Promotion of Myth" as Professor Phil Scraton called it in
the
title of his book, No Last Rights, was deliberate. I was wa rned by
my
medical defence body that the General Medical Council takes a "dim
view" of
doctors who criticise c o r o n e r s 1 verdicts (the same helpful people
also

  Printed for Home Office General Internet Address <gen.ho@mai.. .6
          13:34 18/02/98 -0, No Subject

advised me not to get involved in this matter in any way whatever,
even
with unattributable remarks.) So it is perhaps best if I let people
draw
their own conclusions. But whatever is announced, Hillsborough is
not going
to go quietly away.

Someone from the South Yorkshire police said at the time of the
television
drama that it would achieve nothing other than to re-open wounds.
You
should be careful when using medical aphorisms in the presence of a
doctor.
I can say authoritatively that wounds, in order to be re-opened,
have to
have healed in the first place.

Yours sincerely

    This afternoon I listened on the radio to the statement of the Home
    secretary on the results of the latest inquiry into the
    Hillsborough
    disaster. I was shocked and appalled that nothing further is to be
    done. Whilst one can argue about the significance of available
    evidence the bottom line for me is that as the home secretary
    admitted, a grave injustice has been done to the victims and their
    relatives and according to his statement nothing is to be done
    about
    this.   Measures in the areas he mentioned are aimed only at
    preventing a further injustice of this type. I must say that I'm
    bi tterly disappointed as I expected much better from this
    government
    and this home secretary.

NEW-LABOUR = NEW COVER-UP!

That decision was an absolute disgrace and I hope Jack Straw can
sleep at
night with the death of 96 people and the grief of thousands
weighing on his
mind. Then again the decision just shows what a heartless,
spineless
uncaring, incompetent bastard he really is so I'm sure he doesn't
give a toss.

Yours,   a very pissed-off EX-Party member,GAZ

P.S. There are thousands who feel the same as me, that decision
will cost
you dear on merseyside in the next election - just wait and see!

Dear Sir,

THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

     As a person who was ^injured in the disaster in .1.9S9 I would be
very pleased to be able to pufT'The whole tragic affair behind me, as
many more people would like to do, I am sure. I therefore welcome the
sensible decision of the Home Secretary not to have another enquiry.
     The persons responsible for the disaster were undoubtedly the
hooligan football fans whose bad behaviour caused Sheffield Wednesday
and other clubs to erect 'cages' for spectators as a. means of
controlling crowds. They are the ones to blame, not the police or
club officials. If there had been no 'cages', there would have been
no ser ious pr oblerns.
     People like Trevor Hicks annoy me. Why does he have to go on
trying to apportion blame? This will not undo the situation.
     Maybe he is after compensation and of course the police <and
thus the taxpayers) are the main identifiable group with money.
     Let the situation now rest.
     I sympathise with those who lost family members. My own injuries
were bad enough, but I am sure they gave nothing like the trauma
bereaved families will have experienced.


Yours faithfully

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 12 December 1997 to the Home Secretary about the Hillsborough
disaster.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is currently carrying out an independent scrutiny into the events at
Hillsborough. In the course of his scrutiny, he has received a great many submissions from a variety
of different parties. He also spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those who died and
listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these meetings fruitful and constructive, and
that they were of great help to him in writing his report.

Although it was hoped that the judge would be able to produce his report by the end of 1997, the
number of representations he has received has been such that this has not been possible. However, he
expects to be in a position to present his report to the Home Secretary shortly. Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith will recommend in his report any action which he considers appropriate in the light of the
representations he has received, and his advice will be made public. In the meantime, I am sure you
will appreciate that the management of the scrutiny remains entirely the judge’s responsibility, and it
would not be appropriate for Ministers to comment further at this stage.

Yours sincerely

Jack Straw M.P.
Home Secretary
Houses of Parliament
Westminster

17th December 1997

Reference: Hillsborough

Dear Mr. Straw,

I write with reference to my previous letter to the former Home Secretary (copy enclosed), and to the
recent Cook Report Update documentary shown on ITV on Tuesday 16th December.

I am very surprised and shocked to hear that the mother of one of the victims of the Hillsborough
tragedy has allegedly been approached by Mr. Justice Smith with regard to accepting a compromise
to re-opening the inquest, the compromise being that he merely attempt to more fully explain the last
hour or so of her sons life. She very bravely rejected this out of hand and continues to refuse to collect
her son’s death certificate until the time of death is changed and the truth revealed at a new inquest.

This scandalous cover up cannot be allowed to continue. Negligence in the extreme was responsible
for this tragedy and until somebody is made accountable, we run the risks of a repeat in the future.

I am not suggesting that any form of charges or punishment be brought to bear upon any individual.
Goodness knows, having to live with the consequences of that fateful day is burden enough to bear for
anyone. However, in order to ensure these events are never repeated, the authorities charged with
public safety must be made accountable in order to remain fully focused on the job in hand. Being able
to fail in their duty without recourse will only encourage the sort of arrogance and incompetence seen
at Hillsborough. Had a more focused view been prevalent I am convinced the tragic chain of events
which led to disaster at Hillsborough would never have occurred.

I will gladly discuss any points raised in this or my previous letter and ask once again that, in the
name of justice and in the interests of public safety, the inquest be re-opened in order to establish the
truth and allow the victims and their families to rest in peace.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and please do not hesitate to contact me at the above
address.

Yours sincerely,




                                                                                           OPPU REGI

Michael Howard M.P.
Home Secretary
Houses of Parliament
Westminster
London

6th December 1996


Dear Mr Howard,

I write with reference to the recent documentary on the Hillsborough disaster and to express my
concern at what appears to be the withholding of evidence, and collusion by senior officers serving
with South Yorkshire Police at the time.

I have attended football matches for some thirty years both home and away and have been to
Hillsborough several times to see my team, Newcastle United, play Sheffield Wednesday.
On one particular occasion, many years prior to the disaster, we were subjected to exactly the same
scenario as the Liverpool fans were on that fateful day, but were fortunate in that we managed to force
open the side gates at the top of each pen and spill over into empty terracing reserved on either side
for segregation purposes. Our screams for help were met with abuse from the police. Our fingers were
hit with truncheons whilst trying to scale the fences to escape the crush. We were pushed back into the
overcrowded pen just as we were about to escape it. In short, our lives were put at serious risk because
of the, “They’re all animals”, attitude of South Yorkshire police.

Several people of all ages and backgrounds were injured and complained bitterly, but were silenced by
the threat of arrest for some invented, “Breach of the Public Order Act”.

I am sure that, upon the realization that their detractors could be silenced, South Yorkshire Police
became complacent and their standards continued to slip. Measures that were previously taken, such
as putting up terriers and checking tickets on the way to the stadium, were slowly discontinued.
These falling standards due to lack of accountability were, I believe, the major factors that led to so
many wrong decisions being taken on that fateful day, and the feet that ,as yet, there has still been no-
one held accountable, leaves open the possibility of a repeat disaster despite the recent improvements
to stadia.

How can any organization that pledges to take responsibility for the safety of the public, be allowed
to shirk that responsibility when the going gets tough?

Other incidents since Hillsborough, which I will gladly discuss, reinforce my view that there is still a
lack of training given to police officers on the issue of crowd control. Training which I am sure would
be forthcoming if every Chief Superintendent knew that they were going to be held accountable
should they fail in their duties.

I consider it imperative that the inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster be reopened, not as a witch
hunt of individuals, but to make accountable every organization which claims responsibility for public
safety, be it the police, fixe brigade, channel tunnel or whatever.
I will gladly discuss these and many other points which time prevents me from adding at this time and
implore you to consider the new evidence highlighted in the Hillsborough documentary.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and please do not hesitate to contact me at the above
address.


Yours sincerely,

Dea

Thank you for your letter of 13 October to the Home Secretary about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
Scrutiny into the Hillsborough disaster, and for your personal views about the incident.

The Home Secretary has indicated that the terms of reference which he has given Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith for the Scrutiny will allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence was
overlooked in the consideration of the causes of the disaster or the consideration of criminal or other
proceedings. The Judge will also be able to recommend any other action which should be taken in
the public interest. The Home Secretary has said he is confident that the terms of reference will allow
the Judge to carry out a full scrutiny of the evidence which has been submitted by the families and
others.

Yours sincerely




Mike Ward

Dear Miss Jones

Thank you for your letter of 7 October to the Home Secretary about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
reported comment during his recent visit to Liverpool.

I am sorry that you were upset by the Judge’s comment to Mr Phil Hammond. The Judge has said
on the record that he deeply regrets this remark, which he made off-the-cuff and without any
intention to offend or for it to be taken seriously. He has made clear that the behaviour of the fans is
not the subject of the Scrutiny.

As you know, the Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those who died and
listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these meetings fruitful and constructive, and
that they will help him to write his report.

The Home Secretary has indicated that he is satisfied Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will produce a
thorough report in which the families and the public can have confidence.

Yours sincerely

The terms of reference which the Home Secretary has given Lord Justice Stuart-Smith for the
Scrutiny will allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence was overlooked in
the consideration of the causes of the disaster or the consideration of criminal or other proceedings.
The Judge will also be able to recommend any other action which should be taken in the public
interest. The Home Secretary remains confident that the terms of reference will allow Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith to carry out a full scrutiny of the evidence which has been submitted by the families
and others.

As you know, the Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those who died and
listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these meetings fruitful and constructive, and
that they will help him to write his report.

     Dear Home Secretary

     I am writing to you today after hearing on the news the comments of' Lard.
     Justice Stewart Smith, the Judge conducting the new enquiry into the
     Hillsborough disaster.  His remarks concerning the punctuality or
     otherwise of Liverpool people, where 'Liverpool football fans arrive
     late* (The Vorld at One, Radio 4) gave an appaling indication of his
     bias towards Liverpool people, and clearly reflects his inability to
     conduct any enquiry.

     Therefore, I ask you to consider removing him from chairing this
     enquiry, and question his suitability in chairing this or any other
     sensitive enquiry. His lack of tact suggests his inability to arrive at
     any impartial and just decision, despite his subsequent apologies.

     At the same time, I would ask you to ensure all evidence and former
     Police investigations concerning Hillsborough (both old and new) be
     considered, in the interests of justice for those killed and their
     relatives.

     Yours sincerely___________

  Dear Sir,

   am the Chairman and Founder o f the Official Barnsly F C Supporters Club, I am also the
^P^ssistant Secretary o f the Northern Division o f the National Federation o f Football Supporters
  Clubs.

  I am writing reference your decision to refer the Hillsborough disaster to another Judge for him to
  investigate the facts and report if a further inquiry is required.

  In view o f the recent comments passed by this Judge reference Liverpool supporters arriving late,I
  feel he has prejudiced his inquiry before it starts.The reason being is that if he does eventually
  come to the conclusion that the Liverpool supporters arriving late was one o f the reasons for the
  disaster,the Liverpool Supporters are going to say it was not a proper inquiry because the Judge
  held this view before he started looking at the facts.

  In view o f this I would like to request you appoint another Judge to examine the facts.

  One o f the Main criticism Football supporters levied against the Taylor Report was that the
  Inquiry team consisted mainly o f academics who had never attended Football match's this applied
  especially to Lord Justice Taylor.That is probably the reason they came to such dramatic
  conclusion's which has resulted in NEARLY pricing the average supporter out o f the game.

  I would hope you would take this criticism on board and appoint members o f the Football
  Supporters organisations onto this inquiry team.

     I am very concerned about the judge who made such a inane remark.
To do this shows a serious lack of judgement— therefore is he capable of
sound judgement not only for this enquiry but for any other cases he may
handle in the future? I greatly admire the families who were willing to
accept his apology, but personally I feel that he should not have been
allowed to continue to Chair the enquiry.

      Judges get paid a very high salary; the public should be able to
expect a very high standard from them. Do they undergo appraisal
regularly? If so by whom, I wonder? They themselves seem to come from
a very narrow social group.

     I hope you will deal with this matter most strongly not just for this
one case but for the judiciary generally.



                            Yours faithfully

Deaij

Thank you for your letter of 6 October to the Home Secretary about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
reported comment during his recent visit to Liverpool.

I am sorry that you were upset by the Judge’s comment to Mr Phil Hammond. The Judge has said
on the record that he deeply regrets this remark, which he made off-the-cuff and without any
intention to offend or for it to be taken seriously. He has made it clear that the behaviour of the fans
is not the subject of the Inquiry.

As you know, the Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those who died and
listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these meetings fruitful and constructive, and
that they will help him to write his report.

The Home Secretary has said he is satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will produce a thorough
report in which the families and the public can have confidence.

Yours sincerely




Mike Ward

Dear Mr Hooper

Thank you for your further letter of 3 October to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Secretariat about the
current scrutiny into the Hillsborough disaster.

My letter of 1 September detailed Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s terms of reference. You will appreciate,
therefore, that the scrutiny will not, in itself, have any impact on the work of your association. Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith is concerned with the existence of any new evidence which may justify a further
public inquiry into the disaster. It is only in the event of a further public inquiry being established
that events such as those to which you refer in your letter may be affected.

At this stage, it is the intention of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to hear only from those who wish to
make representations concerning the events at Hillsborough. In view of the fact that your association
is not affected by the current scrutiny, we do not propose to consult you at this stage. If, on the
conclusion of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny, the Home Secretary feels a further full public
inquiry is warranted it will, of course, be open to you to make further representations.

Yours sincerely




Mike Ward

  Dear Sir

  Further to my correspondence with the Home Secretary’s office and subsequent reply from the
  Operational Policing Policy Unit, I write on behalf of the above Association in relation to the
  scrutiny of the evidence regarding the Hillsborough disaster.

  As a result of the main Hillsborough Enquiry, there were several changes in legislation and
  guidance in relation to crowd control, policing and allied features for many outdoor public
  entertainment events which have affected many of the agricultural shows, specialist events
  and country fairs represented by the Association.

  The ASAO is particularly anxious to be involved in future discussions and/or consultation
  with regard to any modification of existing legislation.

  The events represented by the ASAO, some 200 with over 4 million people attending
  throughout the year, are mostly organised by registered charities, and our membership expects
  that we should be closely involved in discussions which may directly affect the running of
  these events. Often it is only experienced event organisers who can say whether a proposed
  change is likely to have the desired effect, especially where the inter-action between animals
  and humans is involved.

  We should be grateful therefore to receive information and consultation papers in due course
  regarding any proposals.

  Yours faithfully



(J^Paul J Hooper

Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to the Home Secretary about the forthcoming scrutiny of
evidence about the Hillsborough disaster.

Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
scrutiny to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, to conduct the scrutiny.
His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor, or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
f:\oppn\complnts\com-sfj\mjw-0146.doc
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration of his
terms of reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT.

The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
over the events of that terrible afternoon.

You also refer in your letter to the issue of parental responsibility for the actions of children
who offend. Like you, the Government believes that the primary responsibility for the

•
behaviour of children rests with parents, and takes the view that an effective deterrent is
needed in order to prevent young people from committing crimes, and to nip criminal
behaviour in the bud.

That is why it is proposed to give the courts a range of new community disposals which will
be designed to curtail offending behaviour at an early stage. These include an Action Plan
Order, a highly focused three-month order which will involve the young offender in an
intensively supervised programme of education and activities and ensure that his parents are
fully involved, and a Reparation Order, which would require the young person to make
specific reparation either to the individual victim of his crime, where the victim desired this,
or to the community. An end to the current system of formal police cautioning is also
proposed with the introduction of a new Final Warning, which will trigger action by local
agencies to ensure that the young person is deflected from his offending behaviour.

Measures such as these will confront young offenders with their behaviour and produce
practical solutions for changing it, as well as ensuring that punishment produces some
worthwhile community benefit in the form of reparation and reduced levels of offending.

Yours sincerely



M J Ward

Dear

Thank you for your recent letter which was included in our weekly “Letters to
the Editor” slot on the Daniels and Phillips programme.

Hillsborough has been much in the news recently, and by the time you receive
this letter, the new Home Secretary, Jack Straw, will have announced whether
a new inquiry or review of the original inquiry will take place.

Thank you for your interest.

Yours sincerely,

   Dear Editor,

   I recently saw the TV film,            " Hillsborough."

   The content was so intensely realistic,             emotions of anger a,nd depres s i o n h ad me
   switch off..where the n a u s e a t e d boy witness       repeatedly- seeks a b r e a k from the
   oblivious official.

   I recalled why I'd o r i g i n al l y left the U.K.       for the U.S.

^ ^ I t was p r e c isely because of the fraudulent, spiritless outlooks, (so v i g i l a n t l y
     portrayed), of the coryzal, w o u l d - b e or pr i v i l e g e d classes, their paucity of
     generosity, their p a l e o l i t h i c views on equity or compassion for anybody but them­
     selves, their blistering, spite corroded ethics and their frigid, arrogant, irr-
     eformable hearts. This includes the dishonourable, colluding, legal leeches.

   Brit a i n n e v e r h ad an Empire.

   It just raped, pi l l a g e d and stole extensive territories.

   W h e n unfortunate people we r e abused, punished, m u r d e r e d or e x c l u d e d in the pursuit
   of power, wealth, immunity an d the p r e s e r v a t i o n of them...so be it.

   The correlation w i t h H i l l s b o r o u g h is unmistakable.




   Very Truly Yours,

  Thank you for your letter of 1 July to the Prime Minister, copied to the Home Secretary,
  about the forthcoming scrutiny of evidence about the Hillsborough disaster.

  Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
  attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
  December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
  Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
  scrutiny to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
  To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
  Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
  terms of reference are:

            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
            Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

            a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
            b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
               discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
            c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
               matters;

           And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
           such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
           Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
           attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
           their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
           be taken in the public interest.

  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
  has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
  submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
  available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
  Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
  f:\oppu\compliits\corresp\mjw-0144.doc
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration of his
terms of reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT.

The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely



M J Ward

Dear Sir,

I was delighted to learn that you are to re-open the investigation ini the Hillsborough
Football disaster and presumably the extent to which Police incompetence to this tragedy.

Football supporters, as you know, have caused more deaths, personal injury, trauma and
damage to property than any other sporting group in the last few decades in both the UK and
possibly the world.

I am sure that with careful consideration of all the relevant facts, and using the equivalent of
the logic applied to the Dunblane tragedy and the subsequent formation of the Firearms
Amendment Act 1997, that you will come to the inescapable conclusion that spectators at all
football matches should in future be banned. This should also eventually apply to Rugby

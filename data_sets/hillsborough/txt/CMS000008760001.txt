                 Dear

                 Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan
                 which has been passed to this department in view of our
                 responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act. I
                 apologise for the delay in replying to you.

                 Thank you for expressing your concern over the cost of
                 introducing all seated accommodation at football leaaue
                 grounds particularly those in the lower divisions. However
                 item?Shf inC?rr?? bY these clubs may not be quite so severe as
                       n ^in          seem. As you may be aware the Chancellor
                 announced in the recent Budget that the government would be
                 P?nnCin?i      ?00lu bettin9 tax therefore making available
                       million to the football industry over the next five
                 furfh^r-      Football Trust expects to provide clubs with a
                 almost
                 almost £26
                          £26 millionnprovided each
                                                n6Xt year
                                                      ten by
                                                          years' in addition
                                                             television      to
                                                                        and pools
                 companies     Consequently there is a considerable amoSnt of
                 improvements      ^ f°°tba11 clubs to make the necessary ground

             Jhf^rtherKreason for the cost incurred by the clubs being less
             than may be expected is that current attendances at many
             grounds are well below the maximum capacity of the ground
                      tCe Taylof co^ented, in his Final Report, that a
             small scale redevelopment possibly involving only part of the
             ground, might be sufficient in some cases.

                                                                                 Yours sincerely

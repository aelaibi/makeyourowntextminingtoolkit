W h e n we    first    e n t e r e d the       ground we were met                 by a large n i m e r             of

Liverpool          supporters,         who were a n g r y and we were                    suj<fected to a lot of

verbal a b u s e .         I made my way             towards       the    t.unns^r w h i c h     runs       underneath

the West S t a n d w h i c h was              found to be b l o c k e a by the Liverpool

supporters          hanging about,             some      of them seemed               dazed,    in order       to get

into    the tunnel          we    had to get           hold of the supp o r t e r s and shout at                        them

to get       out of the          tunnel,       even      passing       them from one Offi c e r               to

ano t her.



W hen   1 got       onto    the    terfcacs' behind             the    goals,         I saw a large          number      of

bodies       on the    floor,          people were          standing        on them to get             out of the

way,    some       of the    fans were          pulling         the wire         barriers       down with their

hands     in order . t h a t       they       couId get         out    from the         terrace       o n X o the

pitch,       as    the wire was          being       torn out from the                 supports       other

s p e c t a t o r s were    picking          some    of the      bodies         off    the    floor and       passing

them    through       the    gate       or    through       the openings              in the f enc i ng .



I assisted          in helping w ith some                 of the      bodies          on the te

placing       them onto          the    playing area.            Officers         were       trying    to    revive      the

fans as were          some       of the other            fans,     there were also a large                    number        of

fans    that were          ripping       down       the a d v e r t i s i n g    boards w hich were            being

used to       carry the          injured and the dead fans awa y from the goal                                     m outh

towards       the    other       end of       the ground or to              the       gymnasium.

                   I assisted       in removing         a number       of s p e c t a t o r s     from the        playing area

                  near    to    the West        stand    to the     other      end of      the     ground.         I also       helped

                  carry a number           of     people    that were         o b v i o u s l y dead to the           g y mnasium

                  behind       the N o r t h Stand.         Whilst      I was      doing     this a large             number     of

                  fans    that were        carrying        bodies     into     the g y m n a s i u m were         rushing about

                  knocking        people    out of       the way      irrespective           of what          they were        doing,

                  t rying      to get    to the g y m n a s i u m as         soon as    they       could.         I believe       that

                  this    was wit h good           intent as they were              trying        to get medical           treatment

                  as   fast as      they    could       for there      fellow fans.



                  Whilst       I was    in the      g y m n a s i w m and    in the    process          of    returning        to the

                   pitch,      I was    a sked     by a Senior        Offi c e r    that     if    I was       not engaged would

                   I stand      by one     of the       bodies     laid      inside    the      gymnasium.

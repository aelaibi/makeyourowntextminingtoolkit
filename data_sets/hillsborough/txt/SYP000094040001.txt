                     who were         trying      to get through the turnstiles.

                     At a time w hi ch            I can only estimate                    to have been about             three    o ’clock

                     (1500),       I saw a Police Officer                     open a large             blue    concertina type gate

           J         block from L ep pi nq s Lane.

\q    j              I saw a large            number         of s upporters enter               the ground           thro ug h gate

                     I was aware           of    people       getting        through the Police Cordon behind me,                            I

                     saw them getting              under       the bellies              of the Police Horses.

                     T here was a sudden                rush from behind me as either                          the    police    broke       the

                     and get       in through gate                  5A ’ before         the mass.

            bumping        into    this   portacabin as they         rushed towards          the open gate.

               0 n Saturday           15.4,        I went     to the L i verpool           and N o t t i n g h a m Forest

               m a t c h at Hills b o r o u g h .

               I am a s u pporter              of L iv er p o o l   FC.
                                                                      lot"       K/iioq-g.

                                                                    t
                                                        B irkenhead.        We    picked                up   in Country,

              W h e n we      got to S h e f f i e l d     traf/ic was           heavy,    and we        parked    in the side

               s tre e t s    near to the          ground, /we          parked a bout      12.30pm and went                to a pub,

               I think        it was      the F r eema sV)n s A rm s . I think             it was Wang erl ey Road.

              The     pub was         full w i t h L i verpool           suppo r t e r s and there was a good

              a t m o s phere.        I did not       see anyone          deliberately        trying         to get drunk and

               t here was          no violence.

               I think we            left the      pub about 2 . 3 0 - 2 . 3 5 p m and w hen we                 got       to the
                                                                                    /                      P A GE         2
                                                                                                           SI 569

ground there was a mass                   of/ people       from the street           inwards      towards       the
                 '' -n"                   \j
t u r n s t i l e s, There      were      no queues and people were                being    funnelled         into

an a rea      between gates.              In this mass           there was      pressoire from the            people

be h i n d and      it became       u n c o mfortable.          I d i d n ’t get /tear the turnstiles.

I then became a ware               of     the    fact that gates          to my right       had    been

opened.       We    ran t hr ou gh        the    gates and this         op e n e d up into a yard             area

and    there was         room to move           about.     Here    some     of my friends went             to the

toilet and          I met a fri e n d          from S c o t l a n d and we       chatted for a couple                of

minutes.       After      that we e nt e r e d the             tunnel    to the    terrace.       I didn't       see

any    signs       indicating an y other                routes to the        terrace and         1 d i d n ’t see

any stewards.            We went along           the tunnel        w i t h a lot of other          people.

Wh en we got         to the      end of the tunnel               it was     one mass      of    people and you

had to       push your w a y t hr o u g h because you were                      being    pushed    from          /

behind.       You just       had to go ^wiVn the                crowd and       I found myself          in P e n 3

and    I was       in front      of a barrier,            one back       from the       barriers       that    later

collapsed.         There     was    two young           lads    in front     of me and to my            left who

were    screaming         for    people        to move     back    because       they said someone was

dying.       There was       no wa y an y o n e         could move,       the    pressure was          so great.

The    game    had kicked          off and       1 had my arm a r o u n d the            bar to the        barrier

and    I was d et er m i n e d      to keep hold of              it.    I can remember          someone       asking

me    if I was       on a bar,          his    face was a s h e n and        I twisted         to my    right    so

he    could get       behind me.          H owe v e r    I ’m not e x a c t l y sure whe n this was.                 At

some    stage      the    play     came       to my     left and       it was    then that       I went       down.

My    legs went       out    in front          of me and        I held onto       the bar because             if I

had gone       right      down     I w o u ld have       been kiTlied.          I managed      to get      up when

the    pressure       eased but most             of that ywas a complete                blank.    I held       onto

the    bar    until      about     3. 4 0 - 3 ,50pm,/when              things were       beginning       to get

organised.         I counted        eight       b o d i e y in front      of me and a r o u n d me

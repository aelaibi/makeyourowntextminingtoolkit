At 3 . 1 0 pm         (1510)       we a rr iv ed at L e p p i n g s L.n end to see great                         numbers

of L i v er pool         fans      shoutin g and        running about.                   As we entered the

g r o un d several          L iv er p o o l   fans a p p r o a c h e d me saying                that    it was all            our

fault,       that      is     the Police.            The    fans were irate and shouting

o b s ce ni t ie s     at     the     police     in general.               As I a p p r o a c h e d the? tunnel         at

L e p p i ng s Ln end         into the ground              1 saw several                males    laid out on the

floor,       most a p p e a r e d        to be   in an u n c o n scious              state and some were

receiving medical                a t t e n t i o n from the a m b u l a n c e            service,       the    police and

o ther     football         supporters.

I carr i e d on          into      the    ground and on          coming           out    of the     tunnel       I went        to

the    right         in company w i t h other              o 4 ?icers         into      the stand.         The

s up p o r t e r s    in the       stand were        e if t h e r scr e a m i n g       and shouting          or seem to

be w a t c h in g about            in a daze, j I then saw more                         bodies    being       carried

from the front                of    the s t a n d / b y s u pporters back                through the        tunnel.           As

1 looked         towards        the      front/of     the s tand          I       saw what       can only be

d e s c r i b e d as a large             pile/of     bodies,       few of w h i c h seemed                to be moving.

In front         of the s tand            is a perimeter           fence a p p r o x i m a t e l y        10 feet      high

w h i c h some        supp o r t e r s    were   trying      to climb over onto the                       field and.

P o l ic e at the other               side    trying      d e s p e r a t e l y to remove           the    fence with
                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                  S3008

their       hands    to enable          them to get         to the       bodies         on the stand side               but

due    to the       supporters          cl i / \ b i ng onto     the   fence        the    police     officers were

being       h i n dered    in thei r / attempts            to    remove     the      fencing.        These

supporters          that we re ^rl 1mbi ng onto ythe fence were using                               the    bodies

below as a stepping                stone and showed                little     concern for           their well

being       only for their             own s a f e t y /    I then star t e d to assist                   other

officers          in trying       to untangle/ bodies and                  remove         them.

Whilst       1 was       helping       remove The       bodies,        most       of w h i c h a p p e a r e d    to have

a blue       tinge       to their       skin due       to lack of ox y g e n and being                    crushed

1 could smell             intoxicants          on some of the            bodies.           Most of the           bodies

had either          v om i t e d or their           bodily functions              had c o llapsed         causing

them to ur inate themselves.                        Some    clothing f rom these                  bodi es wa.s

miss i n g    due    to the       bodies       being    tangled up.               During     this time the

police       broke       through       the    fence and         1 w ith the a s s i s t a n c e       of other

officers          started    passing          the   bodies       thro u g h the         fence     onto    the

football          pitch to    receive medical               attention.              By the way most              of the

bodies a p p ea re d        I realised that they were                     dead but          still     pulled       them

out w i th the           hope that       some       could be saved.

At    one    point whilst          I    was    pulling      the     bodies        out     I felt    s o m ething

strike me on the back and heard someone                                say w a t c h y o u r       face    s o m ebody

is throwing          coins    from above.              After most         of the/b o d i e s        had been

cleared       I went       onto    the       football      pitch an d a s s / s t e d other              fans with

trying       to    calm peopie          down.                                 /

After       the ground was             empt i e d of all         supp o r / e r s    I then went          back     to the

stand w ith black            plastic          bags and      c o l leVt^d up all             the    personal        items

w h i ch were       laid about and took                them to the g y m n a s i u m after                which     I

then    left       the    ground.

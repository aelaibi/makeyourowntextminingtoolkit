              I am a D e t e c t i v e       Constable          in the          South      Yorkshire              Police    Force      and    I

              am     presently         stationed         at W o o d s e a t s       Police       Station,           Sheffield.




              At 8 . 3 0 a.m.          on Saturday,.          1 5th A p r i l        1989,       1 come n e e d       duty     in full

              u n i f o r m at    Woodseats         Police       Station,            Sheffield,              in    relation     to a

              football         special       duty    at H i l l s b o r o u g h          F o o tbal1 Ground           for    the    semi­

              fin a l     match    between Liverpool                  and N ot t in g h a m Forest.

              I was       transported          together        with        other         Police        Officers,          by a P S V

              double       decker       bus,    to H i l l s b o r o u g h         Football          Ground.         A briefing         then

              took       place    in the       North Stand            area and            the    officers           were    given      some

              packed       refreshments.             My     duties         were      that       of     seri a l     11.

              At     approximately           1 1 . 1 5 a.m.      that       day,         together           with Detec tive

              Constables          Friend,       Oakes,       Titterton,              Police          Constable        Thickett         and

             Police        Sergeant         Edwards,        I w ent        to      the    i ns i d e    of    the    Leppings       Lane

              turnstiles          to    patrol      the     inside         of      the    turnstiles              numbered     1 to 8«

             The      supporters         could      be    seen     through           the     turnstiles             and Mounted

             Officers          were    on    d u t y at     that      location            outside           the    ground.      Police

             Officers          were    also     positioned            on    the      outside           of    the    turnstiles         to

              carry      out     'selective         s e a r c h i n g ’ for         prohibited articles.

                                                                                                                                    R3S4

I positioned myself                    on    the    inside            of    turnstile            number             after           a high

hinged       fencing           had    been     opened.               This     prevented           supporters              entering

the W e s t       Stand area           and a       portable            barrier          fence      was    placed           there          by

the    ground        staff.           This     enabled           two       more    turnstiles            to    be     brought

into    use       to a l l o w       the    supporters               into    the    North- S t a n d a r e a              of    the

ground.

At    12 noon,           the    turnstiles          were         opened          and a number            of    supporters

came    through           to    get    themselves               a good       position            in the       ground.               A

number       of      Sheffield             Wednesday            s u p p o r t e r s came     to    the     turnstiles

asking       if      a    programme           could        be    purchased and              passed        out to      them.

Those       requests           were    made,

As    the    time        pa ssed,      the     turnstiles              became       nrn*ft b u s i e r        and     problems

were    b e i ng     caused          by the       supporters.                      the     tickets        we re      imng

handed       into        the    turnstile          oper(         a    t     fans    from         behind       were        snatching

the    tickets        and       trying       to    use     them again              to    get      into    the       gr o u n d .

Other       fans    were        jumping       over       the         barriers       and      claiming          that        they          had

handed       their        tickets          in but      t hat      was       not    so.

Due    to    these        problems,          I stood            inside       the    turnstile            areas       and

supervised          both        booths       at    that         entrance          numbers             and             .        I c o uld

see    the    crowd        outside          a n d at     approximately                  S . 30    p.m.    I could              see       that

the    crowd       outside           had    swollen        considerably.                   The     Poli ce O f f i c e r s

outside       were        experiencing             difficulty               in s e a r c h i n g    due       to    the        numbers

and an       obvious           pressure       was      beiryf c a u s e d          in the        surge        forward           to       the

t u r n s t i 1e ent r a n e e s .

At    approximately              2.40         rrt. / h e        turnstile           entrances            were jammed and                      a

number       of      youths          entered with               tickets          to the W e s t      S t a n d ar ea.               It was

impossible          to     direct          them    back     and        to    the    correct         turnstiles,                 due       to

the    supporters              that    had m o v e d       forward and              filled         their       space           as       they

entered       the     turnstile.              They were              allowed        through and               directed

through       the        portable          barrier       fencing            to    the    appropriate               area        of       the
                                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                                     R384

gro u n d .

At    that      point,        numerous           fans      were       scrambling                over    the w a l l s          and    into

the      ground       and     it was        impossible              to    stop        them.           I detained             two     and

attempted            to    eject       them      from      the      ground,           but       it     was     not      p o s s i b l e to

se n d    them       back     through         the       turnstile          areas.                It w as       not     p o s s i b l e to

put      them    through          the    l arge         gat e s     to L e p p i n g s          Lane    as     the      supporters

were      pushing          against       it.        Had       it    been       opened           they w o ul d          have     spilled

ins id e .

It was         not    practical          to      take      these         two     to    the       Police        Room       as    the

depletion            of P o l i c e     Officers          would          h ave    caused more                problems           than

could      have       been       benefitted             and    the       two w e r e         allowed         to    enter        as

paying         supporters.              Further          youths          entered with                 tickets          and     it was

quite      obvious          t h at     they      had     been       in a n       intoxicated                state       but     it w as

not      possible          to a r r e s t     or    e j ect        these       from        the       ground       either.

Looking         through          the    turnstiles             I could           see       that       the    Mounted           Officers

were      si,uck. s o l i d       in a      compacted              c r o w d w h i c h wa s           surgeing          forwards           and

stretching            for     s ome     considerable                distance.                The      Policewoman              on    the

out/i de        of    the     turnstile            had    been        pinned          to        the wall          by   force         of the

criswd a n d         she    was      pulled        into       the     turnstile                 a n d into     the g r o u n d .

 s the         supporters            continued           to    come       through            the      turnstiles,              I could

see      that    s ome      of    them were             clearly          injured.               Some    h ad      obvious           limps,

others         were       clutching         at     parts       of     their       own        bodies         and    showing           signs

of    p ai n    on    their       faces.           As    they       came       through           the    gates          they

expressed            rel i e f    due    to      having        escaped           from        the      pressure          on     the

outs i.de       of    the     g round .

I c o ul d      see       that    the    peo p l e       on    the       outside           of    the    ground were                 clearly

distressed            and    a great          deal       of    suffering              wa s      being       experienced.

Being      inside          the    turnstile             area,       I started              to    pull       people       through           the

turnstiles            to a t t e m p t      to a l l e v i a t e         the     outside             pressure.           As     s ome

came      through          they were          in    poor       c o n d i t i o n an d were              taking          their        first
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      R3S4

full     gasp       of       air      as     they      entered          the    turnstile             space.          A    number          went

to a n       internal             fence       in the         turnstile          and       stood       for       a while         to

recover        before          making            their       way    to    the       North        Stand      part         of    the    ground .

The     stream          of    supporters               continued          to    come       over       the       wall      and       into    the

West     Stand          entrance             to the      ground and             I continued                to    pull         supporters

through        the       turnstiles.                   A number          of    these       did       not    h ave        tickets,          but

there        was    no w a y          they       could       be    sent       back,       ejected          or a r r e s t e d .           There

was     no    other          course          of a c t i o n       but    to    let       them     through and                 into    the

gro u n d .        As    I pulled             s o me    of    the       spectators             through,          the      turnstile

staff        were       unable          to    take      the       stubs       off    the       tickets          f a st    enough          and

s ome    went       through             without         handing          them       in.        The    turnstiles               would       have

registered              the       numbers         going       through.

Throughout              all       this,       c h i l d r e n as        young       as    seven       or    eight         years       old

were     jumping             o ver      the      turnstiles,             claiming           to    be w i t h         parents         and

running        through                into    the      ground.           It w a s        impossible             to    stop      them,       due

to t h e i r       numbers             and    the      circumstances                surrounding             their         entrance          and

the     duties          that          1 was      completing.              Ei'lderly p eo p l e             were       complainant               ot

the     intense          pressure             outside         and       some    of       the     injuries            they      had

sustained.               They          were      directed          towards          the P o l i c e        Room and            as    none

were     par t i ciuta r 1 y s e r i o u s ,             they were             directed,             rath er         than      escorted

swinging           of    fists          and      pushing           to    get    into       the       turnstile area                 and

through        i nto         the       ground.          The        a t m o s phe re was           very      tense and

aggressive              and       virtually            everyone          that       entered          stated          that      someone

was     going       to       be       killed      in the           crush       outside.

t h at     effe ct.             I could          hear        the       crowd        shouting         outside        and        it was

apparent         tha t          the     teams          had    gone           onto     the     pitch.,        Ihe    time        would     be

approximately                   3.00      p.m.         and    the        pushing          and aggression                 was

accelerated                by    the      fact         that       the        game     had    started.

whilst        helping            the      supporters               through            the    turnstiles,             1 noticed           that

the      pressure           had       suddenly           dropped..                  I was    unaware         of    the     reason why

as    I was      pre -oc cup ied with                        helping           the        supporters         through           the

turnstiles.                 As    I looked              through              I could        see     t hat    the     crowd        had

virtually             g one      and      that         some       supporters               had m o v e d     to the        sid es.        Only

a    few      continued           to      queue         to    hand           in t h e i r     tickets        and     the       turnstiles

slowed        down almost                   to a halt.

Wondering             at    the        reason          for    the        drop        in    crowd      pr e s s u r e ,    1 came        out

f rom      the    t u r ns t i 1e a r e a t o see                       the     tail       e nd   of a      c r ow d o f s u p p o r t e r s

running          into       the        crowd.           I soon           realised           that      tne    gates        had     been

opened        and      on       looking           at    them           I could        see     that       they were            badly     dented

and      distorted where                     they       had        been       either        pushed against                or     banged       on.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y          3,06        p.m.       I was           informed         that       there     haa        been a     pitch

i n v a s i o n a n d as          my attendance                        was    no     longer.requirea               at     the

turnstiles,                I attended              with           other       officers            from    serial/nl,            niaking my

way      to     the    pitch.               Together          with Detective                      Constables         Friend,

Titterton             and       Oakes,           I went           round       the     r i ght      s i d yr of    the     West       Stand

and      to     the     rear      of        the    goalposts                 in f r o n t            the W e s t     Stand.

As    I did,          I saw       t hat          the    c r o w d was^ surgi/fg a nd                     that     p^ojjjle w e r e

most       serious          was        to    the       left        side        of    the     goal p o s ts w h e r e           I could      see

 that      people          were        disfigured                 as    their        faces        were    pinned         to     the w i r e

meshing.              An    officer              pointed           to    one        stating        that     he w a s      dead and          on-

 looking,            it was           c l ea r    that        a number              were     already        dead and            others      were

 dying.

Some       of    the       pe o p l e       pinned           to    the       fence        had     vomit     on t h e m a n d         they

were      unable          to m o ve.             Their       skins           had     turned        to a       blue/purple            colo u r

and      their       e yes       were       lifeless.               A sm a l l         entrance          gate       ha d a l r e a d y        been

opened       some         te n    feet        away and Police                      Officers            were    pulling         supporters

o p      through          that        gate       in ord e r         to       relieve         the       pressure        inside        the

area.        Being         unable           to    enter          the     gate        due     to    the       number      of P o l i c e

already         there?           I positioned                myself           in f r o n t        of    the    fence       where         the

majority          were         being        c r ush ed.

Together          with around                 twenty         other           Police         Officers?          I tried         to    pull

the      fencing          forwards            o nt o    the       pitch.             Despite           the    substantial            f o rce

t h at    was     used?          it    could          not    be m o v e d          at all.             I then       climbed         onto       the

wire      fencing?             perched           on the          t op    section            and    bent       the    forward         spikes

b a ck    that       protruded              into       the       crowd.            Reaching            down    into      the    crowd?           I

managed         to     pull       s ome       youngsters                up    from      the       heaving       m a ss .       As    I

location          and a number                   of    supporters              had      been       pulled        through        the       small

gate      from       the       West      Stand and               pushed        o nto        the    pitch.           It a p p e a r e d        that

H i s Afodyw a s         discoloured                 a blue/purple                 colour

                     His       eyes         were     motionless              and      I was u n a b l e to f i n d              a

pulse.            I checked            both       his w r i s t      and     his      n e ck a n d       opened          his    eyes       to

check        for    dilating,               but    they    never        changed.              He    was       obviously             dead

and      t hi s    was    confirmed               by a d o c t o r      who       approached,             informed             me    that

he w as       a     doctor         and checked             the    same        as      I had a l r e a d y d one b e f o r e

saying        that       he    " had        gone a n d     to     le a v e     him".

I covered           his       f ac e    with a        red/biue/green                  jumper        and       returned          to w h e r e

the      gate      was    to a s s i s t          in the     removal           of     further         bodi es.            As    t hey

came      out      I checked            them       for    pul s e s     and       for     dilation            of    the    eyes

before        covering           their        faces,       whilst           they      laid     on the          pitch awaiting

their        removal          in due         course.        All        around Police                Officers,             ambulance

and      supporters            were         attempting          to     breath         life     back       into       the       victims

and massa ged             their         chests.

The      Police      presence               had    increased           at    t hi s     time       and    after          assisting           to

r e mo v e   a number            of     dead       bodies       from        the     stand,         I continued             to       check

the      bodies      that        appeared           to    have       a normal           or    near       to    normal          skin

colouring.               I was         aware       that    at     l e ast     three          doctors          were       among       the

victims,           confirming               which     bodies         were     too       far    gone       and       selecting

others        to a t t e m p t         to    resuscitate.               As    the       ambulances             attended             they

were      filled         particularly               with    s m all         children and              left         within       moments

of    their arrival.

Bodies       had     been        pulled           from what          can     only       be    described             as    a mass        of

dead      people         who     had        previously          remained               s t a n d i n g due to        the       pressure

that      was      holding        them        upright.            As    t h at         p r e s s u r e was r e l i e v e d ,        they

fell      into a t a n g l e d              mess    and    the       Police           O f f i c e r s i n s i d e the          stand       had

I tagged        his      body with                a sudden             death       label        marked with             my     details

to    sign       off    duty.                 •

■From my         duties       at      the    ground and                   position           at     the      turnstiles,              I can

state       t hat      the    pressure            on the             outside           of    the       turnstiles           was       building

up    considerably,                particularly after                           2-. 4 0     p »m . t h at      day.         As     the      time

approached             3,00      p.m.-' it w a s            c l ea r       that        the      cr o w d     surge       would        increase

and      t hat    injuries,            and most             definitely                 fatalities             by s u f f o c a t i o n          were

possible          at    the      Leppings          Lane          turnstile                entrance.            That        possibility

was      accelerated             by    the    roar          of       the       c r o w d as       either       the       teams        corning

on t o    the     pitch       or a near            goal,           which          encouraged                them    to     surge       forward

in f ear         of m i s s i n g      something              on the            field.

If    the      gates       had     not      been       ope n e d ,         I feel           certain          that    fatalities

would       have       been      found       on    the        outside             of      the     g r o u n d at     this        location,

The      opening        of    the      g a t e s wa s         essential                to a l l e v i a t e        t hat    possibility,

but      unfortunately,                no    one       c o uld        foresee             the     problem          that     would          be

caused         inside.

From      my     opinion         I believe             that          numerous             people        were       already         d e a d at

3.06      p.m.      when      I made         my w a y         in f r o n t          of      them       to    see    them        crushed

against          the    fence .            Some    had a l r e a d y              discoloured                bodies        and were

lifeless,           clearly           dead    by       that          time.         As       ti me      progressed,              J. c o u l d     see

people         changing          colour        in f r o n t           of me         in that            crowd.         It w a s        obvious

that      they were           dying         due    to       lack          of    oyxgen          and     it w a s     frustrating                 to

see      them and          being       unable          to     do a n y t h i n g            about       it    in t ime          to save

them,          I am     convinced            that        if      the       fence          could        have     been       o p e n e d at

3.06      pm.     t h e n at       least      a third                or    even        half       of    them       could        have       been

saved.

the      fence      wa s     most      definitely                a    contributory                  factor         which        led    to       the

unnecessary             death         of    peo p l e       who       had       entered           the       ground       early        in order

            beli ef,        due     to      the    late a r r i v a l        of    supjjrarters who               crushed        them         by

            overfilling             the W e s t       S t a n d are a s .

             In my     belief          I am       certain        that      sorp& of          the     peo p l e    were       dead       prior      to

            the     r ush    of     supporters             enteririg/t he a r e a a f t e r                 the    gates       had       been

             been    d e a d for         some      time     by 3 . 0 6       p.m.        One       observation            which         xs    clear

             considerable              unnecessary              loss    of      1ife.

                  Hillsborough Football Ground Incident - 1 5 th April 1989




           I am a Detective Constable in the South Yorkshire Police Force and I am presently
 stationed at Woodseats Police Station,Sheffield.


           At 8.30am on Saturday the 1 5 th of April 1989*1 commenced duty in full uniform at
 Woodseats Police Station,Sheffield,in relation to a football special duty at Hillsborough
 Football ground for the semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.


           I was transported together with other Police Officers,by a PSV double decker bus,
 to Hillsborough Football Ground.A briefing then took place in the North Stand area and the
 officers were given some packed refreshments.My duties were that of Serial 11.


           At approximately 11.15am that day,together with DC Friend,DC Oakes,DC Titterton,
 PC Thickett,PS Edwards,! went to the inside of the Leppings Lane turnstiles to patrol the
 inside of the turnstiles numbered 1 to 8 .


           The supporters could be seen through the turnstiles and mounted Officers were on
 duty at that location outside the ground.Police Officers were also positioned on the outside
 of the turnstiles to carry omt'selective searching' for prohibited articles.


           I positioned myself on the inside of turnstile number   ,after a high hinged fencing
 had been opened.This prevented supporters entering the West stand area and a portable barrier
 fence was placed there by the ground staff.This enabled two more turnstiles to be brought into
 use to allow the supporters into the North Stand ares of the ground.


           At 12 noon,the turnstiles were opened and a number of supporters came througn to
 get themselves a good position in the ground.A number of Sheffield Wednesday supporters came
 to the turnstiles asking if a programme could be purchased and passed out to them.Those
 requests were made.


           As the time passed,the turnstiles became much busier and problems were being caused by
 the supporters.As the tickets were being handed ir, to the turnstile operators,fane from behind
 were snatching the tickets and trying to use them again to get into the ground.Other fane were
 jumping over the barriers and claiming that thev had handed their tickets in but that was
 not so.


           Due to these problems,! stood inside the turnstile areas and supervised both boothes
 at that entrance,numbers    and   .1 could see the crowd outside and at approximately 2.30pm I
 could see that the crowd outside had swollen considerably.The Police Officers outside were
 experiencing difficulty in searching due to the numbers and an obvious pressure was being
 caused in the surge forward to the turnstile entrances.


           At approximately 2»b0pm the turnstiles entrances were jammed and a number of youths
 entered with tickets to the West stand area.It was impossible to direct them back and to the
correct turnstiles due to the supporters that had moved forward and fill their space as they
entered   the turnstile gate.They were allowed through and directed through      the portable barrier
fencing   to the appropriate area of the ground.


          At that point,numerous fans were scrambling over the walls and into the ground and it
was impossible to stop them.I detained two and attempted to eject them from the ground but it
was not   possible to send them back through the turnstile areas.It was notpossible to put them
through the large gates to Leppings Lane as the supporters were pushing against it.Had it been
opened they would have spilled inside.


          It was not practical to take these two to the Police room as the depletion of Folice
Officers would have caused more problems than could have been benefitted and the two were
allowed to enter as a paying supporter*Further youths entered with tickets and it was quite
obvious that they had been in an intoxicated state but it was not possible to arrest or eject

these frorr the ground either.


          Looking through the turnstiles I could see that the mounted officers were stuck solid
in a compacted crowd which was surging forwards and stretching for some considerable distance.
The Folice woman on the outside of the turnstile had been pinned to the wall by the force of th<
crowd and she was pulled into the turnstile and into the ground.


          As the supporters continued to come through the turnstiles,I could see that some of
them were clearly injured.Some had obvious limps,others were clutching at parts of their own
bodies and showing signs of pain on their faces.As they came through the gates they expressed
releif due to having escaped from the pressure on the outside of the ground.


          I could see that the people on the outside of the ground were clearly distressed and th<
a great deal of suffering was being experienced.Being inside the turnstile area 3 started to
pull r>eople through the turnstiles to attempt to alleviate the outside pressure.As some came
through they were in poor conditions and were taking their first full gasp of air as they
entered the turnstile space.A number went to an internal fence in the turnstile area and stood
for a while to recover before making their way to the North Stand part of        the ground.


          The stream of supporters continued to come over the wall and     into the West stand
entrance to the ground and I continued to pull supporters through the turnstiles.A number of
these did not h*ve tickets but there       no «sy they c~uld be sent   u s c k ,ejected   or arrested.
These was no other course of action but to let them through and into the ground.As I pulled
some of the spectators through,the turnstile staff were unable to take the stuB!» off the ticket)
fast enough and some went through without handing them in.The turnstiles would have registered
the numbers going through.


          Throughout all this,children as young as seven or eight years old were jumping over the
turnstiles,claiming to be with parents and running through into the ground.It was impossible to
stop them due to their numbers and the circumstances surrounding their entrance and the duties

that I was completing.Elderly people were complainant of the intensepressure         outside and some

of injuries they had sustained.They were directed towards the Police       room and as none were
                                                                                              w            :
 particularly serious,they were directed rather than escorted to the Police room and first aid
 area.


            As the time neared three a' clock,the pressure behing the outside crown was at its
 worse.People were screaming and fighting was taking place,although limited and being nothing
 more than the swinging of fists and pushing to get into the tunBstile area and through into
 the ground.The atmosphere was very tense and aggressive and virtually every one that entered
 stated that someone was going to be killed in the crush outside.


           I did not have a radio issued to me for this duty but I was aware that a message had
 already been passed to the ground control room to that effect.I could hear the crown shouting
 outside and it was apparent that the teams had gone onto the pitch.The           time   wouldbe
 approximately 3 . Opm and the pushing and aggression was accelerated by          the fact that the game
 had started.


           Whilst helping the supporters through the turnstiles I noticed that the pressure had
 suddenly dropped.i was unaware as to the reason why as I was pre-occupied with helping the

 supporters through the turnstiles.As I looked through I could see that the crown had virtually
 gone and that some supporters had moved to the sides.Only a few continued to queue to handin
 their tickets and the turnstiles slowed down,almost to a halt.


           wondering at the reason for the drop in crowd pressure I came out from the turnstile
area     to see the   tail end of e crowd of supporters running into the crowd.I soon realised tnat
the gates had been opened and on looking at them I could see that they            were   badlydented and
distorted where they had been either pushed against or banged on.


          .Av approximately >*o6pm » was informed thnt x      , had been   b   pitch invasion and as rrv
attendance was no longer required at the turnstiles,I attended with other Officers from serial
11,making my way to the pitch.Together with DC Friend,DC Titterton and DC Oakes I went round
the right side of the west stand and to the rear of the goalposts in front of the West stand.


          As I did,I saw that the crowd was surging and that people were pinned to the perimeter
wire fencing.The place where it was the most serious was to the left side of the goalposts
where I could see that people were disfigured as their faces were pinned to the wire meshing.
An officer pointed to one stating that he was dead and on looking it was clsar that a number
were already dead and others were dying.


          Some ofthe people pinned to     the fence had vomit on them and they were unable to move.
Their    skins had turned to a clue/purple colour and their eyes were lifeless.A small entrance
gate had already been opendd some ten feet away and Folice Officers were pulling supporters
out through that gate in order to relieve the pressues inside the area.Being unable to enter
the gate due to the number of Police already there,! Ktxxxxsi positioned myself in front of the
fence wuere the majority were being crushed.


          Together with around twenty other police officers,I tried to pull the feneing forwards

           pitch.Despite the s^staatial force that was used.it could no, „e          oved at ali.l t_er.

protruded into the crowd.Peaching down into the crowd I managed to pull some youngsters up
 from the heaving mass.As I pulled them up by their arms they laid on the top of the fence and
 I threw them down to two Police officers who caught them as they fell.


         Superintenden Greenwood and Chief Superintendent Nesbit were at that location and
a number of supporters had been pulled through the small gate from the West stand and pushed
onto the pitch.It appeared that these were unaware of the reason for them being brought out
of the crown.They were hostile and a number of blows were made towards Police officers before
they realised that they were oeing brought out to get to the dead and dying.


         A chain was made of Police to the gates and as bodies were dragged to the gate,the
dead were passed down the line and placed on the pitch adjacent to the goalposts.Those that
had a normal colour cut were not breathing were carried out immediately and either placed in
an ambulance or laid or the pitch for treatment.At approximately 3.15pns I carried a youtn I
now know to be the deceased Martin Kevin Travnor
                                   ) from the West stand.With another Police officer I dragged him
to the pitch and laid him down.


         His body was discoloured a blue/purple colour                                         LHis eyes
were motionless and I was unable to find a pulse.I checked both his wrist and his neck and
opened his eyes to check for dilating but they never changed.He was ooviouelv dead and this
was confirmed by a Doctor who approached,informed me that he was a doctor and checked the same
as I had already done before saying that he 'had gone and to leave him'.


         I covered hie face with a red/blue/grsen jumper and returned to where the gate was to
assist in the removal of further bodies.As they came out I checked them for pulses and for
dilation of the eyes before covering their faces whilst they laid on the pitch awaiting their
removal in due course.All around Police Officers,ambulance and supporters were attempting to
breathe life back into the victims and massaged their chests.


         The Police presence had increased at this time and after assisting to remove a number
of dead bodies from the stand,I continued to check the bodies that appeared to have a normal
or near to normal skin colouring.I was aware that at least three doctors were among the victims
confirming which bodies were too far gone ana selecting others to atterriDt to resuscitate .As
the ambulances attended they were filled particularly with small children and left within
moments of their arrival.


        Bodies had been pulled from what can only be. aescribed as a mass of dead'people who
had previously remained standing due to the nressuree that were holding them upright.As that
pressure was relieved they fell into a tangled mess and        the Police officers inEide the stand
had some considerable difficulty in s e p er at mg them.


        The arrival of other Police officers enabled me        to return to the bodies,comfort
grieving fans and relatives and at that point I started        to carry the Advertising boards up to
the grassed pitch area.One piece was placed at the side of one of the bodies I had previously
removed.Martin Tjraynor.I then took notice of the clothing that he was wearing which consisted
 f* • ‘

one black Adidas trainer,a pair of white s o c k s , ^ u n d e r p a n t s , b l a c k track suit bottoms,
grey 'The Jam' tee shirt and the previously described jumper.He had an apparent age of 25
years,approximately 14 stone in weight.He had short ginger hair,blue eyes and a freckled
complexion.

          With assistance fror other people I placed him on the board and he was picked up and
with the assistance of Police and supporters he was carried at some speed across the pitch,
towards the Police room which I had alreadt established was the point where the dead were to
be taken.As I approached the Police room,I was directed into the gymnasium where the deceased

was carried into.


          On entering I was approached by Detective Superintendent who informed me that I was
being allocated to that body and that it was my responsibility until identification had been
completed.I took notice of the time at that stage and realised that it was now 3*40pm.The
body was removed from the board and positioned besides other bodies.At that point the* face
was covered over again due to further supporters entering the gymnasium whilst assisting m
the carriage of other daed and preventing anyone identifying hiir> as being a member of their
family.At 4 .0 8 pn5 1 was approached by Dr Curpen who examined the body and certifeied it as dead.


          The bodies continued to come into the gymnasium and as time passed I was giver the

number 5 ? which was to relate to my dead youth.I searched hirr to establish his identity but
he had no personal property on him at all.His pockets were completely empty and he had no
                      $
wristwatch or other form of jewellery on him at all.
                on the rear of his left $and/wrist.It did not seem unusual for him not to have
any property                                   as he was pulled from the dead.It was also possifile for
hi~ coat to have been discarded or even used to cover someone else's face after death.


          1 tagged his uody with a sudden death label marked with my details and the bare details
that were known at that time of the deceased.A Gen/l8 form was also completed with those details
including a description and I cleaned tne face and head up for the purpose of photographing
him.Some time later the deceased was photographed and t»*e Polaroid snap was marked with the
Dody number before being taken J$r displaying to families for identification purposes.



          The body was cleaned,wrapped and placed into a pi istic uojy uag after it had been
clearly marked with the known details and mv details.I awaiting tor an identification frow
tne Titjotograrih from persons that had attended at the football match,Miat£x*» friends ana

relatives that had oeen brought to Sheffield by coach.


          A t 2 > 5 a m on Sunday the 1bth of April 1989,1 was informed that the photograph had been
picked out by a relative.The body was cleaned and prepared for identification purposes and
then wheeled to a viewing area for a proper            identification.I saw John Tra^nor (28.07*59
address as above) who positively identified the body to be that of his urother Martin Kevin
Traynor of the same address.The body was removed and 1 obtained personal details for the

Gen/l8 form.


          On completion the body was conveyed by the ambulance service to the Medico Legal centre
                                                                                              R Z & f
 ® n <Watery Street,Sheffield,arriving at 3.30am.Documentation proceedures were completed and
 after the body had been clearly marked I left it in the care of the mortuary staff.I xnvxxsri
 had obtained a disclaimer form to allow disposal of the clothing of the deceased.There was
 nothing of value amongst them.I then returned to the gymnasium before being returned to
 Woodseats Police Station to sign off duty.


           From my duties at the ground and position at the turnstiles,I can state that the
 pressure on the outside of the turnstiles was building up considerauly,particularly after
 2 .kOpm that day.As the time approached 3 .0 0 pm,it was clear that the crowd surge would
 increase and that injuries,and most definately fatalities by suffocation**** possible at the
 Leppings Lane turnstile entrance.That possibility was accelerated by the road of the crowd
 at either the teams coming onto the pitch or a near goal which encouraged them to surge
 forward in fear of missing soething on the field.


          If the gates had not been opened I feel certain that fatalities would have been found
on the outside of the ground at this location.The opening of the gates were essential to
axleviate that possibility but unfortunately no one could forsee the problem that would be
caused inside.


          From my opinion I believe that numerous peorle were aieardy dead at 3.06pns when I
made my way in front of them to see them crushed against the fence.Some had already discoloured
bodies and were lifeless clearly dead Dy that time.As time progressed I cou^d see people
                                                                           *
changing colour in front of me in that crowd.It was oovious that they were dying due to lack
of oxygen and it was frustrating to see them and being unable to do anything about it in time
to save them.I am convinced that if the fence could have been opened at 3 »0 6 pm then at least
a thira or even half cl' them could have been saved.


          The delay in being able to get to therr and oeing -unable to tear down       the fence     was

most definately a contributory factor which lead to the un-necessary death of people who had
entered the ground early in order to obtain a prime position to see the football matcn.They
did not do anything themselves to cause their own deaths but suffered,in my belief,due to the
latearrival of supporters who crushed        them Dy overfilling the West stand «pas.


          In my belief   i   am certain that some of the people were   dead prior to   the rush of

supporters e n t e r e m g the area after the gates had been opened,due to the colouration of the

bodies. They appeared to have been oead for some time by      3 *06 pm.une   observation which if clear

in hindsight is that the fer.ces should have emergency wire cutters in prominent positions to
exiirunate this happening again .The delay in getting, to the people crushed against the fence
has caused a considerable un-necessary loss of life.


          Such wire cutters could be placed out before every match and returned to a place of
safety on completio .Failing this,every alternate section of fenci g should be adapted to
enable it to De opened outwards in any emerge        y situation.*encing is unfortunately essential
in todays football supporters but death through suffocation can be prevented with a little
thought

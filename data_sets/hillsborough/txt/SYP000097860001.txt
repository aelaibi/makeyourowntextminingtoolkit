                 HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

                 Thank you for your letter of the 28th April drawing my attention
                                                           gy^e^lPes_plpp,Qlpt turnstlies_                                               .

                 Many thanks for sending it, and I nrnst say my immediate reaction is
                 that tnis should not have been disclosed in this way. I did, however
                 foresee that during the Hearing of the Official Inquiry t l suEjecT

                 ■f?              available for press and public consumption. I see
                 the matctT^will f * at the ^uestlon °f the policing arrangements at
                 the match will focus to some extent on A.C.P.O. guidelines.

                PhilliM     1H,’ \ ^ evitably arise during the Hearing with David

                Phii^L f                L       certainly be looking to you and to David
                Phillips for some guidance in the future as I am anxious that Lord
                Justice Taylor hears the authentic voice of the police in respect of
                policing at football matches.

                ®!„tu^ ns t °     l«t.r, I will certainly ensure that your comments
                are the subject of discussion with Lord Justice Taylor.

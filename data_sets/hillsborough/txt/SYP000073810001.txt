                        Stadiurn.             The    briefing               was    given      by    Inspector              Pheonix,             Dog    Section,

                        South          Yorkshire         Police.
     About      1Q3Q       hours            the      same    date         I       commenced            patroy         with       Inspector

     Pheonix         and       a    South           Yorkshire            PC       dog       h a n d ! e r . </ /? hr o u g h o u t    the       day    we

     maintained            a       patrol           for   approach                roads        to    Hillsborough,                monitoring

     both      Liverpool              and       Nottingham               Forest             supporters.               We    also      kept       a

     constant            check        on     public         houses            near          the     football          ground.




     During         our    patrol            I saw        that       the          public          houses       situated           near      yfte

     Liverpool            coach          park        appeared            to       be    very        busy.        People          were bil l i n g

     about      on       the       pub      car      parks       and      were          also        queueing          to    enter/the

     p remises.




     On   the       roads          leading           from    the         Liverpool                coaches        to    Hillsborough

     Stadium         a    supermarket                 was    selling               alcohol           to    supporters.                The

     supporters            were          then        sitting         on       a    grassed           embankment             outside         the

     supermarket               consuming              the    alcohol.                   Both        the    public          houses       and      the

     supermarket               were         very      busy       throughout                   our     patrol.

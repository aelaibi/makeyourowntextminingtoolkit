Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH : ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I attach a copy o f a letter dated 7 October received from HFSG. It is in direct
response to the question raised by me as to whether the Prosecution intended to call
Roger Houldsworth as a witness.

This response causes us great concern for it shows that the Prosecution may seek to
rely on discredited witnesses and that even at this stage they may not have disclosed
the full extent o f their case to us.

This information seems to reinforce the points made earlier.

Yours faithfully

       Dear Sirs

       Adlington v Murray: Adlington v Duckenfield

       Thank you for your letter of today’s date.

           You ask whether we will call Roger Houldsworth as a witness. I cannot help you about
           particular names at present, I am afraid, but I can tell you that we shall be serving a number of
           statements o f other witnesses, some o f whom have not given evidence to any o f the previous
           inquiries, and some of whom have given only limited evidence to a previous inquiry. You will,
           I am sure, appreciate the problems of collating evidence and selecting witnesses fairly, in a
           case in which so many police witnesses have given more than one version of events in their
           statements, and in which previously unknown facts and fresh evidence continue to be disclosed
           to the prosecution.

           The prosecution will, of course, bear your request in mind, and will seriously consider requests
           on behalf of either defendant that, for bona fide reasons, a particular witness should be called
           by the prosecution in order to be cross-examined.


           Yours faithfully

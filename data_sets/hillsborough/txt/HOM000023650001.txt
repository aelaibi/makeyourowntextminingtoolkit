                                  On Saturday 9th December 1989 I carried out a full briefing
                             of Sector Commanders in the Lecture Theatre at 11 am when details
                             of the Operation Order were fully outlined and contingencies for
                             dealing with visitors without tickets was discussed. In short
                             visitors without tickets were not to be allowed inside the ground
                             but to remain supervised outside within the sterile area.

                                  I arrived at the ground at 12.30 pm and conmenced duties from
                             the command cabin. I also issued a Police pocket set to the Club
                             becretary^and discussed actual arrangements. The gates were opened


                                  From the ConTnand Cabin it was evident that my resources inside
                             the ground were depleted especially supervision of Block 'C'
                             because extra resources had been re deployed to Crathome to assist
                              ith the reception of visiting coaches. However, at this time I was
                             satisitied that the Policing operation was in accord with the
                             requirements of the Taylor Report.

                     I instructed that any further Leeds United fans identified in the
                     Hoigate End must remain there and notified Chief Inspector DALE
                     to relay that instruction to Police Officers and Stewards in the
                     Hoigate End; By this time it was becoming increasingly obvious
                     that a considerable number of Leeds United fans had been able to
                     purchase tickets for the Hoigate End. I contacted the Club
                     Secretary Mr HUGHES and discussed the matter with him pointing out
                     that the Leeds United supporters in the Hoigate End were a potential
                     source of disorder and I requested that I be allowed to re direct
                     Leeds supporters from the Hoigate End into Block 'B'. After some
                     discussion he agreed. However, we both acknowledged that this was
                     an unsatisfactory arrangement because of the lack of segregation
                     facilities or other spectator requirements, especially lack of '
                     toilets. Furthermore, confrontation with Middlesbrough supporters
                     was a distinct possibility.

                          At 2.30 pm a second convoy of 16 coaches arrived outside the
                     ground at a time when many home supporters were congregating at
                     the Clive Road junction and as the second convoy with Leeds^United
                     supporters made their way along Ayresome Park Road across the
                     Clive Road junction they had to run the gauntlett of Middlesbrough
                     fans. Superintendent JONES was required to seek assistance from
                     Mounted Branch Officers to secure the situation and prevent disorder
                     between rival fans.

                     'tv  AS.u1CfeSrf,f time’ 3 1X0 aPProached 1 continued to monitor Block
                         on the CCTV to ensure ground safety and at this time there was
                     no evidence of overcrowding or spectator stress and there was
                     adequate space on both sides of the terraces to cater for the Leeds
                     fans travelling to the ground on the remaining coaches although by
                     this time a number of spectators, especially families belonging to
                     the Leeds United Families Club were standing at the front of the
                     terrace reducing access along the front of Block 'D'. However, at
                     this time I had no means of knowing the exact number of spectators
                     occupying Block 'D'.

                            I was conscious that there was still a group of approximately
                     65 Leeds United supporters with Hoigate End tickets waiting in the
                     w u T T O m f 63 outside Block ’D ' under the supervision of Inspector
                     WHITFIELD serial awaiting a decision as to whether they would be let
                     into the ground.

                         Meanwhile because of the congestion caused by Leeds fans
                    blocking the top of the stairway leading to Block 'D', despite a
                    request from the Police Cabin to move forward, Leeds fans arriving
                    at this time were being led by Police Officers down the sterile
                    area between Blocks 'C' and ’D ’ and into Block ’D ’ by a gate
                     towards the front of Block 'D' in the side railings, which was
                     controlled by a Steward

              At 9.15 a.m.             my s e l f   and other           dog       handlers were          briefed and given our

              o r in our o p i n i o n was all                    quiet,       was    public       order       patrol    at Woodhall

              pat r o l l e d on foot           together          from the N o r t h            side    to the S o u t h side and

              back as W o o dhall             is the     usual          con g r e g a t i n g    place    for    rival    supporters

              travelling           the    country.        We had             cause    to war n several            Notts Forest

^ < /y       supporters            of their          conduct       other          than this,       we had no        incidents.

              The       supporters        in q u e s t i o n had been d r i n k i n g and were                    boisterous

                                                                                                                           R 1.52

 At 3 p.m.          we    returned            to our       van to take              our    packed      lunch as Woodhall

 was    clear       of supporters.

 At 3 . 1 0 p . m ,      we       h e a r d the      call    sign         ’O p e ra t i o n Support*          to

'Hi 11 sfaor oughi*'          I    clarified with                *X S *    if this         i n c lQde^ us at Woodhall

 a'tt'd they said,            "YES".          W.e then made               our way to H i l l s b o r o u g h .

 W hile we were            trave 1 1 i ng to the                 gr o u n d     ’XS'      called      up other       dog

 h a n dlers     to a t t e n d gate            ’O ’ .

 At this       time       I was       under         the    i m p r e s s i o n there was a large                   scale

 disturbance             of some         kind       in the       ground due            to the amount           of dogs that

 were    being        requested.               We    entered        by the          city and        tagged     onto       two

 fire    tenders         w h i c h were         clearing a path through the                            slow moving

 traffic.

 We a r r i v e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 .30                p.m.      and    parked our

 vehicles        at      gate      ’0*    where       other       dog vans were                 parked.       Traffic was

 more    or    less at a s t andstill                      and     large        numbers         of s u p p o r t e r s were

 leaving       the       ground.          IV along wit h P o l i c e Co n s t a b l e Ba r b e r                    was    in

 possession           of a personal                 radio and         I h eard wit h great                  difficulty,

 over    the     noise        of     suppo r t e r s w h i st l i n g           and jeering           to take       our dogs

 into    the gr o u n d and myself and Police                                 Con s t a b l e    Barber      then      took     our

 dogs along wit h                 other       officers       and      their         dogs    into gate         ’O ’ .      We then

 took    up a p o s i t i o n on the                 pitch       in front           of the S pion Kop.                 I. then

 saw a string             of P o l i c e       O f f icers along              the    pitch at the West               Stand.

 While     all      this was          taking         place       there was a large                  number     of

 supp o r t e r s     on the         pitch      in excess           of 200          running about           on the        pitch.

 I then saw Police                  O f f i c e r s and s u p p o r t e r s          carrying         persons,       some

 moving,       some      motionless,                towards       gate        * 0 ’ on m a k e s h i f t    stre t c h e r s and

 it was a p p a r e n t           that    some were          dead.            A d isturbance           then broke          out       on

 our    left     in the N o r t h S tand and several                             officers         appeared         out    of the

 cordon an d a p p e a r e d             to    pull       someone         out    of the         crowd.      This       part     of

 the    crowd then became                     restless an d fearing a further                            pitch      invasion
                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                      R152

   from that area,                  my s e l f and other          o f f icers    m oved to        cover      the N orth

   S t a n d w i t h i n 20 feet             of the     cordon of officers.

   While       stood there            a red coloured              “S ony Walkman*            cassette stereo

   d i r e c t i o n of the N o r t h St^lnd.                                         ,r_

   ■While stood there                 it was        obvious       that     the a t t itude        of }he      crowd was

   one of a g g r e s s i o n towards                each other and the Po l i c e and from many

   years       experience            at     this    type   of     football       match,        I just      cons i d e r e d    it

   the       normal       behaviour.

   There       were       various         radio m e s s a g e s    of fighting             outside     the    ground      in

   Penistone             Roa d and H i l l s b o r o u g h Park          area with officers                being     deputed

   there,          all    this      while     the    ground was          being       empt i e d and while           bodies

   alive and             dead were          still    being      carried away.

   A fter      the       ground      began to        clear      I re q u e s t e d that we          be a l l o w e d to

   return to W o odhall,                    fearing    further          c o n f r o n t a t i o n there.      This was

   granted.              We a r r i v e d    back at Woodhall              at 4.30         p.m.   and took         up public

   order       patrol        on the S o u t h side.               There was          only one       incident at this

   time at the serv i c e                   stat i o n where       Liv e r p o o l    jibes were made amongst

   two       bus    loads      of    s u p p o r t e r s w h i c h we    nipped       in the      bud.       Resuming         off

   duty at S . 15 p.m.



   Apart       from the          fatalities          I do not       think       the f a n s ’ b e h a v i o u r was any

   differ ent            from an y        other m atch of          this     scale      I    have a t t e n d e d   or the

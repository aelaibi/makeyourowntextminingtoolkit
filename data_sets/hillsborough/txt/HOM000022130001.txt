Dear Sir

Hillsborough

As you are aware, we act on behalf of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club with regard to the Public Inquiry and at the
hearing on the 28th April Lord Justice Taylor granted our
clients rights of representation.

It is our intention to submit witness statements we have
obtained   from   Club Officials and others to     both   the
Secretariat and to the west Midlands Police. We are of course
mindful of the direction of Lord Justice Taylor that oral
evidence will only be allowed where statements have been
submitted to the police inquiry.

We expect in due course to submit statements from any of the
Directors of the Club whose evidence is relevant, and also the
following s-

Witness                     Position Held

Graham Mackrell             Secretary
Douglas Lock                Security Officer
Alan George Smith           Physiotherapist
Dr William Eastwood of
Eastwood and Partners       Consulting Engineer to the Club
Roger Houldsworth           Electronics Consultant re CCTV
                            system
At the moment we are in the process of obtaining statements
from stewards and a full list will be provided together with
the statements obtained.

                                                       Cont*••
                                                     4th Hay 1989

We shall provide you with copies of statements and copies will
also be sent to Mr Whalley of the Secretariat.

v/e trust that the statements to be provided shortly will be
acceptable and you have no objection to the submission of the
evidence in this manner. However, if there is any problem in
this regard we would ask you to telephone our Mr 0 ‘Callaghan
to discuss the matter further.

We enclose a copy of the letter sent to Mr Whalley    confirming
the above.

We shall be grateful if you will supply us with a list of
deceased persons and a list of the injured, with whatever
detailed information that is available relating to extent of
injuries etc.

Yours faithfully



DAVIES ARNOLD COOPER

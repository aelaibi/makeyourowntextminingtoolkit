VALUATION OF SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS


Many thanks for your letter of 15 December 1989 enclosing a note
prepared by your colleagues on the above.  I have passed copies
to Lord Justice Taylor and his two Assessors. SHould they have
any further queries, I will contact the Scottish Assessor's
Association direct.

In the meantime, many thanks for your help and all the best for
the New Year.

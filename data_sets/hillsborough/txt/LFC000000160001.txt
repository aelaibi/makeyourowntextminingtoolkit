  To recipients of the full version of the F. A. Handbook




  Dear Sirs,


        Following the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor and
  discussions by The Football Association with their legal
  advisers, it is the view of this Association that safety at
  sports grounds is the responsibility of the individual club
  admitting the public to its ground in conjunction with the local
  authority, where a licence is issued and/or with the police and
  the fire and building authorities.


         It is considered inappropriate, therefore, for us to
  continue to carry a reference to crowd safety in the Appendix to
  the F. A. Handbook and we are advised to withdraw pages 342 to 345
  of the current edition.




                                                                                               Yours faithfully

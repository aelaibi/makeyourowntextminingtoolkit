       N/A.



Q16.   DESCRIBE THE SUPPORTERS BEHAVIOUR IN YOUR PUB BRIEFLY.



       When they came in I formed the opinion they were all drunk.

       At first I w a s n ’t going to serve them but I was entirely on

       my own and I feared for my safety.       Inside the bar they were

       boisterous and swore amongst themselves.       These Liverpool fans

       stole 18 beer glasses from my bar.       I watched them take them.        I

       did not say anything to them because      1 believed they may have

       turned nasty.     I was on my own.   I had no staff or regular

       customers with me.     I later found that those glasses were

       smashed on my car park.     The same people also stole £43.00 cash.

       This had been saved inside a whiskey glass which was on a shelf

       behind the bar.

       I have not reported these instances to the local       police.

       I may add that they were aged 16-26 yrs.       Only two were of

       16 yrs in appearance,    the rest were   18-26 yrs.   Every single o n e ;

       including 3 drivers,    was drunk.



 17.   IF YOU WERE AT THIS PUBLIC HOUSE FOR THE SAME MATCH IN

       1988, CAN YOU POINT TO ANYTHING THAT MADE THIS YEARS
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                D923

           EVENTS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT?



           Yes.   Last year 7 or 8 Liverpool fans were here.          They had a meal

           and were very good.

           This year,   I had 25 or so.     None of those I. have seen     before.

           Incidentally. the 7 or S from last year arrived after           thisg r o u p .

           Once again they were very well behaved.



           FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE OF FOOTBALL. MATCH CROWDS CAN YOU          GIVE

           YOUR VIEW ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF

           a) LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS

           b) NOTTINGHAM FOREST SUPPORTERS

           COMPARED WITH OTHER FOOTBALL TEAM SUPPORTERS.



           I have no experience with football       supporters with the

           exception of those I've described from Liverpool.



    Q19.   IF SUPPORTERS COACHES STOPPED AT YOUR PREMISES,          CAN YOU NAME

           ANY OF THE COACH COMPANIES AND FOR EACH ONE CAN YOU SAY WHAT

           TIME THEY ARRIVED AND WHAT TIME THEY LEFT?

           15 APRIL 1989?

        No damage was caused.     However,   when these 25 fans left I saw

        they were in a convoy of 5 cars.        They dumped about 60 lager

        and beer cans on my forecourt.       They included empty beer bottles

        and smashed pint pots.      I filled a black plastic bin liner with

        their mess.     It was strewn all around the car park.

        N/A.

        AND    CAN YOU ESTIMATE THE QUANTITY?



        No.



<326. DID YOU GO TO THE MATCH (IF Y E S ,    COMPLETE A SUPPORTERS
       QUESTIONNAIRE).



       No   „




Q27.   IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

       JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



       I think that the football authorities should be made to pay for

       this enquiry and put their house   in order.     I think that the clubs

       should have less police in ground and increase the stewards.        I

       don't think the police should have to put up with these problems.

       If my business was in trouble who would help me out?       Nobody

       probably.    It is about time the Football Association sorted these

       problems out.    I do not follow football.     Why should my taxes pay

       for a Football Association problem?    Will they pay for my

       financial   problems if I need help?

                                ft


             PARTIV OF THE PUBLIC ORDER ACT 1986: EXCLUSION ORDERS

             1.    You wrote to John Goddard on 4 July with advice on the
             proposed Home Office Circular on the exclusion provisions.
             The text will be amended accordingly.


             2.    You also suggested that the Circular might    be extended to
             remind the courts of their powers to make attendance centres
             orders.   We think that this would be a useful addition to the
             text and would like to take up your offer to supply a
             paragraph for the circular.

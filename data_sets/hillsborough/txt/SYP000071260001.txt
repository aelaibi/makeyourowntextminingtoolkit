            »                                                                             S 1552

                I would    like    to a d d        that    I think       t hat   we     should       be P o l i c e d   by    the

             Liverpool        Police         w h e n we    play a w a y    from home           and    they     knew     that       there

             was    going     to   be a       l a rge     crowd and       so     they    should       h ave    removed        the

             fences       pening       us    off    on    the    terraces.         The    gates       should      be m a d e       bigge

             which    lead      on to       the    pitch    but    mainly        I think       that     the L i v e r p o o l      Polic:

             should       be w i t h    us w h e n we       go a w a y    from     home.

             Finally       I would          like    to a d d     that    I still        have    my    full    ticket         and    it

             was    not    c h e c k e d at       the    ground.

                                                                                                                              SIGNED

            I am a qualified doctor with qualifications of MBCHB which is a

            Batchelor of Medicine and Batchelor of Surgery.                         I am at present

            working at Vhe Weston Park Hospital.

            On Saturday 15th April        1989 (150489),             I met Dr                              and

            Dr             at Hanarans bar at about                1.40pm (1340).      We th^n made our

            way t/ Sheffield Wednesdays football                    g r o u n d ^ We arrived/at the ground

            at ^bout 2.40pm      (1440) and entered the ground.                    There was no jj^eues

            outjside the Spion Kop end and we all went                      into the Spi jrtTK * e n d ,

            When we were standing        in the Spion Kop I could see to th / opposite

            s ide of the ground where the Liver pool supporters were in the West

            Stand.    At about 2.50pm      (1450)     I noticed a surge forward from the

            Liverpool      supporters   in the centre of JC n e West Stand terracing.                      The

            end pens on both sides of the centre pen was quite empty.                            In the side
                                                                                    PAGE        2
                                                                                    S2506

pens you could see complete bodies standing up, bj^fc^in the centre                      pens

all you could see was a mass of heads,                     Aftp*r the kick off and just

before the game was stopped, Nottinghajjp,'Torrest were attacking down

the right and the whole of the Liv**rpoo 1 supporters                  in the centre of

the stand seemed to surge f o r y & r d .           The next thi ng was a Liverpool

supporter runni ng onto t he/p itch and a Police Of f i ce r then went to the

referee and he took t h a r players off the pitch.                 About 10 minutes after

the game had been stcCpped, we saw a supporter being stretchered off

the pitch and taken between the North Stand and the Spion Kop.                       When

we saw this we realised that it was not a pitch invasion and that

people were injured and it was more serious than we thought.                       Myse 1f

and the doctors                  and              then made our way from the Spion

Kop terracing and we went to a Police Of f i cer a#d told him we were

doctors and could we give any assistance t p / X h a               injured.   We we re then

taken by Police Of f i ce rs out of the re^f of the Spion Kop and escorted

around to the gymnaslurn a r e a .             Wheo/we got to the open area near to

the gym we saw eight or nine people lying outside the g y m .                   All of

these people at this time w e y f e            injured.    We then found out and

attended to these injurec^peopie.                 There was two persons who I saw

i nj ured and from thei r/in j u r i e s        I could see they needed immediate

hos pi tal treatme nt . / 1 then went and tried to find an ambulance to
                           L
ferry them to hospital.             I found a man who I believe was a senior

ambulance man and I informed him of the seriously injured and he said

he would get them away to hospital                 next.     I then returned to assist

other injured pe rsons.            Mo re and more bodi es we re being br ought       into

this a r e a .   Some of them were already dead and we attempted to revive

them,   but they had been dead for/^uite a period of time and we could

not do a n y t ^ p ^ ^ m o i ^ ^ f or thenyf    We eventual ly moved into the gym and I

was asked if I would conFi/m who was dead by a senior Police Of f i ce r.

I confirmed this to h i m / b u t         I never certified any d e a t h s .   I then
                                                                          PAGE      3
                                                                          S2306

  ,      assisted the injured, who had been taken into the gym.    When the Fire

         Service attended we then obtained some basic equipment which we used

         to render mouth to mouth.    Local doctors then started to arrive and at

         about 4,45pm   (1643) we decided that we could leave, so we left the

         ground and made our way back to the car.

                                                                         SIGNED

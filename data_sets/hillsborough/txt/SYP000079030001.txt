              We     set out that m orning at about 9.30 am                                 (0930).       We travelled as a

               two      car group       I ’m not      sure who was            in the other             car except             for the

fact     that m any of them were                  policemen      in fact       I think    there was       three

cars.      We set        out    from my      cousins      home    in                 .    On    route    to

S h e f f i e l d we did stop at B u rt on W ood S e r v i c e s               to meet anot h e r       car we

d i d n ’t take     refreshment.

We    did have about a 1/S hour                    delay because         of traffic       but    I d o n ’t know

where     that was        but    that was the only delay                 I can remember.           On    route       I

d i d n ’t see any other           fans      drinking       but we had a can of            lager    each and

t ha t ’s all                            didn't      because      he was       driving.

We a r r i v e d at about         IS.45      pm    (1245)    I c a n ’t be to sure though,              we

parked at a garage               near    to the S h e f f i e l d Po l i c e Social        Club,    we were

about     10 to     15 minu t e s       walk      from the football            ground.

Ha v i n g a r ri ve d we saw a lot of police                    officers       lining    the    route to the

ground.         We d i d n ’t have       any escort         of specific         d i rections we knew

where we        needed to go and made                our own way.          On our way to the ground

I didn't        see any f i g hting          or disorder         or an y drunkeness            in fact the

fans     I saw were well           b eh a v e d and good humoured.

We a rr i v e d at       the L e p p in g s Ln t urnstiles a r e a at about S . S O                pm

(1430)     to S . 30      pm    (1430).        I saw mass        of fans       outside    the turnstile

ar ea    but    I did see        some    queues at the L e p p i n g s Ln standing                terrace

turns t i l e s    but they were          not      proper    queues as such they were all                     over

the     place     not    double    file      like at Liverpool            but wider       thicker       queues.

It was     quite        packed and there was a lot of                    pushing and shoving            going

on but     I d i d n ’t feel       at    that      time   I was    in any danger.              I did see

p o li c e m e n on horses        trying       to get     people       in queues     shouting at         people

to get     in orde r l y        queues and trying            to stop the         pushing and shoving.

There w a s n ’t muc h          room    I d i d n ’t see any signs             outside    the ground for

my    particular        t u rnstile      w h i c h was    t u r nstile    'B’»      I just went with

the     flow of the        crowd.        My friends         by this      time had s e p a r a t e d from me

because        one or two        of them were         in other         parts    of the ground       I was

wit h                    and            my     cousin outside          the turnstiles.            It was

At about 2 . 3 5          pm     < 1435^>/ 2.4 0 pm < 1440) I saw a gate open to my                             right

the    right       side of the L e p p in gs Ln standing                    terrace    turnstiles.          I

didn't      see who        opened          it.     A large    number       of fans a head         of me then

r ushed thro u o n         this gate and             I got    car r ied along wit h the             crowd

thro u g h that          gate    into       the yard       beyond.       I was with)____________ still at

this     time      but            my       cousin got       s e parated     outside    the       turnstiles

b ecause      the P o l ic e      outside          stopped              from going     through       the    police

horse,      one     of them,         cut     him off.        Whilst      outside     the    turnstiles          I did

see    some       fans    climbing          a w a l l over    to my      left of the L e p p i n g s Ln

s t a nding       terrace       t u r n s tiles.       I d o n ’t know whether          it was      unauthorised

e ntry or whet h e r            they were a v o i d i n g        the    crowd.

I didn't          see any one          help them an d          it was      only a couple          of fans.

Once     inside      the       ground       I wa i t e d w ith                    in the yard to           look for

my    cousin                    We d i d n ’t find him so at about 2 .45                    pm    (1455)    we

d eci d e d to fo l l o w the              other    fans    through the tunnel.

We    didn't       see an y signs            to our m atch viewing             point we      did see        the

tunnel      and fans           going    throu g h / i t     so we f o l l o w e d them.      We did have        free

passage       thro u g h the t un ne l / a n d at the              pitch end of
                                        /

t urned to our            r i q htv-fnT,o p& n 3        1 did see        po l i ceman and stewards at                 the

entrance          to the       tunnel       and also at the e n trances              to the West S tand but

no d ir e c t i o n s as        such were          given.     I d i d n ’t witness         any disorder          or

any other          incidents         betw e e n my entry          point     to the ground and my match

v iewing      point and          I d i d n ’t witness any              c o n s u m p t i o n of any alcohol       in

the ground.              Everything          was    still    quite      good natured as far as              the

fans were          concerned.

Having      ente r e d     pen 3,       still       with                  , we found       it quite

a few yards           from the           perimeter       fence to the          right    of the goal.

V e r y q ui c k l y the       pen star t e d to fill               up wit h fans from behind and                      I

was    star ting       to get        pushed forward towards                  the     perimeter       fence.

I was        still    with                           at this time and was             getting      very     crushed.

Ve r y soon         people about me were                 screaming an d shouting about

the    crushing        taking            place    to the       police    on the      pitch side of the

perimeter           fence.      I        was    being    crushed      from all       sides m a i n l y     from

be h i n d and e v e nt ua ll y                      decided h e ’d climb over            the     perimeter         fence

and get out.             I couldn't             do    it because       I was    so crushed my arms were

pinned to my sides a n d my face an d fronts                                of my body were            pressed

hard ag ai n s t       the     perimete r            fencing .

I w a s n ’t aware        of the          game,       starting      or ending        just sufferin g          from the

continual           crush.

I think        I was     bej/ng          crus hed for about           15 minutes and at about 3 .15                        pm

(•1515)       the    pressure            e ase d off.         I m a n a g e d with   other fans aro u n d me               to

get some         k i ds/over        the     fencing and when             it slacked off one              fan told me

to get out.            3\ c o u l d n ’t I just had not got                  the breath,          s t r e n g t h or

e n e r gy    to get out over               the fence.           I becfrfie aware       that at        somewhere            in

the    fence a gate            had been opened and f4ns were getting                              through and

after        a few minu t e s
                                                                /
                                     1 made my way Jfo the gate and                     left the         pen onto

the    pitch.         There was a large                 cVowd on the         pitch at      this      time and          I

then    became aware            of bodies             Lying on the        pitch tended to by fans and

police.          I was    in a daze aryu. quite                  shocked,      I c o u l d n ’t u n d e r s t a n d what

had happened,            but    r e a lise d         I could get       in the way of the work                 that

was    going        on so I went           back       into    pen 3 and     sat down and w a i t e d and

tried        t o re c over.

I later        got back        onto       the    pitch,       I w a n t e d to help so muc h but              it was

very    crowded still               so    I went       back    into   the    pen 3 again to            recover.            I

r e a lised      I c o u l d n ’t find                           or my    cousin             so     I decided then

that    the best         thing       to do was          to ask a policeman about                  eme r g e n c y

deta i l s     incase       they were        hurt.       I did see a p o l iceman who                c o u l d n ’t

hel p and a d vi se d me            to speak        to an a m b u l a n c e man but          I c o u l d n ’t find

one.    I thought           the    best    thing       to do was     to wait at the               car so at about

4.00     pm    (1600)       I left     the ground and w a l k e d             to the       car™

At about 4.3 0          pin (1630)         I met             and              who    returned and we then

went     into the       police        club to find out             if any of our friends we re dead

or    injured.         We    found     out      that A ndy D E V I N E was          in hospital       and

established           he was       going     to stay      in hospital.              Other    people     in our

g roup made a rr a n g e m e n t s         regarding       his     relatives and at about 9 pm

(2100)        that    night were          returned       to Liv e r p o o l    as there was          nothing

more that could be done.                                                               •




              I d i d n ’t get an y specific              in juries     from the exper i e n c e            but       did

suffer        pains    i n m y 1e g s , c h e s t' a n d face due             to the crush.




I d i d n ’t witn e s s a n y t hi ng           that    I could     consider         to be        a factor      in the

deaths        or    injuries and as             far as any views          or obs e r v a t i o n s as       to how

the    incident was           h an d l e d after        the m a t c h was      stopped all          I can say          is

I d o n ’t blame a n y o ne          in particular.              I did see a few police who

appeared           unsure    of what       to do once        they    realised something               had gone

very wrong.            I think       everyone          fans and     police      could have          handled

t h e m s el ve s    better,       I knew some          police and      fans did good work                that day.

 I d i d n ’t get       involved          not    because     I d i d n ’t want        to    I didn't      want        to

get    in the way.l               I feel     what      is vital     to this         inquiry       is the fact

that    the venue was wrong and that L iv e r p o o l                         fans    should have         been

given     the other          end of       the ground e s p e c i a l l y as          it should have           been

k nown the numbers                of e x p e c t e d to go to such an               important match.

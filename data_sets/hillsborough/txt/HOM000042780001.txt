         Dear Sir,

         Re: Inquiry Into Hie Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

         I refer to your letter of the 7th February, the contents of
         which I find to be most disturbing.

         How is it you can justify criticising me for giving VIP
         treatment to convicted fans on the basis of newspaper reports,
         without having the courtesy to try and ascertain the facts.
         To personally condemn me on the basis of newspaper reports
         is completely unacceptable.

         I must therefore at this stage, ask whether you are prepared
         to render an apology.

         Tours faithfully,




         D.J. Sharpe -•

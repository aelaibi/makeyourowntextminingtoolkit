to the m at c h using           tickets      for N o t t i n g h a m F _ o r e s t end - the S pion K o p .

This was        that we would keep for              their      s ole use a triangle              of t e rracing

p n the ext reme north corner of the *Ko p * and retain them there through

rthe match,, and not move                them to L e p p i n g s Lane.

There were        two m ain       reasons     for this      decision,         the first         is that        the

are a was       easy to      isolate and to keep under                 police      control       because          of

the     r est ricted access         to    it over a footbridge.                This made          it easy for

us to m a i n t ai n the        segregations,        between Liverpool               and N o t t i n g h a m

Forest.

The     other    reason was        that from our         previous       experience at             large     scale

matc h e s we were aware            that     there was      no spare         capacity on the Leppings

Lane     terraces -        pens    1 to 7 inclusive.             Consequently            it was      not

practical        to   consider mov ing          the L i verpool        fans     from the Kop area to

the Leppings Lane             terraces       because     it w o u l d have        created o v e r crowding

in that area and             possibly      led to     pressure.

A l t ho ug h both factors were              relevant,      the a v o idance         of over c r o w d i n g

was     probably the more           dominant       one   for    both of us.           ,1 am aware          that

t his action was           in contra d i c ti on to the Police Order                     for    the m atch

s i g n e d by either MR J AC KS ON ACC             o r C h i e f S uper i n t e n d e r.t DUCK ENF IE L D .

But     this    was a practical            d e c i s ion made    by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G R E E N W O O D            j

feased on       e x perience and operational               j u d gement with which               I concurred.

It follows        from my       concurring wit h the decision,                   that     I i nstructed the
                                                                                                                             <

Wh en    I m en t i o n   e x perience at H i l l s b o r o u g h     I have a l r e a d y said          I was         the

               lack of any spare             capacit y on these      terraces when all      the tickets

              a l l o w e d under     the S a f et y Certificate,      were    sold.   During   part    of thxs

               time S u p e r in te nd en t G R EE N W OO D was    both an    Inspector and Chief       Inspector

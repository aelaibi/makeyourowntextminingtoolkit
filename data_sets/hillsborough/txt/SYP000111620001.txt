of us then m o ve d off on a f a m i l i a r i s a t i o n tour                 of the      immediate area

for the benefit             of the M e r s e y s i d e   officers.           At this     time    there were

no s upporters            of note around,         and the t urnstiles were                  open.      We

c o mp le ted this tour           of the a rea and         returned to the L ep pi ng s Lane

t u r n s ti le area.

Due    to the     fact      that    horses are w or k e d          in pairs      normally,      and         that. 1

attention       to L ep pi n g s Lane and C at ch ba r Lane vicinity.                         The horse            I

was    riding     "BANUM"         is a young      horse        only having       been    in the

d epa rt me nt 6 months,            and    I felt that          crowds       later    in the day may

become     too m uc h       for him to       contend w ith so my               position on the

a p p r o a c h to the      rec ep ti on area w o u l d         be a better          duty to work.            PS

d i rect ly    inside       the    busy t urnstile area.

PS Thomas and PS S m i t h             remained together at the turnstiles,                            PC

Grunhill       and PC S t a n b r i d g e went       off       in a pair and a g a i n toured                the

area.

T. then     pat ro ll ed the a r e a alone           for appro*.             15 minu te s    then returned

to stand w it h           the two S e r g ea nt s an d the t w o M er se ys id e             offi ce rs who

had by this time also                returned.            We    remained       in this      position for

sometime.         No      problems arose w i t h the a p p r o ac hi ng              fans the       usual

a s s i s t a n c e was    given d irecting        them to their              correct    entrance           gate

number,       man y fans       seemed to be        looking at the              “gangway      letter"         on

their     tickets a nd not the t ur nstile                     entrance       letter.

As time       passed an d the number              of a p p r o a c h i n g    fans    increased,        all were

d ir ec t ed to the         turnstiles,       we each shou te d to them                 instru ct in g        them

about a p p r o x i m a t e l y    one hour.         The a t mo sp he re was     good-humoured

without      problems.            However,      I noti ce d that a n u m b e r of fans were

carrying many          cans       of beer and E litre            bo 11 1 es of   1.aae r / bee r .     I saw

a foot     Inspector,         Inspector Sykes,            taki ng ,t he     beer from a number of

fans,     but due      to the ever           increasing      numbers       this task     became

impossible.           I noti

of fans      in general.            It a pp e a r e d to me that they were a f f e c t e d by

alcohol      c o n s u mp ti on and becoming more               hostile.      The    c o m b i n at io n of

drink and a sunny day seemed to be taking                             effect,       I c on ti nually

a d v i s e d fans    that    they would not           get   into the ground drunk,                many

ignored me and             I was    not    in a position to do much about                  it.      Many were

corner     of L ep pi ng s Lane           bridge.       I c ontinually a d v i s e d fans          that they

would not get          into the ground drunk,                   I made a number         of sweeps         of

the footpaths          tp    clear     them from        in front      of the shop to the             first

m o v e d away,      the    crowd    closed        in behind.        Due   to a radio m e s sa ge         I

became aware          that a Special           T r ai n had a r r iv ed and the fans arrival

was     imminent.          The arrival        area of the        fans was heavily          congested

between Vere R o a d and the shop also a considerable                               number    of

approaching          fans all       the way along L ep pi ng s Lane.                I a sk ed Sgt.

Thomas     if we      could sweep the are a t og ether                 in order      to clear       the

f o ot pa th approach.             After a couple of minutes                this we did just           prior

to the arrival             of sight       of train escort.           When the escort was             some

30 yards a way we made a further 2 full                         sweeps      of the area

traffic was       still     able to pass          thro ug h on the       road behind me.             Some

3 0 0 fans were      in the       train escort           but ea si ly as man y more          fans had

b§^sn collected along             the a p p r o a c h    route.

the M i d d l e w o o d R o a d dir ec ti on over         the L ep pings Lane Bridge,           I

estimate     nearly       1,000 fans at         this      time.     It was as if we had

s u dd en ly become       swamped.        There a pp ea r e d     to be few foot        officers           :i.n

the v i ci ni ty the       bridge was becoming               heavily    congested.        As   the

horses      on the train escort              being      led by Ins p. Davis went          into the

"terrace                  t urnstile a r e a " , I noti ce d that P o l i c e w o m a n 1 56 Main

crowd in the terrace              t urnstiles area.            I therefore      joined with

PW    136 Main.      At    this    time the       road was        becoming   bloc ke d w it h        fans

from the Br id ge         up to Catch ba r Lane             interrupting     the flow of traffic,

and    pavements     becoming        blocked w ith L iv erpool           s upporters who         I

u n de r st oo d to be non ticket             holders.        I a s s u m e d they were      non ticket

holders,     as they made          no attempt           to a p p r o a c h the turnstiles.          Some of

them stated they were wait in g                 to meet       their    ’m a t e s ’ coming     in private

cars.     The m a j o r i t y    of these      people wre also          in p ossession of a can

A fight was       taking        place outside a gas s ho wr oo m at             the   crossroads            of

this was al mo st         impossible.          A furt he r     d isturbance     of fighting

officers.          We a g a i n       retained the flow of traffic.                    What    had # few

our    presence.

At approx.         2.45     pm an a s si st an ce           call was made         from my

Colleagues         for any m o u n t e d a s s i s t a n c e        to the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.            At   this       point    I was       p o si ti on ed at the      corner of the

B ri dg e a p p r o x i m a t e l y    15 to 20 yards a wa y from the C Gate Terr ac e

T ur ns tiles.         I saw that            the whole are a from the t ur ns t i l e s              outwards

was a solid block               of     people    s t re tc hi ng     out     into L ep pi ng s Lane-        The

whole a rea        seemed       to be bloc ke d w i t h no movement                  through the

t urnstiles.           I saw m any fans            climbing         over     the walls      above    the

turns ti le s       into    the gruond.            I saw Ins p. H.            Davis who was         nearest       to

me    c o mp letely s u r r o u n d e d       by the    crowd his          horse having       difficulties

in standing          due    to the weights             of    people       pushing a ro u n d him.          I saw

my other        colleagues at the turn st il es                     also     surro un de d tigh tl y       packed

by s u p po rt er s      pushing        their     horses      backwards.          It was a fright en in g

sight a crowd of t housands                     frantically          pushing      forwards w h ic h seemed

to be e asily k no ck in g              half a ton of horse                off   its feet.

I nspector D avis           b ec ko ne d      for myself and PC               156 Main to      join him,      but

as we t ried to do              so the        crowd were           pushing     so tightly     they

 h ys i ca l ly    pre ve nt ed our           access     into the          crowd by p ur posely pushing

at the       horses      chests.         I    yjen

a r r i ve d and the driver w is h e d to get                      the    vehicle    into    the    crowd in

order     to appeal         to the       crowd over          the    the     loud speaker      system.        We

a g a i n tried to get            our horses         into     the crowd ap pe al in g         to    people to

stop     pushing and a l lo w the               vehicle       in,    but our a tt em pt s were

hopeless.          It a p p e a r e d    to me that          this    crowd had made a d e t e r m i n e d

along     w i t h a d e finite       intention to force              entry   into the      ground.        The

crowd were at a complete                   standstill      refusing to move and             it was       not

safe    to force the           "bottle      neck situation".             Because    of the       noise    Of

the    crowd the            loud speaker a n n o u n c e m e n t s    had no     effect. I

continually          sh ou te d to the          fans to stop .pushing forwards as                 people

were b ei ng        cr ushed at the front,              few took      notice ~ others         pushed even

more,     I could           see that     the s i t u at io n at the       front of the           t urnstiles

was at danger               level   —   that there w o ul d        be fatal injuries if           the

pressure       of    crowd was       not    released,      the     only way of doing          this was to

release       pressure        at the    front.

All    of a s ud de n this          happened a f te r having           heard shouts        "open the

gates".        I never        saw w hi ch gates         had been opened,          only the extreme.,

right metal           iron gates        being    shut    some    10 yards      in front     of the

turn st il es       of the C Gate area.             A gap then a p p e ae re d        in the      crowd in

We w e r e    then     in st r uc t ed to form a cordon of horses                  nose    to tail

a cross      the entire        length of the         r eception are a w hich e f f e c t i v e l y

gave    o p p o r t u n i t y for the fans a l r e a d y at          the front     of the turnstile

to get th ro ug h s afely without                 pushing.         Eve n once the       cordon was

the head and flanks               and    pulling     o n the     reins.      It was a very hostile

situation,          we each did our best            to    calm the fans.           I was    under       the

to the       resulting         crowd      pressure and a large                 group surged thro ug h the

a l l o w e d them to filter              through s t e a d i l y          between the horses.                     The

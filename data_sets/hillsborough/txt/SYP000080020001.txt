them       get       onto       the     coach       but       I d o n ’t k n o w w h e r e               they       sat.

We    had       no     travel         delays        except            upon approaching                    Sheffield.                 We w e r e

parked.              I got        off      th e    coach and            walked             straight        to       the       ground          but

Pennistone                Rd.

I arrived              at    the      entrance           to      the S o u t h         Stand        at    about          1.43pm          1345 as

having          seen        the    crowds          of    people         outside             the L e p p i n g s          Ln    thought             that

it w o u l d         be     the    same       outside            my    stand          entrance,           however,             upon arrival

at    my     turnstile,               turnstile             J,     I was         surprised           to    see       there          was       no

queue        or      no P o l i c e        Officers           outside.                I entered           the       ground          easily and

handed          my     ticket         to    the     turnstile               man.           I entered           the       r e ar     of    the

stand and              saw a s te w a r d           and asked               him       if he        could       tell       me      where        to    go,

he    di d      this        and    I then walked                   to m y        seat       which        was    at       the W e s t          Stand

corner          of     the      South       Stand.

I never           saw a n y        persons          consuming               alcohol          inside        the       ground          nor was

there        any       trouble          inside          the      gr o u n d .

I. sat       down         in m y      seat        and was          next         to a m a n         whom    I recognised                   f r o m my

coach        but       d o n ’t k n o w      his        name.

I sat        down and             started          to    looii a r o u n d            and    saw     that       the       centre          pens       in

the    West          Stand were             full        a^6      in    comparison              the       outer       pens         were        empty

At    about          2.30pm        1430       I noticed               that       there       was     a Police             Officer             and
                                                                                                                                            PAGE          3

Policewoman             standing          on    the       perimeter              fence            by the       centre          pens         who

were    waving          with    their          a r ms ,    indicating                   for       people       to m o v e         away       from

the    centre       and       move    towards             th e    outer          pens,            however,         due       to    the       spiked

fences       separating             the    pens        they were              unable              to m o v e      a c " 1"

                  2.50pm       1450       I nAt
                                             o t iacbeodu tt h a t          there            was     a surge          in tW e          centre

pen w hich         started          in the        back       and moved                  down       to    the      fr o n t ,      that       surge

w a s n ’t too      bad       but    there        then       wa s      a main            surae          which      the       whole          pen

seemed       to    be    involved          in.         I think             t h at       this       surge       wa s     caused          by

overcrowding             within       the        pen.

The    first       smaller          surge        seemed          to    involve               about       50    people          but      the       main

surge       involved          the    whole        of      the     pen,        t h e y all            were      pushed          forwards             and

it w a ,     d u r ing thi.                       that       X -       H     d          th .                                   in p en 3.

although          I could       not       actually           see       the       b a r r i e r V l knew             it h a d       broken

because       the       people       around          it a ll          fell       d own,           a gap appeared                  in the          pen

where       about       twenty       people          fell        down and               I could          see      people          on the

floor       struggling          to    get        b a ck    up     before            the        crowd again              closed          up a n d         I

don't       know    what       happened           to      the m.           It w a s          at    th i s     p o int    I realised

that    there       w a s n ’t j u s t         overcrowding                 within             the      centre        pens        but       people

were    getting          injured.

I then       noticed          that    the        same      Policeman                who        had      earlier         been       on the

fence       trying       to    indicate           fo r     people           to m o v e            across       had also            realised

what    really was             happening             inside           the     pens,            because         I saw         him again

climb       the    fence       and    frantically                 tr y      to      pull          the    wire      mesh        away,

however,          it wa s      unmovafale.

I felt       as    if    something             was     going          to    happen             like      it    did,      when          on    route

to    the    ground       I noticed             how       tense        the       c r o w d was,             the    atmosphere                wa s

not    like       normal.

By    now    the    match       had       started          but a f t e r            a    couple          of m i n u t e s         my

attention          was    drawn       away        from      the        match            to     the      centre        pens        because           by

this    stage       there       were       people          leaving            the        centre          pens      by all          ways.
                                                                                                                                PAGE            4
                                                                                                                                52428

I saw        numerous           people         being        pulled       up    into      the       stand above          the

terraces           and       numerous          people        climbing          over      people       in the        pens       to    the

front        of    th e      pen w h e r e       they       were     helped       over        the    perimeter          fence        by

both        fans       and Police.

The     general           fans      appeared           to    be do ing         the     most        both    the.. P o l i c e    and       the

stewards           appeared             unorganized           and      u n c o - o r d i n a t & i i , tfSey s e e m e d       to    panic

and     not       know what             to    do.

At     one    stage          the    Spion Hop           fans       were       jeering         the    Liverpool          fans        not

knowing           what       was    really          happening         and      th e    Liverpool           tans    go t    upset          and

started           to    go    towards          the S p i o n       Kop,       I thought            there    was    going        to    be a

r iot       but    then about                60 P ol i ce     Officers           came        onto    the     pitch and          ushered

them        back       towards          the    Leppings         Ln     end.

I left        the       g r o u n d at        about     4.13pm         1 6 15 on m y          own a c c o r d     as    X felt        I

had     seen       enough.

I walked           straight             back     to    the     coach      but     I had        to w a l k     back      around        the

ground        as       a Police          Officer        wouldn't           let    us     go    into       Leppings        Ln because

they        were        laying          bodies        out    th er e .        I had      in f a c t s e e n a b o u t 2 0       people

layed        out        so    I walked           back       around       the     perimeter           of    the g r o u n d a n d

waited        on        the     coach         for     therest        to a r r i v e .

The     coach           left       at    about      6. 3 0 p m 1 830 but I k n e w at t h a t s t a g e                        that the

t wo    HEWITT          brothers             were     not    on the       coach        but     I was       not a w a r e       then

that        they       had    died.

At     no    time       did     I se e        anything         like a         criminal         offence?         no-one         was

urinating              over     Police         Officers         and      there        wa s    no    pick     pocketing          as    far

as     I could          see.

I feel        that        there         was    a t o ta l      lack      of    co-ordination and                  communication

between           the     Police         and     the    stewards          and     in f a c t        when     I entered          the

ground        th e      man     in the         turnstile           t o l d me     I was        in the        right      place        but

on     going       up     the      steps       towards        my     seat6       the     steward          asked    me     what       I was

doing        in t h a t       st a n d .
                                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                                              S2428

              Also    I feel       that       the    Liverpool        crowd was       larger          than what      had     been

              expected       because          by    1.30pm      1330 w h e n    I passed         the    Leppings       Ln    end    it

              was    crowded,          then    once       inside    the     ground    the    pens       were    very      crowded

              and    after       the    surge       had    occurred        there    seemed       to    be a    lot   of     panicking

              within       the    pens    involved.

              I felt       very    frustrated             because     I was     unable      to    help    once       I realised

              what    was    happening             because      it w a s    very    crowded around             me a n d     I was    too

              far    back    to    be a b l e       to    get   out w i t h o u t   causing       problems       w i t h i n my

              stand.

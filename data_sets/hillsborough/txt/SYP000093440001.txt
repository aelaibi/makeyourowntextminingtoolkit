               been excellent.       The match day operation nas always gone extremely

              well,   the arrangements are very flexible and can be changed with a

              minutes notice.        There is no red tape and whatever           is asked of us

               they get.

It is common practice on match days for Leppings Lane to be closed for

a period of time to allow the/£olice to transfer fans to their various

modes of transport    i.e.   train,   coaches, cars.       This normally occurs

just as the game    is closing to an e n d .



The buses use standard diversions when Leppings Lane            is closed.        the

drivers are made aware       of the closures by radio.



On the   15th of April   1989 (1^ Q < 8 9 ,) even though the Leppings Lane was

closed earlier than no rnj^arl, it caused no hardship be cause the standard

diversion was imp



Leppings Lane   is only used by 5 SYT services.            It is not classed as a

main bus route,    it is primarily a link road between Penistone Road and

Middlewood Road.      In a period of an hour there would only be 8 buses

operating on this section of the road.
                                                       /


A re quest was made to divert buses away f arom Leppings Lane           prior to

kick off.     This was just done and no gfdestions asked.           I   have no

knowledge of the exact time that t^ur request was m a d e .



In short,   closing Leppings Lane is very common place on match days and

would not appear as an unusual        request.

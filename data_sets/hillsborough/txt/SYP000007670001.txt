T here    we re people         in the stadi um w i t h ac c e s s           to areas w h i c h are

normally        r es t r i c t e d due to the         incident.

I am not aware            of an y u n a u t ho ri s e d     person/s       entering     the    computer        room.

I r e a l i s e d that      the    tapes w o u l d be requi r e d as           evidence and after

c o n s u l t a t i on w i t h J>he C l u b S e c r e t a r y   I told Roger HQyt^&SwQRTH to eject

the    tapes and a4ve             them.       I saw him eject           t h e ^ H t p e s ^ ^ iPiis would be

is near        the    computer        room. I. returned to the             computer     room about 7 . 3 0 p m

that     night       to collect        my

raincoat.            I re-set      the a la rm when         I left.        I not i ced that       the video

very    big     crowds,         for even        in the       first           of those years            the Club was

contendi ng for               pro m o t i o n to the First D i v i s i o n a l t h o u g h u l t i m a t e l y               it

Duri ng that          spell       Ins pe cto r Clive C A L V E R T was my Liai s o n Of f i ce r and

he and       I had a good deal                of     contact w ith the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

Club.        Such     liaison was m a i n ly w ith the S e c r e t a r y                      of the C lub - in the

e arly stages Eric E N G L A N D and                    latterly Dick CHESTER - and each game

that    the Club          played t hr o u g h o u t         the season was              c a t e g orised ac c o r d i n g

to    the Gate w hi c h we w ou ld                  expect,         not       least    dependent         on the       kind

of fol l o w i n g      that      the visiting           team w ould            have.        As   I    r e c a l 1 the games

were    c a t e g o r i s e d as A, B          or C.         A c a t egory C game w ould                     involve

crowds       up to say 2 0 , 0 0 0          people;         category B up to 30 , 0 0 0                  people,       and

category A where yet                   larger        crowds w ould             be expected.             There w o u l d be

m ee ti ng s    with the          club    prior       to the start              of the       f o o t b a l 1 season

proper,        w hen the        fixtures w o u l d be known,                    and    the    categories         for       each

game    w ould      be agreed.            E a ch     category         involved a consequent m i n i m u m

level    of     policing and since                   the Club have              to    contribute         to the       cost of

policing        they have a financial                    interest             in the matter.             I would       say

however        that     in my deals          with S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y         they have always

been    prepared         to ac c e p t      the      level    of      policing w h i c h we thought                   proper

and    not     tried     to     influence           us to keep           the numbers          of Police Officers

down    for     cost     reasons.           I should also add                   that even         though       the games

during        the season         things      changed - e.g.             if one of the Clubs               involved

had a successful                run so      that a large           crowd might           be e x p e c t e d - we

w o u l d a n d did       re-catego rise matches.

O ther       f actors were also             involved of          course      in the       level     of policing we              :

About 2 weeks             prior     to each game            Inspector C A L V E R T and           I would have

Superintendent              to discuss           the    policing      for     the      f orthcoming match, and

Headquarters             at Snig Hill,            S h e f f i e l d to a r r a n g e    extra manpower        from

(where        necessary)         Dog Handlers.              W i t h i n a week         of the match we w ould

n o r m a l l y have      c o n f i r ma ti on    of the extra m a n p o w e r ava i l a b l e           to us,      and

then Clive C AL VE RT and                    I w ould discuss            the whole matter and draw up an

op e r a t i o n a l    plan to be           put       into o p e r a t i o n on the day of the match.

This       o perational         plan w ou ld        include,       in particular,             deployment      of

Po l i c e    O f f i c e r s w i t hi n an d     outside       the Ground.

Our    policy was           to use O f f i c e r s       from F D i v i s i o n        in those areas where

there was          likely to be            pressure       or    problems       because        of their

f a m i l i a r i t y and    the H i l l s b o r o u g h area.          Thus we always            tend     to use the

same       g ro up of O f f i c e r s      for duties          on the     pitch,       not    least    because       if

trou b l e were          to arise       their      faces w o u l d be well              recognised by        regular

fans who w ould             perhaps        be more       ready to a p p r o a c h them and             report

matters.           O f f i c e r s w ou ld also         be d e p l o y e d on duty for o f f - l o ading

large     crowds      of v i s i t i n g     fans were        e x p e c t e d we w o u l d    control      their

traf f i c a long a p articular                 route?      coaches       coming       off, the Ml would,              for

example,        be a sk ed     to exit at a J u n c t i o n at T a n k e r s l e y where                there        is a

very    large       lay-by an d they w ou l d be stop p e d                  in that         lay-by and fans on

the arri val         of    coaches a n d trains             so that,       for example,           if a train-                      |

p articular         area,     then to        Follow a p a rticular               route around the            Ground

and    park     in Cole R d .          After     the m a t c h all        v i s i t i ng fans w o u l d then be

escorted        from the G r o u n d         back     via Cole Rd to the               coaches      or trains,            as

the    case may be.            Whe n the operational                 plans were           drawn up     copies

w o u l d go to each part i c u l a r            groups       of O f f i c e r s    - i.e.     Traffic

D i vision ,       M ou nt ed Police,         etc.     and they w ould             detail     the duties         for

each    particular          s ec t i o n of men.          A copy of the operational                   plan was

always       g i v e n to the S e c r e t a r y       of S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F o t o b a l 1 C lub     in

advance       of the match.

O n M a t c h Day,        before     kick-off,         I would       brief all         the Offic e r s      on duty.

Those     b r i efings      normally         took     place w i t h i n the Ground,             either      in the

v i c i n i t y of the Po l i c e R o o m or           in the g y m n a s i u m depending            on how          many

o ff icers were           involved.          After     a general        briefing          to all,    the

I n spectors        and S er ge a n t s      w o u l d then be s e p a r a t e l y        in more    detail,         but

all    b r i efings       e s s e nt ia ll y broke       down the       operation          into 3 phases:--

1.     The    period up to kick-off?

2.     the    period from k i c k-off               until     10 m i n u t e s     before     the end of the

       mat c h ?

3.     From     10 minu t e s      before       the    end to dispersal              of    crowds.

interest         in policing         football         crowds,         f o llowing my retirement                    from the

Force       I wrote a series              of 3 artic l e s           for a     local       newspaper,          the

S h e f f i e l d Telegraph,         on this         topic.          Subsequently           I did appear             on

television               on a couple       of occasions              in d i s c u s s i o n s    on football          and

the    football          supporters,          hooliganism            problems        and    I wrote         some

articles         for      the Po l i c e Review.

in perfo r m i n g my task as S e c u r i t y Officer.                        One    of the early things

that     I did after my a p p o i n t m e n t            was    to    check all       the     gates a r o u n d      the

s t ad iu m and to            change     the    padlocks       on those       gate's to a common padlock

so that            every gate       could be opened w i t h the               seme k e y .      The Pol i c e were

may    be      locked w hich w ou ld otherwise                  be open or other              changes made

All    matt e r s         relating       to the      erection of       perimeter        fences,        gates    in the

fences,            the siting       of    crash barriers         in the       standing areas            etc.    were,

I believe,             dealt w ith        betw e e n the Club and            the C o m m i t t e e    set up by the

Local       Authority,            pursuant      to the Sa f e t y of Sports Grounds Act.                        I

know     for example              that    up to      1985 the    central        pen at      the West S tand

(Leppings            Ln)    end was      not    divided     by the      fence which           now runs from the

centre         of the m ou t h of          the tunnel       under      the    stand,      down to the

perimete r           fence.        There was a crush barrier                  about     12*    in from the

m o u t h of the           tunnel    entrance,        and my     recollection           is that the

p o s it i o n i n g      of that    crush barrier          relatively          close     to the       entrance

from     the tunnel           was    capable of         causing a b u i l d - u p of fans at the m outh

of    the      tunnel       and    it was      often nec e s s a r y    to deploy a Police Con s t a b l e

on either            side     of the     tunnel      to ensure o r d e r l y dispersal                of the    crowd

w i t h i n the        pen.       Subsequently        however        that    crush barrier was             removed

and    the         fence    erected,       pr esu m a b l y at the      request       of the Safety

C ommittee.

                         m at c h e s    so / a r     as     I am a w a r e .     The      gates are j^o d e s igned that               the

                         that       th/e gates w o u l d         normal ly be m a n n e d outside              by stewards and Poli ce

                         them       it was me r e ly n e ce ss ar y to              press      down on the s p r i n g - l o a d e d      latch

                         to      release       it.     I do recall           that a fter my a p p o i n t m e n t       as S e c u r i t y

                         Offi cer        I was a little             con c e r n e d that       some    of the a d v e r t i s i n g    boards

                         those       gates a n d        could      create an o b s t r u c t i o n an d        I a r r a n g e d for    the

                         I also         took       steps     to upgrade         the Pu b l i c A c t r e s s S y s t e m at the Gr o u n d

                         and      indeed       1a ^ f year       the P.A.        S ys t e m was    completely         replaced wit h a

                         new,       more    pp a e r f u 1 ,    system.         Part    of the     reason for" this was               that     I

                         was      consnous           of the      fact     the P «A S y s te m was an essential                   part of the

                         that       e m er ge nc y    e v a cu at io n    procedures were             in force.        The S t e wards         were

                         open       those      gates.          I made     sure     that    this    evacuation         procedure was

                         tested         on m a t c h days        to be s at is f i e d that           it w ould work e f f i c i e n t l y         in

At about 2 . pm (1400)                  ame of the e m ployees                 from the Tur n s t i l e Room

s howed that            some 2 4 , 0 0 0 fans were               in,   mostly        in the S o u t h Stand and

into     s o m ething        of a s pl a y e d         leg      position,       an d    then    recovered and           this

was an         indi c a / i o n    to me        that    the      crush out       Vrfere was increasing.

that    the Police          had o p e ne d the gates at the Leppings                       Ln end of the

Ground.         G r a h am    r es po n d e d to the effect           "Can we get them                 in, are we up

to    capacity?"             and    I r e sponded that we we re n o t .                  I made my w a y down

towards        the West S ta n d an d then saw                  j^ople      climbing        over      the    pe r imete r

fe n c e s at that end               of    the    pitch,    jf t    that    point a Po l i c e            Offi c e r went

onto     the    pitch and            a sk e d    the Referee        to stop the          game.                                  i

T here was a mass              of    people #ra/und the             perimeter          fence    behind the            goal      |

a re a and      I am not abl e             to s-jiy w h e t h e r   the gates          in the       perimeter         fence

were     opened to a ll ow               peoples o u t .     I could see          that    some       people were

being       lifted over            the    to^> of the fence,          people a p p e a r e d to be            lying on

the     ground      i n j m ^ e d, a m      m a n y were w a n d e r i n g a r o u n d    in a dazed

c on d i t i o n and     in obvious             distress.     I helped a number                of    people     in that

state       back    towards          the    p l a y e r s ’ tunnel area and            into the S o u t h S tand

so that        they    could         be    co m f o r t e d and helped.          I recall        that one of the

A s s i s t a n t Caretakers,             named               said we       needed more             stret c h e r s    from

the     tea Bar,         I went          in and got the 2 stret c h e r s w hich were                       st o r e d on

top of the          cupboard         in that Bar           so that     they      could be used.

At    one    point     I recall           that B r i a n C L O U G H s t o p p e d me and said              "Sir,      I

wan t    you to find the D i r e c t o r s and the F.A.                       Off i c i a l s and tell          them        I

am    putting my players                  in the     bath an d taking            them home."            Mr C L O U G H

knew     that      I w o r k ed w i th the Club for                 I had been         introduced to him

earlier        that    day.         I was aware         of the      fact    that    there was a m e e t i n g

g oing      on in the D i r e c t o r ’s room to discuss                    the situation,              w h i c h was

still       unclear a n d          I went       into that     room to tell          the Dir e c t o r s what Mr,

C L O U G H had said.              The message,         in effect,         was    that    there        could be        no

thought        given to        r e - c om me n c i n g the game w h e n the             problem had been

dealt w ith            of     course,       at    that time,        the    full j ^ t u r e     of the       tragedy

was     not known.

It was at about               that       point    I realised that/' there               had been no

announcement           over        the P u bl ic Address S y s t e m          in acco r d a n c e w i t h the

P o l i c e are      in charge        of    the Pu b l i c Addr e s s         System     in the sense           that

they     have an override               sys tem and the e m e r g e n c y            procedures       stipulated

that     the Police w o u ld make                 the    necessary         broadcast.         I therefore            used

my    personal         radio and        instr u c t e d all S t e w a r d s         to unlock       the   gates

around     the ground.               I got      replies       from some        of them o n l y , and           I recal1

I spoke        to                          and a s k e d      him to get        round and ensure            that the

gates were           opened all         the w a y around.

I recollect            that    I was also a p p r o a c h e d           by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Roger

G R E E N W O O D who     said he w a n t e d to take K e n n y D A L G L I S H and B r i a n C L O U G H

to the Poli ce Control                  Box     to broadcast            to the      crowd    in the G r o u n d and

e x p la in the        pos i t i on and        1 took      them there         by a relatively

unobstructed             route.

I s u b s e qu en tl y had a request                   over    the    radio     from the Head S t e w a r d s          to

a l l o w the men to stand                 down       pending    the     crowd event u a l l y       1eav i ng the

G r o u n d t hr o u g h the gates w h i ch had been opened,                          but    I refused that

request        on the       basis     that their a t t e n d a n c e          was    still    required whilst

the    crowd        remained.

S ince    the       tragi c events          on 15th April             I have     been able       to w a t c h the

video     recording           of the       position at the              gates at L e p p i n g s Ln,        thro u g h

the Club's           own static         camera         trained on those             gates.      I now     realise

that     the    initial        event wh e n a            crowd of s pectators               burst    into      the

G r o u n d through Gate C , w h i ch                  caused me        to first      leave    the Control

Room,     was       in fact      s u b s e qu en tl y    contr o l l e d after a number              of fans had

gone     in.        They a p p a r e n t l y    got     in whe n the Police we re a t t t e m p t i ng to

eject     some of the            s pe c t a t o r s   inside,        t h r o u g h Gate C.     It was after

that,     it seems,           that    the order was             g iven by the Police             for" Gate C to

be opened to a ll o w spe ctators                       in.

I have      read this S t a t em en t and                it is true and             correct     to the best           of

my kn o w l e d g e and        belief.

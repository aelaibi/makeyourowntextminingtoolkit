            Editor,

            1 Canada Square
            London, El4 5DT                                      16 February 1995




            Dear Sir,

                  LITIGATION ARISING FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL TRAGEDY:
                                COMPLAINT OF CONTEMPT OF COURT

            The Attorney General has received representations from Messrs
            Russell Jones & Walker, solicitors acting on behalf of a number
            of officers and former officers of the South Yorkshire Police,
            to the effect that coverage by the Daily Telegraph on 3 February
            1995 of the pending litigation against the Chief Constable of
            South Yorkshire Police and others for the recovery of damage for
            psychiatric illness constitutes a contempt of court.        They
            assert that the coverage, and in particular the final passage of
            the editorial, amounts to improper pressure calculated to deter
            the police officers from pursuing legitimate claims before the
            court.

            The Attorney General has yet to form a view about this matter and
            would be assisted by your comments as to the purpose of and
            reasons for the reporting and editorial. It may assist you to
            have sight of the terms of the complaint from Messrs Russell
/           Jones/and Walker.   I enclose a copy of their letter.

            Since the litigation in question is fixed for trial next month,
            the Attorney General would welcome an expeditious reply.

            Yours faithfully,




            S. J. WOOLER

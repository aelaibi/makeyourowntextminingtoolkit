            On S a t u r d a y     15th April      1989,       I was d e t a i l e d to work Sam              y:   8 pm in

            c o n n e c t i o n with the       football        semi    final at Hill sborougrt.

            My      primary duty was a s si st in g             with the flow of traf/ic at T i n s l e y

            I s land at          its j u n c t i o n w i t h the Ml rno t o n ^ y        /i   o rjt,hpo u n d carriageway.



            At 2 . 3 0 p m       I a t t e n d e d at the driving            school,     B r i g h t s i d e Lane w here        I
             .   /'
                  rd meal    and was       i ns t r u c t e d to stand-by.



                 bout 3 . 1 0 p m a message        was      recieved         in relation to a public                    order

            p roblem         at H i l l sborough.



            In company with other                 o f f icers     I was       c o n veyed to H i l l s b o r o u g h where          we

            e n t e r e d the ground via the P e n n i s t o n e Roa d end,
                                                                                                                   page:
                                                                                                                   S26130



    On entering          the ground,            ye wjre    led onto the             playing area where we

    were      "lined up"       in f ronj, ojy the N orth Stan d , t h e n ma r c hed across                             the

    w id th    of the      pitch on        jfys    half way    line to form a barrier                    across         the

    pitch.



    After      being     lined up ac r o s s         the   pitch       I became       fully aware          of what        had

    occurred,         a l t h o ug h at    first     I thought         that a mass          pitch     invasion had

    occurred,


                                                                   2 (+'c
    At    this   time      I was    stood wit h Pc 737 Part i / t , and                     I could see           that

    younger      officers at the L e p p in gs Lane EnuMof                          the ground were              finding

    it hard to cope with,                  so     in company w ith Pc P a r f i 1 1 , 1 left                 the    line

    and went      to the L e p p in gs            Lane   end of the gro u n d where               I rende r e d what

    a ss is ta nc e    I could to the              dead and    injured         people.



    In company w ith Pc Parfitt,        I broke up some of the a d v e r t i s i n g     boards
                       /                                               .       J

                                                                           f   ft

    and    decea s e ^ parties            to the g y m n a s i u m .



    After      some time       I became           parted from Pc Parfitt,                 and on return to the

    L e p p in gs Lane end          saw that most           of the          injured and dead had been

    removed-      I o rg an i s e d some           supporters      to       clear    the a d v e r t i s i n g    boards

    from the      playing are a then                returned to the Pertnnistone Roa d end where

    I joined Pc 212 8 Granswick,                     who was     driving a personnel                  carrier.          With

    On    returning       to the g r o u nd we were            instr u c t e d       to a t t e n d C l a y w h e e i s

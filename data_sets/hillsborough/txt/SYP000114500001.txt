                 meal          we    walked around               the p e r i m e t e r     track           to   the L e p p i n g s       Lane      end,        at

                  this         stage     we w e r e         only a stand            by    unit.            Once         there       we    stoodaround,

                  taking       the     piss      like.           I remember          the       gaffer           messing       about       with      the

                  ga t e    on the      fence         w h i c h at     the       time     we     found          quite    amusing.             After

                  being      there      for      a short          t i me    we w e r e     asked           by g r o u n d     control         to    go    to

                  the      turnstiles           on P e ni st on e R oad             so as        to a s s i s t       with     the       incoming

                 Notts       Forest       fans.          We w a l k e d      around        by the           back      of L e p p i n g s      Lane

                 Road.         It was       also       relatively             c l ea r    of     f a n s as       wel l,      we w e r e      also

                  posted       to a t u r n s t i l e a n d            me a n d A n d y          took       the         last       t u r n s t i l e to   the

                 Kop,          thinking         these        w o u l d be    the     quickest.

                 They       turned      out      to    be    not     very        b u s y a n d we          spent      most     of     the     time

                  either       chatting          amongst          ourselves          or     to       the    stewards          or     the N o t t s

                 Forest        fans,      who     all       seemed         in g o o d     spirits.               Up   until        about

2.00    pm    (1400)          the          spectators              came     in d r i b s           and     d r ab s      but    they       slowly

increased          in n u m b e r s ,            however           there       were       no       real      problems           apart        from

having       to    take       beer          off       one     or    two     but       even         this      wa s     taken      in g o o d

spirits.           As     kick         off       drew       nearer        one       or    two       started           turnstile

hopping       and       one       or       two     got      locked        up    from          the       turnstiles             higher        up.

Throughout           all      at       the       t i me     we w e r e      approached                  by a g o o d          few Liverpool

fans    who       h a d all        gone          to    the w r o n g        e n d a n d we              k ept    telling         them        to go

back    to L e p p i n g s         Lane.              As    kick     off       t i me     drew          nearer        these      fans

seemed       to    increase                in n u m b e r s        and    there          was a g r e a t e r             urgency       in t h e m

to    get    down       to L e p p i n g s            L a n e.      I remember                as    kick        off      got    c l o se     me

and    Andy watching                   a    couple          of     scousers           who      had       been wandering                up a n d

down    for a w h i l e            without             a ticket           and       it    looked           like       they      were       going

to    try and        jump         the       turnstile,              however,             it was          then       that A nd y E d d i s on

shouted       to     us      to    come          down       to     the    gym       entrance,              which         we    did,    and

once    there        we w e r e            told       to get        straight             round          to L e p p i n g s      Lane       as

there was          trouble             with        the      fans.         The       u nit      went        straight            away and             on

getting       out       onto       the        perimeter             track       I looked                down     towards         Leppings

Lane    and       I saw a          number             of    f ans    on     the       edge         of    the     pitch,         the

perimeter          track          and       stood          on the        fe n c e .       We       turned        down and walked

passed       the N o r t h S t a n d as we                       did.       I rec all              seeing        a bobby         struggling

w i t h a f an       on the            track          and Andy E d d i s o n and Dave                           Frost         went    to

help.        I decided             to       carry          on.      I w as      c o n v i n c e d at            this      time       t hat      the

fans    were       fighting,                as     they a p pe a re d           to       be    doing         just        that.        O n c e at

the L e p p i n g s L a n e            end       I remember              the    gaffer             telling          us    to    form a

single       line       cordon along                    the      touchline.               I d i d t ha t            and       looked

towards       the       crowd and                I saw them              s t il l     climbing             over       the      fence       and

running       towards             us.         The       terraces           looked absolutely                        packed.           A man

came    screaming             up       to     us      saying        a man was             dead          in the        crowd and

s c r e a m e d at      us    to       do     something             at    first          I just          d i d n ’t b e l i e v e      what          he

was    saying,          thinking              h e ’d p r o b a b l y        fainted            or       something             like a n d        I

remained          in the        c ord on.         But      this ma n           came         back     to me a n d A n d y a g a i n ,

shouting          and      swearing         for      us    to     do     soemthing,               t hi s    time        we w e n t       with

him,       that's       me a n d A n d y         did.        We     went       to      fence and            jumped         up on         it

and      l o o k e d at     the       crowd, p e o p l e           were      reaching             out      t o w a r d s us a n d

begging          us   to    ge t t h e m    out,       but       I j us t      couldn't            think         ho w     we    could,

as    I c o u l d n ’t s e e         h o w we     c o u l d get          in or         them       get      out,     I felt

absolutely            helpless.             The      ne xt       thing       I r ec a l l         was      seeing        a man       being

passed         down     the     crowd above               their        hea ds,         he w a s a b o u t          my a g e a n d         ha d

blond         gingerish         hair       with      grey        c o rds     on,       they       passed         him     r i gh t    down

to    us      on the       fence      and     held        h im    up     but      we    c o u l d n ’t get          a hold          of    him

because          of   t hjr f e n c e a n d       he      fell      down       onto         the    steps,          people       moved

back       for    hym,      somehow,          and      he j u s t        lay      th ere .         I l o o k e d at         hi m     I knew

he was         dVad.        I ran      b ack      for      some        reason          to    tell       Martin and             then       ran

ba c k     again      by this         t ime A n d y a n d           some       other         bobbies          and       fans    were

in but         the    fans      inside        were        still        trying          to get        out      so    it a g a i n

delayed          thipgs.         We     did      eventually              get      in a n d        they      tried        to g i v e       him

all      frying       to    get      out     of t hi s     gate        so    nothing           much was            happening,

at    the L e p p i n g s        Lane     which         ha d     been      taken       down       I just         looked around

my    helmet         which       I had       taken       off,        at    some       poi nt      and      I started             to     look

for     it,     t h r o u g h all       the       pil es       of    helmets.            It s e e m e d a s i l l y              thing           to

I eventually               found       it.        Me    and Andy West                 then     just        stood       there           not

talking         or    doing       anything             just      stood.           People       k ep t      coming          up    to us

asking        us w h a t     was       happening,              how        many were          dead and            if the         g a m e wa s

going      to      re-start,           but     I couldn't                  give them         any answers because                        I

ju st    didn't        know       the     answers.               Eventually            our     gaffer        found          us a n d we

grouped         up a g a i n      then       j us t     stood        th e r e ,    shouting,            trying         to       sa y

HEELEY DHQ




0830   on    duty       at   Heeley,    in   good     spirits,     usual        jokes    etc.,   being     made.

Changed into uniform and off to Hillsborough.

Once   there       we    went    to    the   North    Stand   where        we    were     briefed    by    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and other senior officers.                                  Andy Eddison fetched

packed meals and we sat in back of van and ate them.                                   After meal we walked

around the perimeter track to the Leppings Lane end, at this stage we were

only a stand-by unit.                 Once there we stood           there taking the piss like.                I

remember     the     gaffer messing about with the gate on the fence which at the

time we      found quite         amusing.       After being        there    for a short time we were

asked by Ground Control to go to the turnstiles on Penistone Road so as to

assist with the incoming Notts Forest fans.                        We walked around by the back of

Leppings      Lane       which   was    clear    of    fans   at    this        time    and   then   out    into

Penistone Road.              It was also relatively clear of fans as well, we were also

posted      to a turnstile and me and Andy took the last turnstile to the K o p ,

thinking these would be the quietest.

They   turned out            to be not very busy and we spent most of the time either

chatting amongst ourselves or to the stewards or the Notts Forest f a n s , who

all seemed in good spirits.

Up until about 2.00 p.m.                (1400)   the spectators came in dribs and drabs but

they slowly increased in numbers, however there were no real problems apart

from having         to take beer off one or two,                 but even this was taken in good

spirits.          As kick off drew nearer one or two started turnstile hopping and

one or two got locked up from the turnstiles higher up.                                   Throughout all of

the time we were approached by a good few Liverpool fans who had all gone to
             fl
the wrong end and we kept telling them to go back to Leppings Lane.

As    kick off time drew nearer these fans seemed to increase in numbers and

there    was    a    greater   urgency         in   them    to    get   down    to   Leppings      Lane.     I

remember       as kick off got close, me and Andy watching a couple of scousers

who    had    been    wandering     up   and    down    for a while        without     a   ticket and       it

looked like they were going to try and jump the turnstile, however, it was

then that Andy Eddison shouted to us to come down to the gym entrance, which

we did, and once there we were told to get straight round to Leppings Lane

as    there    was    trouble with       the    fans.       The unit went straight away and on

getting out onto the perimeter track I looked down towards Leppings Lane and

I saw a number of fans              on   the    edge    of the pitch,          the perimeter track and

stood on the fence.            We turned down and walked passed the North Stand.                            As

we did I recall seeing a bobby struggling with a fan on the track and Andy

Eddison       and    Dave   Frost   went       to   help.        I   decided    to   carry   on.      I    was

convinced at this time that the fans were fighting, as they appeared to be

doing just that.

Once    at the Leppings        Lane      end I remember the gaffer telling us                   to form a

single line cordon along the touchline.                          I did that and looked towards the

crowd and I saw them still               climbing over the fence and running towards us.

The terraces looked absolutely packed.                      A man came screaming up to us saying

a man was dead in the crowd and screamed at us to do something.                                 At first I

just    didn't believe what he was                  saying,      thinking he'd probably fainted or

something like and I remained in the cordon.                            Bui" this man came back to me

and Andy again, shouting and swearing for us to do something.                                This time we

went with him, that's me and Andy did.                      We went to fence and jumped up on it

and looked at the crowd, people were reaching out towards us and begging us

to get them out, but I just couldn't think how we could as I couldn't see

how we could get in or them get out.                    I felt absolutely helpless.



                zy><7
The next thing I recall was seeing a man being passed down the crowd above

their     heads,    he was    about     my    age   and    had blond     gingerish     hair with grey

cords     on.    They passed him right              down to us on the fence and held him up,

but we couldn't get hold of him because of the fence and he fell down onto

 the   steps,    people moved back for him,                somehow,    and he   just   lay there.   I

looked at him I knew he was dead.

I ran back for some reason to tell Martin and then ran back again.                            By this

time Andy and some other bobbies and fans were pulling at the fence and fans

were pushing at it from inside.                     I joined in frantically trying to pull it

 free,   but    it just wouldn't give way,                it seemed to take for ages before it

did but eventually           it did and we pulled it back,                somebody I think it was

Andy,    tried to get in, but the fans inside were still trying to get out so

 it again delayed things.               We did eventually get in and they tried to give

him the kiss of life.              It was then that I noticed that somebody had opened

the left gate and fans were trying to get out, but they were all trying to

get    out of this gate        so nothing           much was happening,      nobody getting     in or

out.      The fans slowly started to part and leave a gap on the terrace and I

recall looking up the terracing and seeing bodies strewn all over the steps,

there were about 20 or so, none moving.                       I couldn't comprehend what I was

seeing and I stood there just staring until somebody shook me.                           I moved back

towards    the     fence     and   to   the   gate which I stood up on, whilst the              crowd

continued to stream out they seemed oblivious to the bodies that were laid

out only a few yards away and just seemed intent on getting out.

Somebody       then started passing           bodies out and a human chain was formed.              I

stood on the track and passed the bodies on.                          I didn't look at them,     just

passed them on, it seemed to last a while but I don't think it was.                           When it

had stopped        I turned and went out onto the pitch and saw bodies just laid

out, with people walking around them.                     Me and Andy West went to one of them

                 '&>£r
a young lad about 20, who was laid next to another lad about the same age

and we started to give mouth to mouth and heart massage to him.                   I did the

mouth to mouth.         We went    at it hellfor leather and at first we thought he

was coming round.         As we did this to this lad I recall feeling somebody kick

me    in the left       side andI looked round cos I       thought they were trying to

attract    my    attention and      as I did a fan spit    in my   face and called me a

bastard.        I couldn't   take    this   in at first and I just wiped        it away and

carried on with this lad until eventually we decided it was no good and we

packed in.       As we did I looked up and saw somebody picking money from the

side of the other lad who was laid out, it obviously having fallen out, then

just   walk     away    with it.     I didn't   take   this in either    then   and   instead

looked down at the lad we had been trying with and then we turned him onto

his side in the recovery position for some reason and I wiped my mouth clear

of the vomit that the lad had brought up.              I recall how this tasted of beer

and I couldn't get rid of this taste for ages, despite any drink I had later

on.    A board was brought over and we laid the lad on it.              Andy took his coat

off and covered him with it.           We then sprinted across the pitch with him and

to the gym.       When we got there we saw bodies just laid out and somebody said

leave him so we did and we went back to the crowd.             As I ran back across the

pitch I recall seing three people struggling across the ptich with a board

with a young lad on i t .          I looked at him and saw his Liverpool scarf tied

around his wrist and neck, he was only a young lad, a young teenager and he

was dead.       I helped carry him to the gym area and left him there.                When I

got back all the bodies seemed to have gone and fans and bobbies were just

walking around, most of them in a trance.               I stopped once near the net at

the Leppings Lane which had been taken down.             I just looked around me and at

myself.       I recall    trying    to wipe   the spit off the arm of my tunic until

somebody came up to talk to me and then I thought about my helmet which I
        A

    had    taken       off.      At     some   point    I started to look for it,              through all the

    piles of helmets.                 It seemed a silly thing to do when all these people were

    dead but I just wanted to do something.                       I eventually found it.              Me and Andy

    West     then      just      stood     there     not    talking     or    doing    anything,      just    stood.

    People kept coming up to us asking us what was happening, how many were dead

    and if the game was going to re-start, but I couldn't give them any answers

    because I just didn't know the answers.                        Eventually our gaffer found us and

    we grouped up again then just sood there, shouting, trying to say something

    that made some sense.

    I recall an old woman walking past us and saying,                                 "Well done lads", and I

    thought well done,                 for what.       People by now were leaving the ground as the

    match        had finally              been called off and we made our way up the Leppings Lane

    which        was   totally            clear now         apart from a few fans satwith their heads in

    their        hands     and    one    or two bobbies.         It was hard to          believe      that only a

    short        time before              there had         been such panic and pandemonium on these steps.

    We stood at the back of the stand until we were ordered to return to the

    van.         I still thought then that only 20 or so had died as I had only been

    able to take in what was happeneing in the immediate vicinity of myself, as

    though nothing else was happening inside of me.

    We     got    back     to    the    van    and   somebody    said    70 people       had   died    and I just

    couldn't believe this.                     We left the stadium in the van and started getting

    sent here, there and everywhere in response to reports of fans fighting, but

    my heart just wasn't in it and I just wanted the day to end.

    We     returned        to    the    ground later that evening and everything was                         in total

    contrast to earlier,                 all quiet,        almost eerie,      but there was that lingering

    stench of dead bodies,                    like a sudden death,           but 70 times as bad.            We left

    the ground, went back to Heeley and off duty.

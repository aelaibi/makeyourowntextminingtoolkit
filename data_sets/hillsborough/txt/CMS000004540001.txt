On    present          forecasts,           and       even       if   there       is    no growth,              The

Football Truat expects to receive over £100 million from thm

pools companies'                Spotting-the-Ball competition over the next ten

years,          Of the total sum,                    three-quarters,              or E75 million,                   is

likely to be made available by the Trustees to help profession*!
football.



Whilst tha game would undoubtedly like more money, these are

considerable              sums       and    will          go a     long     way     to help m«et                the

The Trust has long experience of helping clubs comply with the

need* of aafety and with other measures                                     to combat hooliganism,

and we are ready to assist with the new responsibilities atnd

requirements which the judge's report will confer upon football.



Certainly there is no need to establish any new statutory body

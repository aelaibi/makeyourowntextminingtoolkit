      the    fans        went       through           but     the       gate    was       only          open    for       a s h o r t .space                 of

      entering           the    ground           I saw        a    cordon        of      police          officers          on    the       field

      It w a s      not       until       a    short        time        later       a    police          officer          came    to m e            and

      said     people          are       dying        in    there,        w e * 11       have       to    do    something.                 I

      immediately              went       to     the       fence        and    saw       people          crushed          up    against             it.

      Some     appeared             to    be     in a       bad     way.        No.       4    safety          gate       wa«    open          and       I

      fans     through          it.

      The    fans        I helped             through         were       badly          shaken,          apart       from       one    who          needed

      resuscitation                 and       looked        in a        bad    way       but       this    was       c a r r i e d s out        by       a

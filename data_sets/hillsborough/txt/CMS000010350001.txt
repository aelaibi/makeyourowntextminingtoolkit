THIRD MEETING OF THE FOOTBALL LIAISON GROUP DUE TO BE HELD AT
11AM ON 5 FEBRUARY IN ROOM 1104, HOME OFFICE, QUEEN ANNE'S GATE.


The report of the House of Commons Select Committee on football
hooliganism is due to be published on 5 February. In the
circumstances and as no matters of urgency have been proposed for
discussion, it has been decided to cancel next week's meeting of
the Football Liaison Group.

I shall be in touch shortly to arrange an alternative date for
the Group's third meeting.

                                   THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE                                     x x x ix



                                 I Summary of Recommendations

  134. We believe that the press ought to exercise much greater responsibility when reporting
football hooliganism.                                                             (Para 13)

  We recommend a determined effort by all football clubs to make a much higher standard of
facilities available to fans.                                                   (Para 18)

  We recommend that the Football Licensing Authority pay particular attention to ensuring that
home and away fans receive equal treatment at every ground.                        (Para 19)

  We recommend that the compulsory seating proposals be re-examined in the case of the smaller
clubs-                                                                          (Para 22)
  We believe that it should be a priority of clubs to provide the police and'other organisations
such as St John Ambulance with the facilities which they need to discharge their duties efficiently.
                                                                                        (Para 23)
  We recommend that the Government keep under review the rate of Pool Betting Duty, and, if
necessary, decrease the rate to make more money available for ground improvements. (Para 25)

  We add our voice to all those who have called for an imaginative and vigorous campaign by
the football authorities to ensure that the money is raised and the facilities at all grounds improved
to the level of the best.                                                                   (Para 26)

  W e recommend that the football authorities and the police consult oneanother on match
scheduling and heed one another’s professional expertise.                       (Para 28)

  We do not see any need for any further powers to prevent matches taking place. (Para 29)

  We recommend that the police remain alive to the fact that football matches are intended as
entertainment for the enjoyment of the maximum number of law-abiding fans. There must be a
good reason for altering the day, venue or time of a game.                          (Para 30)

   We recommend that all names and descriptions of hooligans against whom high grade
intelligence is possessed are passed to clubs concerned by the National Football Intelligence Unit
via the local police force’s football liaison officer.                                . (Para 31)

  We believe it would be quite wrong for the police to use tactics against away supporters which
had the intention of extending the Luton experiment [of banning away supporters] by the back
door.                                                                              (Para 33)

   We recommend that clubs whose teams are engaged in European competitions organise
attractive, good value and well-stewarded package deals for travelling supporters, and that match
tickets are available only through these arrangements.                                (Para 35)

  We recommend that all League clubs establish community programmes.                      (Para       36)

   We recommend that the football authorities and individual clubs should establish regular
liaison and dialogue with the supporters’ organisations.                        (Para 37)

  We recommend that gradual but steady progress towards desegregation should be the aim of
police and clubs.                                                              (Para 40)

  We urge ACPO to come forward speedily with the new arrest procedures which Taylor
recommended a year ago.                                                  (Para 41)

  We recommend that the Home Office should continue to monitor developments in video
technology, and the Football Trust continue to make money available for state-of-the-art
equipment to be installed.                                                    (Para 42)

   The Committee is convinced that the intensive gathering and sifting of intelligence is the most
effective means of dealing with the menace of gang hooliganism and recommends that each force
appoints a full-time football intelligence officer for each League club in its area.  (Para 43)

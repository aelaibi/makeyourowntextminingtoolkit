           arrangments to go to the semi final                 cup final footbaLI match between

‘ arrived at the Leppings Lane end a ^ a b o u t      one thirty    (1330) «   On my

  way to the ground I did not wit/ffess any kind of disorder or drunkeness

  on my way to the ground,         there was an obvious crowd of people

  preparing for the match and the humour was general             for the type of

  match to be played that day.                                                      ^

  On our ar r ival at Leppings L a r ^ entrance the re was a steady J^Kfck 1e of.

  people going through the^Srnrnst i 1 e s .      There was an obvijxts presence of

  police officers se^rt^ing the respective fans prior / o               going through

  the turnstiles.    I ^ad      no difficulties   in getting to the turnstiles         I

  was searched prior to getting into the ground but my ticket was

  checked.   I eventually went through the turnstile marked either F or

  G.   There was no delay,        once through into the concourse area 1 went to

  buy a programme.

  I did not see any police officers or stewards at thi^fjo in t , they may

  well have been present but I d o n ’t recollect.        Jk'do not recall seeing

  any signs directing us to either side of               te r rac es.   The most

  obvious point of entry was through the Jrnnnel which all four of us

  subsequently went and in any event          VC was behind the goal area whi ch I

  would normally go to anyway.          We had easy access through the tunnel

  and went to the pep^on tiae left hand side which I understand is

  classed as Pen >T.    We first stood in the centre of the pen directly in

  front of a o^asjn barrier.         I would say that this would then have been

  about 1335 h/s    (1335).      At this particular time I would say there were

  a few f a n / probably about forty or fifty         just lying around in the

  pens sunbathing.     There was no hassle just a happy environment.               From

  there on in it was a steady build up of fans coming              into the pens.          It

  w a s n ’t until about 2.30     (1430) - 2.45 (1445)   that we got pushed from

  side to side,    up until this point we had been playing with a beach

  ball and having a good old sing song.            At about a quarter to three

  (1445)   time looking back we were being pushed to the left and forward

   it was uncomfortable.        I have never experienced that type of crowd at

   a match before.        I recollect that         was behind me.    I have no idea

   where         and          were but now that I've said that it may well have

   been        that     was behind me.    I do not recollect time or too much

   detail we     were being pushed further forward all the time, you had no

   control     over your own movements whatsoever, I eventually got pushed                up

   against     the perimeter fence on the way down I went over to the left                of

   the centre and       then back to the right centre and forward.         I

   recollect colliding with a crash barrier and catching my inner                right

   leg against    it.     When I got to the perimeter fence I recollect a young

   person I do not know whether       it was male or female but they were small

   the person was wearing a purple coat.

   I coul dn’t describe it as an anorak or anything          it was a definate

   purple outer garment.       The person was small as their head was pressing

'^'against     the left hand side of my chest which was restricting my

   breathing even more and caused me to panic

   I coul dn’t give any further description of this person at all when I

   eventually moved away       they d i d n ’t fall over or anything but       just kept

   to/the fence.        A lot of people were being helped out of the           pens and

   by virtue of this the pressure became less and I was able to turn

  around and move and saw that there was a gate in the fence just a few

   feet away from me.        I saw a few feet away behind me that there was a

   gap in the people       in this gap there was a male person about 30-40

   years   lying on the steps.      There were two or three people talking to

   him he appeared to be alright         I coul dn’t give a full description but

   he was of medium build he had a moustache he was wearing a button down

   shirt that was open.        I d o n ’t know the colour.

   I stepped over him to       the side fence and was subsequently helped to

   get over into the smaller pen which I believe is Pen 5 and then down

   some steps to a gate which took me onto the pitch.            Initially I tried

to find friends but I couldn ’t so I decided to see if I could assist

anyone as I was first aid trained.           There was a fairly large man on

the South Stand side of the goal near to the 6 yard box two people

were assisting him and giving him heart massage.

I did not help here as he seemed to be in good hands^ ''generally tri

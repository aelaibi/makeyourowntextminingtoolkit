Further to our telephone conversation of yesterday evening, I have pleasure
in enclosing a copy of the video tape compilation for your personal use and
retention.   Should you require more copies in the future please do not
hesitate to contact me.

My Chief Constable, Geoffrey Dear, mentioned last night to Lord Justice
Taylor the question of the Coroner's Inquiry which I, with my officers, are
completing on your behalf.  The suggestion was put forward that we may be
able to complete the full inquiry for you, hopefully by the Autumn, but
long before that we would indicate to you when we would be ready so that
you could discuss with Lord Justice Taylor the timing of the Inquest. I
will keep you informed of the progress of the enquiries.

 With best wishes.

                                                                             r

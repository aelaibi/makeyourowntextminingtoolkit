Dear Madam

HILLSBOROUGH

We have           had our discussion with Mrs Bashforth's assistant and confirm     that
we have           written to the Coroner to try and establish theextent of      the evidence
required           from Arthur Butler and David Bownes and also to see whether this could
be done           by way of a prepared written statement.

We will           let you know once we have a response.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sir

                   Hillsborough Inquest - Witness Letter

I refer to your letter dated 22nd October, 1990 addressed to the
Principal District Surveyor, Building Surveyor’s Division of the
Sheffield City Council, Mr. A. Butler.

The matters which involved Mr. Butler have been well documented in the
Inquiry transcripts and have been fully explained in a witness statement
prepared and signed by Mr. Butler for the Director of Public
Prosecutions.   This latter document was prepared in the standard witness
statement format and therefore may be used as evidence at the forthcoming
Inquests.

I hope that the Coroner will not find it necessary to require the
attendance of Mr. Butler, but if it is necessary for Mr. Butler to attend
he will do so without a witness summons to deal with issues regarding his
personal involvement.

Yours faithfully




City Solicitor and

West Midlands Police Inquiry into the Hills borough Disaster

At approximately 4.55 p.m. on Monday 23rd April 1990 I spoke to Detective
Superintendent Taylor of West Midlands Police who had called earlier in the
afternoon.

He i n dicated that the West M i d l a n d s Pol i c e had been given the job of carrying
out a criminal inquiry into the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster and had recently submitted
a file to the D i r e c t o r of P u b l i c P r o s e c u t i o n s as I p r o b a b l y knew. I indicated
to h i m that I disco v e r e d this from the local newspaper.

Mr. Taylor indicated that on the D.P.P's instructions I was to be interviewed
as a witness”. I asked him what this meant. He indicated to me that meant that
he was seeking evidence from me as a witness and not as a person who is likely
to be prosecuted.  (I think it will be useful to obtain some further
clarification on this point).

Mr. Taylor inidcated that he wished me to give a statement which would probably
be quite lengthy in connection with the disaster but did not go into significant
detail about what he required.    He said he thought it would probably be useful
to have a preliminary discussion about the statement in the fairly near future
as he was under pressure to proceed with the inquiry.

 I said I thought this would be a good idea and would get back in touch with him
 as soon as possible.

 D e t e c t i v e S u p e r i n t e n d e n t T a y lor's numbers are as follows:-

 021-359-5147 (a direct line) or021-322-6000 extension 6901   to 6904.   I should
 explain that I tried to contact  him on the 6000 number and got nowhere.

 After having discussions with various people I talked to Mr. Taylor three times
 on the morning of Tuesday 24th April and we finally arranged Wednesday 2nd May
 1990 at 10.30 a.m. in the Town Hall for a preliminary discussion about the
 statement. During the course of the conversation Mr. Taylor indicated that h e
 was interested in my role in relation to •'the other Authorities (for example t e
 Fire Service) feho " tupt blank aL LlrtT. jju iul                (4
  7X£          t      4         \s& 'teA'fjLrC'                           i T T kh,

 etc. He also specifically mentioned the question of the removal of barrier 144
 and whether or not I had the authority to authorise the removal of it. I took
 it from the conversation that Mr. Taylor was really interested in all aspects of
 the Council's functioning in respect of Safety of Sports G r o u n d s presumably up
 until the time of the disaster. He also indicated that he may wisn to talk to
 other people within the Council structure who had an involvement.

  In my original conversation with Mr. Taylor he indicated that a statement may,
  take one to two days to prepare-I think this is an under estimate.   If he
  requires full detail then the statement will scarcely be of a lesser lengththan
  the statement I did for the inquiry.

        In the course of these duties I prepare written reports for Council

Committees.             The job also involves liaison with other departments and

outside agencies such as the Fire Service and the Police.

        On 1 April 1986 South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council ceased to

exist by virtue of the Local Government Act 1985.                              The County Council had

responsibility for the discharge of functions under the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975, and these were to be taken over by Sheffield City

Hillsborough.           This entailed the City Council making arrangements to take

over this function.

       I recall that in February/March 1986 I spoke to Mr VAUGHAN of the

County Council who was then dealing with the Safety of Sports Grounds, at

his offices in Barnsley.               I also spoke to the Police and the Fire Service

and Building Surveyors about Safety of Sports Grounds.                           I did not recei-ve

any information to the effect that any serious safety issues were

outstanding.

       In order to establish a framework within which Sheffield City Council

could exercise its functions which would be acquired on 1 April 1986 I
                                                                *
prepared a report which was submitted through the Head of Department, to

the General Purposes Panel which was a sub committee of the Municipal

Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee (referred hereafter as

MEGS) which is in turn a Committee of the City Council.                            The report was

submitted to the Panel on 3 March 1986.                      I produce that report,             (Ref DMB1)

(Ex            ).

       The report "recommended that the following delegations be approved:-

(a)            All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of

               Sports Ground Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes

               Panel;

(b)            The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act

               be delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department

               in consultation with Chairman or Deputy Chairman of this Panel or

               of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme

               Committee as appropriate.

 (c)           The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

               delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department."

      At its meeting on 3 March 1986 the Panel resolved in accordance with

the report.          The minutes of the Panel were subsequently approved by MEGS

at its meeting on 17 March 1986.                       In turn the minutes of MEGS were

approved by the City Council at its meeting on 9 April 1986. I produce an
                     t
extract from the Council Summons dated 9 April 1986 which contains these

minutes (Ref DMB2) (Ex                        ).

      As from the 9 April 1986 the delegations approved by the Panel came

into full legal effect.

      All the County Council files (which consist of some thousands of

documents and plans) in relation to Sports Grounds in Sheffield were
                                                                          *
handed over to me on the demise of the County Council.                                         Consequently I was

able to examine their administrative system more thoroughly before making

a further report to the Panel.

      The Council now having acquired the functions, it was necessary to

establish an administrative system within which it could fulfil its

functions under the legislation.                        To achieve this I prepared a further and

more detailed report which was submitted via the Head of Department to the

Panel on 6 May 1986.                I produce the report (Ref DMB3) (Ex                                      ).

       The Panel considered the report at its meeting on 6 May 1986 and

resolved (amongst other things), "that

       a)      the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

               former South Yorkshire County Council under the Safety of Sports

               Grounds Act 1975 be noted and authority be given for the

               continuation of such system for the time being. "

       The resolution also deals with other non material matters.

       As the Panel had full delegated power to deal with this issue the

resolution took effect immediately.

      As a matter of routine the minutes of the Panel meeting were seen by

MEGS and the City Council.                    I produce an extract from the Council Summons

dated A June 1986 which contains these minutes (Ref DMB4) (Ex                                                           ).

    The administrative system adopted was based on the former County
                     i
Council system and comprised two main components. These were meetings of

an Officer Working Party at which bi-annual inspections of sports grounds

were carried out and meetings of the Working Party on other occasions to

discuss various matters.

      Dealing with the bi-annual inspections these were carried out by

representatives of the Police, the Fire Service and the Building Surveyors

Division of the City Council.-

      Also in attendance would be myself and representatives of the Club.

Inspection^ involved a thorough check of the stadia and the identification

of any defects.                Any defects found were brought to the attention of the

Safety Certificate holder and/or his technical representative if present.

Depending upon the nature of any defect steps were then agreed for

rectification.

       The Officer Working Party meetings comprised representatives of the

same organisations but representatives of the Club or their technical

advisors were not members of it.                        Dr EASTWOOD and/or a representative of

his firm and/or of the Club could of course be present during inspections

and during General Purpose Panel meetings when relevant issues were being

discussed.          I do not recall inviting Dr EASTWOOD,etc. to attend Working

Party or Advisory Group meetings.

       Examination of Officer Working Party minutes pre 1 April 1986 show

that on occasions either Dr EASTWOOD and/or his representative and/or a

 representative of the club attended meetings.                                    I am unable to comment upon

 the extent of the involvement of Dr EASTWOOD^his company or Club

 representatives in the Working Party system prior to 1 April 1986.

     The Officer Working Party, post April 1986, considered all aspects of
                      t
 safety of spectators at sports grounds, acting as a co-ordinating body

which attempted to ensure that a balanced and consistent approach was

maintained to current issues.                    For example the                    provision of disabled

 facilities in the North Stand at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, which

 involved the construction of ramps etc.

       In adopting the administrative system from the County Council the role

 of. the constituent agencies was divided and defined in accordance with a

 schedule drawn up by the County Council.                              This gave responsibility for

,."the carrying out of inspections, re inspections and making final

 technical recommendations..." to ’primary authorities’.                                           For example the

 ’Primary Authority’ for the spacing and strength of barriers and strength

 of perimeter walls and terraces (structural) was the building surveyor and

 for terraces (means of escape) the Fire Service.

       The Council was the prime authority for estimation of safe ground

 capacity.       I produce the schedule which was in force until 1987 (Ref DMB5)

 (Ex         )

       As part of the administrative arrangements the Officer Working Party

 in addition to making "agreements" (for example in respect of work to be

 carried out) could make recommendations to the Panel.                                          Recommendations

 could cover any issue in relation to safety of sports grounds, examples of

 issues in which the working party did make recommendations to the Panel

 involved the South Stand roof and the Spion Kop (both of which are at the

 Hillsborough Stadium).

Continuation ofstatement of   David Malcolm BOWNES



      If the Working Party               were unable to reach agreement on any matter then

it would be referred to the Panel.                        If the Club refused to implement

something agreed by the Working Party then this would be referred to the

Panel.

      Minutes of the Officer Working Party were taken by me due to my

position with the Council.                  So far as my involvement with the Working

Party is concerned I acted as Clerk/Secretary and took the lead as the

occasion demanded although in practice this did not arise very often,

owing to the smooth operation of the Working Party.

      Regarding the reduction of Barrier 144, this arose at the bi-annual

inspection attended by the various agencies at Hillsborough on 7 August

1986.     Representation was made by the Police for two sections of the

barrier in the1ft»£h Central Pen to be removed so that persons entering

the terrace from the tunnel would not be obstructed by it.                                        According to

the Police some difficulties had arisen                           in this area.Following

discussion it was agreed                 by the Officer Working Party                 that the barrier be

reduced.       In attendance at the time that the discussions were taking place

were representatives of EASTWOODS on behalf of the Club, although I am

unable to name the individual(s ).

      During the course of the discussion in regard to the reduction of the

barrier I am unable to recall whether any mention was made on the question

of crowd capacity of this part of the ground.                               My personal notes taken at

the time are not available.

      So far as I am concerned the working party arrived at an "agreement"

which was wholly consistent with past practice and the administrative

procedures briefly described in the report of 6 May 1986.                                     Such

’agreements’ were expressly authorised by resolution 4(a) of the General

Purposes Panel meeting held on 6 May 1986.

       In the period after May 1986 a review was carried out by my department

of the administrative system relating to safety of sports grounds. As
                     i
part of this review consultation took place with the Police, the Fire, the

Building Surveyors Department and the Health and Consumer Services

Department (of the Council).                        This led to a draft report being prepared

and circulated for their comments to these authorities on 3 August 1987 .

I produce a copy o f the l e t t e r circulating the d r a f t to the Fire Brigade

followed the same format.

       Following receipt of replies from the agencies a report was submitted

to the Panel via the Head of Admin and Legal Department on 7 September

1987 which reflected the consultation process.                                          I produce the report (R.ef

DMB7) (Ex                   ).

       A resolution was passed by the Panel on that date and took full legal

effect immediately.                  The minutes of the meeting were passed to MEGS and

the Council for information only.                            I produce an extract from the Council

Summons of 7 October 1987 which includes these minutes (Ref DMB8)

 (Ex           ).     The purpose of the review was to update the administrative

system and to try to clarify and simplify the system.

       The Panel resolved that;

         "a)   the details contained in the report now submitted regarding the

               operation of the Councils Certification function for the safety

               of sports ground*be noted,

              including the establishment of the proposed Safety of Sports

              Grounds Advisory Group comprising representatives of the Building

              Surveyor, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service, the South

              Yorkshire Police and the Director of Environmental Health and
                          i
              Consumer Services to advise the Council on matters relating to

              the Safety of Sports Grounds be approved and

      c)      authority be delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

              Department to deal with all routine matters in connection with

              the administrative system."

      It will be noted that there are minor differences between the

re s o lu tio n   and the recommendations in the report.

      The significant changes arising from the review were that the Health

and Consumer Services Department now had a role, the inspection system was

made annual (instead of bi-annual) and included inspections during

specified activities.             The practical effect of the change to the

inspection system was that written reports were submitted by each

authority to Head of Admin and Legal Department following an inspection.

The Officer Working Party ceased to exist and it was replaced by the

Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group.                      As the report says:            This:-

         "would function as a forum for discussion between officers; its most

regular use would probably be the discussion of items of advice to the

Council before they are finally formulated by the appropriate Authority.

Meetings of the Group would be held at the request of one or more

Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head of Administration and

would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken by each

Authority would be noted.                It is then anticipated that detailed written

      In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep

copies of all relevant correspondence which will be available to all

      The roles of the various agencies were also simplified from those

previously laid down in the schedule referred to (Ref DMB5).                               Thus the

Building Surveyors Department had responsibility relating to the structure

of stadia, including crush barriers, walls etc. and South Yorkshire County

Fire Service were responsible for amongst other things, means of escape

and stadia capacity.              The Health and Consumer Services Department had an

input on Health and Safety matters including First Aid.                              Built into the

system was a general provision for flexibility.                             There was no role in the

Advisory Group for Clubs or Eastwoods.

Administration and Legal Department in relation to "routine" matters.

Interpretation of the phrase "routine matters" is a matter for individual

judgement to be exercised in the circumstances of a particular case.

of the Department during 1986/8^ and his assistant Head of Department was

Mr WEBSTER.

      This administrative system was in force at the time of the

Hillsborough Disaster on 15 April 1989.
                     i
    As far as I am concerned the members of the Officer Working Party and

subsequently the Advisory Group were regarded as the Council’s source of

professional advice in relation to Safety of Sports Grounds matters.                                            The

methods of communication between the authorities comprising the Advisory

Group were general ones, telephone, meetings, memos and letters and this

would include liaison with the Building Surveyors Department.
                                                               *
      Communication with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was on the ssaifc

basis as with the other authorities.

      Dealing with the relationship between the Football Club, the Advisory

Group and the Council, I would describe this as reasonably satisfactory.

The impression I have is that the Club were reasonably safety conscious

and generally complied with requests made of them.                          I am aware that a

number of issues involved more discussion than others but eventually

agreement was reached.

       Post April 1986 when the City Council took possession of the files

from the County Council in regard to the Safety of Sports Grounds I read

through them including the file on Hillsborough Stadium.                            I also read

about this time the Green Guide on Safety at Sports Grounds 1976.                                          There

was a very large amount of paperwork and I cannot specifically recall any

particular issues raised in the files and this includes the erection of

radial fences in the West Terraces in 1981 and 1985 or the crushing in. the

terraces in 1981.

Continuation of statement of   David Malcolm BOWNES



       On 1 April 1986 bearing in mind that the Safety of Sports Grounds

system had been operated for a considerable length of time by a

responsible body (South Yorkshire County Council), I was entitled to

assume (in the absence of any contrary evidence), that the sports grounds
                     i
in Sheffield, including Hillsborough Stadium, were reasonably safe.

       I have been asked to comment on my knowledge of the following issues

in relation to the Leppings Lane terraces of the Hillsborough sports

ground

(a)           The elevation of the tunnel beneath the West Stand;

(b)           The configuration of crush barrier on the terraces;

(c)           They^gates in the perimeter fence;

(d)           The reduction of barrier 14A;

(e)           The capacity on the West terraces;

(f)           The capacity on the Safety Certificate;

(g)           All these issues with regard to the Green                     Guide;

(h)           All these issues pre and post 1 April 1986.

       My comments have been sought on the basis that some or all of issues

(a) to (e) involved variation from the Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds -

the Green Guide.

        It is necessary for me to re-state the following three facts

 (i)          I am not technically qualified;

 (ii)         I was not involved in safety of sports grounds prior to 1 April

               1986;

 (iii)         I am an Administrator.            It follows from these facts that I cannot

               authoritatively comment on any technical issues or on any issues

               pre dating 1 April 1986.

       Bearing in mind my comments, issues (a) to (g) are technical issues

upon which I cannot comment.                      Issue (d) I have commented on elsewhere in,

this statement and in my submission to the Inquiry - and I have nothing to

add.     With regard to issues (e) and (f) I am aware that allegations have

been made that the certificate should (for example) have specified

capacities for the pens on the terraces.                                At no time prior to April 1989

has anyone suggested to me that capacities should be imposed in respect of

the pens.         Had such a suggestion have been made I would have taken

appropriate action (as I did for example in relation to the Spion Kop).

Those changes that had been made, in particular I am thinking of the

erection of radial fences in the West Terrace, in 1981 and 1985, which

could have an effect on capacity, were not brought to my attention either.

       I have also been asked to comment on the questions,                                        "Did the Council

undertake a full survey of each sports ground in Sheffield after 1 April

1986 to discover the extent of compliance/non compliance with the Green

Guide?       If not why not?"

       Up to 1 January 1988 the duties of the Council were set out in the

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (as amended).                                       These duties were

summarised in Annex ’A* to Home Office Circular 7 of 1986 (Ref DMB12)

 (Ex             ) which I produce.               No mention is made of inspections.                                 The 1976

edition of the Green Guide suggests that annual inspections are

appropriate.            (Paragraph 4).

       From 1 January 1988 two more duties were added to the list **»£ the Fire

Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.                                       These are a duty to

enforce the legislation and to carry out inspections.                                           The Home Office

issued statutory guidance on annual inspections, see Home Office Circular

72/1987 (Ref DMB13) (Ex                     ) which I produce.              The Guidance clearly

refers to a limited inspection.

      Bearing in mind these facts there is clearly no obligation on the

council to carry out the type of survey envisaged in the question.

      Bearing in mind that the same authority/personnel were involved pre

and post 1 April 1986 it would also have been unreasonable to carry out a

survey.       Also no authority has indicated that such a survey would be

appropriate.

      The method by which I arranged for reasonable safety to be monitored

at Sports Grounds in Sheffield contained three main elements.                              The first
                                                               *
element is inspections o£ Sports Grounds by professional officers, these

are well documented in the files.                   The second element wej;e the written

communications to working party members in early 1987 asking for their

views on sports ground safety in Sheffield, all communications are

available if required.              The third element was the review of the Safety

of Sports Grounds system covered in the report to the General Purposes

Panel in September 1987 (Ref DMB 7) (Ex                             ).

      Had any of the experts identified any issues relating to^reasonable

safety then the system I have outlined should have encouraged them to

raise them and have them resolved.                    There are examples of such issues on

the Advisory Group notes.                It is also relevant to note that it is the duty

of professional officers involved in                          Licensing System to bring safety

issues to the attention of the Licensing Authority.                             I am aware that the

Green Guide does have a relevance tc^reasonable safety issues as does

other guidance.

      Regarding amendments to Safety Certificates my view is that it is not

necessary to physically alter or amend the original certificate document.

Where amendments are made by the council in accordance with legislation it

is sufficient that notice procedures as specified (in the Safety of Sports

Grounds Regulations) are followed.                   This involves notifying by letter

various parties involved and notices in the Press.                          With regard to the

increase in capacity for the Spion Kop this procedure was followed with

the exception of the notice in the press.

      As part of the third element referred to previously the Safety

Certificate conditions were reviewed on two separate occasions, the second

and most detailed draft being circulated to the authorities for comment on
                                                               *
s30 March 1989.           I produce the letter, to the Chief Fire Officer, together

with the draft conditions (Ref DMB 9) (Ex                             ).   A similar letter/

memorandum and draft were sent to the other authorities.

      At the time the second draft which considered crowd capacity was

circulated no amendment to the crowd capacity in the West Terrace was

proposed.         Obviously officers comments on the draft, which may have

included reference to capacities, were not made prior to the disaster

occurring on the 15 April 1989.

      The Council as the licensing authority have a duty to enforce within

their area the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

regulations made under it and for that purpose, to arrange for the

periodical inspection of designated Sports Grounds.                          In carrying out the

functions I have described I consider that they (the Council) have

fulfilled their duty.

      The report recommended that all the powers and duties of the City

     something agreed by the working party then this would be referred to the

         b)    the revised administration system set out in the. report,

               including the establishment of the proposed Safety of Sports

               Grounds Advisory Group comprising representatives of the building

               Surveyor, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service, the South

               Yorkshire Police and the Director of Environmental Health and

               Consumer Services to advise the Council on matters relating to

               the Safety of Sports Ground's be approved and

         c)    authority be delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

<^             Department to deal with all routine matters in connection with

               the administrative system.

         It will be noted that there are minor differences between the

resolution and the recommendations in the report.

         The significant changes arising from the review are that the Health

and Consumer Services Department now have a role, the inspection system

aieyrsd       lo   annual nverr^bi-annual^and included inspections during specified

activities.          The practical >cffect of the change to the inspection system

was that written reports were submitted by each authority to ae' foiicving

an inspection.           The officer working party ceased to exist and j.?■..was ■-.

replaced by the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group.                    This would

function as a forum for discussion between officers, its most regular use

would probably be the discussion of items of' advice to the Council before

they are finally formulated by the advising authority.

      .and stadia capacity.                      The Health and Consumer Services Department had an

        input on Health and Safety matters including First Aid.                                               Built into the

       I am employed by Sheffield City Council in the Admin and Legal

Department as Chief Licensing Officer.                        I have been employed by the City

Council since September 1971 and have held my current post since 11 July
                                t
1977.      I have a HNC in Public Administration.

       My job entails the management of the licensing section which deals

with 33 licensing systems including taxis, private hire vehicles,

operators and drivers, cinemas, theatres and places of public

entertainment as well as the safety of sports grounds licensing system.

       In the course of these duties I prepare written reports for Council

Committees, the job involves liaison with other departments and outside

agencies such as Fire and Police.

       On 1 April 1986 South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council ceased to

exist by virtue of the Local Government Act 1985.                              The County Council had

responsibility for the discharge of functions under the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975, these were to be taken over bySheffield                                  CityCouncil in

This entailed the City Council making arrangements to take over this

function.

      I recall that in February/March 1986 I spoke to Mr VAUGHAN of the

County Council then dealing with the Safety of Sports Grounds, at his

offices in Barnsley.             I also spoke to Police and Fire Officers in

Sheffield.

      In order to establish a framework within which Sheffield City Council

could exercise its functions which would be acquired on 1 April 1986 I

prepared a report which was submitted through the Head of Department.                                   The

report was submitted to the General Purposes Panel which was a sub

committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme

Committee (referred hereafter as MEGS) which is in turn a Committee of the

City Council.          The report was submitted to the Panel on 3 March 1986.                           I

produce that report,            (Ref DMB1) (Ex               ).

      The report recommended that all the powers and duties of the City

Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the

General Purposes Panel.              Further that the powers under Sections 10 and 11

of the Act which deal with Emergency Procedure Powers and the Power to

authorise Officers respectively be delegated to the Head of the Admin and

Legal Department.             The power under Section 10 had a consultation

recommendation.

      At its meeting on 3 March 1986 the Panel resolved in accordance with

the report.         The minutes of the Panel were subsequently approved by MEGS

at its meeting on 17 March 1986.                  In turn the minutes of MEGS were

approved by the City Council at its meeting on 9 April 1986.                               I produce an

extract from the Council Summons dated 9 April 1986 (Ref DMB2) (Ex                                          ).

      The effect of this decision making process was that as from the 9

April 1986 the delegations approved by the Panel came into full legal

effect.

      All the County Council files in relation to Sports Grounds in

Sheffield were handed over to me on the demise of the County Council.

Consequently I was able to examine their administrative system more

thoroughly before making a further report to the Panel.

      The Council now having acquired the functions, it was necessary to

establish an administrative system within which they could fulfil its

functions under the legislation.                     To achieve this I prepared a further and

more detailed report which was submitted via the Head of Department to the

Panel.       I produce the report (Ref DMB3) (Ex                              ).

       The Panel considered the report at its meeting on 6 May 1986 and

resolved, "that

       a)      the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

               former South Yorkshire County Council under the Safety of Sports

               Grounds Act 1975 be noted and authority be given for the

               continuation of such system for the time being.

       b)      the position of the Health and Safety Executive in the matter be

               noted and the Head of Administration and Legal Department be

               requested.

       i)      to keep the Executive informed of all matters relating to sports

               ground safety.

     ii)       to consult the Association of Metropolitan Authorities on the

               involvement of the Health and Safety Executive and

    iii)       to maintain consultation on the safety of sports ground policy

               with the other District Councils in South Yorkshire.

      c)      the head of Administration and Legal Department be requested to

              draft new safety certificate conditions in consultation with

               other appropriate authorities for approval by the Council and

               Legal Department be requested to report back on the Councils

               estimated costs in the matter.

      As the Panel had full delegated power to deal with this issue the
                         £
resolution took affect immediately.

      As a matter of routine the minutes of the Panel meeting were seen by

MEGS and the City Council.                  I produce an extract from the Council Summons

(Ref DMB4) (Ex                  ).

       The administrative system adopted was based on the formal County

Council system and comprised two main components.                              These were bi-annual

inspections of sports grounds and meetings of an officer working party.

       Dealing with the bi-annual inspections these were carried out by

representatives of, Police, Fire Service, Building Surveyors, Division of

the City Council.

       Also in attendance could be myself and representatives of the Club.

It involved a thorough inspection of the stadia and the identification of

any defects.           Any defects found were brought to the attention of the

Safety Certificate holder and his technical representative if present.

Depending upon the nature of any defect steps were then agreed for

rectification.

       The officer working party comprised of representatives of the same

organisations but representatives of the Club or their technical advisors

were not invited as a matter of course.                              Having said this I can recall at

least one occasion when Dr EASTWOOD or a representative of his firm and a

club representative were invited to attend an officer working party

meeting which dealt with




      Examination of officer working party minutes pre 1 April 1986 show

that on occasions either Dr EASTWOOD and/or his representative and/or a

representative of the club attended meetings.                                  I am unable to comment upon

the extent of the involvement of Dr EASTWOOD and his company in the

working party system prior to 1 April 1986.

       The officer working party, post April 1986, considered all aspects of

safety of spectators at sports grounds, acting as a co-ordinating body

which attempted to ensure that a balanced and consistent approach was

maintained to current issues ie provision of disabled facilities in the

North Stand at Sheffield Wednesday FC, which involved the construction of

ramps etc.

       In adopting the administrative system from the County Council the role

of the constituent agencies was divided and defined in accordance with a

schedule drawn up by the County Council.                                This gave responsibility for the

terraces, structural and means of escape to the Building Surveyors

Department and Fire Brigade respectively as the prime authorities.

       The Building Surveyors Department was also the prime authority for the

spacing of crush barriers and the strength of those barriers and perimeter

walls.       The Council was the prime authority for estimation of safe ground

capacity.         I produce the schedule (Ref DMB5) (Ex                               ).

      As part of the administrative arrangements the officer working party

in addition to making agreements (for example in respect of work to be

carried out) could make recommendations to the Panel.                                 Recommendations

could cover any issue in relation to safety of sports grounds, examples of

issues in which the working party did make recommendations to the Panel

involved the South Stand roof and the Spion Kop at Sheffield Wednesday.

      If the working party were unable to reach agreement on any matter then

it would be referred to the Panel.                             If the Club refused to implement

something agreed by the working party then this would be referred to the

Panel.

      Minutes of the officer working party were taken by me due to my

position with the Council.                  So far as my involvement with the working

party is concerned I acted as Clerk/Secretary and took the lead as the

occasion demanded although in practice this did not arise very often.

      Regarding the removal of Barrier 144, this arose at the bi-annual

inspection attended by the various agencies at Hillsborough on 7 August

1986.      Representation was made by the Police for two sections of the

barrier in the North Central Pen to be removed so that persons entering

the terrace from the tunnel would not be obstructed by it.                                 According to

the Police some difficulties had arisen in this area.                                 Following

discussion it was agreed by the officer working party that the barrier be

reduced.         In attendance at the time that the discussions were taking place

were representatives of EASTWOODS on behalf of the Club, although I am

unable to name the individual.

       During the course of the discussion in regard to the reduction of the

barrier I am unable to recall whether any mention was made on the question

of crowd capacity of this part of the ground.                            My personal notes taken at

the time are not available.

      So far as I am concerned the working party arrived at an agreement

which was wholly consistent with past practice and the administrative

procedures briefly described in the report of 6 May 1986 and in accordance

with the resolution 4(a) of the General Purposes Panel meeting held on 6

May 1986.

      In the period after May 1986 a review was carried out by my department

of the administrative system relating to safety of sports grounds.                                            As

part of this review consultation took place with Police, Fire, Building

Surveyors Department and Health and Consumer Services Department (of the

Council).         This lead to a draft report being prepared and circulated to

these authorities on 3 August 1987                   and asked for their comments on the

draft report.            I produce a copy of         the letter circulating the draft to                           the

Fire Brigade (Ref DMB6) (Ex                      ), letters to the other agencies followed

the same format.

       Following receipt of replies from the agencies a report was submitted

to the Panel via the Head of Admin and Legal Services Department on 7

September 1987 which reflected the                   consultation process.                I produce the

report (Ref DMB7) (Ex                    ).

       A resolution was passed by the Panel on that date and took full legal

effect immediately.              I produce an extract from the Council Summons (Ref

DMB8) (Ex                ).    The purpose of the review was to update the

administrative system and to try to clarify and simplify the system.

              operation of the Councils Certification function for the safety

               of sports ground be noted.

      b)       the revised administration system set out in the report,

               including the establishment of the proposed Safety of Sports

               Grounds Advisory Group comprising representatives of the building

               Surveyor, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service, the South

               Yorkshire Police and the Director of Environmental Health and

               Consumer Services to advise the Council on matters relating to

               the Safety of Sports Grounds be approved and

       c)      authority be delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

               Department to deal with all routine matters in connection with

               the administrative system.

       It will be noted that there are minor differences between the

resolution and the recommendations in the report.

       The significant changes arising from the review axe that the Health

and Consumer Services Department now have a role, the inspection system

altered to annual not bi-annual and included inspections during specified
                                        .in­
activities.          The practical effect of the change to the inspection system

was that written reports were submitted by each authority to me following

an inspection.            The officer working party ceased to exist and it was

replaced by the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group.                            This           Id
        aA
function as a forum for discussion between officers, its most regular use

they are finally formulated by the advising authority.

      Meetings of the Advisory Group would be held at the request of the

agencies and on the receipt of a request the Admin and Legal Services

Department would arrange a meeting and circulate a list of items to be

discussed.

      At the conclusion of the meeting a further list of items would be

prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken by each agency would

be noted.         It is then anticipated that detailed written advice would be

provided by those agencies and be acted upon as appropriate.                               Copies of

correspondence were retained by the Admin and Legal Department.

      The roles of the various agencies were also simplified from those

previously laid down in the schedule referred to (Ref DMB5).                               Thus the

Building Surveyors Department had responsibility relating to the structure

of stadia, including crush barriers, walls etc and South Yorkshire County

Fire Service were responsible for amongst other things, means of escape

and stadia capacity.              The Health and Consumer Services Department had an

input on Health and Safety matters including First Aid.                           Built into the

system was a general provision for flexibility.

      Dealing with the delegation given by the Panel to the Head of Admin

and Legal Services Department in relation to routine matters.

Interpretation of the phrase "routine matters" is a matter for individual

judgement in the circumstances in a particular case.                          Generally the

operation of the delegated power is very similar to that in other

licensing systems, operated by the Council.                        Taking account of my

responsibilities as Chief Licensing Officer, I operated the day to day

running of the system on behalf of the Head of Admin and Legal Services

Department.          Mr PENSAM, now retired, was the Head of the Department during

1986/87 and his assistant Head of Department was Mr WEBSTER.

Football Club.            This entailed the City Council making arrangements to take

over this function.

      I         recall that in February/March 1986 I spoke to Mr VAUGHAN of the

County Council then dealing with the Safety of Sports Grounds, at his

offices in Barnsley.              I also spoke to Police and Fire Officers in

Sheffield.

      In order to establish a framework within which Sheffield City Council

could exercise its functions which would be acquired on 1 April 1986 I

prepared a report which was submitted through the Head of Department.                                      The

report was submitted to the General Purposes Panel which was a sub

committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services 'Programme

Committee (referred hereafter as MEGS) which is in turn a Committee of the

City Council.            The report was submitted to the Panel on 3 March 1986.                            I

produce that report, (Ref DMB1) (Ex                               ).

       The report recommended that all the powers and duties of the City

Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the

General Purposes Panel.                 Further that the powers under Sections 10 and 11

of the Act which deal with Emergency Procedure Powers and the Power to

authorise Officers respectively be delegated to the Head of the Admin and

Legal Department.              The power under Section 10 had a consultation

recommendation.

       At its meeting on 3 March 1986 the Panel resolved in accordance with

the report.           The minutes of the Panel were subsequently approved by MEGS

at its meeting on 17 March 1986.                        In turn the minutes of MEGS were

approved by the City Council at its meeting on 9 April 1986.                                I produce an

extract from the Council Summons dated 9 April 1986 (Ref DMB2)                                 (Ex.            ).

      The effect of this decision making process was that as from the 9

April 1986 the delegations approved by the Panel came into full legal

effect.

      All the County Council files in relation to Sports Grounds in

Sheffield were handed over to me on the demise of the County Council.

Consequently I was able to examine their administrative system more

thoroughly before making a further report to the Panel.

      The Council now having acquired the functions, it was necessary to

establish an administrative system within which they could fulfil its

functions under the legislation.                    To achieve this I prepared a further and

more detailed report which was submitted via the Head of Department to the

Panel.       I produce the report (Ref DMB3) (Ex                              ).

       The Panel considered the report at its meeting on 6 May 1986 and

resolved,        "that

       a)      the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

               former South Yorkshire County Council under the Safety of Sports

               Grounds Act 1975 be noted and authority be given for the

               continuation of such system for the time being.

       The resolution also deals with other non material matters.

       As the Panel had full delegated power to deal with this issue the

resolution took affect immediately.

       As a matter of routine the minutes of the Panel meeting were seen by

MEGS and the City Council.                  I produce an extract from the Council Summons

 (Ref DMB4)        (Ex          ).

       The administrative system adopted was based on the formal County

Council system and comprised two main components.                                  These were bi-annual

inspections of sports grounds and meetings of an officer working party.

      Dealing with the bi-annual inspections these were carried out by

representatives of, Police, Fire Service, Building Surveyors, Division of

the City Council.

      Also in attendance could be myself and representatives of the Club.

It involved a thorough inspection of the stadia and the identification of

any defects.           Any defects found were brought to the attention of the

Safety Certificate holder and his technical representative if present.

Depending upon the nature of any defect steps were then agreed for

rectification.

      The officer working party meetings comprised of representatives of the

same organisations but representatives of the Club or their technical

advisors were not invited as a matter of course after 1 April 1986.                                       Dr

EASTWOOD or a representative of his firm and a club representative were

present at inspections carried out by the officer working party.

       Examination of officer working party minutes pre 1 April 1986 show

that on occasions either Dr EASTWOOD and/or his representative and/or a

representative of the club attended meetings.                             I am unable to comment upon

the extent of the involvement of Dr EASTWOOD and his company in the

working party system prior to 1 April- 1986.

       The officer working party, post April 1986, considered all aspects of

safety of spectators at sports grounds, acting as a co-ordinating body

which attempted to ensure that a balanced and consistent approach was

maintained to current issues ie provision of disabled facilities in the

North Stand at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, which involved the

construction of ramps etc.

      In adopting the administrative system from the County Council the role

of the constituent agencies was divided and defined in accordance with a

schedule drawn up by the County Council.                       This gave responsibility for the

terraces, structural and means of escape to the Building Surveyors

Department and Fire Brigade respectively as the prime authorities.

      The Building Surveyors Department was also the prime authority for the

spacing of crush barriers and the strength of those barriers and perimeter

walls.       The Council was the prime authority for estimation of safe ground

capacity.         I produce the schedule (Ref DMB5) (Ex                       ).

      As part of the administrative arrangements the officer working party

in addition to making agreements (for example in respect of work to be

carried out) could make recommendations to the Panel.                           Recommendations

could cover any issue in relation to safety of sports grounds, examples of

issues in which the working party did make recommendations to the Panel

involved the South Stand roof and the Spion Kop at Sheffield Wednesday.

       If the working party were unable to reach agreement on any matter then

it would be referred to the Panel.                   If the Club refused to implement

something agreed' by the working party then this would be referred to the

Panel.

       Minutes of the officer working party were taken by me due to my

position with the Council.                 So far as my involvement with the working

party is concerned .I acted as Clerk/Secretary and took the lead as the

occasion demanded although in practice this did not arise very often.

       Regarding the removal of Barrier 144, this arose at the bi-annual

inspection attended by the various agencies at Hillsborough on 7 August

1986.       Representation was made by the Police for two sections of the

barrier in the North Central Pen to be removed so that persons entering

the terrace from the tunnel would not be obstructed by it.                             According.to

the Police some difficulties had arisen in this area.                             Following

discussion it was agreed by the officer working party that the barrier be

reduced.        In attendance at the time that the discussions were taking place

were representatives of EASTWOODS on behalf of the Club, although I am

unable to name the individual.

      During the course of the discussion in regard to the reduction of th.e

barrier I am unable to recall whether any mention was made on the question

of crowd capacity of this part of the ground.                             My personal notes taken at

the time are not available.

      So far as I am concerned the working party arrived at an agreement

which was wholly consistent with past practice and the administrative

procedures briefly described in the report of 6 May 1986 and in accordance

with the resolution 4(a) of the General Purposes Panel meeting held on 6

May 1986.

      In the period after May 1986 a review was carried out by my department

of the administrative system relating to safety of sports grounds.                                          As

part of this review consultation took place with Police, Fire, Building

Surveyors Department and Health and Consumer Services Department (of the

Council).         This lead to a draft report being prepared and circulated to

these authorities on 3 August 1987 for their comments.                             I produce a copy

of the letter circulating the draft to the Fire Brigade (Ref DMB6)

(Ex            ), letters to the other agencies followed the same format.

      Following receipt of replies from the agencies a report was submitted

to the Panel via the Head of Admin and Legal Services Department on 7

September 1987 -which reflected the consultation process.                                         I produce tne

report (Ref DMB7)              (Ex          )   •




      A resolution was passed by the Panel on that date and took fuxl legal

effect immediately.                  The minutes of the meeting were passed to MEGS and

the Council for information only.                        I produce an extract from the Council

Summons dated 7 October 1987 (Ref DMB8) (Ex                                        ).     The purpose of the

review was to update the administrative system and to try to clarify and

simplify the system.

       The Panel resolved that?

       a)      the details contained in the report now submitted regarding the

               operation of the Councils Certification function for the sa>                                               y

                of sports ground be noted.

       b)       the revised administration system set out in the report,

                including the establishment of the proposed Safety of Sports

                Grounds Advisory Group comprising representatives of the building

                Surveyor, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service, the South

                Yorkshire Police and the Director of Environmental Health and

                Consumer Services to advise the Council on matters relating to

                the Safety of Sports Grounds be approved and

        c)      authority be delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

                Department to deal with all routine matters in connection with

                the administrative system.

        It will be noted that there are minor differences between the

  resolution and the recommendations in the report.

        The significant changes arising from the review are that the Healtii

  and Consumer Services Department now have a role, the inspection system

altered to annual not bi-annual and included inspections during specified

activities.          The practical affect of the change to the inspection system

was that written reports were submitted by each authority to me following

an inspection.            The officer working party ceased to exist and it was

replaced by the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group.                            This would

function as a forum for discussion between officers, its most regular use

would probably be the discussion of items of advice to the Council before

they are finally formulated by the advising authority.

      Meetings of the Advisory Group would be held at the request of the

agencies and on the receipt of a request the Admin and Legal Services

Department .,wo;uld arrange a meeting and circulate a list of items to b*                                    -

discussed.

      At the conclusion of the meeting a further list of items would be

prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken by each agency would

be noted.         It is then anticipated that detailed written advice would be

provided by those agencies and be acted upon as appropriate.                               Copies of

correspondence were retained by the Admin and Legal Department.

      The roles of the various agencies were also simplified from those

previously laid down in the schedule referred to (Ref DMB5).                               Thus the

Building Surveyors Department had responsibility relating to the structure

of stadia, including crush barriers, walls etc and South Yorkshire County

Fire Service were responsible for amongst other things, means of escape

and stadia capacity.              The Health and Consumer Services Department had an

input on Health and Safety matters including First Aid.                            Built into the

system was a general provision for flexibility.

      The situation so far as Eastwoods and the club were concerned remained

the same as the officer working party post April 1986.

      Dealing with the delegation given by the Panel to the Head of Admin

and Legal Services Department in relation to routine matters.

Interpretation of the phrase "routine matters" is a matter for individual

judgement in the circumstances in a particular case.                          Generally the

operation of the delegated power is very similar to that in other

licensing systems, operated by the Council.                        Taking account of my

responsibilities as Chief Licensing Officer, I operated the day to day

running of the system on behalf of the Head of Admin and Legal Services

•Department.         Mr PENSAM, now retired, was the Head of the Department during

1986/87 and his assistant Head-of- Department was Mr WEBSTER.

      This administrative system was in force at the time of the

Hillsborough Disaster on 15 April 1989.

      As far as 1 am concerned the Officer Working Party and subsequently

the Advisory Group were regarded as the Council’s source of professional

advice in relation to Safety of Sports Grounds matters.                           The methods of

communication between the authorities comprising the Advisory Group were

general ones, telephone, meetings, memos and letters and this would

include liaison with the Building Surveyors Department.

         Communication with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was on the same '

basis as with the other authorities.

      Dealing with the relationship between the Football Club, the Advisory

Group and the Council, I would describe this as reasonably satisfactory.

The impression I have is that the Club were reasonably safety conscious

and generally complied with requests made of them.                         I am aware that a

number of issues involved more discussion than others but eventually

agreement was reached.

         Post April 1986 when the City Council took possession of the files

from the County Council in regard to the Safety of Sports Grounds I did

read through them including the file on Hillsborough Stadium.                                I also read

about this time the Green Guide on Safety at Sports Grounds 1976.                                     There

was a very large amount of paperwork and I cannot specifically recall any

particular issues and this includes the erection of radial fences in the

West Terraces in 1981 and 1985 or the crushing in the terraces in 1981.

On 1 April 1986 bearing in mind that the Safety of Sports Grounds system

had been operated for a considerable length of time by a responsible body

(South Yorkshire County Council),-“I was reasonably entitled to assume in

the absence of any contrary evidence, that the sports grounds in

Sheffield, including Hillsborough Stadium, were reasonably safe.

              MR BOWNES TO DRAFT INTO STATEMENT SOMETHING TO COVER KNOWLEDGE OF

              THE ELEVATION IN TUNNEL INTO CENTRAL PENS, BARRIER CONFIGURATION

              SCHEDULE 3 OF SAFETY CERTIFICATE.

         The method by which I arranged for reasonable safety to be monitored

at Sports Grounds in Sheffield contained three main elements.                               The first

element is inspections of Sports Grounds by professional officers, these

are well documented in the files.                        The seco.nd element was the written

communications to worsting party members in early 1987 asking for their

views on sports ground safety in Sheffield, all communications are

available ir required,                Tne third element was the review of the Safety

of Sports Grounds system covered in the report to the General Purposes

Panel in September 1937              (Ref DMB 7) (Ex               ).

         Had any of the experts identified any issues relating to reasonable

safety then the system I have outlined should have encouraged them to do

so.       I am aware that the Green Guide does have a relevance to reasonable

safety issues.

      Regarding amendments to the Safety Certificate my view is that it is

not necessary to physically alter or amend the original certificate

document.        Where amendments are made by the council in accordance with

legislation it is sufficient that notice procedures as specified are

followed.        This involves notifying by letter various parties involved and

notices in the Press.              With regard to the increase in capacity for the

Spion Kop this procedure was followed with the exception of the notice in

the press.

      As part of the third element referred to previously the Safety

Certificate conditions were reviewed on two separate occasions, the second

and most detailed draft being circulated to the authorities for comment on

30 March 1989.           I produce the letter, to the Chief Fire Officer, together

with the draft conditions (Ref DMB 9) (Ex                               ).   A similar letter and

draft were sent to the other authorities.

         The Council as the licensing authority have a duty to enforce within,

their area the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

regulations made under it and for that purpose, to arrange for the

periodical inspection of designated Sports Grounds.                            In carrying out the

functions I have described I consider that they, the Council have

fulfilled their duty.

              1ST APRIL 1 9 8 6 WHEN SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL FIRST TOOK OVER THE

              RESPONSIBILITY.

      A written submission was prepared by me and submitted to Lord Justice

TAYLOR’S enquiry onbehalf of Sheffield                    CityCouncil.This submission

deals in       detail with many of the           issues dealt with inthis statement                        and

should be read in conjunction with it.                     I produce a copy of the submission

(Ref DMB       10) (Ex            ).

         Subsequent to the submission, I gave evidence to the TAYLOR eiiquiry on

27 and 28 June 1989.             I produce a copy-of the transcript of my evidence

(Ref DMB       11) (Ex            ).

         The transcript is the truth although some points needed clarification

which I have made in this statement.                    I am content that the submission and

transcript be used in any proceedings.

INTERVIEW OF DAVID BOWNES - CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION - HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY -
30T:l HAY 1990________________________________________________________________

The meeting coaEenced at 2.00 p.m. at Graysons, Solicitors.       Present at the
meeting wsre:-

Superintendent Taylor and Chief Inspector Tope of West Midlands Police
David Bownes
Frances wood’nead Admin and Legal Department Sheffield City Council
Jonathan Bennett from Graysons representing David Bownes' interests.

Superintendent Taylor opened the interview by explaining that the purpose of the
statement was to obtain information from David which would enable him to take
issues up in other areas, for example with the Club. He said that he proposed
to refer to 3 documents, namely documents 24, 25 and 26 attached to the
statement David made to the Inquiry before Lord Justice Taylor together with
references to David's written submissions commencing at paragraph 44. He also
indicated that he would like to see Roger Pensam or his superior and the
•Building Surveyor who dealt with issues post 1986.

The statement was then proceeded with. The interview was concluded at
approximately 5.10 p.m.. We resumed at 9.45 a.m. on 1st June 1990 and continued
to deal with the matter.

At- the end of the meeting, Superintendent Taylor indicated that there were one
or two issues he still wished to pursue and it was agreed that the interview
would therefore continue on Thursday 7th June when he hoped to finalise David's
statement. He wants to discuss the content of various schedules which specify
the.^areas in which the individual agencies were to be responsible, the
responsibility of Eastwoods in procedures and the function of the Working
Party.

He supplied David with a copy of the statement so far. David is going to check
this in consultation with his solicitor. David also supplied myself and Liz
Eas’
   nforth with a copy. A typed copy will be available from West Midlands Police
on Monday morning.

Superintendent Taylor indicated that he hoped to finalise David's statement
within the next two weeks and he would then move on to interview Arthur Butler
in connection with the installation of radial fences, the removal of barrier
144 and whether any consideration was given to the  possible affect on capacity
ot the ground. He will also wish to interview him in connection with David
Bownes' role within the Advisory Group.

He also requires a statement from Mark Webster and would be happy for Mark
Webster to prepare a statement for submission to him dealing with the following
issues:-

With respect to the period Arpil 1986 to September 1987,

      (i)      What authority was delegated to David Bownes, and how was this done?
               (i.e. Verbally, in writing or simply by virtue of the fact that David
               Bownes was the author of reports and attended the General Purposes
               Panel.)
            (ii)   With regard to the removal of barrier 144, did David Bownes/the
                   Working Party's authority extend to that or should it have gone
                   to Committee?

With respect to the period post September 1987, the same questions as above and
additionally, what was the extent of David Bownes' authority in connection with
safety certificates, how were they amended, how were amendments implemented
(i.e. was there a change to the body of the licence or merely an appendage by
way of the letters and how should this be done as a matter of practice?)

He also wishes to explore Mark Webster's interpretation of "routine matters" as
referred to in the report of September 1987.

I agreed that I would mention these matters to Mark Webster and we would
indicate next week to Superintendent Taylor whether Mr. Webster would prefer to
deal with them during an interview or by way of a statement.

V’ith effect from 1st April 1986, the City Council will be responsible as
Licensing Authority for the administration of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
 1985 in place of the South Yorkshire County Council. This preliminary report is
intended to inform Members as to the basic framework of the Act and the
delegations required to carry out the Council's functions.

A detailed report will be presented to the next meeting of the Panel by which
time investigations into the current licensing system will be complete.

The Home Office have provided a useful summary of the duties of Licensing
Authorities and a summary of the Act itself; both these documents are attached
to this Report for members to consider.

Following the Bradford disaster, the importance of the provision of a sufficient
level of safety at sports grounds has been highlighted; the responsibility of
the Council in this regard should not be underestimated.

Members will probably be aware that the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into
Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Ground (the Popplewell Report) yas recently
published and a copy of its recommendations are attached to this Report for
information.

Summary and recommendations

A more detailed report will be submitted to the Panel as soon as possible but
in the meantime it is recommended that the following delegations be approved

(a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports Ground
      Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel;

(b)   The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be
      delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in
      consultation with Chairman or Deputy Chairman of this Panel or of the
      Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as
      appropriate.

(c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Actbe delegated      to
      the Head of Administration and Legal Department.

REPORT OF THE H E A D OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO T H E GENERAL
PURPOSES PANEL

                               Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Introduction

The Panel will recall that a report was submitted to the March 1986 Meeting

covering the general safety of sports grounds legislation as it affects the City

Council.         This follow-up report aims to deal in detail with the current

situation in Sheffield as inherited from the South Yorkshire County Council.

There are 2 sports grounds currently subject to the legislation - Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club and Sheffield United Football Club; the Owlerton Sports

Stadium is likely to be made subject to the legislation shortly.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club - Hillsborough

The Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited was designated as requiring a

Safety Certificate in August 1978 and such a Certificate was issued by the

County Council on 21st December, 1979.         The Stadium is currently undergoing

major works which, when complete, will form a roof .over the.Spion Kop and thus -

substantially improve the accommodation for spectators.

Sheffield United Football Club, Bramall Lane

The Club was designated as requiring a certificate in August 1984 but to date

a certificate has not been issued as there are outstanding works to be

co m p leted .   The County Council took the view that the certificate should only be

issued as and when the Ground was up to the appropriate safety standard and not

before.      This procedure effectively insured chat the terms of the Safety

Certificate were not breached as soon as it was issued.            It is hoped that the

Council will be in a position to issue a certificate before the start of the

1986/87 season.

Owlerton Sports Stadium

It is understood that the Home Secretary will shortly be designating the Stadium

as requiring a Safety Certificate in accordance with the Popplewell Report

recommendations.         It will, therefore, be necessary to arrange for a full
going to be required to raise the standard of the Stadium to appropriate levels.

The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but is currently

leased to the Owlerton Sports Stadium Limited.   This Lease will expire on 1st

November, 1987.

Safety Certificate Standard Conditions

At the moment the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are

standardised throughout South Yorkshire and both the Police and the Fire Service

have indicated that they would wish this situation to continue for reasons of

administrative simplicity.    The Conditions do, however, give some cause   for

concern, as they appear to   be inadequate or inappropriate in someareas.     The

drafting of these Conditions is of particular importance as it is a serious

criminal offence to contravene any of them punishable by the Statutory Maximum

Fine (Currently £2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.


It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate, and to

submit them to the Panel for approval.   The Sheffield Wednesday Certificate

would then be replaced in accordance with Section 4 (1) (b) of the Act.      The

Sheffield United Certificate could then be issued with the new conditions before

the start of the 1986/87 season.    The re-drafted conditions would, of course, be

submitted to the Fire Service, the Police and Building Surveyor for comment;

other authorities in South Yorkshire could also be involved in this process.

Existing Administrative Arrangements

The County Council system for administering the Act is based    on 2 main

components - (a) bi-annualinspections of the Stadium; and (b) meetings      or an

officer working party.   The bi-annual inspections consist of representatives

from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections of the

Stadia and the identifying of any defects.    These defects are at the time or the

visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

representative if one is present.    Depending or. the nature of the raults round
to rectify them or so arrange matters that no risk to the public occurs.         The

Working Party consists of representatives from the Police, Fire Service,

Building Surveyors and the County Council - it considers in detail various

matters (such ar. tr.e Soion Kop development at Sheffield Wednesday Football

Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.         The

Working Farty is effectively a co-ordinating body which attempts to ensure that

a balanced and consistent approach is maintained to current issues at the Sports

Grounds.    Any recommendations it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.

The Health and Safety Executive

Recommendation 9 of The Popplewell Committee's Interim Report read as follows

"There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety Executive and

the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and

communicate their inspections and reports”.    Bearing this in mind the local

office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to participate in the

administrative system for safety at sports grounds.      This invitation was

declined.    The Executive will apparently take no direct part in the

Certification system.

In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and the position

explained; it appears that negotiations are under way between the Home Office

and the KSE about Popplewell's recommendation but as yet there has been no

useful outcome.

In these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety Executive

informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite their comments on them.

It would then be the responsibility of the Executive to decide whether or not to

respond.

Fees

The basis on which fees may be charged is set out in Regulation 14 of the Safety

of Sports Grounds Regulations 197 6 wnicn states   1^.    A local authority may
4.

amendment of safety certificates but such fees shall not in a particular case

exceed an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."     Th

South Yorkshire County Council did not fix any fees under the Regulation

apparently as a matter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

which of the following options to adopt:- (a) state as a matter or policy that

no fees will be charged in respect of Safety of Sports Grounds legislation or

(b) decide in principle to fix fees and to ask for a report back on the costs

to the Council.

Conclusion

The Panel is asked to:-

(a)   Note the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

      County Council and authorise its continuation for the time being;

(b) -Note the position of the Health and Safety Executive and request the Head

      of Administration and Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

      all matters relating to sports ground safety;

(c)   Request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to draft new

      safety certificate conditions in consultation with the appropriate

      authorities approval by the Council;

(d)   Either resolve that no fees will be charged under the legislation or

      request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to report on the

      Council's costs in this respect.

REPORT OF THZ HZ AD Or ADMINISTRATION ASP LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GENERAL
PURPOSES PANEL

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENT SITUATION AND PROPOSALS FOR THg
FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNCIL'S CERTIFICATION-FUNCTION ,

Introduction

The Panel will recall that on 1st April 1936 the City Council inherited rrc~ tr.e
South Yorkshire County Council the role or certificating Autr.ority unaer -he
1975 Act. The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adequate stancaras oz
safety at designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at tr.i zorent
— Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sherrield United rootba.il. uj.ub., ar.3 tr.e
Owlerton Sports Stadium.  A detailed report on the Act and its application i~
Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th May 1986.

The Current Situation

The Panel at its meeting in May 1986 identified several main areas for further
investigation.

Firstly it was accepted at the time that the broad outlines of the
administrative system organised by the County Council should be continued for
the time being. This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
reorganisation is detailed later in this report.

The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be kept informed of
all natters relating to sports ground safety and that the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the HSE's involvement. As far as
keeping the HSE informed of safety developments at the stadia the Executive made
it fairly plain that they would not make any comments.  The.practice vas
therefore discontinued. The involvement of the AMA in the ESE issue has been
somewhat forestalled by action at central Government level to review the HSZ’s
relationship with local authorities; this review was announced in the
Government's reply to the Popplewell Report but no results of that review have
yet been received.  Fortunately, however, the Council's Director of Health and
Consumer Services has permitted his Officer's to provide ahealth and safety
input into the decision making process in relation to safety of sports grounds.
This substitution, therefore, temporarily covers the absence of an input rrom
the HSE.

The Panel also made reference to consultation on the safety of sports grounds
policy with the other District Councils in South Yorkshire. Unrortunately,
attempts at arranging consultation meetings have been unsuccessful to date. It
is proposed to try again to organise some consultations in the fairly near
future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down in each area.

The drafting of- new safety certificate conditions in consultation with the
Council's advisers has been progressing steadily and new draft conditions are
currently under consideration by those advisers. It is hoped that the new
conditions will be submitted to the Panel at its meeting in October for final
approval;-.; '?£'(?,■

As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it should be
be made clear, that such fees are only payable on the grant of a Certificate.
It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new Certificate conditions a
Certificate will then be issued to Sheffield United and at that ti=e it is
r r o D Qs e d to deal with tne cuestior. cf fees.
Future Administration of the Council's Certificating F u n ct i on

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become clear that a
detailed administrative system needs to be established m connection vitn -r.e
Council's Certificating function. Discussions on this matter nave been underway
for some time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council's Building
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services on tne establishment
cf such a system.

Accepting that the Council as the Certificating Authority will act on tr.e- oasis
of advice from e::perts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how
that advice may be best formulated. In the past, the County Council organised
an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the Council.    mat
particular working party also appeared to have had some decision making powers.

As it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overlap of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have now agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working party to
perform a similar function for the City Council. It is recommended that the
"Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor’s
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would function as
a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the discussion of items of advice to the Council before they are finally
formulated by the appropriate Authority. Meetings of the Group would be held at
the request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head of
Administration and'Legal Department would -arrange.-a meeting .and. despatch a list
of 1 tarns to be discu33ed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further list of
items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken by each
Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated that detailed written advice
would be provided by each discipline and be acted upon as appropriate.

In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep copies of
all relevant correspondence which will be available to all participants in the^
Group.

Under the old County Council administrative structure the different Authorities
represented in their working party had fairly clearly defined roles within which
to operate. Although it can be seen that there is some merit in this idea the
areas of potential overlap of responsibility are quite extensive in dealing with
sports grounds. However it appears that the various Authorities and Officers
wish for some definition of roles and the following have been agreed:-

Authority                                          Area of Responsibility

The Building Surveyor                     All matters relating to the structure of

    It is a n t i c i p a t e d that the H e a l t h and Consumer Services Depa r t m e n t would h ave an
    input to the A d V i s o r y Group on (a) aspe c t s of general safety; (b> the general

                   u. County Fire Service.     They had been on already.     - A. Yes. sir.

                   Q. Police:    they had been on already? - A. Yes.

                   O. The County Council could not be on any longer because they had
                      ceased to exist, and you were in their place? - A. Yes.
               B   0.   But before that change of name - it was no more than that -
                        took place, which we see from your statement was September
                        1987, you had been in the saddle for 16 months? - A. Yes. sir.

                   0.   And it was during that 18 months period that the inspection
                        had taken place in August when the removal of 14^ was
                        authorised? - A. August, 1986, sir.

                   G. Exactly.  Do I understand it right that during that 18
                      months period you had been continuing with the old
                      system, the officer working party, but with yourself in
                      place of the now defunct County Council? - A.
                      Effectively, yes, sir.

                   0.   You told the Inquiry that you had your own engineer - when I
               D        say "you", the City Council? - A. Yes, sir.

                   0 . As indeed had the.County Council beforehand? - A. No,  sir.
                        The County Council used the City Council's Building Survevor.

                   Q.   I am so sorry.  At any rate, the hat may have changed but what
                        was beneath the hat remained the same? - A. Yes. sir.

                   0.   He was in fact, Mr. Don Sheriff of the Building Department? -
                        A. I think Mr. Sheriff attended meetings, sir, yes.

                   0.   And he is a qualified chartered engineer? - A. I d o n ’t know
                        his qualifications, sir. but I am quite confident he is.

                   0.   If he was not there there was somebody else standing in his
                        shoes? - A. Yes, I imagine so.

                   Q. Under the old system, would you look in the core bundle page
                      27.   I expect you have seen it before. To avoid people not
                      knowing what their respective responsibilities were there was
                      an allocation of responsibilities, and if we look at
                      "Terraces” on the left-hand side. "Structural" was a matter
                      primarily for the building authority but with the Fire and
                      Police to be consulted. - A. Is that the third one down, sir?
                      It is' a poor copy.

                   0. It depends how you count, but do you see the word "Terraces"?
                      - A. "Egress from the ground” , and it is below that?

                   0. Yes.  Over the page:   "Spacing of crush barriers;   strength of
                      crush barriers” , both building authority? - a . Yes. sir.

               H   0.   "Estimation of safe ground capacity” , Council? - A. Yes, sir.

THE HILLSBOROUGH CRIMINAL INQUIRY -
TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH SUPERINTENDENT TAYLOR ON 24TH MAY, 1990 BETWEEN
APPROXIMATELY 9.15 A.M., AND 10.00 A.M.______________________________________


                                      ntioned that he had been on huliaa\
that was the reason for him not coming back to me sooner. He said he had now
had the opportunity .of reading the statement which I had prepared and it seems
to answer a lot of his questions.

He does however want to make an arrangement to take a formal statement from me
covering various areas which are still outstanding including a number of those
which he mentioned on the last visit.

I explained that I had done some work on the basis of the questions he had
raised last time and that I thought these would assist the process considerably.
We then went on to discuss at some length some of the issues raised and I think
I managed to explain a bit further about the delegation procedure although I am
convinced that Mr.  Taylor is still not clear about it. It is clear that he
wants to resolve the delegation question entirely and he indicated quite plainly
that he wished to interview people involved in this delegation process. He
specifically asked about Mr. Pensam and I explained the situation as
diplomatically as possible. He also mentioned the Chair of the appropriate
Committee.

Mr. Taylor went on to indicate that the procedure which he proposed to adopt was
to get something down in writing at a meeting in order to provide him with a
basis for his discussions with other people. He thought that perhaps it may not
be possible to get  a signed statement on the day of his visit but he hoped that
something could be   committed to writing with a view to havingit drawn up as a
statement in due course.

It is clear that Mr. Taylor is anxious to proceed with his enquiries and we
swopped around a few dates and came to the conclusion that possibly Tuesday the
5th June or Friday the 8th June would be most appropriate for an interview date.
I promised him that I would get back to him as soon as possible.

I talked briefly to Mr. Webster about this issue and we discovered in
Mrs. Bashforth's Diary that there was apparently nothing on Friday the 8th June,
although Tuesday the 5th was booked for something else.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
MEETING WITH WEST MIDLANDS POLICE QN 2ND MAY, 1990

This note has been prepared from notes of Liz Bashforth and Frances
Woodhead.

PRESENT at the meeting:-
                              i.
Superintendent Taylor and a •
                            Sargent from West Midlands Police, David
Bownes, Tony Gregory from Keeble Hawsons, Mr. Bennett from Graysons
representing David Bownes' interest, Liz Bashforth until 11.50 a.m.,
Frances Woodhead from 11.50 a.m. onwards.

The meeting was at the request of West Midlands Police who had appraoched
David Bownes direct to ask wheither of not’hfe jlwas prepared to talk
generally with them about a number of issues. David Bownes has consented
to this. There have been no objections to the presence of the other
people at the meeting.

 Wies't Midlands Police indicated that they haye sent papers to the DPP in
 connection with David Bownes at the end of March concerning David's
’culpability and that of the City Council. As far as David was concerned,
 the interview would take place if he agreed. He was not in jeopardy.
 If, during the interview, it became apparent that it was appropriate to do
 so, David would be cautioned. Reference was made to the Taylor Report.
 Superintendent Taylor expressed the view that communication with the
 Council and other agencies. had‘ been less than desirable. The Safety
 Certificate was not well administered. This was not the cause of the
 disaster, a factor in the scale of the disaster and he saw that as a civil
 matter. Copy of transcript to us. We jgave them a copy of David Bownes’
 statement.

No conflict at moment - butAwetre that one may cbme up, for example, in
connection with the amount of work undertaken by David Bownes.

The following are a summary of the questions which were asked by
Superintendent Taylor

1.    Powers delegated to General Purposes Panel - How? How was the
function transferred from South Yorkshire County Council to Sheffield City
Council?
                                  S io
2.    Other sections - other than SO?

3.    Removal barriers 144 - effect on scale of disaster -Pen 3.

4.    Anything else - general power - see Committee Reports uncontentious ,
administrative ^contentious G.P. Panel.

5.    Other file - General Policy File.

6.    Building Surveyor's responsibility for spacing of barriers and
strength.

             At this point, Frances Woodhead took over.

7.    Who does David Bownes depend upon for expert advice?

8.    If advice was taken from a building surveyor concerning the removal
of barriers, David Bownes should have appreciated the consequences of
that. Was that a group decision of* an individual decision?
                          ■fcJt-5
9.    Did the group fail to^ account of the significance of the removal   of
the              barrier in approving removal?

10.        Duty on group to consider all the factors?

11.   The part played by Health and Consumer Services in the group?

12.    The capacity figure state-', the-safety Certificate did not reflect
tne changes on the Kop? Questions wars raised about the maintenance of
the Safety Certificate in an accurate state.

13.   How were decision of the Advisory Group documented?

14. Did Eastwood and Partners attend Advisory Group meetings?   Did they
communicate directly with the Council or through Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club?

15.   Who attended from the Council upon the testing of crush barriers?

.6.   Who chaired who took the lead at Advisory Group Meetings?   How did
the group recognise it had made a decision?

17.   Did you take the lead as to the decision taken if there was an
impasse between the experts?

18.   How did the liaison between Administration and Legal and    the
building surveyors section work?

Superintendant Taylor concluded by saying he would go away and read
David's statement and would contact us further. He was asked by David
Bownas what issues they were looking at in connection with criminal
liability.  Superintendant Taylor confirmed that they were looking at
corporate manslaughter and as far as individuals were concerned, possible
charges of culpable misfeasance or neglect of duty.

Note of Meeting held in Mrs. Bashforth's Office - Wednesday 2nd May, 1990
at 10.45 a.m.

                        THE HILLSBOROUGH CRIMINAL INQUIRY


Present:       Detective Superintendent Taylor (West Midlands Police)
               Detective Inspector Tope (West Midlands Police)
               Mr. Ralph Bennett (Graysons)
               Mrs. E. Bashforth (SCC until 11.30 a.m.)
               Mrs. F. Woodhead (SCC from 11.30 a.n. onwards)
               Mr. A. Gregory (Messrs. Keeble Hawsons)


The discussion commenced with Superintendent Taylor indicating that he has
passed papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the
potential criminal culpability of both the Council Corporately and myself
individually.These papers were passed to the Director at the   end of March,
1990. Instructions then cane back to obtain a witness statement from me. If it
became clear during the course of the interview which would give rise to the
statement that an offence may have been committed then appropriate cautions
would be administered, etc. Mr. Taylor also indicated to those present that
there may be a conflict of interest at some stage and it would be appropriate to
bear that in mind, both Mr. Gregory and Mr. Bennett acknowledged this.

Mr. Taylor went on to say that the Taylor Inquiry had made various criticisms
about'communications between the Council and other authorities and had
criticised the administrative systems on various points. As far as the police
are concerned these are civil natters and were not subject to criminal enquiry.

There was then a brief discussion of roles whereby Messrs. Taylor and Tope
indicated that they were charged with the criminal investigation into this issue
which was perhaps outside their previous experience. Mr. Bennett explained that
he was my representative. Mr. Gregory explained that he may in due course be
representing the Council if criminal matters were alleged against it and both
Mrs. Bashforth and Mrs. Woodhead were observing the proceedings.

There then followed a long discussion in connection with the Inquiry and in
particular in relation to matters raised in the transcript of my evidence.

It was explained by Mr. Taylor that the Police had previously been unaware of
the existence   of my statement and have therefore relied on the transcript.   I
handed a copy   of the statement over tothem so they could copy ir. and return, it
to me.

Mr. Taylor had a number of "juestions to   ask about the Safety of Sports Grounds
issue. These took up the bulk of time      during the meeting which lasted until
approximately 12.40 p.m. It was agreed     in the majority of cases that the
statement would probably answer most of    the questions but Mr. Taylor went
through them anyway.

The first question concerned the delegation of powers and how exactly this was
achieved in practice and what exactly my role was and from where any power that
I exercised came. This issue will require some further clarification.

                                         -2 -



The second issue concerned relationships within the advisory group/working party
and this again is an area that requires clarification.

The third issue related to the "policy" file which is referred to in the
transcript.  I explained that the existence of this file had been known to the
West Midlands Police but its contents have never been requested. Mr. Taylor
indicated that he would like to have a look at it sometime and this was agreed.

There were then questions about the decision making process as far as the
Council was concerned.

There are also questions about Eastwood's role and Mr. Taylor appeared to be
indicating that Eastwood had in fact taken over the Council's role.  I explained
that this was not the case and that neither Eastwood nor the clubs were members
of the Advisory Group or the Working Party.

There was also mention of the Health and Consumer Services Department role in
which Mr. Taylor indicated that he had the impression that they were not a "lead
authority".  I explained that this was a bit of a misnomer and that in fact they
were treated in exactly the same way as all other members of the Advisory
Group.

The next point made related to certificate amendments. Mr. Taylor took the vie-.’
that the certificates should perhaps be physically altered when amendments were
made in order that for example the Police Ground Commander could go along to the
club and obtain a current up-to-date copy of the certificate and therefore be
sure that conditions were being complied with.  I explained that as far as I was
concerned there was neither a legislative requirement nor an administrative one
for such a process to be followed.

There was then some discussion about the testing of barriers and I indicated
that my understand was that when barriers were to be tested, Eastwoods notified
the Building Surveyor and someone from that Division attended.

There was then a discussion about the issue raised by the i n q u i r y in relation to
the chairing, etc., of the Advisory Group after some discussion it was suggested
that perhaps this issue was more one of a confusion of terminology.        I asserted
that the Advisory Group and the working party had acted efficiently as far as I
was aware.

The last point Superintendent Taylor made related to the relationship between
the Building Surveyors' Division and the Administration and Legal Department, I
explained that this relationship involved telephone conversations, memoranda,
etc., all of which were to be found on the appropriate files.

At the end of the meeting Mr. Taylor indicated that from the results so far, he
felt my liability had diminished. I asked him what possible criminal charges
could be made against me and he indicated anything from malfeasance - the
common law offence - to manslaughter.

The meeting terminated at approximately 12.40 p.m.

Dear Member

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY
SPECIAL MEETING

I am writing to consult members about a special meeting of the Authority on the Financial
Assistance to the former Hillsborough Officers.

This will be the meeting at which the Authority will consider requests from the former
officers for further financial support in connection with the forthcoming private
prosecutions.

I have enclosed a schedule of dates in a tabulation. I have included dates even though
there may already be something planned eg there is a Community Affairs Committee on 7
May, there being the possibility that the Police Authority would take precedence, or there
is a bank holiday on Monday 3 May, 1999.

I shall be obliged if members would complete the table to show their availability and return
it in the enclosed envelope. Alternatively could you please telephone Jackie Laycock on
01226.772806.


Yours faithfully




Stuart Lunn

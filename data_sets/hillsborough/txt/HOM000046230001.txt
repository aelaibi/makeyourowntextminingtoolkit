             Dear Mr and Mrs Church

             Re: Request for full list of all members of the Hillsborough Steering Group

             Thank you for your letter of 28 September 1994. I am extremely sorry for the delay
             in responding.

             Unfortunately the Legal Aid Board is unable to provide you with a list of the members
             of the Hillsborough Steering Group. We do not have the information you have
             requested. This is a matter for the Law Society to deal with.

             Alternatively, you may wish to contact the Chairwoman, Elizabeth Steel who may be
             able to assist you.

             I regret I am unable to be of more assistance.

             Yours sincerely

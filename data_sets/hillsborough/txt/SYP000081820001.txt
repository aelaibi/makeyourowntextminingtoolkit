             were       Police         and Stewards           evident           in the         ground.              I wa s      given

             directions             by a S t e w a r d .          O n my     walk        to    the          stands       I saw       no    disorder

             or    otheX. i n c i d e n t .           I saw       no-one        drinking            alcohol             inside       the       ground.
                               \    u\t           n  5(?cmd .
             I took          up m y se a t        at a b o u t 2 p m s i t t i n g            with          my    son.     Whilst          waiting

             for    the       matbh       to    start.        I looked around                      the       ground       and    noticed          t ha t

             4 ,he c e n t r a l t e k r a c e a r e a of the L e p p i n g s L a n e e n d of the g r o u n d was

             quire       full       but    t h e N ^ i ngs    were        nowhere         full          although          I did       not       regard

             this       as    anything          unusual.

             The    match        kicked         off    and    I saw        supporters               climbing             out    from       the

             terraces           onto      the     pitch      until        there     wa s       so m a n y          that    the       game       was

             stopped.             I c o u l d n ’t see        how     serious            the       situation             was    but       I did

             realise          it wa s      serious          when     I saw       one      person             with       a serious          arm    injury

             and    one       peKson       wh o      I presumed           was    dead         being          carried       away.

             I am a q u a l i m d               First       Aider     and       h a ve    been          a    lay    instructor             in the         St.,

             Johns       Ambulance             Service       for     2 4 yr s      and        l a te r       in the       ierritorial             Army.

             I have          performed          duty    with        the    St.     Johns           at       Liverpool          and    Everton

             Football           C l\ijs , A i n t r e e      Race     Course        and        at       pop       concerts       so       I decided

             to    go    onto       ther p i t c h     to    se e    if    I could            be    of       any assistance.                    This

             would       have       b e e n at       about    3.15pm.

             I got       down       onto       the    ground        where       I saw 2            people          attempting             to

             resuscitate               casualties           but     it w a s     clea r        they          had    no    first       aid

             training.              They       were    trying        anything            to    revive             the    casualties,              I then

             noticed          I think          a Policeman           and     trained           nurse             attempting          to

             re s u s c i t a t e      a young        woman.         I a s k e d the           person             giving       the m o u t h      to

             mouth       if     they wanted            relieving           and     I took           over          the    mouth       to m o u t h

             resuscitation.                    I kept       this     up    for     some        time,             about    5 minutes,             but

             there       wa s     no    response        from        the    casualty.

             The    nurse        and myself            checked        fo r      vital         signs          but    we    decided          there       wa s

             nothing          more      that      could      be     done     for     the       young             woman.        This       girl    wa s      i

           on the          girl            near           the      goals        on    the N o r t h       Stand       side       of    the     pitch.          1

           then moved                   to a n o t h e r               casualty,           a ina n w ho        I would          guess     wa s     in his

           early          twenties,                      slim      bu il d ,      short       dark       h a i r and       he    had acne          spots       on

           his      face.               He w a s            laying         behind          the    g o a l.      He    had       obviously          recently

           vomited and                     I thought                   he m a y      have     asphyxiated             on    the       vomit.          1 cleared

           his     airway               and         commenced mouth                       to m o u t h    and    cardiac          massage          but    I got-

           no      response                at       all        from      him.         I carried           on    the    treatment             for      about

           minutes.                  I had               just      about        given        up   on t h i s     lad w h e n          I s aw a n o t h e r

           casualty              being              lifted             from     the       terraces.            The    lad a p p e a r e d        to     have       no

           colour          so        I decided                    to    check        to    see    if     there       was    any       chance       of

           resuscitating                         him.             I gave        h i m rnouth to m o u t h             and       the    lad     respondsd

           I m m e d i a t e l y.                I assisted                to     place       him      in a n a m b u l a n c e        and when          I left

           him      he w a s            s t ill           alive.

           There          di d       not a p p e a r               to    be a n y         other     casualties             that       1 could         give     any

           positive              help            to       so      X returned                  the N o r t h S t a n d to m y son.

           understanding                         of       the      seriousness               of   the     situation             and    reaction          to    the

           situation.                      It m u s t             have     been       established              fairly       early        how     serious           the

           situation                 was         and       the         immediate           first       aid     facilities             were     inadequate

           to      cope.             If a s u i t a b l e                announcement               had      been made           over     the      tannoy

           spectators                   in t h e            ground         I certainly would                    have       responded           earlier         as       i

           am      sure        many           others              in the        ground would              have       done.

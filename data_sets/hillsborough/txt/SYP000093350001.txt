    7)               On the above date I wasylbn uniform duty detailed tgr serial               11,

           I         commanded by Sgt 639 JtLARK



                     After   briefing,        our serial was detailed to the My’ffland yflailway Station

                     and I was instructed to work with PC                             escorting Liver pool

                     supporters on double-deck buses to Lepping; ^Tane,              Hi 1 lsborough.



                     After all      passengers had alighted we then went back,          on the empty bus,

                     to the railway station for more passengers from Liverpool.



                     We made three journeys to Leppi ngs Lane in total and,              on the last
                                                                           PAGE      2
                                                                           S3761
occasion,   we arrived at the ground at 2.20 pm <1420).         After    the fans

alighted,   we did not return to town but walked to the gymnasium inside

the ground to await arrival and instructions from PS 639 CLARK.



Shortly before 3.00 pmyl 150j>T (kick-off t i m e ) , PS CLARK a nd the rest

of our serial a r r ye d     we were all   instructed to stand by at the

corner of the Spion/Kop and South Stand area.



When we arrived at that      location,   the match had started and we

remained there until we      noticed the referee stop the match.         Sgt CLARK

then directed us towards the Leppings Lane side of the pitch near to

the South Stand corner be pause the re was believed to be c rowd trouble

and spectators were climbing over the perimeter fence onto the playing

area from behind theX_eppings Lane goal.



Initially we were trying to keep spectators         off the playing area

itself but,   eventually, more and more of them came onto the           pitch and

it became evident some of them were      injured from being      crushed in the

crowd behind the goal.     We attempted to keep the fans not injured

behind the touchline whilst tending to the injured on the pitch.


                                              /'
As time passed I   saw spectators and po1i / e     carrying   injured fans

across the playing area towards the gym nasium behind the North Stand
                                   S f
and learned that some people had, ji/fact, died.



I then got detached from my serial when I assjHTted a number of fans

and police officers    in carrying an i nj u re d/ ma n, on an advertising

board,   to an area behind the North St^yfd where he received medi cal

attention from a paramedic for suspect broken leg.
                                                                         PAGE    3
                                                                         S3761

On returning to the pitch,      I again assisted supporters to carry a m a n

with stomach injuries to the rear of the stand where he was attended             ■

to by a paramedic.



I again returned to the pitch and assisted fans and police officers to

c a r r y o u t a man complaining of rib and leg injuries.      This man was ,

treated by a St John's Ambulanceman near to the gymjjasium.



When I returned to the pitch,  I saw a cprdafn pf police offj^^ers ac ross

the centre of the field a nd saw PS 63y5l_ARK and PC S ^ ^ W E A V E R a nd i

stayed with them until we were released from the ground at 4.20 pm

(1620)



I then returned with the r e m a i n d ^   of the serial   to load spectators

onto buses on Penistone R o a d y /

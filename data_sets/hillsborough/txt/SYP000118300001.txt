                Some        time after           this      it was    obvious      that there was            a large      crowd         of

crush        of     people         behind          him.           He was       allowed          to e n t e r        after     paying

money        to     the      steward.              There          was    no    other        alternative              bu t    to a l l o w

this        youth       in.        It w o u l d         have         been     impossible            to    eject       this youth.

If     he    ha d      been    taken          to       the P o l i c e        room     it w o u l d       h a ve     ©seriously

depleted            the m a n p o w e r           at    the       turnstiles           and       it was       also      impossible              to

open Gate              A and       eject          h i m as        the    crush        of    people        outside           would      h av e

rushed        inside.

People        coming          in w e r e          very       distressed and                 saying          that     something           had

to     be    d o ne     about       the       crush outside.                     Decent         middle        aged and            young

f a ns      were       screaming             at    me       saying:         "It's      fucking murder                 out     there."

"Open        them       fucking          gates          or y o u ’ re         going        to    be h e l d     responsible              for

them        out     there."

At     this       time       I saw       b e er        cans a n d        empty        bottles          bei ng       kicked        through

the      turnstiles            including                an     empty        bottle         of M o e t     & Chandon.               Attempts

were        being       made       to    open Gate A                   from     the    outside.              People were               climbing

over        the     walls      at       the       side        of G a t e       A and       the      roof     of     t he t u r n s t i l e s .

These        fans       were       not       stopping             to    complain           of    the     c r u s h b ut      merely       to

g et     into       the      ground.              It w a s        a very        tense       situation.               Nothing           could

be     done       to    stop       the       f an s     climbing            over      th e w a l l s .        It a p p e a r e d        to me

that        the     only way            to    prevent             people        getting          crushed        outside           in

Leppings            Lane      was       to    open          the      large      concertina             ga t e s .

Other        officers          attended                at    my      location and an                Inspector           lined          these

officers            up a l o n g s i d e          Gate A          to a p p a r e n t l y        try and       control         the       fans     in

c a se      the     gates      wee       either             opened        by    the     police         or    forced open               by the

fan s .       I     did      not     see       the       gates         opened        but     sa w    streams         of f a n s        running

in .

Whilst        some        fans      were          still        coming          in,    I heard a             radio message

directing              all    officers             onto        the      p i t c h at       the L e p p i n g s L a n e        end.

Along        with     other        officers          I ran a c r o s s           the      rear      of    the      e nc l os ur e at

the     back     of    the W e s t        Stand.             I did        not    se e a n y       problems             in the       centre

entrance         to    th e    terraces.               I entered            the      South        stand        through          the     g at e

below        the P o l i c e       control          room and             stepped       o v er     the     w al l       from     the

stand        onto     the     pit c h.

I d i d not          see a n y      players          o n the         pitch.          I saw a n u m b e r               of    officers

up against            th e    f e n c e at      Leppings             Lane.         I ran o v e r          and      saw       two y o u n g

girls        who were         at    the    front          of      the     crush and            pressed         up ag ai nst           the

fe n c e .     These         girls    were          in the C e n t r e           Stand         part      of    the      terraces

between         gates        3 and    4.        I immediately went                        to    these         girls         a n d was

able     to     feel       that     they       both       had a          pulse     in t h e i r       caroted artery.                      I

climbed         up    the     fence       to    try and            pull     the      girls          out a n d ge t           the    crowd

to m o v e      back.         I heard          cries         of    "Fuck        o f f " at      this.           I went        back      down

and again            tried     to    revive          the       girls       through         the      fence        by s l a p p i n g

their        faces.

At     this     point        someone       climbed             over       the    fence         to e s c a p e      the       crush and

jumped        down     on     top    of me.            I was         knocked         unconscious               and      came       r ound

on     the    pitch        in the     recovery               position.             I immediately went                        back     to

the     fence        but     could    not       see       the      two     girls       anywhere.

I went        to g a t e      3 which          was     open and            saw a young              man       l ai d    on the

ground and            he a p p e a r e d       to    be      trapped        by his         legs as            someone         else      wa s

laid across            his     legs.           It w a s        impossible            to    get      anyone         else       through

this     gate w i t h o u t         first       removing             this       young      man.          Chief         Superintendent

John Nesbit            and     I pulled             t hi s     man       from    the      gate.          W it h a Notts.

We were        joined         by PC       Tommy        Jackson            (FI)    who      t oo k     over      mouth         to

With another              officer,           and     s o me L i v e r p o o l         fans,       I carried a fan who

appeared        to    be       dea d,      r o u n d to        the    gymnasi u rn .          We    entered          the    gym

through       the     rear          door     and     placed          th e   body       on the       floor•           The    other

made    my way        towards           th e      door.

At    th e   door     I was          told      to k e e p       people          out    of    the    gym,       direct       officers

police       officer           to    stay with           each        bod y .         I was    also       arranging

ambulances           to    carry        the       badly        injured          to    hospitals          at    the       request       of

an    unknown Doctor.

officers        led by          Inspector            Young          (D1).        I was       dealing          with       enquiries

the    hospital           until        r e l i e v e d at       9.10 am and                finished       d u t y at W o o d s e a t s

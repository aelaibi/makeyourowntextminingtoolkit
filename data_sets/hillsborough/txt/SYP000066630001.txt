  the    premises       of The Horse         a J o c k e y , I noted t£*£t this g r a dually

  began to be a heavy             c o n g r egation at     those     premises,       and before          12 noon

  we were moving          the    spillage      of fans on tWe forecourt                of the       premises

   from the road, w he ra / t h e y were beginning to obstruct the junction.

   Some of the fans were a c t u a ll y sitting and lying on the road s u r f a c e ,

  in obvious       danger       of traffic,       and were warned against               this       practice.

  The Beehive          licensed    premises were         in darkness and the doors were

  closed w i t h a       ’C l o s e d ’ sign exhibited thereon.                I noted however              that a

  continuous       sporadic       stream      in groups between two and 8 or 9 were

  knocking       on the door and            being admitted.

  At The M i d d l ew oo d Tavern,           there a p p e a r e d a good atte n d a n c e         of

  Liverpool       fans,    and two mini          coaches were        parked outside,           the      car

  park was       relatively full.             There was     no obvi'bus spillage             of fans          onto

  the    car    park,    until    later on when fans           sati in the       car    park,       and also

  ga t hered on the        pavement         oj

  About    1 pm I noted that The Horse and Jo c k e y was                      pecked out with fans,

  there was a gathering               of    possibly two hundredfijym the              car   park/frontage
                                                                                                  PAGE          3

and a large group of fans were                  gathered,    possibly fifty           in all      on the

grass      verges and banking           opposite and about         twenty were seated

a c t u a l l y on garden walls and steps             to private houses.             All    the   fans

a p p e a r e d to be drinking         heavily,   some e xc es s i v e l y so.       I often saw

fans     coming     from the     premises      carrying    several     pints of beer          each,       and

obviously,         from their actions,          for thei^r own consumption.

The actions         of the fans was         varied.     afome were     drinking and talking

quietly.          The m a j o ri ty however w e r e y e xtrerne 1y boisterous,             and the

litter was general             over the area with         cans and bottles           everywhere,

bankings,         pavements,     roads and frontage.            We a p p r o a c h e d youths     sat on

walls     to private housing and asked them to consider                       the     residents,          and

event u a l l y    one fan made an effort to            clear    that area,      with the fid of

several      black     bin    liners.

We    remained      in the area, /5n one o c c asion         liaising with S u p erinte n d e n t

Marshall       and a p p r a i s i n g him of the situation.           We were a d v i s e d that          if

there was any t r o u b be , for           the five    of us to     remain     in the       vehicle

until     a s sistance       c/me.     The ground     control    was s i m ilarly a d v i s e d of

the     situation by/Police Sergeant Miller.

F rom    1.30pm or i/hereabouts we took up static                   position opposite Tne

Horse and J o \-.Jy .          1 saw that a large number            of fans had become              drunk,

one     or two e x c e s s i v e l y so.    They were     organising      themselves         into

groups      of ten or twenty and singing               football     songs,     containing         several

of the better known obscene words.                    E v e n t u a l l y a number    from two       to

six fans       started       standing      on a boundary wall with a private                 house,

possibly some seven feet high,                 and    1eadi ng the     singers.        It was

u n a v o idable    that e ve n t u a l l y they would fall        from the wall,           and many

did so,       falling      through foliage at the back             of the wall and           into

private       property.        I could not see that any            person    received obvious

injury,       or that there was any apparent               damage     to property.

D uring     this    time     several    of the two to three hundred fans                   in our    view

became        very drunk.            One youth,       in lV[s teens was ex c e e d i n g l y drunk;         and

e ve n t u a l l y
            could only stand w i t h / a s s i s t a n c e of .two of his friends.

This y outh and two or three otters I w i t n e s s e d openly urinating on the

fore court of the              licensed       pqeani s e s , obi i v ious as to who        could see

them.         There was no a n i m o s i t y shown towards               us except good natured

jeering,        gestures and           ribald     comments.

S h o rt ly before 2 . 30pm we were                joined by a further            transit and a dog

handler.             Without    the use of the d o g , we entered                the forecourt and

premises and began to move                     fans    towards       the ground.      M a n y were

reluctant            to move and had to be persuaded.                    I did not witness any

violence whatsoever,                  either    by Police       or towards       them.    I checked

the    tan who was           incapable.         He a p p e a r e d   lucid but had no        control

over his        limbs.         His    two   supporting       friends     stated that they had not

got any        intentions        of going       into the ground even though they had

tickets.             They   intended to stay with him and care for him.                         He was      not

disorderly,            and was a ll ow ed       to go with them.             I feel   that    had any

a tte m p t    been made        to    restrain,       or arrest       him,   the mood of man y fans

w at ching would have a b r up tl y              changed,       for    the worst.

E ventually,           in a long straggle             they m o v e d towards      the ground and we

slowly followed them.                   I saw very        little      trouble,    and w i t n e s s e d only

one    person detained               during    the journey to thj/r g r o u n d .        This was      by

anot h e r     transit,

We a r ri v e d at the ground at 2 . 5 0 pm and je r k e d on tij/T offside of the

corner    of the bridge,         a p p ar en tl y to get a better            view of the    situation

that was     building     up.     F rom my position            I could see a blue metal

c onstructed folding         gate      that was    closed,       being    violently shaken,               and

voiced my opinion that            it would not hold for               long    if that treatment

continued.

The    five of us were
                    then d e t ailed to leave the van, and I .was

engaged with turning awa y f a ns without t i c k e t s , of whom there a p p e a r e d

to be h u n d r e ds,   away from the ground.                 V ery shortly after       this,

possibly about 3 . 1 5p m        I was    directed,         with my serial         into the ground,

by a senior       officer,      who    I do not know.

On entry through the gate               into an area before the tunnel,                 leading           to

the West Terrace,         I was       confronted by a large            cong regat i on of fans.

The y were    very noisy,        and    it was    some seconds         before      I realised that

it was    not their      usual    noise,    but that of terror and panic.                   As       I

neared the tunnel         I saw two or three                persons   beiang      carried therefrom.
                                                        /


Some    people    immediately began to to work                  on them,     as    if in an attempt

to    resuscitate them.          I got    close and saw that two of these

persons a p p e a r e d to be dead.         Others were                                         he

tunnel,     in a similar        condition,       and    I thei                                  hing

very    serious     had occurred,        either    in the '                                    i.


An officer was directing as many officers                                                           g round

and    in a ccor d a n c e wit h this     I entered the West Terrace,                 via the

tunnel.      I found this        to be almost          blocked with hysterical           people,           of

all    ages and sexes.          I shielded two young s t e r s           out of the     crush,           and

then went     back through the tunnel              to the West Terrace.              This   took

several     minutes.

In the ground        I saw that        the gate to the          pitch was open,        and at        least

two    openings     had been made        in the    crowd       control    fence.      I went        onto

the    fiitch and    i mmediately saw several                bodies   of fans      laid near        the

goal    at that end.       I went       to a hole       in the f e n c e and with other
                                                                                                           PAGE         6

         officers and fans began              pulling        people out of tbre t e r r a c e .      Some were

         injured but       could walk,        others        unharmed but     oJBviously terrified.               Many

         however      had to be     lifted bodily out many a p p e a r e d to be dead.                    Whilst

         there and so engaged            I was     struck several          times    by fans who had been

         a l re ad y e x tracated    from this terrace.                They also     tried to pull me away

         a n d were    calling me a murderer,               and    in general      blaming    the   police       for

         the    carnage.

         I continued thus         for about        ten to fifteen minutes,             although      I kept       no

         track    of time.       One young       girl       I helped out we        carried to the         pitch

         and a St.      J o h n ’s A mb ul a n c e woman or an am b u l a n c e      service woman,

         immediately began          resus c i t a t i o n
                                              by the m o u t h to mouth m e t h o d . I bent

         to assist      her and at that time someone kicked me heavily in my left

         s i d e , knocking me over the            legs of the         injured girl.         I saw a y o u t h     in

         a black      jacket    running a way shouting              something      i ncc**rfprehens i ble to me.

         Another      person then a s s i st ed the girl and               I returned to        the fence.

         There were by now too many other persons                       g a W iered there       for me to be

         of any use.         I therefore        g a t hered a b o u t \fjcve or si;< fans and a s s i s t e d

         them    in carrying      two of the        injured fans,          one     parently      dead,     to the

         Kop end      and to the gymnasium.

               that   time     I saw that     this was being used as an e m ergency                  reception

     °   area,    and there a p p e a re d to be            in the' region of ten to fifteen bodies

         were all      exhausted.

         I then rejoined my serial               who were         on the   pitch and we a s s i s t e d     in

         forming a line across            the    pitch as d i r ected by Inspector White,                   of FI

         Division.         We   remained there for a considerable                    time until      directed

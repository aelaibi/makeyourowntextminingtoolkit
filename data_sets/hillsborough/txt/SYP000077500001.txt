walking           around?           drinking             from       beer      and      lager        cans.          People         were     coming

Th e    density            of   the       crowd          began         to     become         oppressive                 and    it    became

Several           mounted             a                        hen     began        t a f o rm a          1 ins across              the       f ront      af

further =              As    they         did        so     people        were       forcing             a way       between and               even

under        the       horses             towards           the      turnstiles.                  I then        h ad     the       definite

impression              that          the       s i t u a t i o n wa s         out     of      control          and      that       it w o u l d         not

more      intent            on    getting                into      the    ground          than          they were           concerned              about

their        own       or    anyone             elses          safety.          I was          then       pushed         in    the       direction

of     the     turnstiles                  by       the     pressure           of    the       crowd and             ha d     to    fully

concentrate                 on    remaining                 standi n g .            It w a s        not       possible         at    this          st a g e

to     take       any       action             to    prevent           the     crowd         pressing           forward            towards          the

turnstiles              and       I was             then acutely               aware         of     feeling          fear      for       my    own

safety         as      the       surrounding                   pressure         on me          o ecame g reater and greater.

The      crowd         pressure                them       seemed         to    lessen          and       within        seconds           I heard          a

message           to    go       into          the       g r o u n d as       there       wa s      a    problem         on    the       pitch,           I

entered           the       ground             by    the       left      hand       s id e     gate       and      ran      towards           the     rear

a    considerable                 number             of     other        Police        officers,               some      apparently

One      young         man who             w as      holding           onto     the       fence          about       halfway         up       shouted

I moved           along          the       front          of     the     fence       towards             the    middle         of    the       pitch

As     I di d       so      I realised               that     something               ha d      happened            in the           stand         an d

t h at       people         in the         stand        were      trying          to     get         out      themselves               or     to    help

other         people          to    get      out      both       o v er     the       fence          and      through           the      gate.            I

then         saw    two       Police        officers             on     the     other           side       of      the     fence         who

the      heavy         guage        mesh        of    the     perwneter               fence          by      pulling          and      pushing            the

 THE LACK OF CONTROL OVER THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE GROUND,           I WAS AT THE SEMI-FINAL

 LAST YEAR AND IT WAS ALMOST AS BAD OUTSIDE THE GROUND LAST YEAR/ VERY LITTLE

 cAdN'T    SEE THE TURNSTILES AND GOT DIRECTED TO THE WRONG TURNSTILES BY A

 POLICEMAN,   EVENTUALLY WE REALISED WE WERE IN THE WRONG AREA AND WE ENDED UP

 AT ABOUT 2.55 PM (1455) STANDING IN THE HUGE CROWD OUTSIDE THE OUTER PERIMETER

 GATES LEADING TO THE TERRACE TURNSTILES,         THE 2 POLICEMEN ON HORSES WERE TRYING

 TO STOP PEOPLE GETTING THROUGH THE OUTER G A T E S .       LIKE A LOT OF OTHERS ME AND

                j GT   IN BETWEEN THE POLICE HORSES AND WENT TOWARDS THE TURNSTILES.

 IN THE AREA INSIDE THOSE OUTER PERIMETER GATES IT WAS MUCH QUIETER AND AS,WE

 GOT CLOSE TO THE TURNSTILES PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY QUEUING,              I NEVER S      ANY

 POLICEMAN OR STEWARDS BY THE ENTRANCES TO THE TURNSTILES.

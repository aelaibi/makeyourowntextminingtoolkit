    HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

    I refer to my letter of 28 June and should be grateful if you
    would indicate whether or not you have been able to consider the
    matters raised therein.   I am coming under extreme pressure from
    councillors and Hillsborough families who are anxious that a
    meeting be convened with you as a matter of urgency.
    Yours sincerely,




    CHIEF E X E C U T I V E - ^

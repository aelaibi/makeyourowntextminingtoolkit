                                      Liverpool away. Last term , we did th e double over Wednesday, with a remarkable,
                                      5-1 success in a dazzling display at Hiltsborough. Today's match will be th e 48th

LIKE Ron Atkinson, David Hodgson (picturedbelow ) had problems                                                    Glasgow
when he opted for a move to Spain. In fact, his spell with Cadiz ended                                            Hangers.
with his taking th e club to c o u r t. . . and winning his case. "I didn't
learn a thing abo ut football, bu t it was a very valuable growing-up
exercise," was how h e summed up th a t period in his career. For
four m onths I trained on my own, so I had plenty of tim e to sort
myself out."
   In th e six years which have elapsed since he first pulled on a
Liverpool jersey, he has sampled just a b o u t everything football has
to offer—including th e lows, as well as th e highs. And not long ago,
in a very frank assessment, he reflected th a t "m y biggest mistake
was leaving A nfield. . . after th a t, I let my standards drop. I stopped
doing th e things I was good a t—I w asn't concentrating."
   David's first season at Liverpool, after his half-million pound move
from Middlesbrough, ended with his having a League-championship
medal to show for his efforts; b u t after this he found th a t nailing
down a regular first-team spot
was easier said th a n done. He
said later: "I was in th e reserves
and th o u g h t I should have been
in th e first team . . . I realise now
th a t if you're doing th e business
for Liverpool, you'll be picked for
th e senior side."
   After Anfield, Sunderland and
Norwich City were th e next stops,
th e n David opted for a move to
th e Continent, with Cadiz. When
he cam e back to this country, it
was Sheffield Wednesday w ho
signed him on a free transfer, and
he rated himself "very lucky to be
given a second chance in th e top
flight."
   Naturally, he'll be hoping th a t
he is in Wednesday's line-up
against Liverpool today, and
everyone at Anfield will wish him
all th e best in his bid to boost his
career a g ain . . . except, of course,
w hen he's in action against us!

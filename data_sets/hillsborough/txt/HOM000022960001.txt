If a contravention of a requirement is alleged then,
if you have followed the guidance in the

that you have complied with the Regulations, If
you have not followed the guidance then that will
be evidence tending to show that you have not
complied. It will then be up to you to demonstrate
by other means that you have satisfied the
requirement.

Other requirements
The guidance relates only to the Requirement
given at the start of each document. The building
work will also have to comply with the
requirements of any other relevant paragraphs in
Schedules 1 and 2 to the Regulations, Other
Approved Documents give guidance on the other
requirements in Schedule 1,

Materials and Workmanship
Any building work to which a requirement of the
regulations applies must, in accordance with
Regulation 7, be carried out with proper materials
and in a workmanlike manner. You may show that
you have complied with this requirement in a
number of ways, for example by following an
appropriate British Standard or British Board of
Agrement Certificate. You will find further
guidance in the Approved Documenton Materials
and Workmanship.

British Standards and British Board of
Agrgment Certificates
When a document makes reference to a named
British Standard, the relevant version of the
Standard is the one listed at the end of the
publication.
Building Regulations are made for specific
purposes; health and safety, energy conservation
and the welfare and convenience of disabled
people. British Standards and Agrement
Certificates are relevant guidance to the extent
that they relate to these considerations. The
Standards and Certificates themselves may
address, also, other aspects of performance such

1.6 In vehicle parks expected to be used by
vehicles of less than 2.5 tonnes (cars and light
vans), barriers should be capable of resisting a
horizontal force at the height shown in Diagram 4.
If the vehicle park will be used by heaviervehicles
or by vehicles moving at a speed of more than
16km/h, the relevant recommendations of BS
6180: 1982 Code o f practice for protective
barriers in and about buildings should be
followed, (see paragraph 1.7 below)

                                         SUBMISSION



This     Inquiry        has     proceeded           at     great    pace and has had laid

before        it, in its 6h weeks of sitting, a considerable quantity

of     material        both oral and written.                  Its objective has been to

endeavour,        despite           the constraints of time, to ascertain what

happened at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on the 15th

of April       1989 and why the tragedy of that day occurred.



The     actual investigation of those events has been in the hands

of     the    West Midlands Police.                  It continues so to be and it is

no     secret     that their enquiries are not complete, nor as it is

understood,          are they expected to be until some weeks or months

hence.         They     have a       formidable task.              Further, material in

their        possession        from     dates        in May was being disclosed even

only     at the end of June.                 As Counsel for the Inquiry indicated

in     his     opening,        it     must     be        obvious    to   everyone that the

investigation           is still continuing and all the evidence has not

yet been assembled.



At     the     Inquiry        no     rules     of        evidence prevailed,         no      sworn

testimony         was        given     (and     once       the     Advocates        had    become

accustomed to such licence), leading questions became the order

of    the     day,      hearsay upon hearsay was invited and opinion and

speculation            was      canvassed.                Additionally,        it    has     been

emphasised        by     the       Inquiry      in       the     circumstances        that    the

absence       of a challenge to the material laid before it will not

be taken adversely or as an indication by any of the persons or

bodies present of an acceptance of the material given.
Accordingly              it     may        be        unsafe,       even   if    it were considered

possible,           to        come        to    what       might      strictly    be described as

findings           of fact.              It is submitted that it may be dangerous to

attempt        anything              more        than       an     impression or a general view

(which in any event may ultimately be demonstrated to have been

mistaken).



In     some        areas           even        the     forming       of   a    general view may be

difficult.               For example whilst it is plain that the failure of

crush     barrier              124A        in Pen 3, perhaps in two stages, played a

crucial        part in the events, scarcely any material has been put

before        the        Inquiry           or any attempt made to enable an informed

view     to        be     tentatively                 reached as to when or how or in what

circumstances                 that        occurred.          Arguably that barrier's failure

led     to injury and death.                          The state of the material before the

Inquiry        indicates                 that        the    failure       or   failures   may   have

occurred           as     early as around about 14.47, see BBC video, or as

late     as 15.04,             see the accounts of

Their     accounts,                 it     is        noted, taken in May ( f r o m ^ s

early     as        the        2nd       of M a y ) , were not made available until the

latter        stages           of     the       Inquiry and were not the subject of an

oral     hearing.              It is submitted that no final view can, at this

stage,        be        reached as to when whatever happened to the barrier

occurred           but        it     is        likely       that     such failure was, not upon

either        of        those        times, the result of a sudden inrush of fans

from Gate C being opened.



Given     that           the        state        and       nature     of the material canvassed

before        it     will           be well in the mind of the Inquiry a detailed

discussion              of inconsistencies and conflicts is for the greater
part unlikely to be helpful.                        It is proposed in this Submission

to deal with the matters in a "broad brush manne r".



CHOICE OF GROUND



When     it     was        known        who the semi-finalists were, the Football

Authorities,              knowing the Police requirement of segregation and

which        ends        would     be     allocated to which supporters, selected

Hillsborough.               That was a decision of the F.A. and of the F.A.

alone.              Any     criticism          that might      arise      therefrom cannot

properly            be     addressed          to the     South Yorkshire Police.            Itwas

the     same        arrangement          as    had taken       place       in 1988. No       one

suggested           that        1988    had been flawed in its            Policing. No       new

circumstances were identified or disclosed.



POLICING OUTSIDE



The      Semi-Final              was     a    sporting      event,     likely     to     attract

considerable              crowds,        for the most part intent on enjoying the

company        of        their friends and fellow supporters and, it was no

doubt        hoped, a fine game.                 Whilst a formidable Police presence

at     every turn, equipped for every eventuality that might occur

to      the     imagination              anticipating         such   an   event    might      be

provided,           some judgment had to be exercised.                    It was necessary

that     a balance be struck and that required that regard be paid

to     experience           and to information and intelligence.                       It was no

more reasonable,                in the absence of intelligence, to assume that

no     one     would        turn up than it would have been to have assumed

that     some        thousands           would      present    themselves for admission

after        2.30        such     that       they   would     have     no real prospect of
getting in before the kick-off.



The Police had the previous experience of 198 8 to draw upon - a

match between the same teams in, according to the intelligence,

identical circumstances.                   Not unreasonably,       it is submitted, it

was     determined           to     follow    the      same plan and, in relation to

Leppings Lane, to provide the same level of Policing.



In     the planning not every eventuality would be spelt out, such

was     not practicable and would probably not have been wise.                        In

such circumstances it would arguably be preferable to encourage

flexibility              and the exercise of judgment and not to inhibit or

discourage           initiative.           The Policing was, by and large, to be

done        by     highly     experienced       Officers     well      acquainted   with

dealing           with     crowds, with Hillsborough matches in general and

with        the     Leppings        Lane     end and    Semi-Finals       in particular.

Added        to     that     body     of experience was the presence of highly

experienced                Merseyside         Mounted        Police.           Including

Superintendent Marshall, Chief Inspector Creaser and Inspectors

Sykes        and    Purdy,        with the 5 Mounted Officers, provision             was

made        for     some     53     Uniformed Officers        at    the   Leppings Lane

entrances          which      number       swelled to 78 upon the arrival of the

Wadsley Bridge contingent at about 2.15.



It     is    submitted        that no reasonable relevant criticism can be

levelled          at the Police planning for this event.                  That problems

occurred          which led Superintendent Marshall to ask for gates to

be    opened        should        not be taken as indicative of some planning

error.           The Policing which was to be carried out was perfectly

orthodox - no suggestion to the contrary has been made.
Reference           has       been     made      to     queueing.         In the sense of neat

lines        to     each turnstile doorway it is submitted that queueing

was     not        practicable,            was    not       done     and, as Counsel for the

Inquiry           observed,          "to expect orderly queueing from a football

crowd        is     to expect something that simply will not ever happen

and     has        never       happened".         When queueing is spoken of in this

context it is submitted that what is intended is something like

that situation which is shown in photograph MWL.10/25A in South

Yorkshire composite bundle No.l.



The     nature           of such Policing is such that it depends very much

upon     the        consent          and co-operation of the public who exercise

self     control,             listen       to    advice and observe the instructions

and directions given.                   Such Policing can be vulnerable.                      It can

be     confounded             and     overcome.             That     is     not to say that the

situation           or     occasion         is unpoliceable for plainly, depending

upon     a        preparedness to use a infinite or substantial level of

force        or     considerable            numbers         of     Police     it    is   not.    The

surprise, whether forensic or real, which greeted the admission

that such balanced Policing might fail is, it is submitted, not

justified.                It fails to recognise that Policing well short of

saturation             with     men     and      equipment,         cordons        and   barriers,

corailing          and        dragooning         the       crowds    may be appropriate and

preferred          -     even       were      the other to be practicable at such a

place for such an occasion.



LEPPINGS LANE - WHAT HAPPENED



Although          Superintendent            Marshall had asked for the closure of

Leppings           Lane        there       were       no    problems        at     Leppings     Lane
turnstiles          until           some     time        after 2.30 and more particularly

from     about       2.40.           The H.S.E. report at page 5, paragraph 4.17

indicates        a fairly steady flow actually through the turnstiles

between 2.0 5 and 2.50.



There     was however a build-up of people outside and it occurred

quite     quickly.                  It     contained         a significant and substantial

element          of non-ticket                  holders,          an     increasing     number     of

latecomers          and        a considerable number of persons who had taken

drink.           To a number of observers it appeared as though there

was concerted action.                      It was certainly unlike many experienced

Officers,        including                those from Merseyside had ever previously

witnessed.               Such        difficulties            as       occurred   may    have     been

aggravated          by        the        poor     and confusing signing leading to the

involvement          of Officers to an unnecessary degree in the giving

of directions to confused ticket holders.



NON-TICKET HOLDERS



These     should             probably           have     been     numbered       in    several 100s

(according          to        Inspector           Sykes      2000 was "probably nearer the

mark"     Day       15       page         24H)     and     the general impression is that

there     were       considerably                 more than might have been expected.

See     for     example             the accounts of Inspector Sykes and Sergeant

Proctor       Day        1    page         38F.        The      presence     of the non-ticket

holders         had          various consequences                 -    there were those who by

various devices confounded the turnstiles and their operators -

there     were       those who attempted to buy their way in and had to

be dealt with or were turned away - there were those who got to

the     turnstiles            and        went back and, curiously there were those
who     detached themselves from their fellows, submitted to being

searched and yet did not enter the ground.



There were also those who planned to get in with others - to be

the     recipients        of     tickets thrown out wrapped round coins and

tickets passed by spectators over the turnstiles as can be seen

on the video tapes.



All     the   foregoing          would inhibit the flow of people and cause

annoyance       and trouble.              Additionally there were those who may

be said to      have           had some stratagem or scheme to get in.



In     relation     to     the       last-mentioned,            the    very        notion        that

something       was planned               or    organised to defeat the Police and

embarrass       them           into having to open the gates was, in the early

stages        of        this Inquiry,                dealt      with       perhaps        somewhat

dismissively        and        treated         as    fanciful        by Counsel           for     the

Inquiry.        Clearly         it    is not a matter upon which it                       might be

expected        evidence        would          be    readily,        if ever,        available.

However,      belatedly          it       has       to   some degree emerged and it is

submitted     that       the     notion             of   a    plan    by    some     to     foment

difficulty        and     disorder         cannot        be    airily dismissed.                It is

noted    that      probably          at    the       time that this matter was first

canvassed     there       was already               in the hands of the West Midlands

Police at     least one statement to support such a view.



That    there      was some concerted effort or some stratagem was an

impression       that a number of Officers independently had arrived

at.      It     does account for some of the behaviour of members of

the crowd and it is consistent with a relentless persistence, a
surging           and     pushing from the back without reason, a disregard

for        advice        and        a        failure     to    heed the repeated requests of

Police Officers - all of which occurred.



The        material            in       the "Yellow           Book"compiled             by the South

Yorkshire           Police              discloses disturbing intelligence concerning

certain           elements              of     Liverpool           fans - a determination and an

appreciation on the part of such fans of what they can threaten

and can achieve.



The        conduct        of        some was           described          as being like a planned

invasion (PC Burns Day 17 page 15E).



It     is        significant that a large number of complaints from many

different               people,              addressed        to     a   considerable    number   of

individuals, attributed the                            events of the day to "No           Tickets",

and        "No     Tickets, the Wrong End".                          At one stage in the Inquiry

it     was        suggested that such complaints were to do perhaps with

hurt        pride        but        that        does not bear analysis.            When death and

injury        have        been           caused it is not credible, it is submitted,

that       thoughts should have been upon hurt or injured pride.                                  To

look        for     such an explanation may, it is feared, be indicative

of     a     pre-conceived notion or attitude.                             Is it not more likely

that       the      fans,           who would know better than anyone, were aware

that considerable numbers had been present and had got into the

ground without tickets, having been deprived of the opportunity

of     buying           tickets by reason of the smaller allocation?                          It is

not     unreasonable,                    it is submitted, to consider that those who

referred to "No Tickets" were advancing what they identified as

the cause of the events.
ALCOHOL



The     Inquiry           has        been provided with various information as to

the     consumption              of        alcohol        by     Liverpool     supporters in the

build-up        to        the        match.              There are the impressions of local

residents,           some        of whom found their gardens visited more than

usually by urinators and others of whom found their refuse bins

unusually        full           with        empty         cans    of    alcohol,        a     noticeable

proportion           of     which           had      previously         contained           the stronger

brands     of        beer        and        lager.          In discussions, Counsel for the

Inquiry        spoke of records provided by supermarkets giving their

alcohol        sales        in        the morning and early afternoon of the 15th

April     1989        that           show       very       high and speedy takings for such

beers and lagers - these records are yet to be produced.                                           There

are      the         testimonies                of       seasoned      and   experienced          Police

Officers:       for his part, Sergeant Smith gave this account at Day

16, page 64E:



         "I have not seen in my experience that amount of drinking

         going       on         in        the     streets prior to a football match.                   I

         speak       now        not         only from my experience of Liverpool.                      I

         have     been          to football matches in Manchester, Birmingham

         and     London,              and I have not seen that amount of drinking

         going        on             in     the          streets       prior       to        a   game".



Such     material,          though              disparate        in    source, speaks with one

voice,     namely          that consumption of alcohol in quantity by some

Liverpool        supporters                was       a    factor at this year's event that

marked it as different from the circumstances that attended the

1988 Semi-Final Cup tie.
In our submission, that factor is material to any consideration

of what happened on the 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough for two

reasons:            firstly,           it     accords        with    the    body     of   evidence

suggesting          that         this        year's match was different also for the

large     numbers           of     supporters           presenting          themselves    at   the

Leppings        Lane        end        later than usual, if not in fact late.                   In

this     connection,              the attention of the Inquiry is drawn to the

evidence of Messrs Sykes, Purdy, Duffy, Best and Crawford given

respectively           at        Day        15 page     11D         and page 24B, Day 15 page

48B,     Day         15 page 88H, Day 15 page 103D and Day 16 page 100B;

secondly,           where        the        Police     had placed proper reliance upon

Policing       with         the consent of the crowd, it made a significant

element        of     that        crowd less willing to do as counselled - for

example,        queue, await its turn - and more ready to engage upon

unhelpful           activities              of its     own      volition, such as pushing,

diving       under      horses              and   thereby       frustrating         the strenuous

efforts of the Police to manage and order the crowd in front of

Leppings        Lane turnstiles.                  In this connection, the Police face

the     dilemma of deploying manpower to eject and/or arrest those

who     arefired       by        alcohol          or    of     allowing           such persons to

continue their obstructive behaviour as part of the crowd.



LATENESS



Any     lateness        by numbers of supporters cannot be accounted for

by     traffic       conditions              or   problems and, it is submitted, can

only    be     attributed               to    their      own conduct and choice.            As to

traffic,         see        particularly               the     account      of     Superintendent

Brougham            Day 12        beginning page             110,     and        compare the 1988

experience.
UNCO-OPERATIVE BEHAVIOUR



For    whatever            reason, be it a design, the effect of alcohol or

simple        selfish           arrogance,        it     is    plain      that      there     was     a

considerable              relentless           disregard of the safety and wellbeing

of     others        by        some     fans.          Care    should be adopted when the

conduct       of         some     of     those       fans     is    perhaps euphemistically

described           as     "boisterous",             "happy",       "merry".          There was a

persistent,              heedless        pressing on by fans, the forcing open of

the     Leppings           Lane        perimeter        gates,      a     squeezing     under and

between        Police           horses, a thrusting into the throng, a surging

at     its     back        and        the climbing of side fences by the river to

endeavour to get into the crowd at its front from the side.



The state of the crowd cannot, it is submitted, be explained by

frustration              and     an individual concern that the kick-off might

be     missed.                 Frustration and           anxiety,         having to wait, must

confront        most           people     at     some       time.       They do not ordinarily

respond        by        pushing and shoving, by throwing themselves into a

mass     of people, under horses disregarding the Police their own

safety and the repeated tannoy and public address requests.



Even     if     such           conduct could be so explained by frustration or

exasperation              it     is     submitted        that such behaviour and to the

extent        encountered              on that day could not reasonably have been

anticipated               and,        when      it     occurred,         it   was    not in         the

circumstances possible to                               deal with it.



The    methods            of     dealing or attempting to deal with the crowds

were orthodox and in accordance with normal practice.
MOUNTED POLICE



As     regards     the        disposition of Mounted Police, not long after

2.35    pin     many,        if        not    most of the 13 horses deployed at the

Leppings Lane end were used to supplement the blue wrought-iron

perimeter gates, by way of further physical barrier restraining

spectators from joining the large and massing crowd in front of

the    turnstiles.                 In        our   submission,         this was a proper and

reasonable        use        of        the Mounted Police.             Indeed, at one stage,

this     ploy     caused           a     gap to appear between that crowd and the

Mounted       Police         (see        Day 16 page 61G).             If such a disposition

was     not ultimately effective, that is eloquent evidence of the

determined        and        unreasoning             mood     of   a    crowd   with the sole

apparent        intent        of getting into the ground.                   No doubt, having

by     choice     forced           open        the gates or "negotiated" the horses,

groups of those supporters did not hold back from pushing their

way     into the crowd before the turnstiles.                            In this connection,

the     reaction        of        the animals themselves should not be ignored

and provides an interesting and useful gauge of the mood of the

crowd after 2.40 pm.                    For example, Police Constable Grunhill, a

very     experienced              Officer with an experienced mount, gave this

evidence on Day 16 at page 85C:



         "Some     of        the agile supporters got underneath him.                   He's

        very      sound           and he has done a lot of ground, but even he

        got a bit agitated with that, people popping up all round

        him              the Merseyside Police horses would not walk in;

        they      had     had           enough.         The    only     way I got him to go

        backwards         towards             that    gate (one of the blue perimeter

        gates) was to rein him backwards".
So     far as any danger posed by the use of Mounted Police at the

Leppings          Lane        end     is    concerned,          the     only     accounts of any

injuries          in     fact        sustained       from the horses are those of one

spectator         whose         toe was fractured and of Sergeant Proctor who

was     kicked.          In truth, the situation that obtained in front of

the     Leppings Lane turnstiles after 2.4 0 pin was a dangerous one

and     of the kind that as much threat to life and limb was posed

by human agency than any other source of potential danger.



Further,          in     our        submission,          some     of    the spectators were a

danger         towards          themselves          where       the     Mounted      Police     were

concerned          -     particular             reference        is made to the accounts of

Messrs       Hand-Davis,              Sykes,       Ellis        and    Grunhill      all     of whom

describe          remarkable             scenes     of     spectators          diving      under the

bellies of the horses.



The     Inquiry's             attention          is respectfully drawn to the account

given by Inspector Hand-Davis and to paragraph 1.43 of the ACPO

Guide        to        Policing          football     matches          as   giving      sufficient

justification             for       the     further        use and deployment of Mounted

Police to control crowds approaching turnstiles.



CORDONS



It     has     been       said in some quarters that a filtering system or

cordoning         off         should       have     been practised.            Even if that was

practicable            (and it would have had to have been upon and across

a     public      highway           in     at     least     2    places        and enforced by a

preparedness             to     carry       out arrests)         it would have had to have

been     carried          out in streets bordered by dwellings and private
property.          It     may     be that such would simply to have been to

have     removed        the     problem       further        along the road.       It would

still     have required co-operation on the part of the spectators

to      have      been        effective        and         would   have       considerable

implications.             The     Inquiry       is     invited to conclude upon the

material before it that it is not satisfied that such cordoning

or     filtering had ever been practised although it is plain that

individual Officers or numbers of Officers undoubtedly did make

random checks upon individuals to ascertain whether or not they

were     ticket holders.           Quite what should be done with those who

lacked     tickets        or     insisted on walking along the road or gave

the     reasonable        excuse       that they were expecting to meet their

friend who would be waiting at the gates with a ticket for them

is     unclear.          To     have    arrested           individuals    without proper

justification            would     have its          own     problems and       the     very

arresting       itself         would    have        severe     manpower       implications.

However,       on the material available the Police did endeavour to

move     off   non-ticket          holders and encourage others to get into

the ground.



STEWARDING/POLICING - THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CLUB FOR SAFETY



In the Police Review for the 16th of August 1985, Lock recorded

his     "regretful        experience"          as a former Police Superintendent

responsible         for        Policing football             matches     held     in   South

Yorkshire as follows:



         " ..... frequently            the    Police take it upon themselves to

         assume     stewards       duties.           This is not acceptable.            Some

         football        clubs     pay       only    lip     service     to     stewarding,
            offering          derisory           salaries,        so it is not surprising to

            find       the     least           able employed in those positions .....

            Clubs       must be forced to employ fit, able-bodied, trained

            persons in those positions and not just match watchers."



In     his        account          to     the     Inquiry,        Lock     recognised   that the

physical           abilities of the stewards employed at Hillsborough by

the Club are restricted by their ages (Day 31 page 48 at A ) .



Further,           many       of the stewards in attendance at the Semi-Final

ties        this year received no more than £9 for carrying out their

duties       (page 141 of the Club Bundle).



Our     submission             is        that     such a meagre sum reflects the basic

limited           nature       of        the     tasks     in     fact     carried out by those

stewards.              In broad terms, the job of stewards at Hillsborough

is     to        help people to go wherever their ticket directed them -

for     example,             the        full-time        job     of a West stand steward was

described by one witness as telling spectators which rows their

seats are on (Day 21 page 116G).



Moreover,             this job is not begun at the Leppings Lane end until

a     spectator           presents             himself     at     the     foot of the stairways

leading          to     the     West           stand.          There     are no stewards in the

forecourt             between           the blue perimeter gates and the turnstiles

(Day        21     at page 82G), nor any stewards at the turnstiles (Day

21 page 8 2 F ) .            Similarly, on the occasion of the Semi-Final tie

this year, there were no stewards in the concourse area between

the    turnstiles              and       the      West    stand stairways - except for a

solitary steward, without instructions as to giving directions,
stood     at     the     gateway           in the wall running between Gate B and

Gate C.        Lastly, there were no stewards on the Terraces.



The     slightness        and        simplicity          of    the   role     played     by the

stewards        has     increased          the burden upon the Police and led to

the     apparent        assumption          of        duties    adverted to by Lock.         In

effect, the Police are left to direct spectators to the correct

turnstile            sections,        to    check        spectators     for     tickets,     to

persuade        and     cajole spectators to the outer Pens (Day 31 page

55F),     to     evacuate spectators from the West stand (Day 21 page

31C)     and     to     concern        themselves with the gates at the top of

the     radial        fences        on the Leppings Lane Terraces (Day 21 page

32C) .



Indeed,        the     imbalance           of function between the Police and the

Club's     stewards           has     caused such a reliance to be placed upon

the     former by the Club that Lock stated that he would quiz the

Police,        as the responsible party as it were, if he noticed the

ground to be filling slowly (Day 31 page 68F) .



Again,     in our submission, this reliance may have been fostered

for     two reasons:          firstly, so far as the Club is concerned, the

Police         have      successfully             managed       their   games     and,     more

particularly,           met        the difficulties posed by the topography of

the     Leppings Lane end (see the account of Stuart Thorpe at Day

21      page     47A) ;       secondly,          to     the    extent   that     the     Police

stewarded,        the     Club        is    relieved from training fit and able-

bodied     stewards           to    carry        out the multiplicity of stewarding

tasks identified below.
At    Chapter          4,        paragraph           4.13     of        his final report prepared

following            the     Bradford           Fire        Disaster, Mr Justice Popplewell

identified this dangerous misconception:



           "Because,             as     a matter of practice, Police Officers have

           regularly             attended in large numbers at football grounds,

           it    has        somehow           been     assumed          by    the      Clubs   that the

           responsibility                for     control           of    what goes on inside the

           ground has passed from them to the Police11.



The       evidence          given        by Mackrell suggest that this assumption

has been made by the Club.                           On Day 30 at page 116D he stated:



           "The       Police           were     operating the system themselves.                    The

           Police          had        never     come        back to me at any time and said

           hang       on,        the     Green        Guide        says you have got to do the

           stewarding.                We are not going to do it any more 11.



In    short,          soon after publication of the 1986 Green Guide, the

impetus         for        changing        what may have gone on in the ground was

to    be     provided,            if by anyone, according perhaps to the Club's

view, by the Police who in effect were there for monitoring, as

an ongoing concern, the safety of crowds attending Hillsborough

football stadium.



As    a     matter of generalisation, the 1986 Green Guide states at

Chapter         2,    paragraph           23 that the safety of the public inside

the       ground      is the responsibility of those who stage the event

and       administer             the     ground        in     which          it   is    held   ie   the

"management".              This        responsibility              applies in both normal and
emergency         situations.             With specific regard to stewarding the

1986 Green Guide makes the following matters plain:



          (i)       Effective         stewarding            should prevent overcrowding

                    in     sections         of    the       ground        (preface to Chapter

                    13);



          (ii)     Basic duties stewards are called upon to carry                         out

                    include        "controlling             or directing members of       the

                    public     who are entering or leaving the ground, to

                    help achieve an even flow of people to the viewing

                    areas      and        safe    dispersal          of    spectators on the

                    terraces         or     "viewing slopes" and "patrolling the

                    ground      to        deal    with any emergencies".             (Chapter

                    13, paragraph 195(a) and (b));



          (iii)    Stewards        should         prevent overcrowding by ensuring

                    that     the      crowd       limits      in     various parts of     the

                    ground      are        complied         with     (Appendix     B, Section

                    2 (i)) •



None of    these responsibilities is set out in similar terms or

at all in the original Green Guide and their inclusion as part

of the 1986 publication marks the new emphasis placed after the

Bradford         Fire     Disaster        upon        the   primary        duty   of Clubs to

safeguard         those     admitted        into        their      grounds and onto their

stadia through the agency of competent and fully-trained safety

stewards.



In   the context of Hillsborough,                     such emphasis should have done



                                                 18
no    more     than reinforce the general duties allocated to safety

stewards       by        Section          9        of     the 1979 Safety Certificate.           The

absence       of        reference             to        stewards    upon    the    Leppings      Lane

terraces       at        Schedule             3,        Part   2 of the Certificate does not

absolve       the Club         of        its       responsibility,            as     identified by

Paragraph          195(b)       of        the           1986 Green Guide, for       the safety of

spectators upon those terraces.



The    Safety           Certificate cannot and should not be regarded as a

synthesis          of     the       Green           Guide's        particular      application     to

Hillsborough               football                stadium     even     less as      a   definitive

statement of             how the Club was to discharge its duties.                          Rather,

at    all     times,        the          Club           - like any commercial organisation,

which is run for profit, organising a private function - should

be regarded as having the primary and continuing obligation and

responsibility             to       ensure              reasonable safety for those who are

invited       onto its premises.                         Some recognition was given to this

responsibility             by       the        Club        document,       "Use    and Training of

Stewards”          -     stated          only           to be for "management information” .

The attention of the Inquiry is once more respectfully drawn to

Sections 1, 3 and 8 of that document.



In    contra        distinction, the Popplewell Report, the Green Guide

and    the     Safety Certificate identify the Police's primary duty

as    to     secure        and preserve law and order.                       This is set out in

unequivocal            terms        at Chapter 4, paragraph 4.15 of the Report.

Similarly,          Section          7     of the Safety Certificate provides that

the   holder shall at his own expense arrange for the attendance

of an adequate number of Police Officers "to secure the orderly

and lawful behaviour of the spectators” .
These        few        statements       of     what       is the proper and appropriate

division           of responsibility between the stewards and the Police

may not concur with what the Inquiry might consider was in fact

undertaken              by these two bodies of men.               What the Police did or

did     not        do     in    the past, the acceptance by Officers in their

accounts of a "responsibility” or of a function does not in law

determine           that       responsibility.              The    Police     were    not sub­

contracting stewards on behalf of the Club.                             Even if they could

properly           in law take on that role it could only be done in the

clearest           of terms.          Whilst Lock spoke of the existence of some

agreement           to       some     such     effect       (in   the   absence      of    clear

suggestion              thereof        in his        statement     and the novelty of its

suggestion              at     so   late      a stage in the Inquiry apart) such is

refuted        by       the Police who crave leave to refer, in particular,

to     the     statement,              of    Superintendent Chapman, dated 3rd July

1989     which           has    been        served     upon the Inquiry and is annexed

hereto.             It is understood in any event that the Club does not

so assert.



The     better           explanation          for    the    variance between theory and

practice        may be found, with respect, upon consideration of the

most     pertinent             area     of     immediate      concern       to this Inquiry,

namely        crowd          control     on     the Leppings Lane terraces.               If the

division        of       responsibility, stewards to Police, is decided in

fact according to where stewards were placed - for example, the

safety stewards had little concern for the safety of spectators

in     the West stand, except when an emergency arose (Day 21 page

117D)     -    so        too the decision as to where stewards were placed

was     determined             in     large part by their fear of going onto the

Leppings       Lane terraces.                 Perhaps the most eloquent evidence in
support        of     this        last       submission was the reaction that Chief

Inspector           Calvert1s           address        to     the     stewards       at the annual

meeting of 19 81 prompted.



Is     the     assertion           that        those        terrace are a "no-go area11 for

stewards        good        or any justification for causing them to be the

preserve        of the Police?                 Stewards worked upon the Spion Kop at

the     Semi-Final           tie        this    year         amongst       away     fans where the

anticipation             was of Liverpool supporters having some Spion Kop

tickets and theref-ore^Of their |tingling with "rival fans".                                   One

may     query       whether            the     Policeman's           lot    is     likely   to be a

happier        one than a steward's upon terraces.                               Indeed, if such a

steward        is     fit        and able-bodied there is no reason to suppose

that     he might not effectively discharge his tasks.                                  Evidently,

some     football           clubs        had       regarded stewards as having greater

potential           than their present deployment at Sheffield Wednesday

might        suggest        -     see,       for     example         the reference to Chelsea

Football        Club        in     Lock's          Police      Review       article referred to

abo ve.



In     like     manner, we submit that the suggestion that the Police

were         somehow         agents            for     the          Club     in     meeting     its

responsibilities                 for     the       safety      of stewards on the Leppings

Lane    terraces            cannot be accepted or regarded as justification

for,     in effect, not actively managing that part of the ground.

There     was no agreement between Police and Club to give rise to

such an agency.             In any event, the "agency argument" is no more

than    the        practical realisation of the dangerous misconception

identified          by     Mr     Justice          Popplewell         and is contrary to the

spirit,       if     not        the      letter, of the 1986 Green Guide.                   To the
extent        that the Inquiry may entertain the notion of a de facto

agency,        this can and should not absolve the de facto, and here

de jure, principal                  (the Club)         from its overall responsibility.



Where        the     Club faces responsibility in matters of safety that

could        not     be        assumed         by any other agency, our submission is

that     in        material          respects          the Club failed to meet them.           In

particular,              as     regards         the     role     and importance of a Safety

Officer and in relation to sign-posting within the ground.



If     Lock        was        the    Safety       Officer        at     the Inquiry, the chief

steward        for the West stand, namely Stuart Thorpe, was the only

person        to     consider            him     as such.        That said, it would appear

both     from        the Police Review article and from Section 1 of the

Local        Plan        that       at    some        previous        occasion    Lock   had been

regarded, if only by himself, as Safety and Security Consultant

to the Club.



If Mackrell was the Safety Officer, he described himself in his

account        to the Inquiry as Chief Executive for the Club, rather

than     in        addition         its        Safety     Officer.         On the information

presently           available,            it    would      appear       that     Mackrell had no

special        expertise            in    matters         of safety.       Further, one might

query        the    wisdom          of    having         the same person acting as Chief

Executive           and       as    Safety Officer where the ensuring of safety

may     be a costly process - please see again Minutes of Meetings

in     the Club Bundle which indicate that expense was a deterrent

to installing further turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end.



So     far     as     sign-posting               is     concerned       this     was a matter of
particular           importance          where, as indicated above there were no

stewards        in     the        concourse      and      the    solitary steward at the

gateway        in     the wall running between Gates B and C was without

instruction.           Complaint had been made about the sign-posting at

earlier        annual        meetings (see the evidence of Stuart Thorpe at

Day     21     page        38B), though it would appear that such complaint

fell     on deaf ears.              In consequence, at the Semi-Final tie this

year     the        only     way     people      were likely to get onto the North

standing        area        was     if they happened to see the steward at the

gateway        and     he     was     pointing         towards     that area or by going

through        the     tunnel,        onto      the centre Pens and then filtering

along        (see     Day         21 page       4OF) .    The inadequacy of this sign­

posting        gave        rise     to      a    potential for      overcrowding in   the

central Pens.



LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE



Given that the supporters were all of the same persuasion there

was     no question of any segregation occurring, the whole of the

terracing           being     available for their use.               Additionally it was

an     all     ticket match          and          unlikely that the capacity of       the

terraces        would             be exceeded.           As in 1988 the Police were   not

intending to fulfil nor had any arrangement been made that they

should perform any stewarding role.



The    giving         of a choice to spectators as to where to stand may

be    mistaken.              The fact is that the Club took no steps on the

day     in    question            in the discharge of its obligations to those

who purchased Leppings Lane terrace tickets.
The     situation on the terraces can be observed from the videos,

the     photographs                    and        the     accounts         of     those who were there.

Whatever           view           is        expressed           thereon         will be determined by a

number        of        individual                 and        perhaps peculiar factors including

one's previous experience,                               if any, one's standpoint (whether in

a particular part of the crowd), one's sensitivity, the time of

assessment,              (whether                 it     is contemporaneously with the events

or,     for        example,                 the        result     of having been present at this

Inquiry)           and        the           criteria employed.                  At the end it cannot be

more     than           an        impression              and     the impression may be that the

central        Pens           still           had        some     room      by     2.46.    Such however,

because        of the distribution may have been entirely wrong.                                       The

accounts           by various fans may not be easily reconciled but they

were there. Ian Clark spoke of Pen 3 being quite full with room

for another 100 and feeling "slightly squashed when the players

came     on,        like           at Anfield” .                Diane Connolly spoke of it being

crowded        by        a quarter to three saying it was "like an ordinary

match     day           when           it     is        packed11.        Mr Moody spoke of it being

uncomfortably                 full           at        2.48     and   Mr        Postlethwaite     of being

anxious        for           his own safety at 2.40.                        Clearly the density will

vary from place to place and from moment to moment.                                             There were

accounts by fans of no problems before kick-off.



It is submitted that if the Pens were overcrowded at some stage

Police        Control              are not to be criticised for not noticing what

no one else saw.



As     soon        as        it     was           appreciated that there was a problem the

Police        reacted              and        the       perimeter         gates     were     opened.   The

photographic                 and       video           material       shows       that     the gates were
opened        certainly           by     2.59    and that by then numbers of people

were     already           out     on     the    perimeter     track.   That any Police

Officer            ignored what            he    saw to   be    a problem is resisted,

although       the      speed           with which it nature was appreciated may,

for     some, have been conditioned by thoughts of ground security

and     pitch        invasion.            The Liverpool goalkeeper's account, not

tested        by     cross-examination,              is plainly wrong in a number of

respects,           showing on his part an understandable pre-occupation

with     the        game.          Whatever        efforts are made to reconcile his

recollection           with        the     accounts of others it is plain that he

was oblivious of any problems until well into the game and when

play was down at the Forest end.



We     invite        the        view,     having     regard    to the accounts that no

conclusion could safely be drawn but that once opened,                         (save in

respect        of     what Mr Smith             did),     any of the gates were again

closed        and     that in           Mr Smith's case what happened is credible

and     explicable.                In his case no conclusion, it is contended,

could        fairly        be     drawn     that his closing of Gate 3 had any or

any other than momentary effect.



The     presence           and     concern of the Police was for public order,

but not such as to preclude them from activity and intervention

in     the     event        of peril or hurt appearing or appearing likely.

When such was perceived they acted.



There        was     some        suggestion       that Police Officers had actually

thrust people back into the crowd, and assaulted and beat them.

We     contend that no conclusion to that effect can reasonably be

arrived        at.     If the accounts thereof have any credibility, and
that      is      disputed,           they        are     not     supported       aliunde,       no

photographic or video material to that effect has been seen and

they     may     be the result of incorrectly perceiving what in fact

was     being     done.         We     submit           that     there is no force in the

criticism that the Police should have been tuned to looking for

overcrowding        or     to have immediately recognised the reason why

individuals        were     coming          out     of     the        Pens.     When     it   was

understood       that     individuals             were     being hurt          and crushed the

Officers acted.



RADIAL AND PERIMETER GATES



The     first     radial     fences          were introduced to improve Policing

following        1981.The provision of gates in them was, so far as

the Police were concerned, necessary to provide access for them

and,     when     segregation was being practised, the gates would be

closed     in     which     circumstances,                as     described       by     Inspector

Calvert        they would be attended by the Police.                           That such gates

were     ever     agreed by the Police to be constantly manned is not

the     Police understanding.                Mr Calvert the only witness who was

actually present at the various occasions when the matter arose

has     given    his      unequivocal             account.            Not only was it not so

understood,       it was not so practised.



The     perimeter       gates        were     attended           by    the     Police     but for

Policing purposes.



The     value on the day of the perimeter gates as constructed for

other     than    Police access is most debatable.                            In fact by their

size      and    the      approach          to     then        they may       have      proved    a
disadvantage rather than a benefit.



COMMAND AND CONTROL



The     account of what happened in the control box has been given

by     those who were there.                 Their attention was not only focused

upon        the    Leppings      Lane        terraces   nor upon the Leppings Lane

entrances               although        by    degrees   the        latter   assumed   more

importance.



As     to     what was happening at the Leppings Lane entrance whilst

the     impression         may have been of numbers it was not, certainly

at     an early stage one of risk to life and limb.                         That occurred

when        the    mood,    as     it    has been put, changed.             At 2.30 it is

submitted          it    would     be    difficult      to fault a decision not to

postpone          the    kick-off.            Thereafter      it    may be difficult to

identify a time when such a decision might have been considered

to be reached in time to have made any difference.



When     PC Buxton was asking for it the problem at the turnstiles

was perhaps demanding more instant relief.



COMMUNICATIONS



The difficulties of the day were compounded by a communications

problem       but       those    problems were not peculiar to the Police.

The     radios of others were affected.                 Communication on the Club

radio       was     thwarted       and       difficulties were experienced by the

Ambulance         Service.         No fault has in fact been found in any of

the     equipment.         The problem may have been one of the amount of
air     traffic,           it     does    not appear to have been related to any

particular          part of the ground.                The equipment was orthodox and

its     manner        of        usage, on talk-through, well practised.                    Radio

equipment plainly has its limitations and even when functioning

has to compete with the external noise.



COMMUNICATION



Chief        Superintendent              Duckenfield has given his account of his

understanding              of the peril of Leppings Lane entrances.                        He had

a life threatening situation at the turnstiles, the result of a

throng in a narrow space and the requests of an experienced and

valued        Officer,           Superintendent          Marshall,    for the gates to be

opened.            Beyond the gates was ample space.                      The opening of the

gates        would run counter to Policing policy.                         To open the gates

whilst perhaps the obvious course was not a decision,                                it may be

said     easily          taken.           In    the circumstances, whilst foresight

(essentially             the      result       of     hindsight)     might       suggest     that

various            matters        should       have     entered    his     mind,     his     pre­

occupation was with the safety of those outside.                                 It is perhaps

too     easy        here        to say what else he should have done.                  He gave

the order to open the gates.



CRUSHING



Given        the    propensity            in the terraces for fans to sway, surge

and     move       and      that     such       actions     are,     it     is   arguable,     in

themselves          potentially           highly       dangerous      (whether or not any

barrier        fails        should       anyone lose their footing or faint), it

may     be     difficult to form any reliable view as to how and when
any     particular              injury        or        death       was    in     fact        caused.   The

situation           may        be      simple or          may        be highly complex, but the

substantial              injuries           and    death        would          appear    to      have been

sustained           in        Pen      3     and below the area protected by barrier

124A.         To     arrive at a view that because people went into the

tunnel       upon         the         opening of          Gate        C    injuries or death were

thereby        caused would require a detailed investigation the like

of     which        has        not,     on        the     occasion         of     this Inquiry, been

attempted.               Whilst perhaps convenient and for certain purposes

attractive such a simplistic view would not, it is submitted be

justified.               This         has     not        been        a trial nor is there, it is

submitted,               the           material            available             upon         which     such

conclusions              might even be tentatively based.                           Whilst it may be

considered           that           notions        such        as     the burden and standard of

proof        may     impede           the     Inquiry process, the fact is that they

have     not        featured           and        that what has been done has been done

whilst evidence and further material are still being sought and

gathered.           Speculation              will        not        suffice      although        it may be

interesting              to          ponder         what            satisfactory         or     sufficient

explanation              or explanations can be given for, as appears to be

the     case,        some           deaths having occurred to individuals who may

have     come        in       at      the     second opening of Gate C.                       The Inquiry

cannot,        it        is     submitted permit the conclusions post hoc ergo

propter hoc.



As to the positions in which people may have died we urge that,

as     has    been indicated will be the case, there should be taken

into     account          the         material          supplied          by     the South Yorkshire

Police in relation to Pen 3.
ACTIONS



Criticism is made of the Police action taken upon the nature of

the     problem        being realised.              In this context it is urged that

it was not unreasonable for there to have been no specific plan

to     deal     with     such        an     event.      It was not foreseen.      When it

occurred        it was horrendous and outside anyones expectation but

Police        Officers        at     different levels displayed initiative and

acted     whether        or        not they had been previously or were at the

material        time     under instruction and direction.                  Officers went

to the tunnel within moments and made endeavours to relieve the

throng        and bring out casualties.                  Such was done quite quickly.

The     perimeter        gates           were    opened,     people were helped up and

out.      Endeavours were made to cause the crowd to go back which

endeavours were not it seems understood or immediately complied

with.          Many in the crowd were oblivious that any incident let

alone     some       tragedy         had        occurred although they were close to

it.



A     major     incident           was     set     in   train,     operation support was

called,        Ambulance           and     help was summoned.         In so far as there

was     chaos or confusion that,                  in the earlier stages,        is perhaps

understandable.               People        did      their   best    in   many instances

without        regard     for        their       personal convenience or wellbeing.

Officers,        Messrs       Nesbitt, Greenwood and McKay for example set

about         arranging       and        organising.         The    emergency    services

attended       and      it must, in the light of the material available,

be     doubtful      whether any lives or injuries would or could have

been     saved       in the circumstances by any other course of action

once it was realised that people were trapped and crushed.
EMERGENCY SERVICES



In     our submission, close analysis of the accounts given to the

Inquiry        reveal            that        such     obstacles      as    may    have presented

themselves            to        emergency           vehicles   (for example, non-emergency

vehicles         blocking              in     part     an   access        route   or advertising

hoardings            on       the perimeter of the pitch) were temporary or no

impediment.                   Most significantly, the attention of the Inquiry

is     respectfully               drawn to the account given by Station Officer

Higgins        at         Day     24        page     49C where he stated that, so far as

SYMAS Ambulances were concerned:



          "I     think it went as smoothly using the first entrance as

          it would have done using the in-out method"



and     then         also        to the account given by Station Officer Easson

on Day 24 at page 68E which suggests that the in-out method may

have      been        available              to     such Ambulances from the first or at

least       from          a     stage        earlier than Station Officer Higgins was

himself aware of.

Dear Lord Taylor,

     Thank you for your kind letter of 22/5/89,
acknowledging my own deep interest in this dreadful
disaster.

     I do not envy you the terrible task that confronts
you, and hope that we shall all benefit from your
deliberation.




                                             Yours sincerely.

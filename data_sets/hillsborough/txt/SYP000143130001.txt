        INSIDE GROUND AT LEPPINGS LN END OF GROUND ADJACENT TO

(PLEASE SEE MAP AT REAR OF QUES TIO NA IRE )

I WAS OUTSIDE THE MAIN LEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCE FROM 1100 TO ABOUT             1200

MIDDAY.     AND THEN I WENT BACK INSIDE ADJACENT TO THE TURNSTILE




07.     DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS OR INJURIES AT THE TIME THIS DISASTER

        HAPPENED?

        AT APPROXIMATELY   1400 HOURS GATE C .    AT THE LEPPINGS LN END WAS

OPENED AND APPROXIMATELY 150 - 200 PEOPLE RUSHED THROUGH,         DURING

WHICH TIME TWO BOYS (APPROX TEN YEARS) RECEIVED AN INURY TO HIS

FACE.     I DID NOT WITNESS HOW IT HAPPENED BUT AS A RESULT OF WHAT MY

WIFE SAID TO ME I BELIEVE IT WAS GRAZED FROM RUBBING ALONG THE WALL.

THE GATE WAS CLOSE APPROXIMATLEY ONE MINUTE AT THE MOST AFTER         IT WAS

OPENED AT 1400 HOURS.      ALSO AT THIS TIME I SAW AN ADULT LYING ON THE

FLOOR AT POINT NEAR TO GATE C AND TURNSTILE A.          STEWARDS AND POLICE

OFFICERS WERE IN THE VICINITY, AND SOMEONE WAS LOOK ING AFTER H I M / H E R .



      GATE C WAS AGAIN OPENED AT APPROX    1450 WHEN ABOUT 800 - 1000

PEOPLE SURGED THROUGH.     NONE OF THESE STOPPED,     THEY RAN STRAIGHT

TOWARDS THE TUNNEL AREA AND PASSED US.           ON THIS OCCASION STEWARDS
                                                                          PAGE     4
                                                                          D 540

AND POLICE WERE BEING PUSHED AND SWORN AT.           ATMOSPHERE AT THIS

POINT FROM THIS SURGE WAS VERY TENSE.



I DID NOT WITNESS WHO OPENED THE GATES BUT BOTH STEWARDS AND POLICE

OFFICERS WERE PRESENT,   WHEN IT WAS OPENED.



      NB.   ON BOTH OCCASIONS THE GATES WERE OPENED LARGE NUMBERS OF

PEOPLE WERE OBVIOUSLY DISTRESSED AND SOME WERE GASPING FOR THEIR

BREATH A ND IT WAS BEING DISCUSSED ABOUT THE LARGE VOLUME OF PEOPLE

OUTSIDE TRYING TO GET IN.     ONE MAN HAD APPARENTLY BEEN WAITING AT THE

FRONT OF THE QUEUE FOR SOME FORTYFIVE MINUTES.




QS.   WERE YOU SUBJECTED TO ANY THREATS OR ANY VIOLENCE DURING THIS

      FOOTBALL MATCH?   (Briefly Explain)



      NO




Q9.   DID YOU WITNESS ALCOHOL BEING BROUGHT INTO THE GROUND OR CONSUMED

      IN THE GROUND ON THIS DAY?   (Briefly E x p l a i n ) .



      NO - BUT A LOT OF THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE VERY DRUNK.             TO

THE POINT THAT SOME HARDLY STAND AND TALK
                                                                         PAGE   5
                                                                         D540




G10.    DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSHING OR SURGE.      IF YES,   GIVE TIME

        AND BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



        YES - SEE CONTINUATION OF QUESTION 7




Q 1 1. WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH OR SURGE.       IF YES, GIVE

        TIME AND BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



        NO   - BECAUSE I PLACED THREE SAFETY BARRIERS AROUND US (MYSELF

MY WIFE AND A YOUTH NAMEd            TO PREVENT THIS.




Q 12.   IS THERE ANY VITAL   INFORMATION YOU HAVE FOR THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



        AT APPROXIMATELY 1430 A NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS      (POSSIBLY 20

IN N U M B E R ) RAN THROUGH THE MAIN CENTRE WALL AND INTO OUR AREA AROUND

GATE C AND TURNSTILES A - G.        I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY WENT ONLY THAT

THEY WENT TOWARDS PENS ONE AND TWO OF THE WEST STAND.



        A NUMBER OF YOUTHS CLIMBED OVER THE WALL ABOVE THE TURNSTILES

-1 - 16.     THIS HAPPENED ON TWO OCCASIONS

             1ST AT ABOUT 1350        2ND AT ABOUT 1440
                                                                     PAGE

Q13.   IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO SAY ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THE

       15 APRIL 1989?



       GENERALLY THE SUPPORTERS DID NOT ENTER THE GROUND VERY QUICKLY

AND FOR SOME REASON THE TURNSTILES WERE CLOSED?     ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT

CONFIRM THIS.     PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE

TRYING TO ENTER THE GROUND WITHOUT TICKETS AND THIS WAS POSSIBLY THE

REASON FOR THIS.

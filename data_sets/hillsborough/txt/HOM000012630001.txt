THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


I attach for your information correspondence I have received from
the Police Superintendents' Association, together with a copy of
my response.

The main concern of the Association is that the definition of
"pitch" in any new legislation should embrace any area used or
intended to be used by participants in the sport.

I support the view that the term "pitch" will require careful
drafting and should be sufficiently wide to encompass areas
additional to the actual playing surface.

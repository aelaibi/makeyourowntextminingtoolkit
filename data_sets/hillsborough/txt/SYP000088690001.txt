               I am e m p l o y e d     by    the S o u t h Yorksj^ire Are a He>rlth A u t h o r i t y as a

               hospital        porter,        an d work at the N o r t h e ^ / ^ e n e r a l     Hospital.          I have

               been e m p l o y e d     by    the H e a l t h A u t h o r i t y for almost     four years.

               Qn S a t u r d a y   15th      April    1989    (150489),        I was working 2pm              (1400)       x10pm

               (2.200) at the hospital.                  I had my      radio on and heard there was



            O our      boss,   a                      I a head

              ’porters      to be d r a f t e d     into    the e m e r g e n c y    casualty department.                There


NWV            was also a large               response     from off      duty       porters   to assist also.                   I

               h e l p e d to get all          the^emergency        e q uipment       ready for     the     casualties.

               At about        quarter        p;*€t three     (1515)     these a m b u l aa n c ^ T s t < t e d to arrive
                                                                                                    star

               wit h    casualties           on board.      I walked       into the      resus      room and saw three

               young     people       being wo r k e d on,      they all        looked     in a bad way,           one      of
                                                                                                                          PAGE            2.
                                                                                                                          S3295

               these     looked         like my brother,          wit h dark hair.              I remember        t h a t one

V   i    H^    of the y oung            people     being w o r k e d on had m o u s e y h a i r an d w a s wearing

               a red L i v e r p o o l     top.      All    these were        in the         resus    room.

        13"?   Later     I remember         taking        the young      boy w ith the          red Liv e r p o o l     top     into

               the     plaster      room w h i c h was acting as a mortuary,                         a student        nurse

               a s s i s t e d me to wheel          the    boy on a t r o l l e y to the             plaster     room.        I do

               inot know the            name of the student             nurse     nor    could       I describe        the nurse,

               t hey    change h o s p i t a l s     © very six weeks a n d             is not at my hospital                 now.

               I could not          i d e ntify the n u r s e .         It a p p e a r e d    to roe that this y o u n g boy ,

               was     dead,      and    I think     there were         other     dead bodies           in the    plaster        room.

               After     this      I returned        to the amb u l a n c e a d m i s s i o n are a a n d together

               with     other      porters a n d helpers/u              assisted        in the       removal     of    people

               f rom ambula n c e s .        Mr WARDDRjffi, a C onsultant,                    did a quick e x a m i n a t i o n of

               the     people and they were                either   sent to the              plaster     room    if they were

               dead,     if serious         injured but a live they were                      sent to the        resus    room,

               if w a l k i n g    injured they were sent to the                     physio on War d 60.

               Du r i ng the a f t e r n o o n      I took several           dead bodies            to the    plaster     room

               a n d the m a j o r i t y of these           I cannot       remember,          but    I do remember a girl

               a g e d a b out     15 yrs,       she had dark hair,             an d w e a r i n g j e a n s .    She was        blue

               fro m    the neck up.             I remember       her    being      in the      plaster       room,     but

               nowh e r e    else.        She had been w o r k e d         on because          I saw tubes and a drip

               in her       hand.        I als o    remember a good           looking         lad a ged about 23 yrs,

         ~ v s lim build,           dark short        hair.       He was      sun-tanned,            with a n e a r r i n g .     He

bcA&           was w e a r i n g jeans,          white     new socks.         I remember            seeing    this     lad in the

               plaster       room.        I cannot        remember mo v i n g      him.        Most     of the dead wer e so

               young,       I c o u l d n ’t beli e v e     it.

               W h e n we were w i n d i n g        down a member          of staff,          I d o n ’t remember who,

               tol d me that fans wer e               fight i n g on C floor at the hospital.                           I saw a

               police       van    parked o u t s i d e and       I went      out a n d told the driver and the

               P o l i c e all     got out a n d went          to C floor.           I did not see a n y fighting                    or
                                                                                                      PAG E    3

              di s t u rbance as    I returned to my floor w h i c h       is above C floor.

              I do not    know for     certain how m a n y dead bodies         I m oved during    the

              afternoon,      but   I saw about twelve      in the      plaster    room.

              I continued to help until about             10pm   (2200)    whe n   I left work.

              Later   in the day      I a s s i s t e d other staff    in taking    bodies   from the

              plaster    room to the mortuary.         I cannot       identify these.      (Signed)

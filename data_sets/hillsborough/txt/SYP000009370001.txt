of the West S tand approx 20                       persons who were             lying    on the ground all

of who m      had some form of               covering          over their       faces.        1 gathe r e d    that

these     people were          deceased.             We were then directed                by a Police

O ffi c e r who      I think was            a Sergeant to go             into the       tunnel    under    the

 ^ st S tand which gave access                      to    pens at the          rear   of the goal a r e a .

As we emerged from the                     tunnel       I saw a lot of          people    on the    pitch but

only a few          remaining       in Pen 3.              We were       directed to a hole           in the

fence w h ich had been forced                      open and up and tied with a scarfe which

was    from a Liverpool             supporter.                 We went    to the hole and          climbed onto

the    pitch a nd i mmediately set to work.                              The    first    person    (marked XA

on map)       was   on the grass/at                the    rear    of the goal         nets.       I was     told by

hair.         I am unable          to say what            he was wearing.               At this    stage      I was

wo r k i n g with F /M                                    We    inserted a Brook Ai r w a y         into      the

man's m outh and then a t te mp te d to revive him with oxygen.                                      This was

:arried on for 3 or 4 minu t e s                        but was    unsuccessful.                    H and     I then

(Ex no              )(Ref              no    as    I m oved       to this        casualty     I was aware that

manual        operation by tilting           his head back,          clearing    the a i r w a y and

using     o xygen on him.            We a gain worked        on him for 3 or 4 minutes                  and

whe n we got no response we moved to XC as                          shown on map                       I I am

able     to say about        this    casualty     is that      he was a white male 2 0-30

years     of age.        j~'KTe again wor k e d on him for a similar               length of time

but a g a i n got      no response.           Under    instructions        from Sft-                  to move

other     casualties at the Ko p end of the ground.                         Wh©4i we a r r i v e d

at XD as        shown on map            we we re instructed again by SO                                to get

a bill        board to use as a stretcher              for   this     casualty.          We    left    our

equipment with SO                            "ogether with F/M                   I ran to the side

of the        pitch and got an ad v e r t i s i n g     board and took          it back to position

XD,       SO              was working        on this man w hen we          returned.            I was

then     instructed by SO                     to qo to the amb u l a n c e area as m a r k e d on

m ap           and obtain some more Brook Airways.                      I went     to the a mbulances

but was        told there were        none    left    but some would arrive              in 10 minutes,

I went        back to SO               and    reported my findings.                At    this    point       I
                                                             / '
observed        that XD was     on a stretcher and''was being                 conveyed         to an
                                                        /
ambulance        together with our           r e s u scitation      equipment.          I am only able

to say that         this was a white male / i n his                late teens.          I then m o v e d to

position XE and saw a man who                  l/believe was a doctor working                    on the

casualty.           The doctor was       giving       cardiac massage and m outh                to mouth

and was asking me           if we     carried any       painkilling        drugs w hich we d o n ’t.

At     this    point   I had with me another            r e s u s c i t a t i o n set w hich    the doctor

d i d n ’t require.         I am only able to say that                 XE was a young male.



I then went with my oxygen set to two or three                           doctors who were

w ork i n g    on casualties        on the    pitch and offered oxygen but                    on each

occasion        it was    refused.       I then went         to an area behind the goal at

the Kop end of the ground and                  rendered basic          first aid to two teenage

males who were           suffering     from shock.           Following      this    I gave my

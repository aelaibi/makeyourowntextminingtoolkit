            Driver -                   Attendent -                        Vehicle 8211
            At 1551 a call from Control was received asking if we were aware of the______
            incident at Hillsborough.                 At the time we were not.______________ __________
            The controller then gave a brief account of the incident, telling us to call
            out of base on Channel 4 then change to ERC1, South Yorkshire Control and ask
            for further instructions.                                 ________________
            At 1553hrs 8211, from Retford, was dispatched with L/A                                       and myself on
            board.     South Yorkshire Control were contacted, we were instructed to proceed
            to the Hillsborough Football Ground where further instructions v/ould be______
            given. .________________________ _ _ _____________________________________
            En route a message was given by South Yorkshire Control to all mobiles to
            proceed towards I-Ierries Road side of the ground.___________ ______________
            Further instructions to all mobiles v/ere given.                              Further casualities should
            be taken to the Hallamshire Hospital as the Northern General was full._____
            As L/A        knew of tine Herries Road location we continued to the stadium.
            On getting nearer the Ground we followed behind a South Yorkshire Airibulance
            to the scene.                     _______________________________ _________________
            On arrival, at 1633hrs all we could see was about 15-20 Ambulances lined up
            in front of us, some with their blue lights flashing, some not.                                   It was____
            impossible to pick out a control vehicle. ________________________ _______
            There was no officer to tell of our arrival or to give instructions,
            I tried twice to contact South Yorkshire Control on ERC1 but reception was
            poor and there was too much air traffic.                            I decided that control had
            enough to worry about besides us and gave up.

             Major Incident.            Hillsborough, Sheffield
Tayt continued
        On enquiring from a South Yorkshire crew as to what was happening they said they
          had been told to sit tight.                 We decided this was our best course of action.
          The roads around were a mass with football fans leaving the Ground.                             This also
          made it impossible to leave the vehicle and look for a senior Ambulance Officer.
          At approximately 1700hrs vehicles began to move up towards the Herries Road end
          of the Ground.
          We then saw our first Ambulance Officer, with walkie-talkie in hand.
          He told us we were going to move the fatally injured.
          Then another Ambulance Officer , with walkie-talkie in hand said there was a change
          of plan. We were than told to proceed to the Herries Road bus depot where further
          instructions would be given.____________________________________ ________________
          We stayed at the Herries Road bus depot until an Ambulance Officer, with walkie-
          talkie called all South Yorkshire crews to await further instructions.                             All
          Notts and Derbyshire crews should stand down and return to base.
          We left the bus depot at 1738hrs, arriving back at base at 1841hrs.

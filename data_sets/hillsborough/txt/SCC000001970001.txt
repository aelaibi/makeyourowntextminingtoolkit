  DATE          REFERENCE   SUMMARY


  January       1.113a      Report on ground capacity by Eastwoods which " . . . deals in broad
  1979                      terms with the necessary strengthening and supplementation of the
                            crush barriers on the terraces, and calculations are made of the
                            theoretical exit times . . . "  It deals in detail with all stands/
                            terraces and on page 4 the consideration of the west terracea is
                            started.  Comments are made about spectator circulation and packing.
                            There is also a reference on page 5 to the north west corner,
                            reinforced concrete terrace.   Page 9 of the document refers to the
                            proposed standing capacity at the Leppings Lane end (including the
                            north west corner) 10 ,100 .

  12.2.79       1.124       On page 4 of the notes of the Officers of the Working Party there is
                            reference to the west terrace and the north west corner reinforced
                            concrete terrace.  Comments are made about the lack of depth of the
                            terrace and the Club's offer to reduce spectator limit to 7,200.
                            There was felt to be no real problem with the north west corner
                            reinforced concrete terrace.

  30.3.79       1.238       On page 2 of the notes of the meeting reference is made to the crush
                            barriers on the west terrace, the cross-fall on the steps on the north
                            west corner exit and the height of the crush barriers.  It was agreed
                            that all those points must be drawn to the Club's attention.  As far as
                            the north west corner terrace was concerned, the Building Authority
                            indicated that it would require attention.

  2.4.79        1.139       At a meeting of the Officer Working Party the Club's proposals for the
                            installation of additional barriers and a reduction in capacity were
                            agreed.  Further comments were also made as to the height of the
                            existing crush barriers, corrosion, etc.  There was also mention of the
                            north west corner terrace at the same meeting.

  18.4.79       1.141       The Officer Working Party noted that the Club had accepted that in
                            view of the cross-fall on the north west corner exit the steps should
                            be rebuilt.  There were also comments on crush barriers.  There were
                            also comments about the north west corner terrace.

  1.5.79        1.148       Letter from the Building Surveyor indicating that on the west terrace
                            the downward slope of the exit steps is to be corrected and the
                            capacity to be agreed.  Also in the same document there is reference
                            to the north west terrace, and the replacement of the corrugated
                            sheeting at the rear of it and the removal of under strength barriers
                            and their replacement.

  16.5.79       1.149       Letter from the County Fire Service indicates that the exit routes
                            from the west and north west terraces are satisfactory.  There is also
                            note of the capcities of the west terrace and north west terrace.

  ° 6.79        1.152       This is a list of matters requiring attention at Sheffield
                            Wednesday and there is a note that the replacement of the
                            corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace is required

                               also be carried o u t . Under the reference to the west terrace the
                               downward slope of the exit steps needs to be corrected and the capacity
                               limited to 7,200.

  15.8.79         1.170        There is a note about corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace and
                               that nothing has been done about it.

  19.9.79         1.173        Letter from Eastwoods indicating the emergency lighting installation
                               at the Leppings Lane terraces.

  4.10.79         1.182        There is further mention in a letter from the Building Surveyor about
                               the replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north
                               west terrace.

  16.10.79        1.188        Letter from Eastwoods indicating that they believe the corrugated
                               sheeting is satisfactory and suggesting further discussions.

  31.10.79        1.194        Letter from the Building Surveyor indicating that the corrugated
                               sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace was agreed to be
                               adequate, perhaps with the additional of a horizontal timber member.

  2.11.79         1.195        Confirmation letter to Eastwoods about the corrugated sheeting.

  12.11.79        1.196        Meeting of the Officer Working Party indicating that the work on the
                               west terrace had been carried out and that the north west terrace
                               sheeting should have a horizontal timber member fixed to the front of
                               it.

  ...9.80         2.29         Report from Eastwoods indicating that some minor problems have been
                               discovered on the "north west corner".

  10.2.81         2.52a        An Officer Working Party visit to Hillsborough, in which it was noted
                               that the cracking of the concrete of the terracing at the north west
                               corner terrace had been the subject of quotations.   The Club also
                               outlined the consideration being given to the site of caravans outside
                               the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell
                               tickets.   It was hoped that if this took place increased entry flow
                               of spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the
                               turnstiles.

  7.4.81          2.59         Mention is made that the cracking of the concrete at the north west
                               terrace had been attended to.

                            on the west terrace.  There was general agreement about the proposed

                            working satisfactorily, but there may be problems with fans being able
                            to climb over the radial fences using the crush barriers which run
                            through them.

                            the radial fences appear to be working satisfactorily, but outlining
                            the Police view on the possibility of fans climbing over them.

                            problem at the radial barriers.  The overall view appears to be that
                            the existing arrangement should be retained.

                            terrace and the Police reiterated their view.  The Working Party
                            however agreed that it was preferable from a safety point of view not
                            to adjust the crush barriers.

                            repairs of them.

  27.8.82       2.148       Letter from Eastwoods indicating that as the repairs to the concrete
                            under the north west terrace will be quite expensive and possibly
                            difficult to effect, the Club did not propose to carry out works at
                            this stage, as there is apparently no risk to spectator safety.

  GANGWAYS




  DATE       REFERENCE   SUMMARY


Jan.   '79   1.113A      A report from Eastwoods to the County Council on the
                         application for a ground safety certificate on the spion
                         kop, it is said that there is a very adequate number of
                         gangways with spacings well below the maximum laid down in
                         the guide.  The report also mentions that the west terrace
                         has no gangways.  Gangways are also refered to in the north
                         st a n d .

12.2.79      1.124       The Officer Working Party noted that in the green guide
                         gangways should not be less than 1.1 metres wide and
                         wondered what the reasoning was behind this.  Comments are
                         also made about the lack of gangways on the west terrace
                         but it was agreed that it was unreasonable to insist on
                         gangways or additional exits in view of the reduced
                         capacity on the terrace.  The Working Party noted that in
                         the north stand gangways were only 640 mm wide as compared
                         with the recommended 1.1 metres.

2.4.79       1.139       Officer Working Party noted again that additional gangways
                         would not be required.  It was noted in the south stand an
                         additional gangway to exit onto the derelict land adjoining
                         the spion kop should be considered.

1.5.79       1.148       A letter from the building surveyor to the County Council
                         which first               openings to give access from the
                         radial gangways to the ground perimeter area.  It also
                         notes that it would be necessary to consider the provision
                         of handrails, etc., after the re-routing of gangways, etc.

16.5.79      1.149       Letter from the Fire Service to the County Council
                         enclosing a proposed schedule of work - it is noted that
                         fallgate at least 1.1 metres wide from the radial gangways
                         to the perimeter track should be provided and that
                         additional exit should be provided from the top or side of
                         the kop at least 3 metres in width which does not impede
                         the egress from any other gangway.

23.5.79      1.150       A letter from the South Yorkshire Police indicating that
                         the gateways in the existing perimeter fencing should be
                         re-aligned with the gangways of the kop.

8.6.79       1.152       The formal list of matters requiring attention at Sheffield
                         Wednesday from the County Council notes that four gate of
                         at least 1.1 metres wide from the radial gangway to the
                         perimeter track should be provided and that an additional
                         exit to top or side of the kop of at least 3 metres width
                         which does not impede egress from any other gangway should
                         also be provided.

                      relevant to the Council's licensing functions, which is both varied

                      and complex.



      5.      The Licensing Section deals with 33 licensing systems, for example,

              those involving taxis and private hire vehicles, operators and drivers,

              cinemas,    theatres and places of public entertainment.


             Legislation


      6.     On 1st August,    1975 Royal Assent was given to the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Act 1975 which established a "Certification" system for sports grounds

             capable of holding more than 10,000 spectators.      When a sports ground had

             been designated by the Secretary of State and application would need to be

             made to the Certificating Authority for a General Safety Certificate under

             the 1975 Act.



     7.      At the time the Safety Certificate was granted in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday Football Club the South Yorkshire County Council was obliged to

             attach to a Safety Certificate such terms and conditions as they

             considered necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety at the

             stadium when it is in use for specified activities.     These requirements

             were later amended by the 1987 Act.     The terms and conditions had to

             include:-


             (a)     The maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium and;

             (b)     Terms and conditions as to the number, size and situation of

                     entrances to and exits from the stadium and the means of access to


HB4AAA/JJJ
           any such entrances or exits and requiring those entrances, exits and

           means of access to be properly maintained and kept free from

           obstruction and as to the number, strength and situation of any

          crush barriers.



. Certificate conditions must also be framed with reference to a plan

     attached to the Certificate.



_    Section 10 of 1975 Act provided for an emergency procedure which could be

     used by the Council if it thought that a serious risk to spectators at a

     sports ground was present.     The procedure involved applying to a

     Magistrates'   Court for an Order prohibiting or restricting the admission

     of spectators to the sports ground.



. Under Section 11 of the 1975 Act the person authorised by the Local

    Authority or the Chief Officer of Police, or the Building Authority, or

    the Secretary of State, could on production of his authority enter a

    sports ground to make inspections and examine records and make enquiries

    as he thought fit.     On Local Government Reorganisation on 1st April,     1986

    (when the South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its functions

    passed in the main to District Councils) the reference to the Building

    Authority was changed to the Fire Authority.



    In 1976 the Home Office issued the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

    (Football)   which is a guide to measures for improving spectator safety at

             Grounds,    i.e., at rugby union and rugby league grounds as well as

    at soccer grounds.    It is a voluntary code.   The Green Guide makes

comments on such matters as the spacing of crush barriers, estimation of

safe ground capacity,       terraces, etc.   The Guide makes the point that

deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily

detracting from the overall safety of the ground.         A flexible approach

should be maintained to take account of the particular circumstances at

individual grounds.

                    A revised edition of the Green Guide was issued in 1986 following the

                    Bradford Disaster and the Popplewell Inquiry.        The scope of the Green

                    Guide having been extended to cover measures for improving spectator

                    safety at sports grounds generally.      The earlier (1976) edition referred

                    to football grounds although much of the guidance contained in the revised

                    Green Guide has particular application to football stadia.



          \ 'l .    The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended the 1975

                    legislation in a number of areas.      In particular,   the old Section 10 of

                    the 1975 Act was replaced by a more wide ranging provision which gave

                    local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition Notice in respect of

                    either whole stadia or parts of them.     A Prohibition Notice can only be

                    issued where the Local Authority is of the opinion that a serious risk to

                   spectators is present in the stadium.      A Prohibition Notice may include

                   directions as to the steps which will have to be taken to reduce the risk

                   to a reasonable level and these      may require alterations or additions to

                   the ground or things to be done      or omitted,   which would contravene the

                   terms or conditions of a Safety Certificate for the ground or for any

                   stand at the ground.   A prohibition or restriction contained in a Notice

                   may take effect immediately if there appears to be reason for it, or after

                   a specified period contained in the Notice.        An appeal may be lodged with

                   the Magistrates' Court against a Prohibition Notice but that appeal does

                   not stop its operation.     The Court may either cancel or affirm the Notice.


  llX -            In the new Section 10B of the Act it is the duty of each Certificating

                   Authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations made under

                   it and also to carry out an inspection of each designated sports ground

                   at least once every 12 months and to act in accordance with guidance given

                   to them by the Secretary of State.



                   The 1987 Act also made provision     for Safety Certificates for various

                   stands at sports grounds.    Also,   in order to give effect to various

                On 1st May,     1978 (1.148) the Sheffield City Council's Building Surveyor

                wrote to the County Council indicating that as far as the west terrace was

                concerned,     the downward slope of the exit steps needed to be corrected and

                that the limitation in capacity should remain.     It was noted that, on the

               north west terrace,     the replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear

               was required, as was the removal of understrength barriers and a

 The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) carried out regular

 inspections of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in accordance with the

South Yorkshire County Council policy of twice yearly visits to football

attache^X^lus        si a re T O t i T T - f ^ ^ ) .   At the Working Party inspection on

11th August,   there were two representatives from the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club,     two from the South Yorkshire Police, one from the South

Yorkshire County Fire Service, two from the Sheffield City Council

(Building Authority) and one from the South Yorkshire County Council

Administration Department.             For illustrative purposes,        I would refer to

the last two paragraphs on the first page of the notes of the Working

Party visit.     In the first of the two paragraphs it is clear that a

problem in relation to the brickwork at the rear corner of the stand

nearest the north west terrace had been raised at the previous meeting of

the Working Party and this was further explored at the meeting on 11th
August.    In the second paragraph, Dr. Eastwood (the Club's Consulting

Engineer) gave details of testing of the crush barriers on the terrace and

indicating that appropriate remedial action had been taken, where

necessary and that the first five year cycle of the barrier testing had

thus been completed.


The County Council                                            problems in

connection with the use of the stadium.     An example as to how these

matters were dealt with can be seen by reference to a letter from the

South Yorkshire County Fire Service to the Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club regarding a test which the Fire Service did of the emergency

procedures at a match on 4th October,   1983.   (3.33).   There was particular

concern that stewards could not hear the emergency procedure announcement

on the public, address system, which resulted in stewards failing to carry

out their emergency procedure duties.     Consultations then took place

between the Club and the Fire Officer with reference to the County Council

which resulted in the satisfactory resultion of the public address system

problem.   The system itself was checked and found satisfactory by the

County Fire Service 29th October,   1983, the test proved satisfactory.

(3.34 and 3.37).



Sheffield City Council as Certificating Authority (with effect from
1st April, 1986Q

At the meeting of the General Purposes Panel (which is a Sub-Committee of

the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee of the

City Council) a report was considered from the Head of Administration and

Legal Department on Safety of Sports Grounds.    The Panel adopted the

recommendations contained in the report which were:-



(a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports

      Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel.



(b)   The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be

                    delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in

                    consultation with the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of this Panel or of

                    the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as

                   appropriate.


             (c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

                   delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.     The

                   Panel's decision was subsequently confirmed by a full meeting of the

                   City Council which took place on



   23.       The General Purposes Panel considered a more detailed report on the Act

         and the administrative system used by the County Council at the Panel's

         meeting on 6th May, 1986.          The full report is attached to this statement.

         The following extracts of the report are worthy of note:-”?


         Existing Administrative Arrangements

                   The County Council system for administering the k/t is based on two

                   main components - (a) bi-annual inspections o£/the stadium and (b)
                                                                 /
                   meetings of an Officer Working Party.    The/t>i-annual inspections

                   consist of representatives from all the interested authorities and

                   involve thorough inspections of the Stadia and the identifying of any

                   defects.   The defects are at the time of visit brought to the

                   attention of the Certificate holder and its technical representative,
                                                /
                   if one is present.   Depending on the nature of the faults found (if

                   any), steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate
                                        /
                   holder to rectify fefiem or so arrange matters that no risk to the
                                   ,/
                   public occurs./ The Working Party consists of representatives from

                   the Policey^ire Service, Building Surveyors and the County Council -

                   it considers in detail various matters (such as the spion kop

                   development at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground) and also any

                   outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.    The Working Party

                   is effectively a co-ordinating body, which attempts to ensure that a

HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                    -11-



                   balanced and consistent approach^s^maintained to current issues at

                   the sports grounds.   Any rep-dmmendations it makes are subject to

                   approval by this Panel^


              The Health and Safety Executive

                   Recommendation 9 of the Popplewell Committee's Interim Report reads

                   as follows:-


                   "There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety

                   Executive and the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how

                   best to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports".


                  Bearing this in mind, the local office of the Health and Safety

                  Executive was invited to participate in the administrative system for

                  Safety of Sports Grounds.     This invitation was declined.    The

                  Executive would apparently take no direct part in the certification

                  system.   In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and

                  the position explained; it appears that negotiations are under way

                  between the Home Office and the H.S.E. about Popplewell's

                  recommendation, but as yet there has been no useful outcome.         In

                  these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety

                  Executive informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite

                  their comments on them.    It would then be the responsibility of the

                  Executive to decide whether or not to respond.


             Review of the Administrative System

   24    At its meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel

             considered a report on the future administration of the Council's

         Certificating function.


   25.          The report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority, will

         act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service), the

         question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.           In this

HB4AAA/JJJ
                                            -12-



       respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

       Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

       the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the

       Department of Health and Consumer Services.    Both the Building Surveyor's

       Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

       existing Council structure.   It was envisaged that the Working Group would

       function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most regular

       use would probably be the discussions of advice to the Council before they

       were finally formulated by the appropriate Authority.


        It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

        request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

        Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

        list of items to be discussed.   At the conclusion of the meeting a further

        list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

        taken by each Authority would be noted.    It was then envisaged that

        detailed written advise would be provided by each discipline and acted

        upon as appropriate.


        The report went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

        Authority which follow.


        Authority                          Area of Responsibility

        The Building Surveyor,             All matters relating to the structure
        (Sheffield City Council)           of stadia, including crush barriers,

                                           capacity.

        South Yorkshire Police             Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                           access of emergency vehicles and
                                           emergency planning.


        It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

        would have an input into the Advisory Group on:- aspects of general

         safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items



HB4AA//JJj

             such as first aid requirements.     These lists were of course not

             exhausted and several of the functions overlapped.


             The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

             that one large scale inspection per stadium per annum should be carried

             out per year.     It was noted that the proposal was in line with with the

             Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other areas.


             The Panel approved the revised administrative system and delegated all

             routine matters in connection with that system to the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department.

             Role of the Administration and Legal Department
             in the Certification System

     26.     The basic role of the Department is to co-ordinate the administration of

             the Certification System and also to keep the records of it.


             An example of an Agenda and notes of the meeting are attached, dated 28th

             April, 1988, which shows the sort of items discussed at the Working Group
                                                                                             -O'

             Inspections of Sports Grounds

     28.     Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

             and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

             authorities.     Inspections take place annually.


     29.     Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

             Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and Consumer

             Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.       Often, the Club is

             represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

             another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

             The inspection is carried out by the various Officers who meet at the

             ground and then disperse to various areas in which their particular

             interest lies.



HB4AAA/JJJ
                                              -14-



        Communication is maintained by the Officers throughout the inspection and

        it is common for the Officers to draw points to each other's attention

        when they think fit.   Officers of the Club are usually present and are

        sometimes referred to by Officers by information.


 30.    If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

        Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

        taken to secure its rectification.    If rectification is not possible prior

        to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

        to issue a Prohibition Notice.


  31.   Officers at the conclusion of the inspection write to the Head of

        Administration and Legal Department setting out their comments on matters

        which ought to be raised with the Club, the stadium owners.     These are

        then collated and discussed with the Officers (-ercwHSfcAS^s at a

        Group) and finally formulated into a list which is sent to the Club for

        action.
                        /fj                     1**..
        The actual inspections of stadia take account for approximately

        hours of Officer time per inspection.    This time figure does not include

        the subsequent administrative work or the consideration of proposals

        submitted by stadium owners.     This figure is also to be contrasted with

        the assertion in Home Office Circular 72/1987 that inspections are not

        expected to take more than about two man days per ground on average.


        The role of the Home Office

  32.   The Home Office is the Central Government Department which is responsible

        for safety of sports grounds.     Its functions can be described in brief as

        follows:


        (a)   To advise Parliament on legislation;

        (b)   To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
              and to offer guidance;

        (c)   To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                  -15-


                   inspections); and

             (d)   To issue the "Green Guide" which is an advisory document to assist
                   the improvement of safety standards at sports grounds.


             The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
             and the Popplewell Report

    33.      The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,

             1985 outlining the certification system in operation throughout the

             County.   The press release went on to say that the forthcoming "Summer"

             inspections will take into account the lessons of the recent tragic event

             at Bradford and any revised advise and requirements which may be issued by

             the Home Office. (3.89).   On 13th May, 1985 the South Yorkshire County

             Council sent a letter to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday enclosing a

             copy of the press release and stressing that it is vitally necessary for

             safety stewards to be fully aware of and trained in their duties on the

             manning and opening of doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of

             fire fighting equipment. (3.90).


    34.      The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on

             9th August, 1985 which indicated that the Interim Report of the Popplewell

             Inquiry had been produced and advice had been received from the Home

             Office.   The letter drew attention to a review on the evacuation

             procedures in consultation with the Police and the Fire Service and also

             to the duties of safety stewards.   It was also indicated that the Police

             and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in training stewards.

             Detailed comments were also made about the first aid facilities at the

             stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.    There

             was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

             materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

             displayed. (3.112).   The Club responded to the County Council's letter of

             14th August and comments were made about steward training procedures which

             were to be reviewed before the next home match. (3.116).

        35-     The Sheffield City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday on 15th October,

                 1987 referring to the revised Green Guide which had been published by H.

                 M. Government following the Popplewell Report drawing attention to the new

                 Guide and particularly to Chapter 2, which is entitled "Management

                 Responsibility".     The letter asks Sheffield Wednesday to confirm in

                writing that the Club intends to retain a copy of the revised Green Guide

                on the premises and that they should take immediate steps to appoint a

                safety officer as defined in Chapter 2.            (4.47).   The Club responded to

                that letter on 23rd October, 1987 confirming that a copy of the Guide was

             V ' held at the stadium and that Mr. Mackrell was now the Safety Officer.               *

      [j/ $ [qIn the early part of 1976 discussions took place between the South

                Yorkshire County Council and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about

                the possibility of certification in view of the commencement of the Safety

                of Sports Grounds Act on 1st September, 1975.           On 30th March, 1977 the

                South Yorkshire Police became involved in the discussions and wrote to the

                Home Office indicating that they felt certification should be considered

                when the matter was next reviewed, owing to the large scale events that

                were held at Hillsborough.

  I
                At a football match held on Saturday, 23rd April, 1977 there was some

                trouble at Hillsborough involving some injuries and a number of arrests.

                This prompted further discussions about certification and the involvement

                of the Fire Service Committee of the County Council as well as the Police.

                At the meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council on 27th April, 1977

                questions relating to the problems at the football match were raised and a

                specific complaint was later made by a member of the public in connection

               with an incident that allegedly took place at the Leppings Lane end of the

               ground.

                 of Sheffield Wednesday was not overwhelming and that the Home Office was

                 not minded for the time being - but they would reconsider the matter

                 later.


           'IX. The County Council continued to press the case for designation with the

                 Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

                 played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had

                 been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards

                 of safety within the ground.         The Home Office once again declined to

                designate this stadium.


                The S^uth Yorkshire County Council Fire S ^ i c e Committee at its meeting

                on     j           /'^eciXed to     set up an ^dminist\ative system for safety of

                sport|s ground/ which involved the        setting up of\officer Worki^Parties to

                discuss safety of sportk grounds matters in resp^t of particular stadia.

                There were/ four such Working Parties, one covering Sheffield, one

                RotheWiatm, one Barnsley ant           Doncaster.


          ^     In April, 1978 the County Council prepared and submitted a lengthy paper

                to the Home Office on the case for designating the Hillsborough Stadium

                under the 1975 Act.


         *lM.        August of 1978, the Home      Office wrote to the County Council

                      ........... .   .           .•X.__,^'r -indicating that they would recommend to

     ^          the Home Secretary that an order be made ....                    Hillsborough in

                due course.     The County Council then began the Safety Certificate drafting

                exercise.     The exercise was carried on in consultation with the Police,

                the Fire Service and the Club.

                                                icate on 8th September, 1978/.   The

        stadium
         tadium itself was designated on 1st January, 1979.

         hee Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

‘\ ^       --rr-----   --       " uri,iJ.l.tltiU11, a report was submitted to the County

        Council by Messrs. Eastwoods & Partners, Consulting Engineers, in January,

        1979 which dealt with questions of ground capacity at the stadium.       The

        report 11. . . deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening and

        supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and calculations

        are made of theoretical exit times . . . "    All the stands and terraces

       were dealt with in the report.     Page 4 of the report indicates that the

       west terrace (which is at the Leppings Lane end) has a total area of some

        1,480 square metres, but there are no gangways.      It is suggested that the

       full area would justify about 8,000 spectators, but after making allowance

       for gangways a capacity of 7,200 would perhaps be more reasonable.        The

       report says that the barriers should be designed to match this figure and

       that those barriers which could not withstand test load should be

       appropriately strengthened and extra ones provided where necessary.

       Proposed extra barriers were shown on drawing 1610/2X.       The three exits

       from the west terrace have a total width of about 11.5 metres which would

       permit some 1,250 per minute to leave the terrace.      The terrace could,

       therefore, be emptied in about 6 minutes.      The report goes on that the

       Guide suggests that everyone on the terrace should be within 12 metres of

       a gangway or exit; the report notes that there are no gangways and some

       spectators would be 25 metres from an exit.      The report goes on to say

       that this is felt of no consequence as movement horizontally along the

       terrace will be easy and quick.


       The north west corner reinforced    concrete terrace is also referred to in

       the report which is noted as covering an area of approximately 565 square

       metres.   The recommended number of spectators was 2,900, bringing the

       total standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.      It was also noted that
                                                    -19-


             the exits serving the north west terrace were adequate and emptying should

             take place within 8 minutes.     The significance of the 8 minute time

             relates to the recommended maximum time for a departure of spectators from

             a terraced area of a football stadium.     This recommendation is contained

             in the original "Green Guide" at Paragraph 8.     On the last page of the

             report, a recommended future ground capacity of some 50,100 spectators

             (consisting of approximately 24,000 seated spectators, 16,000 standing on

             the spion kop and 10,100 at the Leppings Lane end). (1.113A)


             Following the submission of Eastwoods' report to the County Council there

             was a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) on 12th

             February, 1979 at which the west terrace and north west corner reinforced

             concrete terrace were discussed.     As far as the west terrace was concerned

             it was agreed that ". . . i n view of the lack of depth of this terrace,

             the Club's offer to reduce the spectator limit to 7,200 and the discharge

             of 6.6 minutes, the Working Party agree that it will be unreasonable to

             insist that gangways or additional exits must be provided."     The Working

             Party also noted that special attention would be required to the crush

             barriers in addition to the ordinary testing in view of the apparent sharp

             edges, corrosion, etc.     The Working Party agreed that there were no real
 I
             problems with the north west terrace but reference is made to the

             corrugated sheeting would be required to pass the appropriate tests, along

             with the crush barriers.


             On 30th March, 1979, the Officer Working Party considered further the

             question of the west terrace and the north west terrace.    As to the west

             terrace it was noted that the terracing in small areas near to the stand

             was in poor condition and that the cross-fall on the steps on the north

             west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw people

             forward.   The height of the crush barriers was also mentioned as being

             below the Guide recommendations.     The Working Party agreed that these

             points should be drawn to the attention of the Club.    As far as the north

                                                    -20-


              west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now took the view that

              the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in order to meet the

              requirements of the Green Guide.


              On 2nd April, 1979 the Officer Working Party visited Sheffield Wednesday

              and a joint meeting was held with the Club representatives.    The Working

              Party agreed that the Club's proposals (including a capacity limit of

              7,200   spectators) was acceptable, without the need for additional

              gangways.   It was also agreed that the question of the cross-fall on the

              steps on the north west corner exit, the height of some of the existing

              crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp edges in places,

              should be the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the

              Building Surveyor.   The Clulb's proposals in respect to the north west

              terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900 and the

             improvement and addition of some new barriers.    It was also agreed that

             the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting should

             be subject to discussion between the Building Surveyor and Dr. Eastwood.

             (1 .139).


             On 18th April, 1979, a joint meeting of the Officer Working Party was held

             at Sheffield Wednesday.     The meeting was held to further discuss the

             proposals in relation to Sheffield Wednesday at the Hillsborough Stadium.

             The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club accepted that the

             cross-fall steps should be rebuilt and that the other matters previously

             raised will be reconsidered after it was seen which of the crush barriers

             failed on testing.    It was accepted the need for improvement or

             replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace,

             the Club wished to consider whether more extensive works could be

             initiated so as to bring in an existing unused area for the accommodation

             of further spectators.

                  On 15th August, 1979 (1.170) the Officer Working Party met again to

                  consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review the

                  progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th

                 July.   It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

                 corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


                 On 19th September, 1979 (1.173) Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County

                 Council about the emergency lighting installation in the stadium.

                 Eastwoods are proposing in the letter that new emergency circuits and

                 fittings be installed in areas of the stadium including the north west

                 terrace, the south west terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.


                 Between 31st October, 1979 and 12th November of the same year, there was

                 correspondence between Eastwoods and the County Council about the

      ( £   I    corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.    It was finally

                 agreed that a horizontal timber member should be fixed to the front of the

                 corrugated sheeting to improve its safety to an acceptable level.    (1.188,

                  •194, 1.195 and 1.196).


            [ On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of

                the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates that in the north west corner

                of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

                pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should

      >         be sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.    (2.29)

     \f
 ^          \ On 10th February, 1981 the Officer Working Party met (2.52A) to inspect

                the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.   It was noted that the Club had received

                quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete at the north west

                terrace, which will be considered shortly.    The Working Party also heard

                the Club outline the consideration it was giving to the siting of caravans

                outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell




HB4AAC/JJJ
  tickets.   It was hoped that if this took place, increased entry flow of

  spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the

  turnstiles.


 On 7th April, 1981 the Officer Working Party (2.59) inspected the

 Sheffield Wednesday Stadium, bearing in mind that an F.A. Cup Semi-Final

 was to take place on 11th April, 1981. ^The Working Party noted that the

 cracking of the concreting at the north west terrace had been attended to

 by injecting material from the top.   The results had been satisfactory,

 except in two small areas where water seepage had taken place and which

 would receive further attention


 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club wrote to the County Council on 15th

 April, 1981 (2.61) outlining an incident which took place at the Leppings

 Lane end of the ground at the Semi-Final Match on 11th April, that year.

 It is noted that there was injuries to spectators because of crushing.

 The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it appears that the

 crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late due to

 travelling problems and rushing to their places after the game had

commenced, thereby causing problems to spectators at the front of the

terracing who had been in the ground for a considerable length of time.

The turnstile readings were apparently 335 persons in excess of the

capacity for Leppings Lane end which was the result of Tottenham fans

having purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival at turnstile

'N' (in Penistone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were

directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

were standing.   Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. John's

Ambulance for minor ailments and at the Royal Hallamshire and Northern

General Hospitals 8 spectators were treated.   According to the Police,

three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

unspecified injuries.   The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

both inside and outside the stadium was very good.
 On 22nd April, 1981 the Chief Executive of the County Council wrote to the

 Police asking for a copy of their report on            ... 5.4’J /. . /hW.fa.

                                      (2.62)


 Mr. Brownlow, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, wrote to the

 Secretary of the Football Association on 3rd June, 1981 commenting in

 detail on the incident at the match on 11th April.        The Chief Constable

 starts by noting the basic facts relating to the stadium and indicating

 that there had been many similar Semi-Final matches at Hillsborough

 without previous incident.    The Police apparently envisaged difficulties

 prior to the match because both sets of supporters would need to use the

 Ml motorway.   There were a number of problems which slowed down the

 arrival of spectatorsm, namely a major road accident, a coach breaking

 down and extensive road works.    These resulted in Tottenham Hotspur fans

being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.        This all resulted in

". . . a sudden influx of large numbers of football spectators to the area

of the ground at around the time for the start of the match . .


Mr. Brownlow went on to indicate that Tottenham Hotspur supporters managed
       .    T1A4l &rx
to obtain ............. from Coventy City Football Club. He noted that

this completely defeated the spectator policy of putting opposing

spectators at opposite ends of the football ground.        Apparently, neither

participating football club told the Police or Sheffield Wednesday, or the

Football Association about this situation and the mixingof supporters was

not properly catered for.     Some 400 Tottenham fans had to      be removed from

the kop and accommodated in the    Leppings Lane end.     This resulted in an

over capacity situation at that    end of the ground.


According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early

took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

the Leppings Lane enclosure " . . .   thereby creating a jamming effect and

the extremeties of it . . ."    The later arrivals then caused a problem
                                                   -25-


               because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

               Hotspur had scored an early goal.   The resulting injuries included broken

               arms, legs and crushed ribs.   It is noted that some 38 people received

               treatment.   The pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane

              enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

              perimeter track to relieve pressure.        Police Officers also refused access

              to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

              the crushing problem.   In Mr. Brownlow's view, no other course of action

              could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


              Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

              had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

              similar events.


              The next entry on the file relates to a visit of the Officer Working Party

              to Hillsborough on 8th June, 1981 (2.69) at which some water seepage was

   /          again noted at the north west terrace.       There was also a note that the tie

              bars through the upper level concrete area to the rear had been

             protectively wrapped.

         £
              essrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 2nd September,

             1981 (2.80) indicating that ». . . we have been instructed by the Club to

             organise the installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the

             Leppings Lane end of the ground . .           it was noted that the intention

             of these fences was to divide the terrace into approximately three equal

             areas, each served by its own entrance.       The object of dividing the

             terrace was to exercise more control over supporters and for example, a

             visiting team with only a few followers would be allocated one section

             with the other two sections retained for home suppoers.       A 1.15 metre wide

             gate was proposed at the rear of each fence, to give access for

             maintenance and also policing during the game.       The gates could be left

             open, but fastened back to connect the areas during the game if

                  appropriate. In order to preserve spectators' views Eastwoods recommended

                  that the top of the fence should be approximately 1680 mm above the

                  terrace.   It was noted that a fence of this height would not prevent

                  individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should eliminate a

                  mass "invasion" from one area to another.      Apparently, fences of this

                  height worked successfully at St. James' Park (the Newcastle United

                  ground).   The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2 and 3.

                  On 9th September, 1981 (2.85) Eastwoods wrote to'the County Council

                  indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in early October,

                  subject to their being no objections from the Council.     Eastwoods

                  indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be received by

                  23rd ...........   or 25th September.


                 The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September (2.87)

                 considered the question of the proposed new radial barriers on the west

                 terrace.    It was noted that there were drawbacks to the division of the

                 terrace into three equal areas, but the Working Party felt that increased

                 control on the terrace should result.     A "for instance" was quoted in that

                 there could well be problems with opposing fans mixing at the rear of the

                 west stand and/or the final exit gates, but the Police considered that
   I
                 they could cope with these problems.


                 The adequacy and positioning of the gates was discussed as well as the use

                 of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.     It was noted that the

                 plans did not indicate the headroom which would be available at the rear

             of the terrace should the radial barriers and gates be installed.           The

             Working Party agreed that there was no objection to the proposals subject

             to further calculations as required by the Building Authority being

             satisfactory, confirmation of the headroom at the rear of the terrace and

             those gates being under Police control.        The County Council wrote to

             Eastwoods confirming the Working Party views on 14th September (2.83).            In


iB4AAC/JJJ

               a letter of 14th December, Eastwoods indicated that the works were now

               substantially complete (2.100).


              The South Yorkshire Police wrote to the County Council on 18th January,

              1982 about, amongst other things, the new radial fencing at Leppings Lane.

              It is confirmed in the letter that the fences are working well, but since

              there have been no large games which resulted in the whole of the

              terracing being occupied by one group of fans.         The Chief Constable goes

              on to say that as crush barriers penetrate or come close to the new radial

              fencing, fans could climb over them.         Also, it was noted that there were

              some " . . .   dangerous peices . . . " protruding from the cut off ends of

              some barrier rails.      (2.107)   The County Council wrote to Eastwood and

              Partners indicating that the radial fences appear to be working

              satisfactory and also outlining the Police views on them.         (2.108).

              Messrs. Eastwood and Partners wrote back to the County Council on 26th

              January, 1982 (2.110) acceping the possibility that fans could climb over

              the radial fence, but it would be unacceptable to leave a gap along side

             each radial fence completely free of crush barriers as that would present

             a major hazard.     The Police comment on the dangerous peices of rails is

             noted.


             At an Officer Working Party meeting on 4th February, 1982 (2.117) the

             Police views on the barriers was again discussed.         It was however, agreed

             that the existing arrangement was necessary and the problem of fans

             climbing over from one pen to another would have to be lived with.            It was

             agreed to review the issue at the end of the current season.


             The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 24th August, 1982 (2.147) and

             a letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners of 27th August, 1982 (2.148)

             deal with some minor problems which did not apparently involve visitor

             spectators in the concrete at the north west terrace.        Similar problems

             were alluded to on 21st February, 1983 at a Working Party meeting. (3.11)

                     On 8th September, 1982 the annual inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium

                     was carried out by the Officer Working Party (2.150) and it was noted that

                     the two radial fences had been installed on the Leppings Lane terrace.

                     The crush barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace had been tested by the

                     Officer Working Party m e e t i n g on 11th August, 1983 (3.25) which testing

                     had completed the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the stadium.

                     There was also mention of water seepage again at the north west terrace.

                     The former A.R.P.   building adjacent to the boundary wall near to Gate 'C'

    fa           °f th8 LeppinSs Lane entrances to the stadium was          in the process of being

    ^            demolished when the Officer Working Party visited          the stadium on 29th

   / \/          February> 1984 (3.41).       Once again, water seepage was noted on that day at
   1 /0       'I L

                     Partners) (3.52) and (3.54).


                     It was noted that there was some cracked brickwork at the rear of the west

                     stand and that there were damaged angled support brackets to the pitch

                     security fence at the front of Leppings Lane terrace, at an Officer

                 Working Party inspection of the stadium on 9th August, 1984 (3.59). it was

                 also noted that the wire mesh barriers on the north west terrace had been

                 successfully test loaded.


                 There was some discussion at an Officer Working Party meeting on 23rd

                 January, 1985 (3.77) about the segregation of home and visiting supporters

                 at the rear of the west stand at certain matches " . . .        (such as with

                 Liverpool) . . ."by erecting temporary        barriers.    It was noted that it

                 was policy of the Police to aim for the exclusive use by visiting

                 supporters of the west stand and terrace.         The Working Party agreed that

                 the Club should consider a scheme for permanent barriers at the rear of

                 the stand subject to the necessary approvals.         It was also noted that the

                cracked brickwork previously mentioned should continue to be monitored and



HB4AAC/JJJ

              that the apparent rusting of steel columns at the rear of the stand should

              receive appropriate treatment.


              Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 9th April, 1985

              (3.79) indicating that the Club was anxious to segregate visiting teams'

              supporters as they entered the ground and also to enable the Police to

              control their exit at the end of the game.    A scheme was prepared and

              shown on drawing 6705/2 which involved the construction the two new banks

              of turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates.        The Officer
                                                                 ft
              Working Party considered these plans on 18th April^j (3 .83).    They were

              agreed, subject to a number of conditions.    These conditions related to

              additional gates being provided between turnstile 16 and the wall of the

              inner access road; the central area of the terrace being divided in half

             by a new central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the

             pitch perimeter fence, with gates erected so as to permit entry to either

             half as appropriate.    It was noted that the proposed new secondary radial

             fence adjacent to the existing fence be abandoned.     The right hand area of

             the terrace should also be divided in half by a new central radial fence

             j#ith two gates in it and the existing radial fence dividing the present

             two terrace areas to have a second gate installed.     The last condition

             related to the existing pitch perimeter fence having additional exit gates

             installed, one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters' area.

             The Fire Service did not object in principle to the proposals, subject to

             more detailed investigations as to the means of escape aspects of it.          The

             Building Authority also saw no objection, subject to the submission of

             satisfactory plans and calculations.    On 30th April, 1985 (3.84) the Fire

             Service wrote to the County Council indicating that from a means of escape

             point of view, the scheme is satisfactory, providing the gates have

             minimum width5»as indicated on the plan enclosed with the letter.       The Fire

             Service also mentioned that it was understood that these gates will be

             supervised either by the Police or Club officials.    The County Council on

              2nd May transmitted its views to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners by letter.

              (3.85).   Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 8th May

              (3.87) and indicated that several of the points made had already been

              incorporated into the latest scheme.    Eastwoods say in the letter that

              fiirther consideration should be given to the idea of two gates being

              installed in two radial barriers.    The reason being that if the gates were

              meant for use in an emergency, it would mean having a steward in

              attendance on each occasion, the expense of which would hardly be

              justified.   Eastwoods go on to express the view that in the event of an

             emergency, spectators can be evacuated quickly through the gates onto the
        t
 / /H Z r    PitCh’ and Vla the normal exit Sates at the rear.     The County Council sent

             a letter to Eastwoods on 10th May, 1985 (3.88) indicating that the Police

        y y were prepared to fccceedj the request for two gates per radial fence,

             provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working

             Party were incorporated.


             Eastwood & Partners submitted a detailed proposal for the revised layout

             of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th July (3.102).     Fourteen

             plans were included in the submission and it was considered by a meeting

             of the Officer Working Party on 29th July (3.103).     The Working Party

             accepted the proposals in principle, but made a number of comments which

             were transmitted to the Consulting Engineers by a letter of 30th July

             (3.104).   The comments were   made by reference to the plans submitted

             (a)   Plan No. 6705/6 - "for both security access and emergency egress
                   purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

             (b)   Plan No. 6705/8A - "the new handrail by turnstile 23 to be either
                   shortened or realigned so as to maintain the exit width between the
                   outer (river) wall and turnstile 23, and the exit width between
                   turnstile 16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of
                   the roller shutter gate between turnstiles 16 and 17";

             (f)   Plan No. 6705/12 -        . no barrier height indicated . .

             (*)    Plan No. 6705/17 - "for both security access and emergency egress
                   purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

 (j)    Stewarding of new gates - "as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
        1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised    by
        stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained".


 Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 1st August (3.109)

 and indicated that it might be easier for discussions to take place when

 the works are under construction.     It is also noted in the letter that the

 stewarding would no doubt be taken care of by Mr. Chester (the Sheffield

Wednesday Club Secretary at that time).


The Officer Working Party visited Hillsborough on 7th August (3.111) and

noted the progress of works to segregate supporters at the Leppings Lane

end of the ground and on the terrace.      The Working Party agreed "(b) that

the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be extended

or have steps to provide easy of access from the new two metre wide gap

formed by the new radial fence; (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter

fence should be provided from the south central terrace pen".       There are

several other comments about general matters in the west terrace.


At a meeting at the Police Sports and Social Club at Niagra, Sheffield,

the Officer Working Party on 13th November (3.128) considered the Club's

proposals in relation to various projects at the stadium.      It was also

noted that the Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the

merging of spectators at the Leppings Lane.      The Working Party noted that

it     was difficult to see how this could be overcome as any physical

restraint could conceivably     be more of a danger than allowing the present

situation to continue.     When notified of these problems by the County

Council in a letter of 14th November (3.129) they found it very difficult

to envisage anything more which could be done at reasonable expense.



The Officer Working Party at its inspection of Sheffield Wednesday on 22nd

January, 1986 (3.141) next considered the segregation arrangements at the

Leppings Lane end.     The Police confirmed that the new arrangements worked

             well on by far the majority of occasions.          Other minor matters were

             referred to in relation to advertising hoardings, spoiling concrete and

             the north west terrace.      The only other references on the file in relation

             to Leppings Lane occurred in August, 1988 (4.74) when Eastwood and

             Partners wrote to Sheffield Wednesday detailing the crush barrier testing

             which had taken place in July, 1988 at the Leppings Lane terrace,

                        UNDER THE ACT AS CARRIED OUT IN RELATION TO THE FOOTBALL
                            MATCH AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY ON 15TH APRIL, 1989



               On 15th April, 1989 a football match took place at Sheffield Wednesday

               Football Club which was a specified activity in accordance with the Safety

               Certificate.    The definition of "specified activity" is contained in the

               interpretations section of the Safety Certificate (Schedule 1).


              At the time the current Safety Certificate was issued, the terms and

              conditions contained therein were those sought by the South Yorkshire

              County Council on the advice of the various interested parties to be

         /    necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of spectators at the

              sports ground.    There is no evidence from the files that the Certificate

              Holder or any other interested party has appealed to the Secretary of

              State (up to 1st January, 1988) or to a Magistrates' Court (thereafter) in

              respect of the Certificate Conditions.


              Section 2(2) of the 1975 Act says that any terms and conditions specified

              in an Order made by the Secretary of State must be incorporated into a

              Safety Certificate.    No such Order has been made.


              Section 2(1)(3) of the Act indicates that a Certificate may include

              conditions relating to:- records of attendance of spectators; records

              relating to the maintenance of safety and conditions relating to

              alterations or additions to the sports ground.    Particular reference can

              be made to General Safety Certificate Condition 28 which requires the

              Holder to keep the following records:- of the numbers of spectators

              admitted to the stadium; of accidents or incidents in the stadium which

              cause injury to spectators; of the training and instruction given and the

              exercises held in respect of stewards; and of all inspections, tests,

              maintenance, repairs and renewals carried out at the stadium.




•iB4AAD/jJJ
 Conditions 5(2) and 15(2) relate to alterations or additions to the sports

 ground.   It should be appreciated that many of the other conditions also

 refer to matters referred to in Section 2(1)(3).


 Section 2(4) of the Act indicates that the Safety Certificate must have

 attached to it a plan and the terms and conditions must be framed by

 reference to it, where appropriate.     Paragraph 5 of the General Safety

 Certificate refers to plans.     Under Schedule 1 of the Certificate, the

 definition of plans is "document or documents attached to and forming part

of the General Safety Certificate and signed by the person signing the

Certificate".     When the files were handed over to the Sheffield City

Council in April, 1986 a copy of the General Safety Certificate for

Hillsborough was in an envelope, together with a number of plans, none of

which were signed by Mr. Mallett (the original signatory of the

Certificate).     The original Safety Certificate and plans are lodged with

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited (the Holder).


The Certificating Authority is under a duty to determine whether or not

the applicant for a Safety Certificate is a "qualified persons" (i.e.,

that the applicant is in a position to prevent contravention of the terms

and conditions of a Certificate.     The Certificate was issued to Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club Limited on 21st December, 1979.


Under Section 3(3) of the Act applications for Certificates had to be

copied to the Police, the Fire Authority and the Building Authority.

Sheffield Wednesday applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September,

1978 (1.79).     Copies of the application were sent to the Building

Authority, the Police and the Fire Service on 13th September, 1978 (1.81,

1.82 and 1.83) relating to consultations with other parties was also

complied with.    There was no formal notice issued by the County Council

requiring the Holder to supply further information to enable it (the
                                                    -44-


         /    Council) to determine the terms and conditions of a Certificate.    The

             matter was dealt with in lengthy correspondence and by consultation.
               -

             The amendment and replacement of Certificates is governed by Section 4 of

              the Act and the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976, which were

             superseded on 1st January, 1988 by the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Regulations 1987.


             The Act provides that a local authority may, if it feels it appropriate to

             do so, amend a Safety Certificate by notice in writing to its holder or

             replace it.     A Safety Certificate may be amended or replaced either with

             or without the application of the Holder of the Certificate.     Section 2 of

             the Act applies to the amendment or replacement of a Safety Certificate.

             Section 4(4) of the Act indicates that a notice under Section 4(l)(a)

             amending a General Safety Certificate shall specify the date on which the

             amendment to which it relates is to come into operation, and the date so

             specified may be a date later than the date of issue of the notice.       The

             Regulations make further provision with regard to the amendment of the

             Certificates.    Regulation 7 provides that where a local authority issues

             or amends the said Certificate it shall forthwith give notice in writing

             of the issue or amendment . . .   to all specified interested parties and

             any unspecified interested parties known to the local authority.     In

             addition, the local authority in giving notices must inform the persons to

             whom notice is given that a copy of the Safety Certificate and the

             application for the grant, amendment or replacement . . . may be inspected

             and where and at what time such inspection may be made.    In addition, the

             local authority must publish in a newspaper as soon as maybe after the

             amendment of the Certificate with the information referred to in the last

             sentence.


             On 3rd September, 1981 the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

             resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

               Certificate by replacing Conditions 10 and 26 of the Safety Certificate.

               The amended Condition 10 contains slight wording differences to the

               original. pLt—        with the provision of— stPuarHc | etc. j$t

                      2a C o n d i t i o n   26 varied the time limits for the submission of

               electrical certificates to the Chief Fire Officer.          There is no evidence

               from the file that these revised conditions were in fact properly brought

               into effect.


              At a meeting on 21st August, 1986 (3.171) the City Council's General

              Purposes Panel resolved to amend the capacity of the J)pion ^op at

              Sheffield Wednesday to 21,000 spectators.         The Panel agreed to amend the

              Certificate on the basis of a number of conditions, one of which related

              to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until such certain works

              on crush barriers on the new spion kop were completed.          This condition

              related to two matches.        The amendment to the Certificate only affected

              the capacity at the spion kop end of the ground and had no effect

              whatsoever on any other parts of the ground.        Unfortunately, no notice was

              inserted in a newspaper in connection with this amendment; as previously

 P            rehearsed the notice would have set out the amendment and detailed where

              tbe Certificate could be inspected.

             Department about the operation of the Council's certification function for

             the safety of sports grounds.    One of the details mentioned in the report

             relates to inspections and the proposal that one large scale inspection

             per stadium should be carried out.     In fact the report itself does not

             make clear my intention that these inspections should be annual.     My

             intention at the time, and the Council's practice has been, to arrange

             annual inspections of stadia.    The report goes on to indicate that these

             inspections would be backed up by a series of "during event" inspections

The Safety Certificate

Under Conditon 1(1) of the Safety Certificate, the Holder's nominee must

be approved in writing by the Council.             The purpose of having a nominee is

so that he or she can be responsible for the Holder's obligation to take

all reasonable precautions and exercise all due diligence to avoid the

contravention of any term or condition of the Certificate (although the

appointment of a nominee does not absolve the Holder from liability).

October, 1987, (4.47) the City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday

pointing out various provisions of the new Green Guide and making

particular reference to the appointment of a Safety Officer as defined in

Chapter 2 of the Guide.     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic responded

to this letter on 23rd October, and confirmed that Mr. Mackrell's duties

encompassed those of the Safety Officer and requesting that the Council's

records be amended to note that he is responsible for all matters of

safety within the ground.


Under Condition 8(1) of the Certificate the Holder is required to provide

and maintain at the stadium, to the satisfaction of the Council, a

suitably equipped first aid room.        The first aid room was installed and

noted by the Officer Working Party to be in use on 21st February, 1983

(3.11).............. first aid facilities was raised and discussed during

1987 and 1988 (4.54 and 4.60).

 Condition 9 relates to safety stewards.    Further enquiries are currently

 being made into the question of stewarding with Sheffield Wednesday.


 Under Condition 11(1) the Holder of the Certificate must provide and

maintain to the satisfaction of the Chief Fire Officer exit signs.       The

Holder must also supply supplementary illuminated signs if required to do

 so by the Chief Fire Officer.   There is lengthy correspondence about signs

and it is detailed in Appendix ' '.


Under Condition 12(2) a report on the emergency power supply must be

supplied to the Chief Fire Officer every 12 months.     Checks are being made

with the Chief Fire Officer to ascertain whether or not this has happened.


Under Condition 12(3) the emergency power supply must be tested not less

than three hours prior to the commencement of a specified activity;

Sheffield Wednesday are being asked for details of tests.     The fire

warning system must be tested periodically to the satisfaction of the

Chief Fire Officer under Condition 13(2).     Enquiries are being made with

the Chief Fire Officer to ascertain whether or not this has happened.      A

Police Central Control Room is in place at the stadium (Condition 14(1))

and at the Officer Working Party meeting on 21st February, 1983 (3.11) it

was noted that the facility had been installed.


There is a requirement that the public address system be audible in all

parts of the stadium.    There has been much correspondence over the years

about the system and changes have been made to it (Condition 14(3)).


 mergency procedure notices must be installed in the stadium and

maintained in legible and unobstructed in such positions as the Chief Fire

Officer may specify.    (Condition 17).   The Chief Fire Officer's

requirements in this regard are being checked.     (See Appendix 1 ').


Under Condition 24 of the Certificate the Holder must supply a Certificate

of a suitably qualified engineer about the structures in the stadium.

           There are several certificates on the files, but none appear to have been

           received recently.     This matter is being taken up with Sheffield

           Wednesday.   A copy of the 1988 Certificate (which was issued in August)

■•Tj       was handed to me at the recent inspection of the stadium.


           Under Condition 25 of the Certificate crush barrier test reports must be

           submitted to the Council.    Many such reports have been submitted to the

           Council and appear to comply with the Conditions.

              (g)   to take statements and prepare reports on any matters where legal

                    proceedings which involve the Council's licensing function;


             (h)    responsibility for implementation of the Safety of Sports Grounds

             (i)    to assimilate and implement the increasing items of new legislation

                    relevant to the Council's licensing functions, which is both varied

                    and complex.


      5.     The Licensing Section deals with 33 licensing systems, for example,
  I
             those involving taxis and private hire vehicles, operators and drivers,

             cinemas, theatres and places of public entertainment.


             Legislation

      6.     On 1st August, 1975 Royal Assent was given to the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Act 1975 which established a "Certification" system for sports grounds

             capable of holding more than 10,000 spectators.    When a sports ground had

             been designated by the Secretary of State and application would need to be

             made to the Certificating Authority for a General Safety Certificate under

             the 1975 Act.


      7.     At the time the Safety Certificate was granted in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday Football Club the South Yorkshire County Council was obliged to

             attach to a Safety Certificate such terms and conditions as they

             considered necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety at the

             stadium when it is in use for specified activities.    These requirements

             were later amended by the 1987 Act.    The terms and conditions had to

             include

             (a)    The maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium and;

             (b)    Terms and conditions as to the number, size and situation of

                    entrances to and exits from the stadium and the means of access to


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                     -3-


                   any such entrances or exits and requiring those entrances, exits and

                  means of access to be properly maintained and kept free from

                   obstruction and as to the number, strength and situation of any

                  crush barriers.


             Certificate conditions must also be framed with reference to a plan

             attached to the Certificate.


             Section 10 of 1975 Act provided for an emergency procedure which could be

             used by the Council if it thought that a serious risk to spectators at a

             sports ground was present.     The procedure involved applying to a
 I
             Magistrates' Court for an Order prohibiting or restricting the admission

             of spectators to the sports ground.


             Under Section 11 of the 1975 Act the person authorised by the Local

             Authority or the Chief Officer of Police, or the Building Authority, or

             the Secretary of State, could on production of his authority enter a

             sports ground to make inspections and examine records and make enquiries

             as he thought fit.    On Local Government Reorganisation on 1st April, 1986

             (when the South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its functions

             passed in the main to District Councils) the reference to the Building
 I


             Authority was changed to the Fire Authority.


             In 1976 the Home Office issued the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

             (Football)" which is a guide to measures for improving spectator safety at

             Football Grounds, i.e., at rugby union and rugby league grounds as well as

             at soccer grounds.    It is a voluntary code.   The Green Guide makes

             comments on such matters as the spacing of crush barriers, estimation of

             safe ground capacity, terraces, etc.    The Guide makes the point that

             deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily

             detracting from the overall safety of the ground.    A flexible approach

             should be maintained to take account of the particular circumstances at

             individual grounds.

              A revised edition of the Green Guide was issued in 1986 following the

              Bradford Disaster and the Popplewell Inquiry.     The scope of the Green

              Guide having been extended to cover measures for improving spectator

              safety at sports grounds generally.     The earlier (1976) edition referred

              to football grounds although much of the guidance contained in the revised

              Green Guide has particular application to football stadia.


              The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended the 1975

              legislation in a number of areas.     In particular, the old Section 10 of

              the 1975 Act was replaced by a more wide ranging provision which gave

              local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition Notice in respect of

             either whole stadia or parts of them.     A Prohibition Notice can only be

             issued where the Local Authority is of the opinion that a serious risk to

             spectators is present in the stadium.     A Prohibition Notice may include

             directions as to the steps which will have to be taken to reduce the risk

             to a reasonable level and these may require alterations or additions to

             the ground or things to be done or omitted, which would contravene the

             terms or conditions of a Safety Certificate for the ground or for any

             stand at the ground.   A prohibition or restriction contained in a Notice

             may take effect immediately if there appears to be reason for it, or after

             a specified period contained in the Notice.     An appeal may be lodged with

             the Magistrates' Court against a Prohibition Notice but that appeal does

             not stop its operation.     The Court may either cancel or affirm the Notice.


     8.      In the new Section 10B of the Act it is the duty of each Certificating

             Authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations made under

             it and also to carry out an inspection of each designated sports ground

             at least once every 12 months and to act in accordance with guidance given

             to them by the Secretary of State.


     9.      The 1987 Act also made provision for Safety Certificates for various

             stands at sports grounds.    Also, in order to give effect to various

              Popplewell comments on indoor sporting activities, the definition of

              public entertainment which require licensing was extended.


     10.      The Safety of Sports Ground Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument

              1987/1941) sets out the prescribed form of application for a Safety

              Certificate and also refers to appeal procedures, etc.


              Home Office Circulars

     11.     Home Office Circular 71/1987 introduced the provisions of Part 2     of the

              1987 Act and gives advice on the effects and operation of them.     There is

              also specific references to the new Prohibition Notice procedure and a

              draft Prohibition Notice.


     12.     Home Office Circular 72/1987 sets out the Statutory Guidance on

             inspections which is mandatory.

    13.      The County Council set up and "Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)"

             which consisted of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the

             Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the South Yorkshire County

             Council Administration Department.   This Working Party was set up

             following a report to the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

             on 8th January, 1976.


     14.     The Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 1978 (Statutory

             Instrument 1978 No. 1091) designated the Sheffield Wednesday Football

             Stadium as requiring a Safety Certificate with effect from 1st January,

             1979.




     15.     On 8th September, 1978 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club submitted their

             application for a General Safety Certificate to the South Yorkshire County

             Council.   (1.79).

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.          This decision was ratified by the full

             County Council meeting on 19th December, 1979.          The grant of a Certificate

             was made subject to remedial works to the south stand steel columns and

             the emergency lighting system being carried out.          The Safety Certificate

             document itself was issued on 21st December, 1979 under the signature of

             Mr. F. A. Mallett, the Chief Executive of the County Council.           (1.211).

             11th August, there were two representatives from the Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club, two from the South Yorkshire Police, one from the South

             Yorkshire County Fire Service, two from the Sheffield City Council

             (Building Authority) and one from the South Yorkshire County Council

             Administration Department.       For illustrative purposes, I would refer to

             the last two paragraphs on the first page of the notes of the Working

             Party visit.     In the first of the two paragraphs it is clear that a

             problem in relation to the brickwork at the rear corner of the stand

             nearest the north west terrace had been raised at the previous meeting of

             the Working Party and this was further explored at the meeting on 11th

                      August.   In the second paragraph, Dr. Eastwood (the Club's Consulting

                     Engineer) gave details of testing of the crush barriers on the terrace and

                      indicating that appropriate remedial action had been taken, where

                     necessary and that the first five year cycle of the barrier testing had

                      thus been completed.


                     The County Council was ^Gc-aotonaii^—made aware of various problems in

                     connection with the use of the stadium.       An example as to how these

                     matters were dealt with can be seen by reference to a letter from the

                     South Yorkshire County Fire Service to the Sheffield Wednesday Football

                     Club regarding a test which the Fire Service did of the emergency

                     procedures at a match on 4th October, 1983.       (3.33).   There was particular

                     concern that stewards could not hear the emergency procedure announcement

                     on the public address system, which resulted in stewards failing to carry

                     out their emergency procedure duties.     Consultations then took place

                     between the Club and the Fire Officer with reference to the County Council

                     which resulted in the satisfactory resultion of the public address system

                     problem.   The system itself was checked and found satisfactory by the

                     County Fire Service 29th October, 1983, the test proved satisfactory.

                     (3.34 and 3.37).

                     City Council) a report was considered from the Head of Administration and

                     Legal Department on Safety of Sports Grounds.      The Panel adopted the

                     recommendations contained in the report which were:-

                    appropriate.


             (c)    The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

                    delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.    The

                   Panel's decision was subsequently confirmed by a full meeting of the

                   City Council which took place on




ifi & ■      The General Purposes Panel considered a more detailed report on the Act

             and the administrative system used by the County Council at the Panel's

             meeting on 6th May, 1986.    The full report is attached to this statement.

 \         Existing Administrative Arrangements

                   The County Council system fir administering the Act is based on two

                   main components - (a) bi-an lual inspections of the stadium and (b)

                   meetings of an Officer Working Party.    The bi-annual inspections

                   consist of representatives 1:rom all the interested authorities and

                   involve thorough inspections; of the stadia and the identifying of any

                   defects.   The defects are at the time of visit brought to the

                   attention of the Certificate holder and its technical representative,

|)fy~              if one is present.   Depending on the nature of the faults found (if

                   any), steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate

                   holder to rectify them or so arrange matters that no risk to the

                   public occurs.   The Working Party consists of representatives from

                   the Police, Fire Service, Building Surveyors and the County Council -

                   it considers in detail vari >us matters (such as the spion kop

                   development at Sheffield We inesday Football Ground) and also any

                   outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.   The Working Party

                   is effectively a co-ordinat ing body, which attempts to ensure that a

HB4AAA/JJJ

                    balanced and consisterapproach is maintained to current issues at

                    the sports grounds.   Any recommendations it makes are subject to

                    approval by this Pane]/.


              The Health and Safety Executive

                   Recommendation 9 of th\e Popplewell Committee's Interim Report reads

                   as follows:-


                   "There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety

                   Executive and the Fire jkithorities and Local Authorities as to how

                   best to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports".

    $              Bearing this in mind, tt e local office of the Health and Safety

                   Executive was invited to participate in the administrative system for

                   Safety of Sports Grounds      This invitation was declined.     The

                   Executive would apparent ly take no direct part in the certification

                   system.   In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and

                   the position explained; it appears that negotiations are under way

                   between the Home Office and the H.S.E. about Popplewell's

                   recommendation, but as yet there has been no useful outcome.          In

                   these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety

                  Executive informed of a} 1 developments in Sheffield and to invite

                  their comments on them.      It would then be the responsibility of the

                  Executive to decide whether or not to respond.


             Review of the Administrative System

             At its meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel

             considered a report on the future administration of the Council's

             Certificating function.


             The report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority, will

             act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service), the

         question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.            In this

HB4AAA/JJJ
                                             -12-



         respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

         Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

         the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the

         Department of Health and Consumer Services.   Both the Building Surveyor's

         Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

         existing Council structure.   It was envisaged that the Working Group would

         function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most regular

         use would probably be the discussions of advice to the Council before they

         were finally formulated by the appropriate Authority.


   tfCf It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

         request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

         Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

         list of items to be discussed.   At the conclusion of the meeting a further

         list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

         taken by each Authority would be noted.    It was then envisaged that

         detailed written advise would be provided by each discipline and acted

         upon as appropriate.


     }   The report went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

         Authority which follow.


         Authority                          Area of Responsibility

                                            emergency planning.


          It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

          would have an input into the Advisory Group on:- aspects of general

          safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items



HB4AAA/JJJ

                  such as first aid requirements.      These lists were of course not

                  exhausted and several of the functions overlapped.


                .. The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

                  that one large scale inspection per stadium per annum should be carried

                 out per year.     It was noted that the proposalwas in                 line with          with     the

                 Popplewell Report and with licensing practice                 inother areas.

                 Inspections of Sports Grounds

                 Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

                 and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

                 authorities.     Inspections take place annually.



    ft ?*'       Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

                 Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and Consumer

                 Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.             Often, the Club is

                 represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

                 another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

                 The inspection is carried out by the various Officers who meet at the

                 ground and then disperse to various areas in which their particular

                 interest lies.

    $t(          Communication is maintained by the Officers throughout the inspection and

                 it is common for the Officers to draw points to each other's attention

                 when they think fit.                 Officers of the Club are usually present and are

                 sometimes referred to by Officers by information.

    b(J
                 If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

                 Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

                 taken to secure its rectification.                                  If rectification is not possible prior

                 to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

                 to issue a Prohibition Notice.

                expected to take more than about two man days per ground on average.


                The role of the Home Office

($((       '•   The Home Office is the Central Government Department which is responsible

                for safety of sports grounds.                        Its functions can be described in brief as

                follows:


                (a)      To advise Parliament on legislation;

                (b)      To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
                         and to offer guidance;

                (c)      To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to

    HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                  -15-



                   inspections); and

             (d)   To issue the "Green Guide" which is an advisory document to assist
                   the improvement of safety standards at sports grounds.


             The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
             and the Popplewell Report

tt.ys.       The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,

             1985 outlining the certification system in operation throughout the

             County.   The press release went on to say that the forthcoming "Summer"

             inspections will take into account the lessons of the recent tragic event

             at Bradford and any revised advise and requirements which may be issued by

             the Home Office. (3.89).   On 13th May, 1985 the South Yorkshire County

             Council sent a letter to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday enclosing a

             copy of the press release and stressing that it is vitally necessary for

             safety stewards to be fully aware of and trained in their duties on the

             manning and opening of doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of

             fire fighting equipment. (3.90).


             The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on

             9th August, 1985 which indicated that the Interim Report of the Popplewell

             Inquiry had been produced and advice had been received from the Home

             Office.   The letter drew attention to a review on the evacuation

             procedures in consultation with the Police and the Fire Service and also

             to the duties of safety stewards.   It was also indicated that the Police

             and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in training stewards.

             Detailed comments were also made about the first aid facilities at the

             stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.    There

             was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

             materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

             displayed. (3.112).   The Club responded to the County Council's letter of

             14th August and comments were made about steward training procedures which

             were to be reviewed before the next home match. (3.116).

             On 15th August, 1979 (1.170) the Officer Working Party met again to

             consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review the

             progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th

             July.   It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

             corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


             On 19th September, 1979 (1.173) Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County

             Council about the emergency lighting installation in the stadium.

             Eastwoods are proposing in the letter that new emergency circuits and
       is

       i     fittings be .installed in areas of the stadium including the north west

             terrace, the south west terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.


             Between 31st October, 1979 and 12th November of the same year, there was

             correspondence between Eastwoods and the County Council about the
    _)
             corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.               It was finally

             agreed that a horizontal timber member should be fixed to the front of the

             corrugated sheeting to improve its safety to an acceptable level.               (1.188,

       | i .1.194, 1.195 and 1.196).


             On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of

             the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates t\y&t in the north west corner

             of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

             pronounced in the past year. The recdmmendation is that the cracks should

             be sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.             (2.29)


   m         On 10th February, 1981 th^^Officer Working Party met (2.52A) to inspect

             the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.            It was noted that the Club had received

             quotations for majexng good the cracking of the concrete at the north west

             terrace^which/will be considered shortly.              The Working Party also heard

             the Club outline the consideration it was giving to the siting of caravans

             outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell

        'H The Chief Constable subsequently agreed to take up the designation

             question once again with the Home Office.      On 24th August, 1977 the Home

             Office wrote to the Chief Constable stating that the case for designation

             of Sheffield Wednesday was not overwhelming and that the Home Office was

             not minded for the time being - but they would reconsider the matter

             later.


       "ZlZ-' The County Council continued to press the case for designation with the

             Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

             played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had

             been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards

             of safety within the ground.      The Home Office once again declined to

             designate this stadium.


       *2-^. The South Yorkshire County Council Fire Service Committee at its meeting

             on                 decided to set up an administrative system for safety of

             sports grounds which involved the setting up of Officer Working Parties to

             discuss safety of sports grounds matters in respect of particular stadia.

             There were four such Working Parties, one covering Sheffield, one

             Rotherham, one Barnsley and one Doncaster.


       2-V        April, 1978 the County Council prepared and submitted a lengthy paper

             to the Home Office on the case for designating the Hillsborough Stadium

             under the 1975 Act.


       ~l$ In AuSust of 1978, the Home Office wrote to the County Council

             .................................     indicating that they would recommend to

             the Home Secretary that an order be made .............. Hillsborough in

             due course.     The County Council then began the Safety Certificate drafting

             exercise.     The exercise was carried on in consultation with the Police,

The Club applied for a Safety Certificate on 8 th September, 1978.     The

stadium itself was designated on 1st January, 1979.

The Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

In support of the Club's application, a report was submitted to the County

Council by Messrs. Eastwoods & Partners, Consulting Engineers, in January,

1979 which dealt with questions of ground capacity at the stadium.      The

report     . . deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening and

supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and calculations

are made of theoretical exit times . . . "    All the stands and terraces

were dealt with in the report.     Page 4 of the report indicates that the

west terrace (which is at the Leppings Lane end) has a total area of some

1,480 square metres, but there are no gangways.      It is suggested that the

full area would justify about 8 , 0 0 0 spectators, but after making allowance

for gangways a capacity of 7,200 would perhaps be more reasonable.     The

report says that the barriers should be designed to match this figure and

that those barriers which could not withstand test load should be

appropriately strengthened and extra ones provided where necessary.

Proposed extra barriers were shown on drawing 1610/2X.     The three exits

from the west terrace have a total width of about 1 1 . 5 metres which would

permit some 1,250 per minute to leave the terrace.     The terrace could,

therefore, be emptied in about 6 minutes.     The report goes on that the

Guide suggests that everyone on the terrace should be within 12 metres of

a gangway or exit; the report notes that there are no gangways and some

spectators would be 25 metres from an exit.    The report goes on to say

that this is felt of no consequence as movement horizontally along the

terrace will be easy and quick.


The north west corner reinforced    concrete terrace is also referred to in

the report which is noted as covering an area of approximately 565 square

metres.   The recommended number of spectators was 2,900, bringing the

total standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.    It was also noted that

             the exits serving the north west terrace were adequate and emptying should

             take place within 8 minutes.     The significance of the 8 minute time

             relates to the recommended maximum time for a departure of spectators from

             a terraced area of a football stadium.        This recommendation is contained

             in the original "Green Guide" at Paragraph 8 . On the last page of the

             report, a recommended future ground capacity of some 50,100 spectators

             (consisting of approximately 24,000 seated spectators, 16,000 standing on

             the spion kop and 10,100 at the Leppings Lane       end). (1.113A)


             Following the submission of Eastwoods' report       to the CountyCouncil there

             was a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) on 12th

             February, 1979 at which the west terrace and north west corner reinforced

             concrete terrace were discussed.     As far as the west terrace was concerned

             it was agreed that ". . . in view of the lack of depth of this terrace,

             the Club's offer to reduce the spectator limit to 7,200 and the discharge

             of 6 . 6 minutes, the Working Party agree that it will be unreasonable to

             insist that gangways or additional exits must       be provided."    The Working

             Party also noted that special attention would       be required to   the crush

             barriers in addition to the ordinary testing in view of the apparent sharp

             edges, corrosion, etc.     The Working Party agreed that there were no real
 I
             problems with the north west terrace but reference is made to the

             corrugated sheeting would be required to pass the appropriate tests, along

             with the crush barriers.


             On 30th March, 1979, the Officer Working Party considered further the

             question of the west terrace and the north west terrace.        As to the west

             terrace it was noted that the terracing in small areas near to the stand

             was in poor condition and that the cross-fall on the steps on the north

             west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw people

             forward.   The height of the crush barriers was also mentioned as being

             below the Guide recommendations.     The Working Party agreed that these

             points should be drawn to the attention of the Club.       As far as the north

HB4AAC/JJJ

              west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now took the view that

              the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in order to meet the

              requirements of the Green Guide.


              On 2nd April, 1979 the Officer Working Party visited Sheffield Wednesday

              and a joint meeting was held with the Club representatives.   The Working

              Party agreed that the Club's proposals (including a capacity limit of

              7,200 spectators) was acceptable, without the need for additional

             gangways.   It was also agreed that the question of the cross-fall on the

             steps on the north west corner exit, the height of some of the existing

             crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp edges in places,

             should be the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the

             Building Surveyor.   The Clulb's proposals in respect to the north west

             terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900 and the

             improvement and addition of some new barriers.   It was also agreed that

             the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting should

             be subject to discussion between the Building Surveyor and Dr. Eastwood.

             (1.139).


             On 18th April, 1979, a joint meeting of the Officer Working Party was held

             at Sheffield Wednesday.    The meeting was held to further discuss the

             proposals in relation to Sheffield Wednesday at the Hillsborough Stadium.

             The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club accepted that the

             cross-fall steps should be rebuilt and that the other matters previously

             raised will be reconsidered after it was seen which of the crush barriers

             failed on testing.   It was accepted the need for improvement or

             replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace,

             the Club wished to consider whether more extensive works could be

             initiated so as to bring in an existing unused area for the accommodation

             of further spectators.

        ^     On 1st May, 1978 (1.148) the Sheffield City Council's Building Surveyor

             wrote to the County Council indicating that as far as the west terrace was

              concerned, the downward slope of the exit steps needed to be corrected and

              that the limitation in capacity shouldremain.     It was noted that, on the       \/

             north west terrace, the replacement of       the corrugated sheeting at the rear

             was required, as was the removal of understrength barriers and a

             replacement by new ones constructed to Guide recommentations.


             On 16th May, 1979 (1.149) the Chief Fire Officer wrote to the County

             Council with a work schedule in respect      of Sheffield Wednesday.   It is

             noted that the west and north west terrace      exit routes were regarded as

             satisfactory.   It was noted that the capacity of the west terrace was
  1
             7,200 persons and that of the north west terrace of 2,900 persons.


      27
      “      On 8 th June, 1979 the County Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday (1.152A)

             enclosing a schedule detailing the works required to be carried out at

             Sheffield Wednesday in order to secure reasonable safety at the ground.

             It was noted in the letter that ". . . after the Club has had the

             opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps you would let me know

             which of the requirements you feel will be able to be carried out in the

             closed season . . .".   The list of requirements contain references to the

             north west terrace and replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear

             of it is require.   The removal of the understrength barriers and their

             replacement by new ones constructed to Guide recommendations and the

             provision of additional barriers was also required.     It was noted that the

             downward slope of the exit steps on the west terrace was to be corrected

             and that the capacity limit of 7,200 was to be fixed and that additional

             barriers were to be provided.   The schedule also confirmed the proposed

             capacities for the stadium and noted that the west terrace would have

             7,200 spectators and the north west terrace, 2,900.

      ^      On 15th August, 1979 (1.170) the Officer Working Party met again to

             consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review the

             progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th

             July.   It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

             corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


       ^     On 19th September, 1979 (1.173) Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County

             Council about the emergency lighting installation in the stadium.

             Eastwoods are proposing in the letter that new emergency circuits and

             fittings be installed in areas of the stadium including the north west

             terrace, the south west terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.


       ^6. Between 31st October, 1979 and 12th November of the same year, there was

             correspondence between Eastwoods and the County Council about the

             corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.     It was finally

             agreed that a horizontal timber member should be fixed to the front of the-/
                                                                                       >/
             corrugated sheeting to improve its safety to an acceptable level.     (1.188,


  t          1.194, 1.195 and 1.196).


             On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of

             the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates that in the north west corner

             of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

             pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should

             be sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.     (2.29)


             On 10th February, 1981 the Officer Working Party met (2.52A) to inspect

             the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.   It was noted that the Club had received

             quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete at the north west

             terrace, which will be considered shortly.     The Working Party also heard

             the Club outline the consideration it was giving to the siting of caravans

             outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell

               would receive further attention^


               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club wrote to the County Council on 15th

               April, 1981 (2.61) outlining an incident which took place at the Leppings

               Lane end of the ground at the Semi-Final Match on 11th April, that year.

               It is noted that there was injuries to spectators because of crushing.

               The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it appears that the

               crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late due to

               travelling problems and rushing to their places after the game had

               commenced, thereby causing problems to spectators at the front of the

               terracing who had been in the ground for a considerable length of time.

               The turnstile readings were apparently 335 persons in excess of the

               capacity for Leppings Lane end which was the result of Tottenham fans

               having purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival at turnstile

               ’N ’ (in Penistone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were

               directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

               were standing.      Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. John’s

               Ambulance for minor ailments and at the Royal Hallamshire and Northern

               General Hospitals 8 spectators were treated.           According to the Police,

               three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

               unspecified injuries.        The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

               both inside and outside the stadium was very good.

HB4AAC/JJJ
             On 22nd April, 1981 the Chief Executive of the County Council wrote to the

             Police asking for a copy of their report on                                        ?




             Mr. Brownlow, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, wrote to the

             Secretary of the Football Association on 3rd June, 1981/commenting in

             detail on the incident at the match on 11th April.     The Chief Constable

             starts by noting the basic facts relating to the stadium and indicating

             that there had been many similar Semi-Final matches at Hillsborough

             without previous incident.     The Police apparently envisaged difficulties

             prior to the match because both sets of supporters would need to use the

             Ml motorway.   There were a number of problems which slowed down the

             arrival of spectatorsm, namely a major road accident, a coach breaking

             down and extensive road works.     These resulted in Tottenham Hotspur fans

             being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.     This all resulted in

             ". . . a sudden influx of large numbers of football spectators to the area

             of the ground at around the time for the start of the match . . .".


               • Brownlow went on to indicate that Tottenham Hotspur supporters managed

             to obtain                   from Coventy City Football Club.     He noted that

             this completely defeated the spectator policy of putting opposing

             spectators at opposite ends of the football ground.     Apparently, neither

             participating football club told the Police or Sheffield Wednesday, or the

             Football Association about this situation andthe mixing        of supporters was

             not properly catered for.    Some 400 Tottenham   fanshad to be removed from

             the kop and accommodated in the Leppings Laneend.      This resulted in an

             over capacity situation at that end of the ground.


        2. According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early

             took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

             the Leppings Lane enclosure ". . . thereby creating a jamming effect and

             the extremeties of it . . ."    The later arrivals then caused a problem

                  because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

                  Hotspur had scored an early goal.                                  The resulting injuries included broken

                  arms, legs and crushed ribs.                             It is noted that some 38 people received

                  treatment.               The pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane

                  enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

                  perimeter track to relieve pressure.                                      Police Officers also refused access

                  to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

                  the crushing problem.                     In Mr. Brownlow1s view, no other course of action

                 could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


               . Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

                 had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

                 similar events.

                Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 2nd September,

                1981 (2.80) indicating that                                 . . we have been instructed by the Club to

                organise the installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the

                Leppings Lane end of the ground . . .".                                       it was noted that the intention

                of these fences was to divide the terrace into approximately three equal

                areas, each served by its own entrance.                                       The object of dividing the

                terrace was to exercise more control over supporters and for example, a

                visiting team with only a few followers would be allocated one section

                with the other two sections retained for home suppoers.                                               A 1.15 metre wide

                gate was proposed at the rear of each fence, to give access for

                maintenance and also policing during the game.                                       The gates could be left

                open, but fastened back to connect the areas during the game if

              appropriate. In order to preserve spectators' views Eastwoods recommended

              that the top of the fence should be approximately 1680 nun above the

              terrace.   It was noted that a fence of this height would not prevent

              individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should eliminate a

             mass "invasion" from one area to another.         Apparently, fences of this

             height worked successfully at St. James' Park (the Newcastle United

             ground).    The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2 and 3.


             On 9th September, 1981 (2.85) Eastwoods wrote to the County Council

             indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in early October,

             subject to their being no objections from the Council.         Eastwoods

             indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be received by

                                 or 25th September.


     pJ*'. The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September (2.87)

             considered the question of the proposed new radial barriers on the west

             terrace.    It was noted that there were drawbacks to the division of the

             terrace into three equal areas, but the Working Party felt that increased

             control on the terrace should result.      A "for instance" was quoted in that

             there could well be problems with opposing fans mixing at the rear of the

             west stand and/or the final exit gates, but the Police considered that

             they could cope with these problems.


       j ^ T h e adequacy and positioning of the gates was discussed as well as the use

             of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.         It was noted that the

             plans did not indicate the headroom which would be available at the rear

             of the terrace should the radial barriers and gates be installed.          The

             Working Party agreed that there was no objection to the proposals subject

             to further calculations as required by the Building Authority being

             satisfactory, confirmation of the headroom at the rear of the terrace and

             those gates being under Police control.         The County Council wrote to

             Eastwoods confirming the Working Party views on 14th September (2.83).           In

                    a letter of 14th December, Eastwoods indicated that the works were now

                    substantially complete (2 .1 0 0 ).


                    The South Yorkshire Police wrote to the County Council on 18th January,

                    1982 about, amongst other things, the new radial fencing at Leppings Lane.

                    It is confirmed in the letter that the fences are working well, but since

                    there have been no large games which resulted in the whole of the

                    terracing being occupied by one group of fans.      The Chief Constable goes

                    on to say that as crush barriers penetrate or come close to the new radial

                    fencing, fans could climb over them.      Also, it was'noted that there were

       ^            some " . . .   dangerous peices . . . " protruding from the cut off ends of

                    some barrier rails.     (2.107)   The County Council wrote to Eastwood and

                    Partners indicating that the radial fences appear to be working

                    satisfactory and also outlining the Police views on them.      (2.108).

                    Messrs. Eastwood and Partners wrote back to the County Council on 26th

                    January, 1982 (2.110) acceping the possibility that fans could climb over

                    the radial fence, but it would be unacceptable to leave a gap along side

                    each radial fence completely free of crush barriers as that would present

                    a major hazard.    The Police comment on the dangerous peices of rails is

                    noted.


                    At an Officer Working Party meeting on 4th February, 1982 (2.117) the

                    Police views on the barriers was again discussed.     It was however, agreed

                    that the existing arrangement was necessary and the problem of fans

                    climbing over from one pen to another would have to be lived with.        It was

           In       agreed to review the issue at the end of the current season.


                    The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 24th August, 1982 (2.147) and

                    a letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners of 27th August, 1982 (2.148)

                    deal with some minor problems which did not apparently involve visitor

                    spectators in the concrete at the north west terrace.     Similar problems

                    were alluded to on 21st February, 1983 at a Working Party meeting. (3.11)

              On 8 th September, 1982 the annual inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium

              was carried out by the Officer Working Party (2.150) and it was noted that

              the two radial fences had been installed on the Leppings Lane terrace.

ptA   m m   Wfirjfcie crush barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace had been tested b   j    ^   ^

              Officer Working Party -jfcee-fciag on 11th August, 1983 (3.25) which testing

              had completed the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the stadium.

              There was also mention of water seepage again at the north west terrace.

              The former A.R.P.    building adjacent to the boundary wall near to Gate 'C'

              of the Leppings Lane entrances to the stadium was in the process of being

              demolished when the Officer Working Party visited the stadium on 29th

              February, 1984 (3.41).    Once again, water seepage was noted on that day at

              the north west terrace.     In June, 1984 the crush barriers at the north

              west corner were tested by the Club's Consulting Engineers (Eastwood &

              Partners) (3.52) and (3.54).


              It was noted that there was some cracked brickwork at the rear of the west

              stand and that there were damaged angled support brackets to the pitch

              security fence at the front of Leppings Lane terrace, at an Officer

              Working Party inspection of the stadium on 9th August, 1984 (3.59). It was

              also noted that the wire mesh barriers on the north west terrace had been

              successfully test loaded.


              There was some discussion at an Officer Working Party meeting on 23rd

              January, 1985 (3.77) about the segregation of home and visiting supporters

              at the rear of the west stand at certain matches ". . . (such as with

              Liverpool) . . ."by erecting temporary barriers.      It was noted that it

              was policy of the Police to aim for the exclusive use by visiting

              supporters of the west stand and terrace.    The Working Party agreed that

              the Club should consider a scheme for permanent barriers at the rear of

              the stand subject to the necessary approvals.     It was also noted that the

              cracked brickwork previously mentioned should continue to be monitored and

                   that the apparent rusting of steel columns at the rear of the stand should

                   receive appropriate treatment.


                   Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 9th April, 1985

                   (3.79) indicating that the Club was anxious to segregate visiting teams'

                   supporters as they entered the ground and also to enable the Police to
                                                                          ft                          N    TV

                   by a new central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the

                   pitch perimeter fence, with gates erected so as to p&rait entry to either

                   half as appropriate.   It was noted that the proaei'sed new secondary radial

                   fence adjacent to the existing fence be abapraoned.     The right hand area of

                   the terrace should also be divided in hdlf by a new central radial fence

                   two terrace areas to have a ^ c o n d gate installed.   The last condition

            ft   Eastwood & Partners submitted a detailed proposal for the revised layout

                 of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th July (3.102).                               Fourteen

                 plans were included in the submission and it was considered by a meeting

                 of the Officer Working Party on 29th July (3.103).                      The Working Party

   ^             accepted the proposals in principle, but made a number of comments which

                 were transmitted to the Consulting Engineers by a letter of 30th July

                 (3.104).      The comments were made by reference to                the plans submitted:-

                 (a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - "for both security access and emergency egress
                        purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

                 (b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - "the new handrail by turnstile 23 to be either
                        shortened or realigned so as to maintain the exit width between the
                        outer (river) wall and turnstile 23, and the exit width between
                        turnstile 16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of
                        the roller shutter gate between turnstiles 16 and 17";

                 (f)    Plan No. 6705/12 - ". . . no barrier height                  indicated . . .";

                 (i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - "for both security access and emergency egress
  ( )                   purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

       (j)   Stewarding of new gates - "as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
             1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
             stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained".


       Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 1st August (3.109)

       and indicated that it might be easier for discussions to take place when

       the works are under construction.   It is also noted in the letter that the

       stewarding would no doubt be taken care of by Mr. Chester (the Sheffield

       Wednesday Club Secretary at that time).


\e\.   The Officer Working Party visited Hillsborough on 7th August (3.111) and

       noted the progress of works to segregate supporters at the Leppings Lane

       end of the ground and on the terrace.     The Working Party agreed "(b) that

       the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be extended

       or have steps to provide easy of access from the new two metre wide gap

       formed by the new radial fence; (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter

       fence should be provided from the south central terrace pen".    There are

       several other comments about general matters in the west terrace.


 iO    At' a meeting at the Police Sports and Social Club at Niagra, Sheffield,

       the Officer Working Party on 13th November (3.128) considered the Club's

       proposals in relation to various projects at the stadium.    It was also

       noted that the Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the

       merging of spectators at the Leppings Lane.    The Working Party noted that

       it was difficult to see how this could be overcome as any physical

       restraint could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present

       situation to continue.   When notified of these problems by the County

       Council in a letter of 14th November (3.129) they found it very difficult

       to envisage anything more which could be done at reasonable expense.



       The Officer Working Party at its inspection of Sheffield Wednesday on 22nd

       January, 1986 (3.141) next considered the segregation arrangements at the

       Leppings Lane end.   The Police confirmed that the new arrangements worked

                   Response to comments made by the Treasury Solicitor in a letter
                   dated the 9th May, 1989

                   Potential Danger on the Leppings Lane Terraces


                   In the earlier part of my statement I refer to the full history of

                   discussions and decisions between the interested parties (the Police, Fire

                   Service, the Building Authority and the Club, and its Consulting

                   Engineers) leading up to the installation of the radial fences on the

                   Leppings Lane terrace.     It will be recalled that the installation of

                   fences took place in two distinct stages in 1982 and 1985.       The result of

                   these discussions and decisions is the creation of the pens at the

                   Leppings Lane terrace.     It is clear from the correspondence on file, which

                   is particularly referred to in my statement, that the fences were erected

            X      only after             careful and thorough consideration by the

                   appropriately qualified experts.      The original radial fencing scheme in

                   1981 was introduced in order to prevent a repeat of the problems which led

                   to spectator injury at an F.A. Cup Semi-Final Match in April, 1981.       It

                   appears from the file correspondence that on that occasion spectators

                   became involved in lateral movement along the length of the terrace which

                   resulted in injuries.     The radial fences which were installed in 1981 had

                   1.15 metre wide gates at the rear of them and were subject to the

                   conditions that the gates should be under Police control.


                   In early 1985 the Club, via their Consulting Engineers, Messrs. Eastwoods

                   & Partners, submitted proposals to alter the Leppings Lane end of the

                   ground and to construct two new radial fences on the Leppings Lane

                   terrace.     I propose ^ n T ^ to^iealwithtythe radial fences at this stage.

                   The reasons for the additional fences on the Leppings Lane terrace involve

                   the better supervision by the Police of spectators, both entering and

                   leaving the sports ground.      Once again, full and careful consideration was

                   given to the proposals by the County Council involving the Police, the

                   Fire Service, the Building Authority, the Club and itSvConsulting

                   Engineers.    There is correspondence on file dealing with the positioning,

                   width and proposed stewarding of the gates in the radial fences.     Full

                   details of these discussions are related in the earlier part of my

                   statement.
    V
                   As far as the Green Guide is concerned, paragraphs 101 to 103 (in Chapter

                   8) refers to the division of spectator accommodation.    These paragraphs of

                   the Guide are drafted in general terms, but it appears to me that the

                   penning arrangement at Leppings Lane does not conflict with the general

                   statements fcontained in the Guide.   I am, of course, mindful that the pens

                   were constructed over a number of years, and were installed and approved

                   in situation by all the interested parties I have already listed.


                   Having had regard to the circumstances in which pens were installed (based

                   on the evidence contained in the South Yorkshire County Council's files) I

                   believe that the Leppings Lane terrace met the standards of reasonable

                   safety for spectators as referred to in the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
                                                                         *
                   1975 as amended.


                   Means of egress onto the pitch from the Leppings Lane Terrace

                   There is no clear record on the files as to when the pitch perimeter fence

                   at Hillsborough was in fact installed, but it appears to have been in

                   place when the County Council first looked at the stadium from the point

                   of view of a Certificating Authority.

                   According to the files, the pitch perimeter gates at Leppings Lane were

                   next considered in 1985 when the second radial barrier development was

                   considered.    It was agreed by the Officer Working Party and the Club and

                   capacities at the stadium and made several comments about the west

                   terrace.  The report started by noting that there are no gangways on the
                               t
                   terrace and that in Eastwoods' professional opinion some allowance should

                   be made for circulation space as spectators have to move quite

                   considerable horizontal distances to achieve good packing.                  Eastwoods

                   suggested that the full area would probably accommodate 8,000 spectators,

                   but a 10% reduction would be appropriate (as the equivalent of gangways)

                   giving a capacity of 7,200 spectators.                Eastwoods go on to say that some

                   spectators would still be 25 metres from an exit, but it was felt that

                   this was of no consequence as horizontal movement along the terrace would

                   be easy and quick.           The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 12th

                   February, 1979 accepted Eastwoods' views and noted the discharge time of

                   some 6.6 minutes.           The Working Party felt that it would be unreasonable to

                   insist on additional gangways or exits.


                   During the various alterations to the terrace in 1981 and 1985 these

                   matters were reconsidered and provisions made for proper access to and

                   egress from the new pens.            These arrangements were, as I have already

                   mentioned, carefully considered and approved by all the interested

                   parties.           (See page^ 2 ^ of my statement).


                   Directional Signs in relation to access to the ground

         Xuv-      There has been criticism of trie p-r ^ i-ei-on of directional signs within the

                   stadium which would lead people to gain access to pens other than the two

                   central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace.                  The point is made that fans

              entering through the turnstiles could only see the tunnel leads to the two

              central pens and no other signs.    There is in fact one small directional

         0    sign to the right of the west stand which says "standing".

              It is appropriate to point out that matters relating to the actual flows

              of spectators on match days are matters on which the Council would need to

              take advice, either from the Club or the Police.    Obviously, where exit

              routes need to be signed, the Fire Service also has an involvement.    There

              is no record on any of the files that there was any inadequacy in signing

              arrangements for the terrace at Leppings Lane and had it been a

              significant factor I would have expected that the matter would have been

              brought up by the Police or the Club.    The provision of signing is not

              usually a complex or expensive task.     It must be borne in mind that the

              direction of spectators on match days is largely the responsibility of

              stewards with some involvement from the Police.


     ^ ^      The siting/strength of crush barriers in the pen
    \ ,
     L   0     n    /flitrUiT    1986, the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was subject

              to an annual inspection.     During the course of this annual inspection I

              recall that the Police representative requested that crush barrier number

              144 be reduced so that the persons entering the terrace from the tunnel
I
              would not be obstructed by it.     Apparently, there had been some

              difficulties in this area.     The barrier itself penetrated the central

              radial fence immediately in front of the tunnel.     The barrier was indeed

              removed with the result that barrier 144 now contains only one section,

              that is in the north central pen (see plan 1610/64E).     The decision on the

              barrier was taken at the time of the inspection in the presence of

              representatives from the Fire Authority, the Police, the Building

              Authority and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners, the Club's Consulting

              Engineers.    No problems with this revised barrier arrangement have been

               brought to my attention.

                 As far as the strength of the barriers Is concerned, they were tested by

                Messrs. Eastwood & Partners on                       ^ ^ M.

                July, 1988 and the report Is attached to this statement.                       There were one

                or two defects discovered on the test which are noted In Eastwoods' letter

                which were remedied during 1988.             All the barriers in the two central

                pens were tested and found to meet the Green Guide standards.

               with the tunnel and as it has been used for many years by many thousands

               of spectators without apparent difficulty or incident in my opinion,                         the

               tunnel arrangement          is reasonably safe within the meaning of the

                  Officer Working Party at a meeting on 12th November, 1979 (1.196) agreed

                  that whilst no real problems had occurred in the past the Club would in

                 consultation with the Fire Service and the Police mark out a lane from the

                 main gates to the south stand in which parking would not be allowed.       It

                 was also agreed that the hydrant outside the south stand.    It was also

                 agreed that the hydrant outside the south stand would have to be kept

                 clear.   The Police noted on 26th March, 1980 (2.15) that they did not have

                 any current problems in relation to the access for emergency vehicles.


                 During the planning stage for the redevelopment of the kop, the Club
                                                                         %
                 offered (letter from Eastwoods 29th November, 1985 - 3.130) to widen the

                 gangway between the north stand and the retaining wall of the kop to

                 enable fire engines to get to the pitch area.   The Fire Service responded

                 to this at an Officer Working Party meeting (22nd January, 1986 - 3.141)

                 by saying that whilst they felt that such a facility was not essential for

                 their purposes it could be useful for use by emergency vehicles in certain

                 situations and should generally be supported.   Towards the end of 1986,

                 (letter from Eastwoods 18th December, 1986 - 3.210) the Club submitted

                 proposals for creating a new entrance to the Sports Hall off Penistone

                 Road so that the public would no longer have to use gate '0'/^ Another

                 purpose of the development was to provide separate access for Police

                 dangers which could result from vehicles having to pass

             am not aware of the evidence on which the criticism about emergency

           )C vehicle}* is based, it is difficult to comment further.      Obviously, if that

             evidence is forthcoming,       I can give further consideration to this

             question.      I understand that meetings have taken place between the Police,

             the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service on the emergency evacuation

             procedures at Sheffield Wednesday.        No doubt those discussions dealt with

             the emergency access of vehicles to the stadium.



             First Aid Facilities

             The County Council, in 1979, approached the Area Health Authority for

                 advice on first aid facilities at Sheffield Wednesday.    The Area Health

                 Authority responded on 31st May, 1979 (1.151) with a list of requirements.

                 References are made in the list to two or three treatment couches; six

                 stretchers, two sets of stretcher wheels, 20 blankets, six pillows and one

                 minute man resuscitator.    Other comments are made about water

                 requirements, lighting, etc.    On 15th August, 1979 (1.170) the Officer

                 Working Party requested the Club to provide a first aid permanent
                                                                        *
                 structure during the 1980 closed season, subject to the Club agreeing to

                 provide the recommended first aid equipment immediately.^/0n 21st

                 December, 1979 (1.211) the County Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday

                 indicating that the existing first aid facilities are accepted on an

                 interim basis only pending the erection of purpose built facilites in the

                 1980 closed season.    On 20th April, 1982 (2.132) the County Council wrote

                 to Sheffield Wednesday following an Officer Working Party meeting at which

                 the Club's outline drawing for new Police and first aid facilities was

                 considered.   As far as the first aid facilities were concerned, four

                 comments were made:-

                  (a)   The walls of the first aid room should be lined with a suitable
                        non-combustible and easily cleaned material, which would not need to
                        be redecorated.

                  (b)   Lockable storage facilities for blankets, stretchers, etc. were to be
                        provided.

                  (c)   A telephone point was to be provided in the first aid room.

                   (d)    The floor was to be of easily cleanable material (such as quarry
                          tiles, etc.)


                   T^e Officer Working Party at its meeting on 21st February, 1983 (3.11)

                   noted that the new Police and first aid facilities under the north stand

                   had been welcomed by the users and were proving to be most useful.

                   Following the Popplewell interim report, the County Council wrote to

                   Sheffield Wednesday on 9th August, 1985 (3.112) and drew attention to the

                   necessity of providing adequate first aid and first aid room facilities.

                   Attention was also drawn to Condition 8 of the Safety Certificate.            In

                   December, 1987 (4.53 and 4.54) the City Council wrote to Sheffield

                   Wednesday in response to the annual inspection which took place on 6th

                   August, 1987.    It was noted on a schedule attached to the notification

                   letter to Sheffield Wednesday that "The main first aid rooms requires to

                   be supplied with adequate first aid equipment for the treatment of

                   spectators . . . "       It was also mentioned that the provision of qualified

                   first aiders was being reviewed and that the views of the Club on this

                                                                        January, *1988 (4.60) Messrs.

                   Eastwood & Partners responded to the Council's comments and noted the

                   views expressed on first aid equipment.           They went on to say that the Club

                   regularly liaise with St. John’s Ambulance about manning levels and a

                   sufficient number of first aiders is provided for each game in line with

                   the recommendations given by the football league.


       - H r       The Green Guide deals with the question of first aid in paragraph 29

                   (Management Responsibility).          The first management responsibility is to

                   appoint a safety officer and Mr. Mackrell, the Club Secretary, confirmed

                   that he was the Club Safety Officer by letter to the Council dated

             refer to-m^tters referred to in Section 2(1)(3).



       t t y . Section 2(4) of the Act indicates that the Safety Certificate must have

             attached to it a plan and the terms and conditions must be framed by

             reference to it, where appropriate.            Paragraph 5 of the General Safety

             Certificate refers to plans.          Under Schedule 1 of the Certificate, the

             definition of plans is "document or documents attached to and forming part

             of the General Safety Certificate and signed by the person signing the

            Certificate".       When the files were handed over to the Sheffield City

            Council in April,       1986 a copy of the General Safety Certificate for

            Hillsborough was in an envelope, together with a number of plans, none of

            which were signed by Mr. Mallett (the original signatory of the

            Certificate).      The original Safety Certificate and plans are lodged with

            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited (the Holder).



            Thte Certificating Authority is under a duty to determin^whether or not

            thi applicant ^ k f r a Saf e t y \ e r t i f icate is a "qu^iffied persons" (i.e.,

            Wednesday Football Club Limited on 21st December,                1979.



            Under Section 3(3) of the Act applications for Certificates had to be

            copied to the Police, the Fire Authority and the Building Authority.

            Sheffield Wednesday applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September,

            1978 (1.79).     Copies of the application were sent to the Building

            Authority,   the Police and the Fire Service on 13th September, 1978 (1.81,

            1.82 and 1.83) relating to consultations with other parties was also

            complied with.      There was no formal notice issued by the County Council

            requiring the Holder to supply further information to enable it (the




34AAD/JJJ
              Council) to determine the terms and conditions of a Certificate.     The

              matter was dealt with in lengthy correspondence and by consultation.



       ( \ i . The amendment and replacement of Certificates is governed by Section 4 of

              the Act and the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976, which were

              superseded on 1st January,    1988 by the Safety of Sports Grounds

              Regulations 1987.



       ^     . The Act provides that a local authority may, if it feels it appropriate to

              do so, amend a Safety Certificate by notice in writing to its holder or

              replace it.     A Safety Certificate may be amended or replaced either with

              or without the application of the Holder of the Certificate.     Section 2 of

              the Act applies to the amendment or replacement of a Safety Certificate.

              Section 4(4) of the Act indicates that a notice under Section 4(l)(a)

              amending a General Safety Certificate shall specify the date on which the

              amendment to which it relates is to come into operation, and the date so

              specified may be a date later than the date of issue of the notice.       The

              Regulations make further provision with regard to the amendment of the

              Certificates.    Regulation 7 provides that where a local authority issues

              or amends the said Certificate it shall forthwith give notice in writing

              of the issue or amendment    ...   to all specified interested parties and

              any unspecified interested parties known to the local authority.     In

              addition, the local authority in giving notices must inform the persons to

              whom notice is given that a copy of the Safety Certificate and the

              application for the grant, amendment or replacement    . . . may be inspected

              and where and at what time such inspection may be made.    In addition, the

              local authority must publish in a newspaper as soon as maybe after the

              amendment of the Certificate with the information referred to in the last

              sentence.



              On 3rd September,   1981 the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

              resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

                 to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until such certain works

                 related to two matches.           The amendment to the Certificate only affected

            l « o - On 1st December, 1986 the General Purposes Panel resolved to amend

                 Schedule 1 of the Certificate so as to extend the definition of specified

                 activity to include Royal visits.                   Again, the notice                 provisions of the

                 legislation were not observed (3.208).


                 Under Section 5 of the Act interested parties may appeal against or about

                 the terms and conditions in a Certificate and the Council's refusal to

                   Department about the operation of the Council's certification function for

                   the safety of sports grounds.       One of the details mentioned in the report

                   relates to inspections and the proposal that one large scale inspection

                   per stadium should be carried out.        In fact the report itself does not

                   make clear my intention that these inspections should be annual.         My

                   intention at the time, and the Council's practice has been, to arrange

                   annual inspections of stadia.       The report goes on to indicate that these

                   inspections would be backed up by a series of "during event" inspections

Under Conditon 1(1) of the Safety Certificate, the Holder's nominee must

be approved in writing by the Council.             The purpose of having a nominee is

so that he or she can be responsible for the Holder's obligation to take

all reasonable precautions and exercise all due diligence to avoid the

contravention of any term or condition of the Certificate (although the

appointment of a nominee does not absolve the Holder from liability).

Chapter 2 of the Guide.              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic. responded

to this letter on 23rd October, and confirmed that Mr. Mackrell's duties

encompassed those of the Safety Officer and requesting that the Council's

records be amended to note that he is responsible for all matters of

safety within the ground.


Under Condition 8(1) of the Certificate the Holder is required to provide

and maintain at the stadium, to the satisfaction of the Council, a

 suitably equipped first aid room.             The first aid room was installed and

The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended the 1975

legislation in a number of areas.                  In particular, the old Section 10 of

the 1975 Act was replaced by a more wide ranging provision which gave

"local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition Notice in respect of

either^whole s£ad-ra or parts of «6faraah»               A Prohibition Notice can only be

issued where the Local Authority is of the opinion that a serious risk to

spectators is present in the s«tadi-am.                  A Prohibition Notice may include

directions as to the steps which will have to be taken to reduce the risk

to a reasonable level and these may require alterations or additions to

the ground or things to be done or omitted^; which would contravene the

terms or conditions of a Safety Certificate for the ground or for any
                        (f&vrtp/v toIf) $t<- il^Tl /hr)
stand at the ground/.            A prohibition or restriction contained in a Notice
                           f
may take effect immediately if there appears to be reason for it, or after

a specified period contained in the Notice.                        An appeal may be lodged with

 the Magistrates' Court against a Prohibition Notice but that appeal does

 not stop its operation.             The Court may either cancel or affirm the Notice.


 In the new Section 10B of the Act it is the duty of each Certificating

 Authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations made under

 it and also to carry out an inspection of each designated sports ground

 at least once every 12 months and to act in accordance with guidance given

 to them by the Secretary of State.


 The 1987 Act also made provision for Safety Certificates for various

 stands at sports grounds.              Also, in order to give effect to various
             Popplewell comments on indoor sporting activities, the definition of

  V                              g
             public entertainment^which require licensing was extended.


      15.    The Safety of Sports Ground Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument

             1987/1941) sets out the prescribed form of application for a Safety

             Certificate and also refers to appeal procedures, etc.


             Home Office Circulars

      16.    Home Office Circular 71/1987 introduced the provisions of Part 2 of the

             1987 $ct and gives advice on the effects and operation of them.               There is

             also specific reference^ to the new Prohibition Notice procedure and a

             draft Prohibition Notice.


      17.    Home Office Circular 72/1987 sets out the Statutory Guidance on

             inspections which is mandatory.             Thh                                  /b^b

             Administration of the Certificating Function by South Yorkshire County
             Council

             The County Council set up an "Officer Working PartyX(Sheffield District)"

             which consisted of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the

             Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the South Yorkshire County

             Council Administration Department.            This Working Party was set up

             following a report to the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee on

             8th January, 1976.


             In the early part of 1976 discussions took place between the South

             Yorkshire County Council and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about

             the possibility of certification in view of the commencement of the Safety

             of Sports Grounds Act on 1st September, 1975.              On 30th March, 1977 the

             South Yorkshire Police became involved in the discussions and wrote

   X         to the Home Office^/ indicating that they felt certification should be

             considered when the matter was next reviewed, owing to the large scale

             events that were held at Hillsborough.

                                      fec©»b4& at Hillsborough involving -&as& injuries and a number of arrests.

                                      This prompted further discussions about certification and the involvement

                                      of the Fire Service Committee of the County Council as well as the Police.

                                      At the meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council on 27th April, 1977

                                      questions relating to the problems at the football match were raised and a

                                      specific complaint was later made by a member of the public in connection

                                      with an incident that allegedly took place at the Leppings Lane end of

                                      the ground.


                   21.                The Chief Constable subsequently agreed to take up the designation

                                      question once again with the Home Office.                      On 24th August, 1977 the Home

                                      Office wrote to the Chief Constable                      stating that the case                    for designation

                   22.                The County Council continued to press the case for designation with the

                                      Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

                                      played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had

j                                     been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards

                                      of safety within the ground.                   The Home Office once again declined to

                       were dealt with in the report.        Page 4 of the report indicates that the

                       west terrace (which is at the Leppings Lane end) has         a totalarea of some

                       1,480 square metres, butthere are no gangways.        Itis     suggestedthat the

                       full area would justify about 8,000 spectators, but after making allowance

                       for gangways a capacity of 7,200 would perhaps be more reasonable.              The

                       report says that the barriers should be designed to match this figure and

                        that those barriers which could not withstand test load should be

                       appropriately strengthened and extra ones provided where necessary.

                       Proposed extra barriers were shown on drawing 1610/2X.            The three exits

           A     permit some l,250|per minute to leave the terrace.           The terrace could,

                 Guide suggests th&t everyone on the terrace should be within 12 metres of

                 metres.   The recommended number of spectators was 2,900, bringing the

                 total standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.           It was also noted that

                 the exits serving the north west terrace were adequate and emptying should

                 take place within 8 minutes.       The significance of the 8 minute time

                 relates to the recommended maximum time for a departure of spectators from

     (\          February, 19797at which the west terrace and north west corner reinforced

                 concrete terrace were discussed.        As far as the west terrace was concerned

                 it was agreed that        . . i n view of the lack of depth of this terrace,

                 the Club's offer to reduce the spectator limit to 7,200 and the discharge

                 of 6.6 minutes, the Working Party agree that it will be unreasonable to

                 insist that gangways or additional exits must be provided."             The Working

                 Party also noted that special attention would be required to the crush

                 barriers in addition to the ordinary testing in view of the apparent sharp

                         edges, corrosion, etc.     The Working Party agreed that there were no real

                         problems with the north west terrace but reference is made to the
i<'f
                         corrugated sheeting would be required to pass the appropriate tests, along

                         with the crush barriers.

       )c
                         terrace it was noted that the terracing in small areas near to the stand

                         was ir\ poor condition and that the cross-fall on the steps on the north

                         west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw people

                         forward.    The height of the crush barriers was also mentioned as being

                         below the Guide recommendations.     The Working Party.agreed that these

                         points should be drawn to the attention of the Club.     As far as the north

                         west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now took the view that

                         the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in order to meet the

                         requirements of the Green Guide.


               2f£.      On 2nd April, 1979^the Officer Working Party visited Sheffield Wednesday

                         and a joint meeting was held with the Club representatives.     The Working

                         Party agreed that the Club's proposals (including a capacity limit of

                         7,200 spectators) was acceptable, without the need for additional

                         gangways.    It was also agreed that the question of the cross-fall on the

                         steps on the north west corner exit, the height of some of the existing

                         crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp edges in places,

                         should be the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the


               X         Building Surveyor.    The Clu^b's proposals in respect to the north west

                         terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900 and the

                         improvement and addition of some new barriers.     It was also agreed that

                         the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting should

                         be subject to discussion between the Building Surveyor and Dr. Eastwood.

                 On 18th April, 1979^ a joint meeting of the Officer Working Party was held

                 at Sheffield Wednesday.          The meeting was held to further discuss the

                 proposals in relation to Sheffield Wednesday at the Hillsborough Stadium.

                 The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club accepted that the

                 cross-fall steps should be rebuilt and that the other matters previously

                 raised will be reconsidered after it was seen which of the crush barriers

      ys.        On 1st May, 1978 (1.148) the Sheffield City Council's Building Surveyor

                 wrote to the County Council indicating th^at as far as the west terrace was

                 concerned, the downward slope of the exit steps needed to be corrected and

                 that the limitation in capacity should remain.               It was noted that, on the

                 north west terrace, the replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear

                 was required, as was the removal of understrength barriers and a

                 replacement by new ones constructed to Guide recommentations.


      yf.        On 16th May, 1979 (1.149) the Chief Fire Officer wrote to the County

                 Council with a work schedule in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.                    It is

                 noted that the west and north west terrace exit routes were regarded as

                 satisfactory.      It was noted that the capacity of the west terrace was

                 7,200 persons and that of the north west terrace of 2,900 persons.


                 As a result of these consultations between the Working Party and the Club

 vr              on 8th June, 1979/a list of "Matters requiring attention at the Sheffield

                 Wednesday Football Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield" was sent to the Club

                 for its attention.       ^-1. 1-5-gj)

                      consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review the

                      progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th

                      July.   It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

                      corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


                      On 19th September, 1979 (1.173) Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County

                      agreed that a horizontal timber member should be fixed to the front of the

             The County Council was^made aware of various problems in connection with

             the use of the stadium.         An example as to how these matters were deslt

             with can be seen by reference to a letter from the South Yorkshire County

    X        Fire Service^Jto the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding a test

             which the Fire Service did of the emergency procedures at a match on 4th


    X        October, 1983.   ^(3 .-3-3      There was particular concern that stewards could

             not hear the emergency procedure announcement on the public address
                   t
             system, which resulted in stewards failing to carry out their emergency

             procedure duties.     Consultations then took place between the Club and the

        K    Fire Officer^with reference to the County Council^which resulted in the
                             0
             satisfactory resjultion of the public address system problem. The system

             itself was checked and found satisfactory by the County Fire Service 29th

             Legal Department on Safety of Sports Grounds.        The Panel adopted the

             recommendations contained in the report which were:-


             (a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports

              and the administrative system used by the County Council at fhr Pnnal-1-^

              Review of the Administrative System

              At its meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel
                                 i )
              considered a report^on the future administration of the Council's

              Certificating function.


              The report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority, will

              act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service), the

              question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.      In this

              respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

              Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

              the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the

              Department of Health and Consumer Services.     Both the Building Surveyor's

              Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

                                              It was envisaged that the -Wo^kiag Group would

              function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most regular

              use would probably be the discussions of advice to the Council before they

              were finally formulated by the appropriate Authority.


              It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would     be heldat the
(A.   *
              request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

              Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

              list of items to be discussed.    At the conclusion of the meeting a further

              list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

              taken by each Authority would be noted.     It was then envisaged that

            T.   It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

                 would have an input into the Advisory Group on:— aspects of general

                 safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items

                 such as first aid requirements. These lists were of course not
                         I Vk
                 exhausted- and several of the functions overlapped.


                 The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

                 that one large scale inspection per stadium ^er annu4 should be carried
      X
                 out pen? year.   It was noted that the proposal was in line with the

                 Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other areas.


                 The Panel approved the revised administrative system which therefore came

                 into effect immediately and delegated all routine matters in connection

                 with that system to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.                             The

                 system remains in effect.

                 proposals modified in the light of comments made.               Prior to the

 Council sent a letter to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesdlf "Sc losing a

 copy of the press release and stressing that it is vitally necessary for

 safety stewards to be fully aware of and trained in their duties on the

 manning and opening of doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of

 fire fighting equipment. (4^9$-).


 The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on
                  I/2_^)
 9th August, 1985 which indicated that the Interim Report of the Popplewell

Inquiry had been produced and advice had been received from the Home

Office.   The letter drew attention to a review on the evacuation

procedures in consultation with the Police and the Fire Service and also

to the duties of safety stewards.    It    also indicated that the Police

and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in training stewards.

Detailed comments were also made about the first aid facilities at the

stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.    There

was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

displayed.            The Club responded^to^he County Council's letter of

14th August and comments were made about steward training procedures which

were to be reviewed before the next home match.   (~3TIT&).


The Sheffield City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday on 15th October

1987 referring to the revised Green Guide which had been published by H.

M. Government following the Popplewell Report drawing attention to the new

Guide and particularly to Chapter 2, which is entitled "Management

Responsibility".   The letter asks Sheffield Wednesday to confirm in

writing that the Club intends to retain a copy of the revised Green Guide

on the premises and that they should take immediate steps to appoint a

safety officer as defined in Chapter 2.           The Club responded to

that letter on 23rd October, 1987|confirming that a copy of the Guide was

                  On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of

                  the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates that in the north west corner

                  of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

                  pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should

                  be sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.   (2.29)


fQ                On 10th February, 1981 the Officer Working Party met (2.52A) to inspect

                  the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.   It was noted that the Club had received

                  quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete at the north west
nn
                  terrace, which will be considered shortly.   The Working Party also heard

                  the Club outline the consideration it was giving to the siting of caravans

                  outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell

                  tickets.   It was hoped that if this took place, increased entry flow of

                  spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the

                  turnstiles.

                    On 7th April, 1981 the Officer Working Party (2.59) inspected the

                 Sheffield Wednesday Stadium, bearing in mind that an F .A. Cup Semi-Final

                 was to take place on 11th April, 1981.


                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club wrote to the County Council on 15th

                 April, 1981 (2.61) outlining an incident which took place at the Leppings

                Lane end of the ground at the Semi-Final Match on 11th April, that year.

                 It is noted that there was injuries to spectators because of crushing.

                The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it appears that the

                crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late due to

                travelling problems and rushing to their places after the game had

                commenced, thereby causing problems to spectators at the front of the

                terracing who had been in the ground for a considerable length of time.

          V     The turnstile readings                         335 persons in excess of the

               capacity for Leppings Lane end which was the result of Tottenham fans

               having purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival at turnstile

                    N   (in Penistone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were

               directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

     V         were standing.          Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. J o h n ^

               Ambulance for minor ailments and at the Royal Hallamshire and Northern

               General Hospitals 8 spectators were treated.           According to the Police,

               three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

              unspecified injuries.           The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

              both inside and outside the stadium was very good.


              On 22nd April, 1981 the Chief Executive of the County Council wrote^to\he

                     comment ing in detail on the incident at the match on 11th April.                  The

                     Chief Constable starts by noting the basic facts relating to the stadium

                     and indicating that there had been many similar Semi-Final matches at

                     Hillsborough without previous incident.                 The Police apparently envisaged

                     difficulties prior to the match because both sets of supporters would need

                     to use the Ml motorway.            There were a number of problems which slowed down

                     the arrival of spectators, namely a major road accident, a coach breaking

                    down and extensive road works.              These resulted in Tottenham Hotspur fans

                    being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.                   This all resulted in

      ?3.           According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early
  I
                    took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

                    the Leppings Lane enclosure " . . .            thereby creating a jamming effect wwT

      y       ^     the extremeties of it . . ."            The latej( arrivals then caused a problem

                    because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

                    Hotspur had scored an early goal.              The resulting injuries included broken

                    arms, legs and crushed ribs.            It is noted that some 38 people received

                    treatment.       The pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane

                   enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

                   perimeter track to relieve pressure.                Police Officers also refused access
HB4AAC/JJJ
                  to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

                  the crushing problem.   In Mr. Brownlow's view, no other course of action

                  could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


                 Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

                 had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

                 similar events.

                   ssrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 2nd September,

                 1981   (2.80) indicating that    . . we have been instructed by the Club to

                 organise the installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the

                 jLeppings Lane end of the ground . .       It was noted that the intention
 kfiVt- V>/fu
                 lof these fences was to divide the terrace into approximately three equal

                 areas, each served by its own entrance.    The object of dividing the

                 terrace was to exercise more control over supporters and for example, a

                visiting team with only a few followers would be allocated one section

                with the other two sections retained for home suppoers.     A 1.15 metre wide

                gate was proposed at the rear of each fence, to give access for

                maintenance and also policing during the game.    The gates could be left

                open, but fastened back to connect the areas during the game if

                appropriate. In order to preserve spectators' views Eastwoods recommended

                that the top of the fence should be approximately 1680 mm above the

                terrace.   It was noted that a fence of this height would not prevent

                individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should eliminate a

                mass "invasion" from one area to another.    Apparently, fences of this

                height worked successfully at St. James' Park (the Newcastle United

                ground).   The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2 and 3.


 tfj#:          On 9th September, 1981 (2.85) Eastwoods wrote to the County Council

                indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in early October,

                subject to their being no objections from the Council.    Eastwoods
HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                                -23-


    /                  indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be received by

                      23rd, 24th or 25th September.



          V*-         The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September (2.87)

                      considered the question of the proposed new radial barriers on the west

                      terrace.      It was noted that there were drawbacks to the division of the

                      terrace into three equal areas, but the Working Party felt that increased

                      control on the terrace should result.       A "for instance" was quoted in that

                      there could well be problems with opposing fans mixing at the rear of the

                      west stand and/or the final exit gates, but the Police considered that

                      they could cope with these problems.


             X-       The adequacy and positioning of the gates was discussed as well as the use

                      of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.       It was noted that the

                      plans did not indicate the headroom which would be available at the rear

                      of the terrace should the radial barriers and gates be installed.       The

                     Working Party agreed that there was no objection to the proposals subject

                      to further calculations as required by the Building Authority being

                     satisfactory, confirmation of the headroom at the rear of the terrace and

                     those gates being under Police control.       The County Council wrote to

                     1982 about, amongst other things, the new radial fencing at Leppings Lane.

                     It is confirmed in the letter that the fences are working well, but since

                     there have been no large games which resulted in the whole of the

                     terracing being occupied by one group of fans.       The Chief Constable goes

                     on to say that as crush barriers penetrate or come close to the new radial

                     fencing, fans could climb over them.       Also, it was noted that there were

                     some " . . .   dangerous pieces . . . " protruding from the cut off ends of

                      each radial fence completely free of crush barriers as that would present

                      a major hazard.        The Police comment on the dangerous pelces of rails is
                      noted.

                      that the existing arrangement was necessary and the problem of fans

                      climbing over from one pen to another would have to be lived with.            It was

                     (3.79) indicating that the Club was anxious to segregate visiting teams'

                     supporters as they entered the ground and also to         enable the Police to

                     control their exit at the end of the game.         A scheme showing a possible

                     modification to the Leppings Lane end was prepared and shown on drawing

                     6705/2 which involved the construction the two new banks of turnstiles and

                     various runs of fencing and new gates.

                   Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 8th May (3.87) and

                   indicated that several of the points made had already been incorporated

                   into the latest scheme.          Eastwoods say in the letter:-        .   .   However I

                   would ask that further consideration should be given to the request in

                   paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to be installed in the

               radial barrier and for the new radial barrier which you have asked for to

               have two gates.              If these gates meant for use in emergency it would mean

               having a steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which

               would hardly be justified.              It is our view that in the event of emergency,

               spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the gates on to the pitch

               and by the normal exit gates at the rear.               We will of course be prepared

               to discuss the matter with the Fire Officer's staff should you so wish

              The County Council sent a letter to Eastwoods on 10th May, 1985 (3.88)

              indicating that the Police were prepared to concede the request for two

              gates per radial fence, provided that the remainder of the points raised

              by the Officer Working Party were incorporated.


    vr.      I Eastwood & Partners submitted a^detailed proposal for jjS revised layout

              of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th JulyO.102).                     Fourteen

              plans were included in the submission and it was considered by a meeting

              of the Officer Working Party on 29th July (3.103).                 The Working Party

              accepted the proposals in principle, but made a number of comments which

              were transmitted to the Consulting Engineers by a letter of 30th July

              (3.104).              The comments were made by reference to the plans submitted:-

              (a)        Plan No. 6705/6 - "for both security access and emergency egress
                         purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

              (b)   Plan No. 6705/8A - "the new handrail by turnstile 23 to be either
                    shortened or realigned so as to maintain the exit width between the
                    outer (river) wall and turnstile 23, and the exit width between
                    turnstile 16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of
                    the roller shutter gate between turnstiles 16 and 17";

              (f)   Plan No. 6705/12 -      . no barrier height indicated . . .";

              (i)   Plan No. 6705/17 - "for both security access and emergency egress
                    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

              (j)   Stewarding of new gates - "as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
                    1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
                    stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained".


              Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 1st August (3.109)

              and indicated that it might be easier for discussions to take place when

              the works are under construction.  It is also noted in the letter that the
                              ..                                          v
              stewarding would^no doubt be taken care of by Mr. Chester^(the Sheffield

             Wednesday Club Secretary at that time).


             The Officer Working Party visited Hillsborough on 7th August (3.111) and

             noted the progress of works to segregate supporters at the Leppings Lane

             end of the ground and on the terrace.     The Working Party agreed "(b) that

             the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be extended

             or have steps to provide easy of access from the new two metre wide gap

             formed by the new radial fence; (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter

             fence should be provided from the south central terrace pen".    There are

             several other comments about general matters in the west terrace.


             At a meeting at the Police Sports and Social Club at Niagra, Sheffield,

             the Officer Working Party on 13th November (3.128) considered the Club's

             proposals in relation to various projects at the stadium.    It was also

             noted that the Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the

             merging of spectators at the Leppings Lane.    The Working Party noted that

             it was difficult to see how this could be overcome as any physical

             restraint could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present

             situation to continue.   When notified of these problems by the County

             Council in a letter of 14th November (3.129) they found it very difficult

             It was noted that there was some cracked brickwork at the rear of the west

             stand and that there were damaged angled support brackets to the pitch

             security fence at the front of Leppings Lane terrace, at an Officer

             Working Party inspection of the stadium on 9th August, 1984 (3.59). It was

             also noted that the wire mesh barriers on the north west terrace had been

             successfully test loaded.


       l&d, There was some discussion at an Officer Working Party meeting on 23rd

             January, 1985 (3.77) about the segregation of home and visiting supporters

             at the rear of the west stand at certain matches                                s— -— (-suc±i-as—x?tTh{

                                          by erecting temporary barriers.                   It was noted that it

             was policy of the Police to aim for the exclusive use by visiting

             supporters of the west stand and terrace.                           The Working Party agreed that

             the Club should consider a scheme for permanent barriers at the rear of

             the stand subject to the necessary approvals.                            It was also noted that the

             cracked brickwork previously mentioned should continue to be monitored and

             that the apparent rusting of steel columns at the rear of the stand should

             receive appropriate treatment.

                       County Council on the advice of the various interested parties to be

                       necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of spectators at the

                       sports ground.    There is no evidence from the files that the Certificate

                       Holder or any other interested party has appealed to the Secretary of

                       State (up to 1st January, 1988) or to a Magistrates' Court (thereafter) in

                       respect of the Certificate Conditions.


     lOy        }*'   Section 2(4) of the^Act indicates that the Safety Certificate must have

^                     attached to it a plan and the terms and conditions must be framed by

                       reference to it, where appropriate.       Paragraph 5 of the General Safety

                      Certificate refers to plans.        Under Schedule 1 of the Certificate, the

                      definition of plans is "document or documents attached to and forming part

                      of the General Safety Certificate and signed by the person signing the

                      Certificate".     When the files were handed over to the Sheffield City

                      Council in April, 1986 a copy of the General Safety Certificate for

                      Hillsborough was in an envelope, together with a number of plans, none of

                      which were signed by Mr. Mallett (the original signatory of the

                      Certificate).     The original Safety Certificate and plans are lodged with

                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited (the Holder).

                      copied to the Police, the Fire Authority and the Building Authority.

                      Sheffield Wednesday applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September,

                      1978   (1.79).   Copies of the application were sent to the Building

                      Authority, the Police and the Fire Service on 13th September, 1978 (1.81,

                     complied with.         There was no formal notice issued by the County Council

                     requiring the Holder to supply further information to enable it (the

                     Council) to determine the terms and conditions of a Certificate.                              The

                     matter was dealt with in lengthy correspondence and by consultation.

                     application for the grant, amendment or replacement . . . may be inspected

                  resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

                  Certificate by replacing Conditions 10 and 26 of the Safety Certificate.

                  The amended Condition 10 contains slight wording differences to the
                                                                                            v v /v p?

                  from the file that these revised conditions were in fact properly brought

                  into effect.


                 At a meeting on 21st August, 1986 (3.171) the City Council's General
     |q Q
                  Purposes Panel resolved to amend the capacity of the Spion Kop at

                  Sheffield Wednesday to 21,000 spectators.              The Panel agreed to amend the

                 Certificate on the basis of a number of conditions, one of which related

                 to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until such certain works

                 on crush barriers on the new spion kop were completed.                   This condition

                 related to two matches.          The amendment to the Certificate only affected

                 the capacity at the Spion Kop end of the ground and had no effect

                 whatsoever on any other parts of the ground.               The   Inquiry has prompted a

                 review of this amendment and it transpires thatno notice                   was inserted in

                 a newspaper in connection with this amendment; as previously rehearsed the

                 notice would have set out the amendment and detailed where the Certificate

                 activity to include Royal visits.            Again, the notice provisions of the

                 legislation were not observed.

              the terms and conditions in a Certificate and the Council's refusal to

     109.     The Council as Certificating Authority may issue a Prohibition Notice
    \\r       under Section 10 of the Act if it feels there is a serious risk to

              spectator safety.   No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of

              Sheffield Wednesday.


     i& r .   It is the duty of the Council under Section 10B(1) of the Act to arrange
        Ii*
              for the inspection of stadia at least once every 12 months.     At its

              meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel noted the

              details contained in a report by the Head of Administration and Legal

              Department about the operation of the Council's certification function for

              the safety of sports grounds.   One of the details mentioned in the report

              relates to inspections and the proposal that one large scale inspection

              per stadium should be carried out.     In fact the report itself does not

              make clear my intention that these inspections should be annual.     My

    V         intention at the time, and the Council's practice^has beenj to arrange

              annual inspections of stadia.   The report goes on to indicate that these

              inspections would be backed up by a series of "during event" inspections

              which proposal was in line with both the Popplewell Report and with

              licensing practice in other areas.     1 am aware that the Fire Service

     V                  visit the sports ground and of course the Police are present

              during most specified activities.

                 Response to comments made by the Treasury Solicitor in a letter dated the
                 9th May, 1989

                 Potential Danger on the Leppings Lane Terraces


     IP9.        In the earlier part of my statement I refer to the full history of

                 discussions and decisions between the interested parties (the Police, Fire

                 Service, the Building Authority and the Club, and its Consulting

         '       Engineers) leading up to^the installation of the radial fences on the

                 Leppings Lane terrace.    It will be recalled that the installation of

    )(           fences took place in two distinct stages in 198^ and 1985.            The result   of

                 these discussions and decisions is the creation of the pens at the

                 Leppings Lane terrace.    It is clear from the correspondence on file, which

                 is particularly referred to in my statement, that the fences were erected

                 only after careful and thorough consideration by the appropriately

                 qualified experts.   The- e-rig'lTial— radial fo-
                                                                 ncing scheme in 4981—wpg—

                 introduced in order to prevent a repeat of the problems^wtrfch led to

                 spectator injury at an F .A.    Cup Semi-Finaljla*€ffin April, 1981.         It

X                appears from the file corresponderje«^that on that occasion spectators

                 became involved in later^i^movement along the length of the terrace which

                 resulted in inmri^s.     The radial fences which were installed in 1981 had

                 1.15 met^^wide gates at the rear of them and were subject to the

                            ■tha-6— the- gates— should be-under Police cont-rolr;— ■


    J    I   n      early 1985 the Club, via their Consulting Engineers, Messrs. Eastwoods

                 & Partners, submitted proposals to alter the Leppings Lane end of the

                 ground and to construct two new radial fences on the Leppings Lane

                 terrace.   I propose to deal with only the radial fences at this stage.

                 The reasons for the additional fences on the Leppings Lane terrace involve

                 the better supervision by the Police of spectators, both entering and

                 leaving the sports ground.     Once again, full and careful consideration was

                 given to the proposals by the County Council involving the Police, the

                 Fire Service, the Building Authority, the Club and its Consulting

                 There is no clear record on the files as to when the pitch perimeter fence

                 at Hillsborough was in fact installed, but it appears to have been in

                 place when the County Council first looked at the stadium from the point,

                 of view of a Certificating Authority.


                 According to the files, the pitch perimeter gates at Leppings Lane were
m
                 next considered in 1985 when the second radial barrier development was

                 considered.              It was agreed by the Officer Working Party and the Club and

                 its representatives that one pitch perimeter fence gate was to be provided

                 per ^en.

                            signing depends on who Ls being addressed by the sign; if the

                            pitch perimeter fence gates were not designed as a primary

                            emergency evacuation rcute use then it would obviously not be

                            appropriate to sign them for that purpose as it would possibly

                            divert spectators from better and possible closer exits, which are

                            at the rear of the pens.                   If the signing on the gates is purely

              take advice, either from the Club or the Police.               Obviously, where exit

              routes need to be signed, the Fire Service also has an involvement.                 There

              is no record on any of the files that there was any inadequacy in signing

              arrangements for the             terrace at Leppings Lane and had it been a

              significant factor I            would have expected that the matter would have been

              brought up by the Police or the Club.              The provision of signing is not

              usually a complex or             expensive task.   It must be borne in mind that the

              direction of spectators on match days is               largely the responsibility of

              stewards with some involvement from the Police.


              The siting/strength of crush barriers in the pen

   1-2T.      On 7th August, 1986, the             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was subject
   I 7 J'i,
              to an annual inspection.              During the course of this annual inspection I

              recall that the Police representative requested that crush barrier number

              144 be reduced so that the persons entering the terrace from the tunnel

              would not be obstructed by it.             Apparently, there had been some

              difficulties in this area.             The barrier itself penetrated the central

              radial fence immediately in front of the tunnel.               The barrier was indeed

              removed with the result that barrier 144 now contains only one section,

    ^         that is in the north central pen (see plan 1610/64E).              The dec4Ls4tis==m=&he

              Engineers.       No problems with this revised barrier arrangement have been

              brought to my attention.


              I should, however, point out that no written record of the decision to

   IJo        remove the barrier is noted on the file.               I can, however, say that I

     yC       the remember the d-ee-is-iem and that none of the persons present objected to

              the removal of the barrier.

                   remedied during 1988.               All the barriers in the two central pens were

                   tested and found to meet the Green Guide^standards.

                   The Access Tunnel to the Leppings Lane Terrace

             not obstruct this access.         I understand that the Fire Service only require

             vehicular access to the exterior of each building in the football ground,

             (see 3.141).      The Officer Working Party at a meeting on 12th November,

             1979 (1.196) agreed that whilst no real problems had occurred in the past

             the Club would in consultation with the Fire Service and the Police mark

             out a lane from the main gates to the south stand in which parking would

yj 12$'      During the planning stage for the redevelopment of the kop, the Club

             offered (letter from Eastwoods 29th November, 1985 - 3.130) to widen the

             gangway between the north stand and the retaining wall of the kop to

             enable fire engines to get to the pitch area.            The Fire Service responded

             to this at an Officer Working Party meeting (22nd January, 1986 - 3.141)

             by saying that whilst they felt that such a facility was not essential for

             their purposes it could be useful for use by emergency vehicles in certain

             situations and should generally be supported.           Towards the end of 1986,

             (letter from Eastwoods 18th December, 1986 - 3.210) the Club submitted

             proposals for creating a new entrance to the Sports Hall off Penistone

             Road so that the public would no longer have to use gate 'O', (Plan Mo.

             ).   Another     purpose of the development was to provide separate access for

             Police vehicles, ambulances, etc.         on match days; the proposal effectively

             reduced dangers which could result from vehicles having to pass

             spectators to gate 'O'.       This development did take place.         As I

             am not aware of the evidence on which the criticism about emergency

             vehicle access      is based, it is difficult to comment further.          Obviously,

             if that evidence is forthcoming, I can give further consideration to this

             question.      I understand that meetings have taken place between the Police,

              advice on first aid facilities at Sheffield Wednesday.       The Area Health

              Authority responded on 31st May, 1979 (1.151) with a list of requirements.

              References are made in the list to two or three treatment couches; six

              stretchers, two sets of stretcher wheels, 20 blankets, six pillows and one

             minute man resuscitator.     Other comments are made about water

              requirements, lighting, etc.   On 15th August, 1979 (1.170) the Officer

             Working Party requested the Club to provide a first aid permanent

             structure during the 1980 closed season, subject to the Club agreeing to

             provide the recommended first aid equipment immediately.


             On 21st December, 1979 (1.211) the County Council wrote to Sheffield

    ^        Wednesday indicating that the existing first aid facilities w e        accepted

             on an interim basis only pending the erection of purpose built facilites

             in the 1980 closed season.    On 20th April, 1982 (2.132) the County Council

             wrote to Sheffield Wednesday following an Officer Working Party meeting at

             which the Club’s outline drawing for new Police and first aid facilities

             was considered.   As far as the first aid facilities were concerned, four

             comments were made:-

             (a)   The walls of the first aid room should be lined with a suitable
                   non-combustible and easily cleaned material, which would not need to
                   be redecorated.

             (b)   Lockable storage facilities for blankets, stretchers, etc. were to be
                   provided.

             (c)   A telephone point was to be provided in the first aid room.

             (d)   The floor was to be of easily cleanable material (such as quarry
                   tiles, etc.)                                              M    7

                 The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 21st February, 1983 (3.11)
       1^0
                 noted that the new Police and first aid      facilities under the north stand

                 had been welcomed by the users and were      proving to be most useful.

                 Following the Popplewell interim report, the County Council wrote to

                 Sheffield Wednesday on 9th August, 1985 (3.112) and drew attention to the

                 necessity of providing adequate first aid and first aid room facilities.

                 Attention was also drawn to Condition 8      of the Safety Certificate.   In

                 December, 1987 (4.53 and 4.54) the City      Council wrote to Sheffield

                 Wednesday in response to the annual inspection which took place on 6th

                 August, 1987.    It was noted on a schedule attached to the notification

                 letter to Sheffield Wednesday that "The main first aid rooms requires to

                 be supplied with adequate first aid equipment for the treatment of

                 spectators . . . "   It was also mentioned that the provision of qualified

                 first aiders was being reviewed and that the views of the Club on this

                 subject were sought.

                 23rd October, 1987, ( ).    Management responsibility (x) is "to

                 provide first aid facilities and first aid staff".

         Statement of David Malcolm Bownes, Chief Licensing Officer, Administration
         and Legal Department, Sheffield City Council______________________ ______

         INTRODUCTION

   1.    My name is David Malcolm Bownes.       I am   employed by Sheffield City Council

             in the Administration and Legal Department as Chief Licensing Officer.


    2.   I have been employed by Sheffield CityCouncil since September, 1971 and

             have held my current post since 11th July, 1977.


    3.   I obtained a Higher National Certificate in Public        Administration from

             Sheffield City Polytechnic in June, 1976.


    4.   The responsibilities of my job are:-

             (a)    to manage the Licensing Section;


             (b) to provide reports on licensing matters for departmental management

                    and committees and to institute, maintain and operate proper

                    procedures to ensure that all relevant matters are brought to the

                    attention of any committee or Officer of the Council required to make

                    a decision on any licensing matter;


             (c)    to liaise with Council members, other departments of the Council and

                    outside bodies on all matters affecting the   Licensing Section;


             (d) to maintain a service to the general public      on licensing matters,

                    including dealing with enquiries and correspondence;


             (e)    in so far as possible to ensure that the requirements imposed upon

                    licensees by law and by Licence Conditions are complied with, and in

                    this connection to co-ordinate the activities of the Council's

                    Officers and the Police, Fire and other relevant authorities;


              (f)   to be responsible for all monies received by the Licensing Section

                    and to maintain proper records to the satisfaction of the City

                    Treasurer;
HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                    -2 -



         (g)        to take statements and prepare reports on any matters where legal

                    proceedings may be contemplated and to appear in any court

                    proceedings which involve the Council's licensing function;


         (h)        responsibility for implementation of the Safety of Sports Grounds

                    licensing system;


             (i)    to assimilate and implement the increasing items of new legislation

                    relevant to the Council's licensing functions, which is both varied

                    and complex.


    5.       The Licensing Section deals with 33 licensing systems, for example,

             those involving taxis and private hire vehicles, operators and drivers,

             cinemas, theatres and places of public entertainment.


             Legislation

    6.       On 1st August, 1975 Royal Assent was given to the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Act 1975 which established a "Certification" system for sports grounds

             capable of holding more than 10,000 spectators.    When a sports ground had

             been designated by the Secretary of State and application would need to be

             made to the Certificating Authority for a General Safety Certificate under

             the 1975 Act.


    7.       At the time the Safety Certificate was granted in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday Football Club the South Yorkshire County Council was obliged to

             attach to a Safety Certificate such terms and conditions as they

             considered necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety at the

             stadium when it is in use for specified activities.     These requirements

             were later amended by the 1987 Act.     The terms and conditions had to

              include

              (a)    The maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium and;

              (b)    Terms and conditions as to the number, size and situation of

                     entrances to and exits from the stadium and the means of access to


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                   -3-


                any such entrances or exits and requiring those entrances, exits and

                means of access to be properly maintained and kept free from

                obstruction and as to the number, strength and situation of any

                 crush barriers.


   8.    Certificate conditions must also be framed with reference to a plan

         attached to the Certificate.


   9.    Section 10 of 1975 Act provided for an emergency procedure which could be

         used by the Council if it thought that a serious risk to spectators at a

         sports ground was present.        The procedure involved applying to a

         Magistrates' Court for an Order prohibiting or restricting the admission

         of spectators to the sports ground.


  10.    Under Section 11 of the 1975 Act the person authorised by the Local

         Authority or the Chief Officer of Police, or the Building Authority, or

         the Secretary of State, could on production of his authority enter a

         sports ground to make inspections and examine records and make enquiries

             as he thought fit.     On Local Government Reorganisation on 1st April, 1986

             (when the South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its functions

             passed in the main to District Councils) the reference to the Building

             Authority was changed to the Fire Authority.


   11.       In 1976 the Home Office issued the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

             (Football)" which is a guide to measures for improving spectator safety at

             Football Grounds, i.e., at rugby union and rugby league grounds as well as

             at soccer grounds.     It is a voluntary code.    The Green Guide makes

             comments on such matters as the spacing of crush barriers, estimation of

             safe ground capacity, terraces, etc.        The Guide makes the point that

             deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily

             detracting from the overall safety of the ground.        A flexible approach

             should be maintained to take account of the particular circumstances at

              individual grounds.

HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                    -4-


             A revised edition of the Green Guide was issued in 1986 following the

             Bradford Disaster and the Popplewell Inquiry.     The scope of the Green

             Guide having been extended to cover measures for improving spectator

             safety at sports grounds generally.     The earlier (1976) edition referred

             to football grounds although much of the guidance contained in the revised

             Green Guide has particular application to football stadia.


   12.       The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended the 1975

             legislation in a number of areas.     In particular, the old Section 10 of

             the 1975 Act was replaced by a more wide ranging provision which gave

             local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition Notice in respect of

             either whole stadia or parts of them.     A Prohibition Notice can only be

             issued where the Local Authority is of the opinion that a serious risk to

             spectators is present in the stadium.     A Prohibition Notice may include

             directions as to the steps which will have to be taken to reduce the risk

             to a reasonable level and these may require alterations or additions to

             the ground or things to be done or omitted, which would contravene the

             terms or conditions of a Safety Certificate for the ground or for any

             stand at the ground.   A prohibition or restriction contained in a Notice

             may take effect immediately if there appears to be reason for it, or after

             a specified period contained in the Notice.     An appeal may be lodged with

             the Magistrates' Court against a Prohibition Notice but that appeal does

             not stop its operation.     The Court may either cancel or affirm the Notice.


    13.      In the new Section 10B of the Act it is the duty of each Certificating

             Authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations made under

             it and also to carry out an inspection of each designated sports ground

             at least once every 12 months and to act in accordance with guidance given

             to them by the Secretary of State.


    14.      The 1987 Act also made provision for Safety Certificates for various

             stands at sports grounds.     Also, in order to give effect to various


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                  -5-


         Popplewell comments on indoor sporting activities, the definition of

         public entertainment which require licensing was extended.


  15.    The Safety of Sports Ground Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument

         1987/1941) sets out the prescribed form of application for a Safety

         Certificate and also refers to appeal procedures, etc.


         Home Office Circulars

   16.   Home Office Circular 71/1987 introduced the provisions of Part 2 of the

             1987 Act and gives advice on the effects and operation of them.   There is

             also specific references to the new Prohibition Notice procedure and a

             draft Prohibition Notice.


   17.   Home Office Circular 72/1987 sets out the Statutory Guidance on

             inspections which is mandatory.


             Administration of the Certificating Function by South Yorkshire County
             Council

   18.   The County Council set up an "Officer Working Party" (Sheffield District)"

             which consisted of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the

             Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the South Yorkshire County

             Council Administration Department.   This Working Party was set up

             following a report to the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee on

             8th January, 1976.


   19.   In the early part of 1976 discussions took place between the South

             Yorkshire County Council and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about

             the possibility of certification in view of the commencement of the Safety

             of Sports Grounds Act on 1st September, 1975.   On 30th March, 1977 the

             South Yorkshire Police became involved in the discussions and wrote

             to the Home Officer indicating that they felt certification should be

             considered when the matter was next reviewed, owing to the large scale

              events that were held at Hillsborough.



HB4AAA/JJJ
At a football match held on Saturday, 23rd April, 1977 there was some

trouble at Hillsborough involving some injuries and a number of arrests.

This prompted further discussions about certification and the involvement

of the Fire Service Committee of the County Council as well as the Police.

At the meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council on 27th April, 1977

questions relating to the problems at the football match were raised and a

specific complaint was later made by a member of the public in connection

with an incident that allegedly took place at the Leppings Lane end of

the ground.


The Chief Constable subsequently agreed to take up the designation

question once again with the Home Office.    On 24th August, 1977 the Home

Office wrote to the Chief Constable stating that the case for designation

of Sheffield Wednesday was not overwhelming and that the Home Office was

not minded for the time being - but they would reconsider the matter

later.


The County Council continued to press the case for designation with the

Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had

been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards

of safety within the ground.   The Home Office once again declined to

designate this stadium.


The South Yorkshire County Council Fire Service Committee at its meeting

on              decided to set up an administrative system for safety of

sports grounds which involved the setting up of Officer Working Parties to

discuss safety of sports grounds matters in respect of particular stadia.

There were four such Working Parties, one covering Sheffield, one

Rotherham, one Barnsley and one Doncaster.


In April, 1978 the County Council prepared and submitted a lengthy paper

to the Home Office on the case for designating the Hillsborough Stadium
                                                     -7-


         under the 1975 Act.


   25.   The Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 1978 (Statutory

         Instrument 1978 No. 1091) designated the Sheffield Wednesday Football

         Stadium as requiring a Safety Certificate with effect from 1st January,

             1979.

   26.   In August of 1978, the Home Office wrote to the County Council

             .................................      indicating that they would recommend to

             the Home Secretary that an order be made        ........... Hillsborough in

             due course.      The County Council then began the Safety Certificate drafting

             exercise.     The exercise was carried on in consultation with the Police,

             the Fire Service and the Club.


   27.   The Club applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September, 1978.         The

             stadium itself was designated on 1st January, 1979.


             The Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

   28.   In support of the Club's application, a report was submitted to the County

             Council by Messrs. Eastwoods & Partners, Consulting Engineers, in January,

             1979 which dealt with questions of ground capacity at the stadium.      The

             report " . . .    deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening and

             supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and calculations

             are made of theoretical exit times . . . "     All the stands and terraces

             were dealt with in the report.      Page 4 of the report indicates that the

             west terrace (which is at the Leppings Lane end) has a total area of some

             1,480 square metres, but there are no gangways.      It is suggested that the

             full area would justify about 8,000 spectators, but after making allowance

             for gangways a capacity of 7,200 would perhaps be more reasonable.      The

             report says that the barriers should be designed to match this figure and

             that those barriers which could not withstand test load should be

             appropriately strengthened and extra ones provided where necessary.

             Proposed extra barriers were shown on drawing 1610/2X.      The three exits


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                   -8 -



             from the west terrace have a total width of about 11.5 metres which would

             permit some 1,250 per minute to leave the terrace.       The terrace could,

             therefore, be emptied in about 6 minutes.      The report goes on that the

             Guide suggests that everyone on the terrace should be within 12 metres of

             a gangway or exit; the report notes that there are no gangways and some

             spectators would be 25 metres from an exit.       The report goes on to say

             that this is felt of no consequence as movement horizontally along the

             terrace will be easy and quick.


    29.      The north west corner reinforced concrete terrace is also referred to in

             the report which is noted as covering an area of approximately 565 square

             metres.   The recommended number of spectators was 2,900, bringing the

             total standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.       It was also noted that

             the exits serving the north west terrace were adequate and emptying should

             take place within 8 minutes.   The significance of the 8 minute time

             relates to the recommended maximum time for a departure of spectators from

             a terraced area of a football stadium.       This recommendation is contained

             in the original "Green Guide" at Paragraph 8.       On the last page of the

             report, a recommended future ground capacity of some 50,100 spectators

             (consisting of approximately 24,000 seated spectators, 16,000 standing on

             the spion kop and 10,100 at the Leppings Lane end). (1.113A)


    30.      Following the submission of Eastwoods' report to the County Council there

             was a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) on 12th

             February, 1979 at which the west terrace and north west corner reinforced

             concrete terrace were discussed.   As far as the west terrace was concerned

             it was agreed that ". . . i n view of the lack of depth of this terrace,

             the Club's offer to reduce the spectator limit to 7,200 and the discharge

             of 6.6 minutes, the Working Party agree that it will be unreasonable to

             insist that gangways or additional exits must be provided."       The Working

             Party also noted that special attention would be required to the crush

             barriers in addition to the ordinary testing in view of the apparent sharp

HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                   -9-


         edges, corrosion, etc.       The Working Party agreed that there were no real

         problems with the north west terrace but reference is made to the

             corrugated sheeting would be required to pass the appropriate tests, along

         with the crush barriers.


   31.       On 30th March, 1979, the Officer Working Party considered further the

             question of the west terrace and the north west terrace.   As to the west

             terrace it was noted that the terracing in small areas near to the stand

             was in poor condition and that the cross-fall on the steps on the north

             west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw people

             forward.    The height of the crush barriers was also mentioned as being

             below the Guide recommendations.    The Working Party agreed that these

             points should be drawn to the attention of the Club.    As far as the north

             west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now took the view that

             the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in order to meet the

             requirements of the Green Guide.


   32.       On 2nd April, 1979 the Officer Working Party visited Sheffield Wednesday

             and a joint meeting was held with the Club representatives.    The Working

             Party agreed that the Club's proposals (including a capacity limit of

             7,200 spectators) was acceptable, without the need for additional

             gangways.    It was also agreed that the question of the cross-fall on the

             steps on the north west corner exit, the height of some of the existing

             crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp edges in places,

             should be the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the

             Building Surveyor.    The Clulb's proposals in respect to the north west

             terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900 and the

              improvement and addition of some new barriers.   It was also agreed that

              the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting should

             be subject to discussion between the Building Surveyor and Dr. Eastwood.

              (1.139).

  33.    On 18th April, 1979, a joint meeting of the Officer Working Party was held

         at Sheffield Wednesday.        The meeting was held to further discuss the

         proposals in relation to Sheffield Wednesday at the Hillsborough Stadium.

         The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club accepted that the

         cross-fall steps should be rebuilt and that the other matters previously

         raised will be reconsidered after it was seen which of the crush barriers

             failed on testing.   It was accepted the need for improvement or

             replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace,

             the Club wished to consider whether more extensive works could be

             initiated so as to bring in an existing unused area for the accommodation

             of further spectators.


   34.       On 1st May, 1978 (1.148) the Sheffield City Council's Building Surveyor

             wrote to the County Council indicating that as far as the west terrace was

             concerned, the downward slope of the exit steps needed to be corrected and

             that the limitation in capacity should remain.   It was noted that, on the

             north west terrace, the replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear

             was required, as was the removal of understrength barriers and a

             replacement by new ones constructed to Guide recommentations.


   35.       On 16th May, 1979 (1.149) the Chief Fire Officer wrote to the County

             Council with a work schedule in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.     It is

             noted that the west and north west terrace exit routes were regarded as

             satisfactory.   It was noted that the capacity of the west terrace was

             7,200 persons and that of the north west terrace of 2,900 persons.


   36.       As a result of these consultations between the Working Party and the Club

             on 8th June, 1979 a list of "Matters requiring attention at the Sheffield

             Wednesday Football Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield" was sent to the Club

             for its attention.    (1.152)


   37.       On 8th June, 1979 the County Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday (1.152A)

              enclosing a schedule detailing the works required to be carried out at

HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                 -1 1 -


             Sheffield Wednesday in order to secure reasonable safety at the ground.

             It was noted in the letter that 11. . . after the Club has had the

             opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps you would let me know

             which of the requirements you feel will be able to be carried out in the

             closed season . . .".   The list of requirements contain references to the

             north west terrace and replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear

             of it is required.   The removal of the understrength barriers and their

             replacement by new ones constructed to Guide recommendations and the

             provision of additional barriers was also required.   It was noted that the

             downward slope of the exit steps on the west terrace was to be corrected

             and that the capacity limit of 7,200 was to be fixed and that additional

             barriers were to be provided.   The schedule also confirmed the proposed

             capacities for the stadium and noted that the west terrace would have

             7,200 spectators and the north west terrace, 2,900.


   38.   On 15th August, 1979 (1.170) the Officer Working Party met again to

             consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review the

             progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th

             July.   It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

             corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


   39.   On 19th September, 1979 (1.173) Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County

             Council about the emergency lighting installation in the stadium.

             Eastwoods are proposing in the letter that new emergency circuits and

             fittings be installed in areas of the stadium including the north west

             terrace, the south west terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.


   40.   Between 31st October, 1979 and 12th November of the same year, there was

             correspondence between Eastwoods and the County Council about the

             corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.    It was finally

             agreed that a horizontal timber member should be fixed to the front of the

             corrugated sheeting to improve its safety to an acceptable level.     (1.188,


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                  -1 2 -



             1.194, 1.195 and 1.196).


   41.       The County Fire Services Committee of the South Yorkshire County Council

             at its meeting on 29th November, 1979 approved the issue of a General

             Safety Certificate and the terms and conditions of that Certificate to

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.   This decision was ratified by the full

             County Council meeting on 19th December, 1979.      The grant of a Certificate

             was made subject to remedial works to the south stand steel columns and

             the emergency lighting system being carried out.      The Safety Certificate

             document itself was issued on 21st December, 1979 under the signature of

             Mr. F. A. Mallett, the Chief Executive of the County Council       (1.211).


    42.      The Certificate is attached to this Statement.


    43.      The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) carried out regular

             inspections of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in accordance with the

             South Yorkshire County Council policy of twice yearly visits to football

             league grounds in South Yorkshire.   These visits are listed on page           of

             this Statement.   At the Working Party inspection on 11th August, there

             were two representatives from the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, two

             from the South Yorkshire Police, one from the South Yorkshire County Fire

             Service, two from the Sheffield City Council (Building Authority) and one

             from the South Yorkshire County Council Administration Department.       For

             illustrative purposes, I would refer to the last two paragraphs on the

             first page of the notes of the Working Party visit.       In the first of the

             two paragraphs it is clear that a problem in relation to the brickwork at

             the rear corner of the stand nearest the north west terrace had been

             raised at the previous meeting of the Working Party and this was further

             explored at the meeting on 11th August.       In the second paragraph, Dr.

             Eastwood (the Club's Consulting Engineer) gave details of testing of the

             crush barriers on the terrace and indicating that appropriate remedial

             action had been taken, where necessary and that the first five year cycle


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                   -13-

             of the barrier testing had thus been completed.


    44.      The County Council was made aware of various problems in connection with

             the use of the stadium.    An example as to how these matters were dealt

             with can be seen by reference to a letter from the South Yorkshire County

             Fire Service to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding a test

             which the Fire Service did of the emergency procedures at a match on 4th

             October, 1983.   (3.33).   There was particular concern that stewards could

             not hear the emergency procedure announcement on the public address

             system, which resulted in stewards failing to carry out their emergency

             procedure duties.     Consultations then took place between the Club and the

             Fire Officer with reference to the County Council which resulted in the

             satisfactory resultion of the public address system problem.           The system

             itself was checked and found satisfactory by the County Fire Service 29th

             October, 1983, the test proved satisfactory.        (3.34 and 3.37).


             Sheffield City Council as Certificating Authority (with effect from
             1st April, 1986)

    45.      At the meeting of the General Purposes Panel (which is a Sub-Committee of

             the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee of the

             City    Council) a report was considered from the Head of         Administration and

             Legal Department on Safety     of Sports Grounds.     The Panel adopted the

             recommendations contained in the report which were:-


             (a)    All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports

                    Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel.
                                                                  j
             (b)    The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be

                    delegated to the Head   of Administration and Legal       Department in

                    consultation with the   Chairman or Deputy Chairman       of this Panel orof

                    the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as

                    appropriate.


             (c)    The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                   -14-


                  delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.         The

                  Panel's decision was subsequently confirmed by a full meeting of the

                  City Council which took place on



    46.   The General Purposes Panel considered a more detailed report on the Act

             and the administrative system used by the County Council at the Panel's

             meeting on 6th May, 1986.     The full report is attached to this statement.


             Review of the Administrative System

    47.      At its meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel

             considered a report on the future administration of the Council's

             Certificating function.


    48.   The report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority, will

             act on the basis of advice from experts      (such as the Fire Service), the

             question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.       In this

             respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

             Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

             the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the

             Department of Health and Consumer Services.      Both the Building Surveyor's

             Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

             existing Council structure.     It was envisaged that the Working Group would

             function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most regular

             use would probably be the discussions of advice to the Council before they

             were finally formulated by the appropriate Authority.


   49.       It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

             request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

             Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

             list of items to be discussed.     At the conclusion of the meeting a further

             list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

             taken by each Authority would be noted.       It was then envisaged that


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                 -15-


         detailed written advise would be provided by each discipline and acted

         upon as appropriate.


  50.    The report went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

         Authority which follow.


         Authority                             Area of Responsibility

             The Building Surveyor,            All matters relating to the structure
             (Sheffield City Council)          of stadia, including crush barriers,
                                               walls, etc.

             South Yorkshire County            Fire precautions, fire alarms, means
             Fire Service                      of escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                               capacity.

             South Yorkshire Police            Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                               access of emergency vehicles and
                                               emergency planning.


   51.       It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

             would have an input into the Advisory Group on:- aspects of general

             safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items

             such as first aid requirements.   These lists were of course not

             exhausted and several of the functions overlapped.


   52.       The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

             that one large scale inspection per stadium per annum should be carried

             out per year.   It was noted that the proposal was in line with the

             Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other areas.


   53.       The Panel approved the revised administrative system which therefore came

             into effect immediately and delegated all routine matters in connection

             with that system to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.     The

             system remains in effect.


   54.       The report was seen in draft by all the interested Officers and its

             proposals modified in the light of comments made.    Prior to the

             preparation of the report the administrative system was discussed at

              length both at a meeting and in correspondence with Officer.

          Role of the Administration and Legal Department
          in the Certification System

  55.     The basic role of the Department is to co-ordinate the administration of

          the Certification System and also to keep the records of it.


  56.     An example of an Agenda and notes of the meeting are attached, dated 28th

          April, 1988, which shows the sort of items discussed at the Working Group.

             (5.13).

             Inspections of Sports Grounds

   57.    Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

             and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

             authorities.   Inspections take place annually.


   58.    Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

             Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and Consumer

             Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.     Often, the Club is

             represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

             another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

             The inspection is carried out by the various Officers who meet at the

             ground and then disperse to various areas in which their particular

             interest lies.


   59.    Communication is maintained by the Officers throughout the inspection and

             it is common for the Officers to draw points to each other's attention

             when they think fit.   Officers of   the Club are usuallypresent   and are

             sometimes referred to by Officers    by information.


   60.    If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

             taken to secure its rectification.    If rectification is not possible prior

              to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

              to issue a Prohibition Notice.


    61.       Officers at the conclusion of the inspection writeto the    Head of

HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                   -17-


             Administration and Legal Department setting out their comments on matters

             which ought to be raised with the Club, the stadium owners.    These are

             then collated and discussed with the Officers (sometimes at a Working

             Group) and finally formulated into a list which is sent to the Club for

             action.


   62.    As an example, a copy of Officers' comments following the 1987 inspection

             are attached to this Statement (              ).


   63.    The actual inspections of stadia usually comfortably exceed two man days

             per year.    This does not include the subsequent administrative work or the

             consideration of proposals submitted by stadium owners.    This figure is

             also to be contrasted with the assertion in Home Office Circular 72/1987

             that inspections are not expected to take more than about two man days per

             ground on average.


             The role of the Home Office

    64.      The   Home Office is the Central Government Department which is responsible

             for   safety of sports grounds.   Its functions can be described in brief as

             follows:


             (a)   To advise Parliament on legislation;

             (b)   To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
                   and to offer guidance;

             (c)   To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to
                   inspections); and

             (d) To issue the "Green Guide" which is an advisory document to assist
                  the improvement of safety standards at sports grounds.


             The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
             and the Popplewell Report

   65.       The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,

             1985 outlining the certification system in operation throughout the

             County.     The press release went on to say that the forthcoming "Summer"

              inspections will take into account the lessons of the recent tragic event


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                 -18-


         at Bradford and any revised advise and requirements which may be issued by

         the Home Office. (3.89).      On 13th May, 1985 the South Yorkshire County

         Council sent a letter to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday enclosing a

         copy of the press release and stressing that it is vitally necessary for

         safety stewards to be fully aware of and trained in their duties on the

         manning and opening of doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of

         fire fighting equipment. (3.90).


  66.    The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on

         9th August, 1985 which indicated that the Interim Report of the Popplewell

         Inquiry had been produced and advice had been received from the Home

             Office.   The letter drew attention to a review on the evacuation

             procedures in consultation with the Police and the Fire Service and also

             to the duties of safety stewards.   It was also indicated that the Police

             and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in training stewards.

             Detailed comments were also made about the first aid facilities at the

             stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.     There

             was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

             materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

             displayed. (3.112).   The Club responded to the County Council’s letter of

             14th August and comments were made about steward training procedures which

             were to be reviewed before the next home match.      (3.116).


   67.       The Sheffield City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday on 15th October,

             1987 referring to the revised Green Guide which had been published by H.

             M. Government following the Popplewell Report drawing attention to the new

             Guide and particularly to Chapter 2, which is entitled "Management

             Responsibility".   The letter asks Sheffield Wednesday to confirm in

             writing that the Club intends to retain a copy of the revised Green Guide

             on the premises and that they should take immediate steps to appoint a

              safety officer as defined in Chapter 2.   (4.47).    The Club responded to

              that letter on 23rd October, 1987 confirming that a copy of the Guide was


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                 -19-


         held at the stadium and that Mr. Mackrell was the Safety Officer.      (         )


*            On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of

             the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates that in the north west corner

             of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

             pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should

             be sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.   (2.29)


             On 10th February, 1981 the Officer Working Party met (2.52A) to inspect

             the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.   It was noted that the Club had received

             quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete at the north west

             terrace, which will be considered shortly.   The Working Party also heard

             the Club outline the consideration it was giving to the siting of caravans

             outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell

             tickets.   It was hoped that if this took place, increased entry flow of

             spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the

             turnstiles.

             The Semi-Final 1981 and Radial Fencing

   68.   On 7th April, 1981 the Officer Working Party (2.59) inspected the

             Sheffield Wednesday Stadium, bearing in mind that an F.A. Cup Semi-Final

             was to take place on 11th April, 1981.


   69.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club wrote to the County Council on 15th

             April, 1981 (2.61) outlining an incident which took place at the Leppings

             Lane end of the ground at the Semi-Final Match on 11th April, that year.

             It is noted that there was injuries to spectators because of crushing.

             The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it appears that the

             crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late due to

             travelling problems and rushing to their places after the game had

             commenced, thereby causing problems to spectators at the front of the

             terracing who had been in the ground for a considerable length of time.

             The turnstile readings were apparently 335 persons in excess of the

             capacity for Leppings Lane end which was the result of Tottenham fans

             having purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival at turnstile

             'N' (in Penistone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were

             directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

             were standing.   Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. John's

             Ambulance for minor ailments and at the Royal Hallamshire and Northern

             General Hospitals 8 spectators were treated.   According to the Police,

             three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

             unspecified injuries.   The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

             both inside and outside the stadium was very good.


   70.       On 22nd April, 1981 the Chief Executive of the County Council wrote to the

             Police asking for a copy of their report on the Semi-Final incident

             (2.62).


   71.       Mr. Brownlow, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, wrote to the

             Secretary of the Football Association on 3rd June, 1981 (          )


HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                      -2 1 -



         commenting in detail on the incident at the match on 11th April.                The

         Chief Constable starts by noting the basic facts relating to the stadium

         and indicating that there had been many similar Semi-Final matches at

         Hillsborough without previous incident.                The Police apparently envisaged

         difficulties prior to the match because both sets of supporters would need

             to use the Ml motorway.       There were a number of problems which slowed down

             the arrival of spectators, namely a major road accident, a coach breaking

             down and extensive road works.       These resulted in Tottenham Hotspur fans

             being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.            This all resulted in

                    .    .   a sudden influx of large numbers of football spectators to the

             area       of the ground at around the time for the start of the match .          . .


   72.   Mr. Brownlow went on to indicate that Tottenham Hotspur supporters managed

             to obtain tickets from Coventy City Football Club.             He noted that this

             completely defeated the spectator policy of putting opposing spectators at

             opposite ends of the football ground.             Apparently, neither participating

             football club told the Police or Sheffield Wednesday, or the Football

             Association about this situation and the mixing of supporters was not

             properly catered for.        Some 400 Tottenham fans had to be removed from the

             kop and accommodated in the Leppings Lane end.             This resulted in an over

             capacity situation at that end of the ground.


   73.   According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early

             took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

             the Leppings Lane enclosure " . . .      thereby creating a jamming effect and

             the extremeties of it . . ."        The later arrivals then caused a problem

             because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

             Hotspur had scored an early goal.        The resulting injuries included broken

             arms, legs and crushed ribs.        It is noted that some 38 people received

              treatment.       The pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane

              enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

             perimeter track to relieve pressure.          Police Officers also refused access

HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                -2 2 -



         to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

         the crushing problem.     In Mr. Brownlow's view, no other course of action

         could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


  74.    Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

         had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

         similar events.


         The installation of, and alterations to, the radial fences on the Leppings
         Lane terrace

  75.    Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 2nd September,

          1981 (2.80) indicating that ". . . we have been instructed by the Club to

          organise the installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the

          Leppings Lane end of the ground . . .          It was noted that the intention

             of these fences was to divide the terrace into approximately three equal

             areas, each served by its own entrance.     The object of dividing the

             terrace was to exercise more control over supporters and for example, a

             visiting team with only a few followers would be allocated one section

             with the other two sections retained for home suppoers.     A 1.15 metre wide

             gate was proposed at the rear of each fence, to give access for

             maintenance and also policing during the game.     The gates could be Left

             open, but fastened back to connect the areas during the game if

             appropriate. In order to preserve spectators' views Eastwoods recommended

             that the top of the fence should be approximately 1680 mm above the

             terrace.   It was noted that a fence of this height would not prevent

             individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should eliminate a

             mass "invasion" from one area to another.     Apparently, fences of this

             height worked successfully at St. James' Park (the Newcastle United

             ground).   The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2 and 3.


   76.       On 9th September, 1981 (2.85) Eastwoods wrote to the County Council

              indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in early October,

              subject to their being no objections from the Council.    Eastwoods

HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                    -23-


         indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be received by

         23rd, 24th or 25th September.


   77.       The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September (2.87)

             considered the question of the proposed new radial barriers on the west

             terrace.   It was noted that there were drawbacks to the division of the

             terrace into three equal areas, but the Working Party felt that increased

             control on the terrace should result. A "for instance" was quoted in that

             there could well be problems with opposing fans mixing at the rear of the

             west stand and/or the final exit gates, but the Police considered that

             they could cope with these problems.


   78.       The adequacy and positioning of the gates was discussed as well as the use

             of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.      It was noted that the

             plans did not indicate the headroom which would be available at the rear

             of the terrace should the radial barriers and gates be installed.      The

             Working Party agreed that there was no objection to the proposals subject

             to further calculations as required by the Building Authority being

             satisfactory, confirmation of the headroom at the rear of the terrace and

             those gates being under Police control.       The County Council wrote to

             Eastwoods confirming the Working Party views on 14th September (2.83).          In

             a letter of 14th December, Eastwoods indicated that the works were now

             substantially complete (2.100).


   79.       The South Yorkshire Police wrote to the County Council on 18th January,

             1982 about, amongst other things, the new radial fencing at Leppings Lane.

             It is confirmed in the letter that the fences are working well, but since

             there have been no large games which resulted in the whole of the

             terracing being occupied by one group of fans.       The Chief Constable goes

              on to say that as crush barriers penetrate or come close to the new radial

              fencing, fans could climb over them.     Also, it was noted that there were

              some " . . .   dangerous pieces . . . " protruding from the cut off ends of


HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                  -24-


         some barrier rails.      (2.107)   The County Council wrote to Eastwood and

         Partners indicating that the radial fences appear to be working

             satisfactory and also outlining the Police views on them.   (2.108).

         Messrs. Eastwood and Partners wrote back to the County Council on 26th

             January, 1982 (2.110) acceping the possibility that fans could climb over

             the radial fence, but it would be unacceptable to leave a gap along side

             each radial fence completely free of crush barriers as that would present

             a major hazard.   The Police comment on the dangerous peices of rails is

             noted.


   80.   At an Officer Working Party meeting on 4th February, 1982 (2.117) the

             Police views on the barriers was again discussed.   It was however, agreed

             that the existing arrangement was necessary and the problem of fans

             climbing over from one pen to another would have to be lived with.     It was

             agreed to review the issue at the end of the current season.


   81.   Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 9th April, 1985

             (3.79) indicating that the Club was anxious to segregate visiting teams'

             supporters as they entered the ground and also, to enable the Police to

             control their exit at the end of the game.   A scheme showing a possible

             modification to the Leppings Lane end was prepared and shown on drawing

             6705/2 which involved the construction the two new banks of turnstiles and

             various runs of fencing and new gates.


   82.       The Officer Working Party considered these plans on 18th April (3.83).

             They were agreed, subject to a number of conditions.


   83.       Particular reference was made by the Working Party to the inclusion of two

             gates per radial fence.


   84.       On 30th April, 1985 (3.84) the Fire Service wrote to the County Council

              indicating that from a means of escape point of view, the scheme is

              satisfactory, providing the gates have minimum widths as indicated on the


HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                       -25-


             plan enclosed with the letter.        The Fire Service also mentioned that it

             was understood that these gates will be supervised either by the Police or

             Club officials.        The County Council on 2nd May transmitted its views to

             Messrs.        Eastwood & Partners by letter.    (3.85).


   85.   Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 8th May (3.87) and

             indicated that several of the points made had already been incorporated

             into the latest scheme.        Eastwoods say in the letter:- ".    .   . However I

             would ask that further consideration should be given to the request in

             paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to be installed in the

             radial barrier and for the new radial barrier which you have asked for to

             have two gates.        If these gates meant for use in emergency it would mean

             having a steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which

             would hardly be justified.        It is our view that in the event of emergency,

             spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the gates on to the pitch

             and by the normal exit gates at the rear.          We will of course be prepared

             to discuss the matter with the Fire Officer's staff should you so wish

                       II


   86.   The County Council sent a letter to Eastwoods on 10th May, 1985 (3.88)

             indicating that the Police were prepared to concede the request for two

             gates per radial fence, provided that the remainder of the points raised

             by the Officer Working Party were incorporated.


   87.   Eastwood & Partners submitted a detailed proposal for the revised layout

             of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th July (3.102).          Fourteen

             plans were included in the submission and it was considered by a meeting

             of the Officer Working Party on 29th July (3.103).          The Working Party

             accepted the proposals in principle, but made a number of comments which

             were transmitted to the Consulting Engineers by a letter of 30th July

              (3.104).       The comments were made by reference to the plans submitted:-

              (a)   Plan No. 6705/6 - "for both security access and emergency egress
                    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                  -26-


             (b) Plan No. 6705/8A - "the new handrail by turnstile 23 to be either
                  shortened or realigned so as to maintain the exit width between the
                  outer (river) wall and turnstile 23, and the exit width between
                  turnstile 16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of
                  the roller shutter gate between turnstiles 16 and 17";

             (f) Plan No. 6705/12 -   ". .. no barrier height indicated . . .";

             (i) Plan No. 6705/17 - "for both security access and emergency egress
                 purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

             (j) Stewarding of new gates - "as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
                  1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
                  stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained".


   88.       Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 1st August (3.109)

             and indicated that it might be easier for discussions to take place when

             the works are under construction.   It is also noted in the letter that the

             stewarding would no doubt be taken care of by Mr. Chester (the Sheffield

             Wednesday Club Secretary at that time).


    89.      The Officer Working Party visited Hillsborough on 7th August (3.111) and

             noted the progress of works to segregate supporters at the Leppings lane

             end of the ground and on the terrace.     The Working Party agreed "(b) that

             the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be extended

             or have steps to provide easy of access from the new two metre wide gap

             formed by the new radial fence; (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter

             fence should be provided from the south central terrace pen".     There are

             several other comments about general matters in the west terrace.


    90.      At a meeting at the Police   Sports and Social Club at Niagra, Sheffield,

             the Officer Working Party on 13th November (3.128) considered the Club's

             proposals in relation to various projects at the stadium.     It was also

             noted that the Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the

             merging of spectators at the Leppings Lane.     The Working Party noted that

             it was difficult to see how this could be overcome as any physical

             restraint could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present

             situation to continue.   When notified of these problems by the County

             Council in a letter of 14th November (3.129) they found it very difficult

HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                 -27-


             to envisage anything more which could be done at reasonable expense.


   91.       The Officer Working Party at its inspection of Sheffield Wednesday on 22nd

             January, 1986 (3.141) next considered the segregation arrangements at the

             Leppings Lane end.   The Police confirmed that the new arrangements worked

             well on by far the majority of occasions.     Other minor matters were

             referred to in relation to advertising hoardings, spalling concrete and

             the north west terrace.


   92.       Although there are few later references to the Leppings Lane terraces in

             the file, it should be remembered that the stadium was inspected annually.


             Other references to the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium 1981 to 1988

   93.       The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 24th August, 1982 (2.147) and

             a letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners of 27th August, 1982 (2.148)

             deal with some minor problems which did not apparently involve visitor

             spectators in the concrete at the north west terrace.     Similar problems

             were alluded to on 21st February, 1983 at a Working Party meeting. (3.11)


             On 8th September, 1982 the annual inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium

             was carried out by the Officer Working Party (2.150) and it was noted that

             the two radial fences had been installed on the Leppings Lane terrace.

             The fact that the crush barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace had been

             tested was noted by the Officer Working Party on 11th August, 1983

             (3.25) which testing had completed the first cycle of crush barrier

             testing at the stadium.   There was also mention of water seepage again at

             the north west terrace.   The former A.R.P.    building adjacent to the

             boundary wall near to Gate *C * of the Leppings Lane entrances to the

             stadium was in the process of being demolished when the Officer Working

             Party visited the stadium on 29th February, 1984 (3.41).     Once again,

             water seepage was noted on that day at the north west terrace.     In June,

             1984 the crush barriers at the north west corner were tested by the Club's

             Consulting Engineers (Eastwood & Partners) (3.52) and (3.54).

HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                  -28-


             It was noted that there was some cracked brickwork at the rear of the west

             stand and that there were damaged angled support brackets to the pitch

             security fence at   the front of Leppings Lane terrace, at an Officer

             Working Party inspection of the stadium on 9th August, 1984 (3.59). It was

             also noted that the wire mesh barriers on the north west terrace had been

             successfully test loaded.


             There was some discussion at an Officer Working Party meeting on 23rd

             January, 1985 (3.77) about the segregation of home and visiting supporters

             at the rear of the west stand at certain matches " . . .   (such as with

             Liverpool) . . ."by erecting temporary barriers.     It was noted that it

             was policy of the   Police to aim for the exclusive use by visiting

             supporters of thewest stand and terrace.    The Working Party agreed    that

             the Club should consider a scheme for permanent barriers at the rear of

             the stand subject to the necessary approvals.    It was also noted that the

             cracked brickwork previously mentioned should continue to be monitored and

             that the apparent rusting of steel columns at the rear of the stand should

             receive appropriate treatment.

                         THE CITY COUNCIL'S DUTIES AS CERTIFICATING AUTHORITY
                       UNDER THE ACT AS CARRIED OUT IN RELATION TO THE FOOTBALL
                           MATCH AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY ON 15TH APRIL, 1989



              Further Comments

    93.       At the time the current Safety Certificate was issued, the terms and

              conditions contained therein were those sought by the South Yorkshire

              County Council on the advice of the various interested parties to be

              necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of spectators at the

              sports ground.     There is no evidence from the files that the Certificate

             Holder or any other interested party has appealed to the Secretary of

              State (up to 1st January, 1988) or to a Magistrates' Court (thereafter) in

              respect of the Certificate Conditions.


    94.      Section 2(4) of the Act indicates that the Safety Certificate must have

             attached to it a plan and the terms and conditions must be framed by

             reference to it, where appropriate.      Paragraph 5 of the General Safety

             Certificate refers to plans.      Under Schedule 1 of the Certificate, the

             definition of plans is "document or documents attached to and forming part

             of the General Safety Certificate and signed by the person signing the

             Certificate".      When the files were handed over to the Sheffield City

             Council in April, 1986 a copy of the General Safety Certificate for

             Hillsborough was in an envelope, together with a number of plans, none of

             which were signed by Mr. Mallett (the original signatory of the

             Certificate).      The original Safety Certificate and plans are lodged with

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited (the Holder).


    95.      Under Section 3(3) of the Act applications for Certificates had to be

             copied to the Police, the Fire Authority and the Building Authority.

             Sheffield Wednesday applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September,

             1978 (1.79).      Copies of the application were sent to the Building

             Authority, the Police and the Fire Service on 13th September, 1978 (1.81,

             1.82 and 1.83) relating to consultations with other parties was also

HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                   -3 0 -



             complied with.    There was no formal notice issued by the County Council

             requiring the Holder to supply further information to enable it (the

             Council) to determine the terms and conditions of a Certificate.     The

             matter was dealt with in lengthy correspondence and by consultation.


   96.       The amendment and replacement of Certificates is governed by Section 4 of

             the Act and the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976, which were

             superseded on 1st January, 1988 by the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Regulations 1987.


   97.       The Act provides that a local authority may, if it feels it appropriate to

             do so, amend a Safety Certificate by notice in writing to its holder or

             replace it.     A Safety Certificate may be amended or replaced either with

             or without the application of the Holder of the Certificate.     Section 2 of

             the Act applies to the amendment or replacement of a Safety Certificate.

             Section 4(4) of the Act indicates that a notice under Section 4(1)(a)

             amending a General Safety Certificate shall specify the date on which the

             amendment to which it relates is to come into operation, and the date so

             specified may be a date later than the date of issue of the notice.        The

             Regulations make further provision with regard to the amendment of the

             Certificates.     Regulation 7 provides that where a local authority issues

             or amends the said Certificate it shall forthwith give notice in writing

             of the issue or amendment . . .    to all specified interested parties and

             any unspecified interested parties known to the local authority.     In

             addition, the local authority in giving notices must inform the persons to

             whom notice is given that a copy of the Safety Certificate and the

             application for the grant, amendment or replacement . . . may be inspected

             and where and at what time such inspection may be made.     In addition, the

             local authority must publish in a newspaper as soon as maybe after the

             amendment of the Certificate with the information referred to in the last

             sentence.

    98.      On 3rd September, 1981 the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

HB4AAC/JJJ
                                                 -31-


             resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

             Certificate by replacing Conditions 10 and 26 of the Safety Certificate.

             The amended Condition 10 contains slight wording differences to the

             original.   Condition 26 varied the time limits for the submission of

             electrical certificates to the Chief Fire Officer.    There is no evidence

             from the file that these revised conditions were in fact properly brought

             into effect.


   99.       At a meeting on 21st August, 1986 (3.171) the City Council's General

             Purposes Panel resolved to amend the capacity of the Spion Kop at

             Sheffield Wednesday to 21,000 spectators.   The Panel agreed to amend the

             Certificate on the basis of a number of conditions, one of which related

             to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until such certain works

             on crush barriers on the new spion kop were completed.    This condition

             related to two matches.   The amendment to the Certificate only affected

             the capacity at the Spion Kop end of the ground and had no effect

             whatsoever on any other parts of the ground.     The Inquiry has prompted a

             review of this amendment and it transpires that no notice was inserted in

             a newspaper in connection with this amendment; as previously rehearsed the

             notice would have set out the amendment and detailed where the Certificate

             could be inspected.   However, the Panel meeting itself was largely in

             public with all the interested parties present and its deliberations

             attracted considerable publicity.   A copy of a press report is attached to

             this Statement.   Additionally, the General Safety Certificate is regarded

             as a public document and it seems to me that the purpose of the

             legislation has been more than adequately met.


   100.      On 1st December, 1986 the General Purposes Panel resolved to amend

             Schedule 1 of the Certificate so as to extend the definition of specified

             activity to include Royal visits.   Again, the notice provisions of the

             legislation were not observed (3.208).




HB4AAC/JJJ

  101.       Under Section 5 of the Act interested parties may appeal against or about

             the terms and conditions in a Certificate and the Council's refusal to

             amend or replace it.   According to the files, there have been no appeals.


  102.       The Certificate Holder must give notice to the Council if he intends to

             alter or extend the sports ground or any of its installations (if that

             alteration or extension is likely to affect the safety of persons at the

             ground).   This Section has been complied with Sheffield Wednesday Football

             Club; the developments which have taken place have been the subject of

             lengthy correspondence in each case.


  103.       The Council as Certificating Authority may issue a Prohibition Notice

             under Section 10 of the Act if it feels there is a serious risk to

             spectator safety.   No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of

             Sheffield Wednesday.


  104.       It is the duty of the Council under Section 10B(1) of the Act to arrange

             for the inspection of stadia at least once every 12 months.    At its

             meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel noted the

             details contained in a report by the Head of Administration and Legal

             Department about the operation of the Council's certification function for

             the safety of sports grounds.   One of the details mentioned in the report

             relates to inspections and the proposal that one large scale inspection

             per stadium should be carried out.     In fact the report itself does not

             make clear my intention that these inspections should be annual.     My

             intention at the time, and the Council's practice has been, to arrange

             annual inspections of stadia.   The report goes on to indicate that these

             inspections would be backed up by a series of "during event" inspections

             which proposal was in line with both the Popplewell Report and with

             licensing practice in other areas.     I am aware that the Fire Service

             obviously visit the sports ground and of course the Police are present

             during most specified activities.

             The Safety Certificate

  105.       Under Conditon 1(1) of the Safety Certificate, the Holder's nominee must

             be approved in writing by the Council.        The purpose of having a nominee is

             so that he or she can be responsible for the Holder's obligation to take

             all reasonable precautions and exercise all due diligence to avoid the

             contravention of any term or condition of the Certificate (although the

             appointment of a nominee does not absolve the Holder from liability).


   106.      Currently, nominee is the Club Secretary.        On the 15th October, 1987,

             (4.47) the City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday pointing out various

             provisions of the new Green Guide and making particular reference to the

             appointment of a Safety Officer as defined in Chapter 2 of the Guide.

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic responded to this letter on 23rd

             October, and confirmed that Mr.     Mackrell's duties encompassed those of

             the Safety Officer and requesting that the Council's records be amended to

             note that he is responsible for all matters of safety within the ground.


   107.      Under Condition 8(1) of the Certificate the Holder is required to provide

             and maintain at the stadium, to the satisfaction of the Council, a

             suitably equipped first aid room.     The first aid room was installed and

             noted by the Officer Working Party to be in use on 21st February, 1983

             (3.11).   The question of first aid facilities was raised and discussed

             during 1987 and 1988 (4.54 and 4.60).


             Sheffield Wednesday - The Up to Date Position

   108.      On Wednesday, 10th May, 1989 the annual inspection of the ground

             commenced.   Police Officer, Fire Officers and Council Officers from the

             Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building Surveyor's Division

             and the Administration and Legal Department.        Detailed enquiries are being

             made of Sheffield Wednesday pursuant to the inspection.

             Response to comments made by the Treasury Solicitor in a letter dated the
             9th May, 1989

             Potential Danger on the Leppings Lane Terraces


   109.      In the earlier part of my statement I refer to the full history of

             discussions and decisions between the interested parties (the Police, Fire

             Service, the Building Authority and the Club, and its Consulting

             Engineers) leading up to the installation of the radial fences on the

             Leppings Lane terrace.    It will be recalled that the installation of

             fences took place in two distinct stages in 1982 and 1985.    The result of

             these discussions and decisions is the creation of the pens at the

             Leppings Lane terrace.    It is clear from the correspondence on file, which

             is particularly referred to in my statement, that the fences were erected

             only after careful and thorough consideration by the appropriately

             qualified experts.   The original radial fencing scheme in 1981 was

             introduced in order to prevent a repeat of the problems which led to

             spectator injury at an F.A.    Cup Semi-Final Match in April, 1981.   It

             appears from the file correspondence that on that occasion spectators

             became involved in lateral movement along the length of the terrace which

             resulted in injuries.    The radial fences which were installed in 1981 had

             1.15 metre wide gates at the rear of them and were subject to the

             conditions that the gates should be under Police control.


   110.      In early 1985 the C^ub, via their Consulting Engineers, Messrs. Eastwoods

             & Partners, submitted proposals to alter the Leppings Lane end of the

             ground and to construct two new radial fences on the Leppings Lane

             terrace.   I propose to deal with only the radial fences at this stage.

             The reasons for the additional fences on the Leppings Lane terrace involve

             the better supervision by the Police of spectators, both entering and

             leaving the sports ground.    Once again, full and careful consideration was

             given to the proposals by the County Council involving the Police, the

             Fire Service, the Building Authority, the Club and its Consulting


HB4AAD/JJJ
                                                   -36-


             Engineers.    There is correspondence on file dealing with the positioning,

             width and proposed stewarding of the gates in the radial fences.     Full

             details of these discussions are related in the earlier part of my

             statement.


   111.      As far as the Green Guide is concerned, paragraphs 101 to 103 (in Chapter

             8) refers to the division of spectator accommodation.    These paragraphs of

             the Guide are drafted in general terms, but it appears to me that the

             penning arrangement at Leppings Lane does not conflict with the general

             statements contained in the Guide.    I am, of course, mindful that the pens

             were constructed over a number of years, and were installed and approved

             in situation by all the interested parties I have already listed.


   112   .   Having had regard to the circumstances in which pens were installed (based

             on the evidence contained in the South Yorkshire County Council's files) I

             believe that the Leppings Lane terrace met the standards of reasonable

             safety for spectators as referred to in the Safety of Sports Grounds Act

             1975 as amended.


             Means of egress onto the pitch from the Leppings Lane Terrace

   113.      There is no clear record on the files as to when the pitch perimeter fence

             at Hillsborough was in fact installed, but it appears to have been in

             place when the County Council first looked at the stadium from the point

             of view of a Certificating Authority.


   114.      According to the files, the pitch perimeter gates at Leppings Lane were

             next considered in 1985 when the second radial barrier development was

             considered.   It was agreed by the Officer Working Party and the Club and

             its representatives that one pitch perimeter fence gate was to be provided

             per ten.

             NOTE : There is no information on the file about the signing of pitch

                       perimeter gates.    It seems to me that the whole question of

                       signing depends on who is being addressed by the sign; if the

                       pitch perimeter fence gates were not designed as a primary

                       emergency evacuation route use then it would obviously not be

                       appropriate to sign them for that purpose as it would possibly

                       divert spectators from better and possible closer exits, which are

                       at the rear of the pens.     If the signing on the gates is purely

                       for the emergency access, then it is adequate.      See paragraphs 214

                       to 216 of the Green Guide.


   115.      The means of access laterally between the pens on the Leppings Lane

             terrace are the gates at the top of each radial fence immediately adjacent

             to the west stand wall.      The gates are so designed so that when they are

             open a clear 1.15 metre opening remains.        At a match where there is no

             need for segregation of fans on the Leppings Lane terrace these gates

             would normally be padlocked in the open position to enable free movement

             between pens.   The gates should be attended either by stewards or the

             Police.    (See the letter from South Yorkshire County Council to Eastwood &

             Partners of 30th July, 1983 (3.104)).


   116.      There are no gangways as such on the Leppings Lane.       Annex 'A' of the

             Green Guide defines gangways as being channels for the passage of

             spectators through a terrace running across the slope (lateral gangway) or

             running with the slope (radial gangways).       Paragraph 96 of the Guide

             indicates that the aim should be to ensure that every spectator on the

             terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit so that they can move

             quickly on to exit routes at the end of an event or in the event of an

             emergency.   In fact, owing the the pen size, spectators within the

             Leppings Lane pen should not be more than 12 metres away from an exit.

             In January, 1979 Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners submitted a general report

             (1.113A) on capacities at the stadium and made several comments about the

             west terrace.   The report started by noting that there are no gangways on

             the terrace and that in Eastwoods' professional opinion some allowance

             should be made for circulation space as spectators have to move quite

             considerable horizontal distances to achieve good packing.       Eastwoods

             suggested that the full area would probably accommodate 8,000 spectators,

             but a 10% reduction would be appropriate (as the equivalent of gangways)

             giving a capacity of 7,200 spectators.       Eastwoods go on to say that some

             spectators would still be 25 metres from an exit, but it was felt that

             this was of no consequence as horizontal movement along the terrace would

             be easy and quick.    The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 12th

             February, 1979 accepted Eastwoods' views and noted the discharge time of

             some 6.6 minutes.    The Working Party felt that it would be unreasonable to

             insist on additional gangways or exits.


   118.      During the various alterations to the terrace in 1981 and 1985 these

             matters were reconsidered and provisions made for proper access to and

             egress from the new pens.    These arrangements were, as I have already

             mentioned, carefully considered and approved by all the interested

    1        parties.   (See page 21 of my statement).


             Directional Signs in relation to access to the ground

   119.      There has been criticism about the adequacy of directional signs within

             the stadium which would lead people to gain access to pens other than the

             two central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace.       The point is made that

             fans entering through the turnstiles could only see the tunnel leads to

             the two central pens and no other signs.       There is in fact one small

             directional sign to the right of the west stand which says "standing".


   120 .     It is appropriate to point out that matters relating to the actual flows

             of spectators on match days are matters on which the Council would need to


HB4AAD/JJJ
                                                   -39-


             take advice, either from the Club or the Police.     Obviously, where exit

             routes need to be signed, the Fire Service also has an involvement.       There

             is no record on any of the files that there was any inadequacy in signing

             arrangements for the   terrace at Leppings Lane and had it been a

             significant factor I   would have expected that the matter would have teen

             brought up by the Police or the Club.    The provision of signing is not

             usually a complex or   expensive task.    It must be borne in mind that the

             direction of spectators on match days is     largely the responsibility of

             stewards with some involvement from the Police.


             The siting/strength of crush barriers in the pen

  121.       On 7th August, 1986, the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was subject

             to an annual inspection.     During the course of this annual inspection I

             recall that the Police representative requested that crush barrier number

             144 be reduced so that the persons entering the terrace from the tunnel

             would not be obstructed by it.    Apparently, there had been some

             difficulties in this area.     The barrier itself penetrated the central

             radial fence immediately in front of the tunnel.     The barrier was indeed

             removed with the result that barrier 144 now contains only one section,

             that is in the north central pen (see plan 1610/64E).     The decision on the

             barrier was taken at the time of the inspection in the presence of

             representatives from the Fire Authority, the Police, the Building

             Authority and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners, the Club's Consulting

             Engineers.   No problems with this revised barrier arrangement have been

             brought to my attention.


   122.      I should, however, point out that no written record of the decision to

             remove the barrier is noted on the file.     I can, however, say that I

             the remember the decision and that none of the persons present objected to

             the removal of the barrier.




HB4AAD/JJJ
                                                  -40-


   123.      As far as the strength of the barriers is concerned, they were tested by

             Messrs. Eastwood & Partners on 14th, 15th, 18th and 19th July, 1988 and

             the report is attached to this statement.   There were one or two defects

             discovered on the test which are noted in Eastwoods' letter which were

             remedied during 1988.   All the barriers in the two central pens were

             tested and found to meet the Green Guide standards.


   124.      (Spacing of barriers)


             The Access Tunnel to the Leppings Lane Terrace

   125.      This tunnel which runs beneath the west terrace is not of a constant

             gradient and at the end increases to a 1:6 on the approach to the terrace

             itself.


   126.      The files in my possession indicate that there have been no discussions

             about the tunnel itself.   As far as I am aware there have been no problems

             with the tunnel and as it has been used for many years by many thousands

             of spectators without apparent difficulty or incident in my opinion, the

             tunnel arrangement is reasonably safe within the meaning of the

             legislation. No complaints have been received about the tunnel.


             The wall at the Leppings Land turnstiles

   127.      The wall at the turnstiles is built in such a way as to prevent persons

             climbing into the ground in the majority of circumstances.   It is   not

             possible to construct a wall which would prevent anybody climbing    it in

             any circumstances without by its very nature causing danger, to the

             persons attempting to climb the wall.


             Access for emergency vehicles

   128.      The Fire Service has commented (16th May, 1979) in the past that adequate

             roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct access can be

             obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of the stadium.       They

             also mention that it was necessary to ensure that parked vehicles would


HB4AAD/JJJ
                                                     -41-


             not obstruct this access.      I understand that the Fire Service only require

             vehicular access to the exterior of each building in the football ground,

             (see 3.141).     The Officer Working Party at a meeting on 12th November,

             1979 (1.196) agreed that whilst no real problems had occurred in the past

             the Club would in consultation with the Fire Service and the Police mark

             out a lane from the main gates to the south stand in which parking would

             not be allowed.     It was also agreed that the hydrant outside the south

             stand.      It was also agreed that the hydrant     outside thesouth stand would

             have to     be kept clear.   The Police noted on    26th March,1980 (2.15) that

             they did not have any current problems in relation to the access for

             emergency vehicles.


  129.       During the planning stage for the redevelopment of the kop, the Club

             offered (letter from Eastwoods 29th November, 1985 - 3.130) to widen the

             gangway between the north stand and the retaining wall of the kop to

             enable fire engines to get to the pitch area.      The Fire Service responded

             to this     at an Officer Working Party meeting     (22nd January, 1986 - 3.141)

             by saying that whilst they felt that such a facility was not essential for

             their purposes it could be useful for use by emergency vehicles in certain

             situations and should generally be supported.      Towards the end of 1986,

             (letter from Eastwoods 18th December, 1986 - 3.210) the Club submitted

             proposals for creating a new entrance to the Sports Hall off Penistone

             Road so that the public would no longer have to use gate 'O', (Plan No.

             ).   Another    purpose of the development was to provide separate access for

             Police vehicles, ambulances, etc.      on match days; the proposal effectively

             reduced dangers which could result from vehicles having to pass

             spectators to gate 'O'.      This development did take place.   As I

             am not aware of the evidence on which the criticism about emergency

             vehicle access      is based, it is difficult to comment further.      Obviously,

             if that evidence is forthcoming, I can give further consideration to this

             question.      I understand that meetings have taken place between the Police,


HB4AAD/JJJ
                                                     -42-


             the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service on the emergency evacuation

             procedures at   Sheffield Wednesday.    No doubt those discussions dealt with

             the emergency   access ofvehicles to the stadium.


             First Aid Facilities

  130.       The County Council, in 1979, approached the Area Health Authority for

             advice on first aid facilities at Sheffield Wednesday.      The Area Health

             Authority responded on 31st May, 1979 (1.151) with a list of requirements.

             References are made in the list to two or three treatment couches; six

             stretchers, two sets of stretcher wheels, 20 blankets, six pillows and one

             minute man resuscitator.     Other comments are made about water

             requirements,   lighting, etc.    On 15th August, 1979 (1.170) the Officer

             Working Party requested the Club to provide a first aid permanent

             structure during the 1980 closed season, subject to the Club agreeing to

             provide the recommended first aid equipment immediately.


  131.       On 21st December, 1979 (1.211) the County Council wrote to Sheffield

             Wednesday indicating that the existing first aid facilities are accepted

             on an interim basis only pending the erection of purpose built facilites

             in the 1980 closed season.       On 20th April, 1982 (2.132) the County Council

             wrote to Sheffield Wednesday following an Officer Working Party meeting at

             which the Club's outline drawing for new Police and first aid facilities

             was considered.   As far as the first aid facilities were concerned, four

             comments were made:-

             (a)   The walls of the first aid room should be lined with a suitable
                   non-combustible and easily cleaned material, which would not need to

s/'V'* 4^?
                    Introduction

       1.          My name is David Malcolm Bownes.     I am employed by Sheffield City Council

                    in the Administration and Legal Department as Chief Licensing Officer.


       2.          I have been employed by Sheffield City Council since September, 1971 and

                   (g)   to take statements apd prepare reports on any matters where legal

                         proceedings may be contemplated and to*appear in any court

                         find complex.


       5.          The Licensing Section deals with 33 licensing systems, for example,

                   those involving taxis and private hire vehicles, operators and drivers,

                   cinemas, theatres and places of public entertainment.


                   Legislation                           ^

       6.          On 1st August, 1975 Royal Assent was given to the Safety of Sports Grounds

                   Act 1975/which established a "Certification" system for sports grounds

                   capable of holding more than 10,000 spectators.          When a sports ground is

                   designated by the Secretary of State an application needs to be

                   made to the Certificating Authority for a General Safety Certificate under

                   the 1975 Act.


        7.         At the time the Safety Certificate was granted in respect of Sheffield

                   Wednesday Football Club the South Yorkshire County Council (the

                   Certificating Authority) was obliged to attach to the Safety Certificate

                   such terms and conditions as they considered necessary or expedient to

                   secure reasonable safety at the sports ground when it is in use for

                   specified activities.     These requirements The terms and conditions at this

                   time had to include

                   (a)   The maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium and;

                   (b)   Terms and conditions as to the number,         size and situation of
                                                                   or      p c w ¥ <^- tV
                         entrances to and exits from the stadium|and the means of access to

                          any such entrances or-exits and requiring those entrances, exits and

                         means of access to be properly maintained and kept free from

                          obstruction and as to the number, strength and situation of any

                          crush barriers. (Section 2(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act

                          1975).

                       ' Section 2(2) of the 19j&5 Act was repealed by the Fire Safety and

                          Safety of Places of Sports Act 1987.   However, Home Office Circular

        8.           Certificate conditions must also be framed with reference to^"plan

                     attached to the Certificate, where appropriate.


        9.           Section 10 of 1975 Act   provided for an emergency procedure which could be

                     used by the Council if   it thought that there was a serious risk to

                     spectators at a sports   ground. The procedure involved applying to a

                     Magistrates' Court for   an Order prohibiting or restricting the admission

                     of spectators to the sports ground.

       10.           Under Section 11 of the 1975 Act £kre person authorised by the Local

                     Authority or the Chief Officer of Police, or the Building Authority,     or

                     the Secretary of State, could on production of his authority enter a

                     sports ground to make inspections and examine records and make enquiries

                     as he thought fit.   On local government reorganisation on 1st April, 1986

                     (when the South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its functions

                     passed in the main to District Councils) the reference to the Building

                     Authority was changed to the Fire Authority.


         11.         In 1976 the Home Office issued the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

                     (Football)" which is a guide to measures for improving spectator safety at

                     Football Grounds, i.e., at rugby union and rugby league grounds as well as

                     at soccer grounds.   A revised edition of the Green Guide was issued in

                     1986 following the Bradford Disaster and the Popplewell Inquiry.       The

                          code.     The Green Guide makes comments on such matters as the spacing of'

                          crush barriers, estimation of safe ground capacity, terraces, etc.                                      The

                          Guide makes the point that deviations from individual guidelines are

                          possible without necessarily detracting from the overall safety of the

                          ground.    A flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the

                          particular circumstances at individual grounds -/paragraphs 6 to 8 of ther

            12.           The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended the 1975

                          legislation in a number of areas.                         In particular, the old Section 10 of

                          the 1975 Act was replaced by a more wide ranging provision which gave

                          local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition Notice in respect of

                          either a whole sports ground or part|f of it.                                      A Prohibition Notice can
                                                                                       'fKwe is

                          may include directions as to the steps which will have to be taken to

                          reduce the risk to a reasonable level and these may require alterations or

                          additions to the ground or things to be done or omitted, which would

                          contravene the terms or conditions of a Safety Certificate for the ground

                          or for any stand at the ground.                         (Section 10(4) of the 1987 Act).                A

The 1987 Act also made provision for Safety Certificates for various

stands at sports grounds.                    Also, in order to give effect to various

Popplewell comments on indoor sporting activities, the definition of

public entertainments which require licensing was extended.


The Safety of Sports Ground Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument

1987/1941) sets out the prescribed form of application for a Safety

Certificate and also refers to appeal procedures, etc.


Home Office Circulars

Home Office Circular 71/1987 introduced the provisions of Part 2 of the

1987 Act and gives advice on the effects and operation of them.                           There is

also specific reference to the new Prohibition Notice procedure and a

draft Prohibition Notice.

                     Administration of the Certificating Function by
                              South Yorkshire County Council

Background to Certification

The County Council set up an "Officer Working Party" (Sheffield District)"

which consisted of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the

Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the South Yorkshire County

Council Administration Department.                        This Working Party was set up

following a report to the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee on

8th January, 1976.            There were four such Working Parties, one covering

Sheffield, one Rotherham, one Barnsley and one Doncaster.


In the early part of 1976 discussions took place between the South

Yorkshire County Council and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about
                                                          6



                 the possibility of certification in view of the commencement of the Safety

                 of Sports Grounds Act on 1st September, 1975.,     On 30th March, 1977 the

                 South Yorkshire Police became involved in the discussions and wrote

                 to the Home Office indicating that they felt certification should be

                 considered when the matter was next reviewed, owing to the large scale

                 events that were held at Hillsborough.


     20.         At a football match held on Saturday, 23rd April, 1977 there were

                     incidents at Hillsborough involving some injuries and a number of arrests.
                            >
                     This prompted further discussions about certification and the involvement

                     of the Fire Service Committee of the County Council as well as the Police.

                     At t|*e meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council on 27th April, 1977

                     questions relating to the problems at the football match were raised and a

                     specific complaint was later made by a member of the public in connection

                     with an incident that allegedly took place at the Leppings Lane end of

                     the ground.


      21.            The Chief Constable subsequently agreed to take up the designation

                     question once again with the Home Office.   On 24th August, 1977 the Home

                     Office wrote to the Chief Constable stating that, the case for designation

                     of Sheffield Wednesday was not overwhelming at that time - but they would

                     reconsider the matter later.


      22.             The County Council continued to press the case for designation with the

                     Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

                     played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had

                      been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards

                      of safety within the ground.   The Home Office once again declined to

                      designate the stadium.


       23.            In April, 1978 the County Council prepared and submitted a lengthy   paper

                      to the Home Office on the case for designating the Hillsborough Stadium

                  under the 1975 Act.

                  In August of 1978, the Home Office wrote to the County Council

                  indicating that they would recommend to the Home Secretary that an order

                  be made designating Hillsborough in due course.          The County Council then

                  began the Safety Certificate drafting exercise.          The exercise was carried

                  on in consultation with the Police, the Fire Service, the Building

                  Surveyor and the Club.


          25.     The Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 1978 (Statutory

                  Instrument 1978 No. 1091) designated the Sheffield Wednesday Football

                  Stadium as requiring a Safety Certificate with effect from 1st January,

                  1979. ' c- '

                  Council by Messrs. Eastwoods & Partners, Consulting Engineers, in January,

                  1979 (1,113A) which dealt with questions of ground capacity at the

                  stadium.     The report ".     .    .   deals in broad terms with the necessary

                  strengthening and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces,

                  total area of some 1,480 square metres, but there are no gangways.               It is

                  load should be appropriately strengthened and extra ones provided where

                  necessary.      Proposed extra barriers were shown on drawing 1610/2X.           The

     HB4AAA/JJJ
                       three exits from the west terrace have a total width of about 11.5 metres

                       which would permit some 1,250 persons per minute to leave the terrace.

                       The terrace could, therefore, be emptied in about 6 minutes.                        The report

                       goes on that the Guide suggests that everyone on the terrace should be

                       within 12 metres of a gangway or exit.          As there are no gangways pnd/some

                       spectators would be 25 metres from an exit.               The report goes on to say

                       that this is felt to be of no consequence as movement horizontally along

                       the terrace will be easy and quick.

                       was a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) on 12th

                       February,   1979 (1.124) at which the west terrace and north west corner

                       reinforced concrete terrace were discussed.              As far as the west terrace

                       was concerned it was agreed that ".        .    . J n view of the lack of depth of

                       unreasonable to insist that gangways or additional exits must be

                       provided." The Working Party also noted that special attention would be

                       required to the crush barriers in addition to the ordinary testing in view

       HB4A A A /JJJ
of the apparent sharp edges, corrosion, etc.     The Working Party agreed

that there were no real problems with the north west terrace but reference

is made to the corrugated sheeting would be required to pass the

appropriate tests, along with the crush barriers.

                        2)OC-
On 30th March, 1979, (LwiSf}) the Officer Working Party considered further

the question of the west terrace and the north west terrace.     As to the

west terrace it was noted that the terracing in small areas near to the

stand was in poor condition and that the cross-fall on the steps on the

north west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw

people forward.   The height of the crush barriers was also mentioned as

being below the Guide recommendations.    The Working Party agreed that

these points should be drawn to the attention of the Club.     As far as the

north west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now took the view

that the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in order to meet the

requirements of the Green Guide.

                     i_oc - 'O
On 2nd April, 1979 (L^-l-3■9') the Officer Working Party visited Sheffield

Wednesday and a joint meeting was held with the Club representatives.        The

Working Party agreed that the Club's proposals (Including a capacity limit

of 7,200 spectators) was acceptable, without the need for additional

gangways.   It was also agreed that the question of the cross-fall on the

steps on the north west corner exit, the height of some of the existing

crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp edges in places,

should be the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the

Building Surveyor.   The Club's proposals in respect to the north west

terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900 and the

improvement and addition of some new barriers.     It was also agreed that

the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting should

be subject to discussion between the Building Surveyor and Dr. Eastwood.

On 18th April, 1979,             a joint meeting of the Officer Working Party

was held at Sheffield Wednesday.     The meeting was held to   urtheipdiscuss

the proposals in relation to Sheffield WtidiSSAuldj^irt the Hillsborough

Stadium.   The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club
                                      08-rv>aX' e/xXW, "faa
accepted thatj^the cross-fall^steps should be rebuilt and that the other

matters previously raised jjiid be reconsidered after it was seen which of

the crush barriers failed on testing.     Whilst accepting the need for

improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting on the

north westj^terrace, the Club wished to consider whether to carry out more
     *
extensive works so as to bring an existing unused area in-jjo use for the

accommodation of further spectators.

                  is c o .i'.L
On 1st May, 197$ (1*.-1~48) the Sheffield City Council's Building Surveyor

wrote to the County Council indicating that as far as the west terrace was

concerned, the downward slope of the exit steps needed to be corrected and

that the limitation in capacity should remain.      It was noted that, on the

north west terrace, the replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear

was required, as was the removal of understrength barriers and ^
                                                        r\i
replacement by new ones constructed to Guide recommendations.



On 16th May, 1979 (1.149) the Chief Fire Officer wrote to the County

Council with a work schedule in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.      It is

noted that the west and north west terrace exit routes were, regarded as

satisfactory.   It was noted that the capacity of the west terrace was

7,200 persons and that of the north west terrace        2,900 persons.


As a result of these consultations between the Working Party and the Club

on 8th June, 1979 (L-^l'52‘&" A) a list of "Matters requiring attention at

the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield" was sent

to the Club for its attention.



On 15th August, 1979 (1.170) the Officer Working Party met again to

consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review the
       progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th

       July.    It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

       corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


37.   On 19th September,        1979         Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County

       Council about the emergency lighting installation in the stadium.

       Eastwoods proposed in the letter that new emergency circuits and

       fittings be installed in areas of the stadium including the north west

       terrace, the south west terrace and the Leppings Lane e x i t .

               >
38.    Between 31st October, 1979 and 12th November of the same year, there was

       correspondence between Eastwoods and the County Council about the

       corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.          It was finally

39.   The   County Fire Services Committee of the South Yorkshire County        Council

       at its meeting on 29th November,       1979 approved the issue of a General

       Safety Certificate and the terms and conditions of that Certificate to

       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.        This decision was ratified by the full

       County Council meeting on 19th December,       1979.   The grant of a Certificate

      was made subject to remedial works to the south stand steel columns and

       the emergency lighting system being carried out.        The Safety Certificate

      document itself was issued on 21st December,        1979 under the signature of

      Mr. F. A. Mallett,        the Chief Executive of the County Council.

                     Example of Inspection

       42.           At the Working Party inspection on 11th August,                   1983 (3.25) there were two

                     representatives from the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club (Dr. Eastwood

                     and Mr. E. England), two from the South Yorkshire Police (J.                    Barker and

                     C.     Calvert), one from the South Yorkshire County Fire Service (J.

                     Miles), two from the Sheffield City Council (Building Authority) (A.

                     Roberts and D.             Sheriff) and one from the South Yorkshire County Council

                     Administration Department (D.                 Vaughan).     For illustrative purposes, I

                     would refer to the last two paragraphs on the first page of the notes of


H B 4 A A A /J J J
                          the Working Party visit.     In the first of the two paragraphs it is clear

                          that a problem in relation to the brickwork at the rear corner of the

                          stand nearest the north west terrace had been raised at the previous

                          meeting of the Working Party and this was further explored at the meeting

                          on 11th August.     In the second paragraph, Dr.     Eastwood (the Club's

                          Consulting Engineer) gave details of testing of the crush barriers on the

                          terrace and indicating that appropriate remedial action had been taken,

p—                        where necessary and that the first ^f-i-ve— year^ cycle of the barrier testing

                          had thus been completed.

                          Issues arising other than on inspections

               43.        The County Council was made aware of various problems in connection with

                          the use of the stadium.     An example as to how these matters were dealt

                          with can be seen by reference to a letter from the South Yorkshire County

                          October,   1983.   There was particular concern that stewards could not hear

                          the emergency procedure announcement on the public address system, which

                          resulted in stewards failing to carry out their emergency procedure

                          duties.    Consultations then took place between the Club and the Fire

                          Officer (with reference to the County Council) which resulted in the

                          satisfactory resolution~of'"the- public^ address...svstem~.p-roblem-.   The system

                          itself was checked and found satisfactory by the County Fire Service 29th

                          October,   1983, (3^34 and 3.37).

             Review of the Administrative System

     46.     At its meeting on 7th September,             1987 the General Purposes Panel

             considered a report (      „       ) on the future administration of the Council's

             Certificating function.


           fts,
     47.     The report    accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority, will

             act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service), the

             question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.               In this

             respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

             Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

             the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the

             Department of Health and Consumer Services.              Both the Building Surveyor's

             Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

             existing Council structure.             It was envisaged that the Advisory Group

HB4AAA/JJJ
                        would function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most

                        regular use would probably be the discussion/ of advice to the Council

                        before they- were finally formulated by the appropriate Authority.


           48.          It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

                        request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

                        Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

                        list of items to be discussed.      At the conclusion of the meeting a further

                        list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

                        taken by each Authority would be noted.         It was then envisaged that

                        detailed written advice would be provided by each discipline and acted             f -

                        upon as appropriate.


           50.          The report went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

                        It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

                        safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items

Role of the Administration and Legal Department
in the Certification System

The basic role of the Department is to co-ordinate the administration of

the Certification System and also to keep the records of it.


An example (-5.13) of an Agenda and notes of a meeting are attached, dated

28th April, 1988, which shows the sort of items discussed at the Advisory

Group.

The Inspection System operated by Sheffield City Council

Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

authorities.   Inspections have taken place on the following dates

7th August, 1986 (3.158); 6th August, 1987 (4.45): 19th May, 1988 (4.72).

Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and Consumer

Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.     Often, the Club is

represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

The inspection is carried out by the various officers who meet at the

ground and then disperse to various areas in which their particular
     58.           The Officers can draw points £ 0 each other's attention during the

                   inspection and Club representatives are sometimes asked for

                   information.


     59.           If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

                   Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

                   taken to secure its rectification.       If rectification is not possible prior

                   to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

                   to issue a Prohibition Notice, if appropriate.


     60.           Officers at the conclusion of the inspection write to the Head of

                   Administration and Legal Department setting out their comments on matters

                   which ought to be raised with the Club.          These are then collated and

                   discussed with the officers (when necessary at an Advisory Group) and

                   finally formulated into a list which is sent to the Club for action.


      61.          As an example, a copy of Officers' comments following the 1987 inspection

                   are attached to this Statement (                    ).
                                                        .   .   .           ^
      62.          The actual time spent on background inspect!oi^usually exceeds two man

                   days per year.   This does not include the subsequent administrative work

                   or the consideration of proposals submitted by sports ground owners.           Home

                   Office Circular 72/1987 states that inspections are not expected to take

                   more than about two man days per ground on average.


                                            The role of the Home Office

        63 .       The Home Office is the Central Government Department which is         responsible

                   for safety of sports grounds.   Its functions can be described        in brief as

                   fol lows :


                   (a)    To advise Parliament on legislation;

                    (b)   To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
                          and to offer guidance;



H B 5A A A /J JJ
                         (c)   To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to
                               inspections); and

                         (d)   To issue the "Green Guide" which is an advisory document to assist
                               the improvement of safety standards at sports grounds.


                                The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
                                and the Popplewell Report

          64.            The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,
                               (3><?c nj
                         1985 (-3v89) outlining the certification system in operation throughout the

                         County.    The press release went on to say that the forthcoming "Summer"

                         inspections will take into account the lessons of the recent tragic event
                                   *
                         at Bradford and any revised advice and requirements which may be issued by

                         the Home Office. (3.89).          On 13th May, 1985 the South Yorkshire County

                         Council sent a letter to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday

                         (3.90) enclosing a copy of the press release and stressing that it is

                                           rsHrj for safety stewards to be fully aware of and trained in

                         their duties on the manning and opening of doors and gates on egress

                         routes and in the use of fire fighting equipment.


          65.                  The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on

                         9th August, 1985 (3-112) indicating that the Interim Report of the

                         Popplewell Inquiry had been produced and advice had been received from the

^                        Home Office.         The letter drew attention to a review op the evacuation

                         procedures in consultation with the Police and the Fire Service and also

                         to the duties of safety stewards.              It also indicated that the Police

<jr~                     and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in                  ini   ef-pVTor^ fi

                         Detailed comments were also made about the first aid facilities at the

                         stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.                  There

                         was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

                         materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

                         displayed.        The Club responded (3.116) to the County Council's letter of

                         14th August^and comments were made about steward training procedures,which

               C                  The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it appears               that the

                                  crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late due to

                                  'N' (in Penlstone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were




               H B 5A A A /J JJ
directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

were standing.       Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. John

Ambulance for minor ailments ani^at the Royal Hallamshire and Northern

General Hospitalsj^8 spectators were treated^      According to the Police,

three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

unspecified injuries.       The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

both inside and outside the stadium was very good.


On 22nd April, 1981 the Chief Executive of the County Council wrote
'Voc {-> ■
(2.62) to *the Police asking for a copy of their report on the Semi-Final

incident.


Mr. Brownlow, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, wrote to the

Secretary of the Football Association on 3rd June, 1981 (2.68)

commenting in detail on the incident at the match on 11th April.          The

Chief Constable starts by noting the basic facts relating to the stadium

and indicating that there had been many similar Semi-Final matches at

Hillsborough without previous incident.       The Police apparently envisaged

difficulties prior to the match because both sets of supporters would need

to use the Ml motorway.       There were a number of problems which slowed down

the arrival of spectators, namely a major road accident, a coach breaking

down and extensive road works.       These resulted in Tottenham Hotspur fans

being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.       This all resulted in

       •        .   a sudden influx of large numbers of football supporters to the

area       of the ground at around the time for the start of the match .        .


Mr. Brownlow went on to indicate that Tottenham Hotspur supporters managed

to obtain tickets.       From Wolverhampton, he noted that this completely

defeated the spectator policy which places the largest groups of standing

supporters at opposite ends of the football ground.       Apparently, neither

participating football club told the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield
Wednesday, or the Football Association about this situation and the mixing

of supporters was not properly catered for.     Some 400 Tottenham fans had

to be removed from the kop and accommodated in the Leppings Lane end


According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early

took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

the Leppings Lane enclosure ". . . thereby creating a jamming effect at

the extreme ties of it . . ."   The late arrivals then caused a problem

because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

Hotspur had scored an early goal.    The resulting injuries included broken

arms, legs and crushed ribs.    It is noted that some 38 people received

treatment.   The pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane

enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

perimeter track to relieve pressure.     Police Officers also refused access

to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

the crushing problem.   In Mr. Brownlow's view, no other course of action

could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

similar events.

        on the Leppings Lane terrace

The 1981 Proposals

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 2nd September,

1981 (2.80) indicating that ". . . we have been instructed by the Club to

organise the installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground . . .".     It was noted that the intention

of these fences was to divide the terrace into approximately three equal

areas, each served by its own entrance.     The object of dividing the
.
•.-s-v


                   terrace was to exercise more control over supporters and for example, a

                   visiting team with only a few followers would be allocated one section

 '<jP             ^with   the other two sections retained for home suppojers.       A 1.15 metre wide

                   gate was proposed at the rear of each fence, to give access for

                   maintenance and also policing during the game.          The gates could be left

                   open, but fastened back to connect the areas during the game if

                   appropriate. In order to preserve spectators' views Eastwoods recommended

                   that the top of the fence should be approximately 1680 mm above the

                   terrace.    It was noted that a fence of this height would not prevent

                   individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should eliminate a

                   mass "invasion" from one area to another.           Apparently, fences of this

                   height worked successfully at St. James' Park (the Newcastle United

                   ground).    The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2 and 3.


         75.       On 9th September, 1981 (2.-85) Eastwoods wrote to the County Council

                   indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in early October,

                   subject to their being no objections from the Council.           Eastwoods

                   indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be received by

 4-                23rd ^24--feh or 2 5 September.


 <J-     ?6   *    The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September (2.87)

                   considered the question of the proposed new radial barriers on the west

                   terrace.    It was noted that there were drawbacks to the division of the

                    terrace intoj^hree equal areas, but the Working Party felt that increased

                   control on the terrace should result.     A "for instance" was quoted in that

                    there could well be problems with opposing fans mixing at the rear of the

                   west stand and/or the final exit gates, but the Police considered that

                    they could cope with these problems.

                    of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.          It was noted that the

                         a letter of 14th December, Eastwoods indicated that the works were now

                 supporters as they entered the ground and also to enable the Police to

                 control their exit at the end of the game.     A scheme showing a possible

                 modification to the Leppings Lane end was prepared and shown on drawing

                 6705/2 which involved the construction the two new banks of turnstiles and

                 various runs of fencing and new gates.

                 They were agreed, subject to a number of conditions.

       83.       On 30th April, 1985 (3.84) the Fire Service wrote to the County Council

                 indicating that from a means of escape point of view, the scheme was

'Jr-             satisfactory, providing the gates         minimum widths as indicated on the

                 plan enclosed with the letter.   The Fire Service also mention ad- that it

                 was understood that these gates -w-oi.iId be supervised either by the Police

                 or Club officials.    The County Council on 2nd May transmitted its views to

                 Messrs.   Eastwood & Partners by letter.    (3.85).


       84.       Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 8th May (3.87) and

                  indicated that several of the points made had already been incorporated

                  into the latest scheme.   Eastwoods say in the letter:- ".     .   .   However I

                 would ask that further consideration should be given to the request in

                  paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to be installed in the

                  radial barrier and for the new radial barrier which you have asked for to
                                                onfe.
                  have two gates. If these gates^jmeant for use in emergency it would mean

                 having a steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which

                  would hardly be justified.    It is our view that in the event of emergency,


   H B5AAA/JJJ
spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the gates on to the pitch

and by the normal exit gates St the rear.   We will of course be prepared

to discuss the matter with the Fire Officer’s staff should you so wish,

The County Council sent a letter to Eastwoods on 10th May, 1985 (3^88)

indicating that the Police were prepared to concede the request for two

gates per radial fenc^, provided that the remainder of the points raised

by the Officer Working Party were incorporated.

Subsequently, Eastwood & Partners submitted a further detailed proposal

for a revised layout of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th

July 1985 (3.102).   Fourteen plans were included in the submission and it

was considered by a meeting of the Officer Working Party on 29th July

(3.103).   The Working Party accepted the proposals in principle, but made

a   number of comments which   were   transmitted to the Consulting Engineers by

a   letter of 30th July £3.104). The comments were made by reference to the

plans submit ted

(a)   Plan No. 6705/6 - #for both security access and emergency egress
      purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

(b)  Plan No. 6705/8A - *the new handrail by turnstile 23 to be either
     shortened or realigned so as to maintain the exit width between the
     outer (river) wall and turnstile 23, and the exit width between
     turnstile 16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width o£

Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 1st August (3.109)

and indicated that it might be easier for discussions to take place when ^

                    On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
                    new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the Police,
         i          This gate would still be available for the use of spectators in an
                    emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
                    Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
                    However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
                    was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South

                   the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates that in the north west corner

                   of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

                   pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should

                   the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.       It was noted that the Club had received

                   quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete at the north west

                   terrace, wttich wjJrl be considered shortly.     The Working Party also heard

                   the Club outline the consideration it was giving to the siting of caravans

                   outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell

                   tickets.       It was hoped that if this took place, increased entry flow of

                   spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the

                   turnstiles.

X       94.        On 7th April, 1981 (2.59), the Working Party noted that the cracking of

                   the concreting at the north west terrace had been attended to by injecting

                   material from the top.  The results had been satisfactory, except in two

                   bars through the upper level concrete area to the rear had been

                   protectively wrapped.

              102.      At the time the current Safety Certificate was issued, the terms and

                        conditions contained therein were those thought by the South Yorkshire

                        County Council on the advice of the various interested parties to be

                        necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of spectators at the

                        sports ground.   There is no evidence from the files that the Certificate

                        Holder or any other interested party has appealed to the Secretary of

                        State (up to 1st January, 1988) or to a Magistrates' Court (thereafter) in

                        respect of the Certificate Conditions.

                           matter was dealt with in lengthy correspondence and by consultation.


              105.         The amendment and replacement of Certificates is governed by Section 4 of

              107.         On 3rd September, 1981 the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

                            resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

                            Certificate by replacing Conditions 10 and 26 of the Safety Certificate.

                            The amended Condition 10 contains slight wording differences to the

                            original.                       Condition 26 varied the time limits in relation to

                            electrical certificates.                                        There is no evidence from the file that these

                            revised conditions were in fact properly brought into effect.

                            Purposes Panel resolved to amend the capacity of the Spion Kop at

                            Sheffield Wednesday to 21,000 spectators.                                        The Panel agreed to amend the

                            Certificate on the basis of a number of conditions, one of which related

                            to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until -guTh certain works

                            related to two matches.                                        The amendment to the Certificate only affected

         /\    109.           On 1st December, 1986 the General Purposes Panel resolved (3.208) to amend

                              Schedule I of the Certificate so as to extend the definition of specified

                              activity to include Royal visits.                             Again, the notice provisions of the

                              legislation were not observed.

                                                                  (C ffr   (<X& <X<KOs*~&

                              alter or extend the sports ground or any of its installations (if that

                              alteration or extension is likely to affect the safety of persons at the

                              ground).            To the best of my knowledge, this Section has been complied with

                              by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club; the developments which have taken

                              place have been the subject of lengthy correspondence in each case.


                112.          The Council as Certificating Authority may issue a Prohibition Notice

                              under Section 10 of the Act if it feels there is a serious risk to

                               spectator safety.              No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of

                               Sheffield Wednesday.


                113.          It is the duty of the Council under Section 10B(1) of the Act to arrange

                               for the inspection of stadia at least once every 12 months. At its

d~                            meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel noted the

                     details contained in a report by the Head of Administration and Legal

                     Department about the operatiofi'of the Council's certification function for

                     the safety of sports grounds.   One of the details mentioned in the report .

                     relates to inspections and the proposal that one large scale inspection

                     per stadium should be carried out.   In fact the report itself does not

                     make clear my intention that these inspections should be annual.     My

                     intention at the time, and the Council's practice since has been to

                     arrange annual inspections of stadia.     The report goes on to indicate that

                     these inspections would be backed up by a series of "during event"

                     inspections which proposal was in line with both the Popplewell Report and

                     with licensing practice in other areas.     I am aware that the Fire Service

                     visit the sports ground and of course the Police are present during most

                     specified activities.


                     The Safety Certificate

      114.           Under Condition 1(1) of the Safety Certificate, the Holder's nominee mast

                     be approved in writing by the Council.


      115.           Currently, the nominee is the Club Secretary.    On the 15th October, 1987,

                     the City Council wrote (4.47) to Sheffield Wednesday pointing out various

                     provisions of the new Green Guide and making particular reference to the

                      appointment of a Safety Officer as defined in Chapter 2 of the Guide.

                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic responded to this letter on 23rd

                      the ground.


       116.          Under Condition 8(1) of the Certificate the Holder is required to provide

                      and maintain at the -o tadiiMn, to the satisfaction of the Council, a

                          Potential Danger on the Leppings Lane Terraces


           118.           In the earlier part of my statement I refer to the full history of

                           discussions and decisions between the interested parties (the Police, Fire

                           Service, the Building Authority and the Club, and its Consulting

                           Engineers) leading up to and following the installation of the radial

                           fences on the Leppings Lane terrace.              It will be recalled that the

                           installation of fences took place in two distinct stages in 1981 and 1985.

                           The result of these discussions and decisions is the creation of the pens

                           at the Leppings Lane terrace.           It is clear from the correspondence on

                           file, which is particularly referred to in my statement, that the fences

                           were erected only after careful and thorough consideration by the

                           appropriately qualified experts.


          119.             In early 1985 the Club, via their Consulting Engineers, Messrs. Eastwoods

                           & Partners, submitted proposals to alter the Leppings Lane end of the

                           ground and to construct two new radial fences on the Leppings Lane

                            terrace.          I propose to deal with only the radial fences at this stage.

                      The siting/strength of crush barriers in the pen

                      to an annual inspection.        During the course of this annual inspection I

                      recall that the Police representative requested that crush barrier number

                      144 be reduced so that the persons entering the terrace from the tunnel

                      would not be obstructed by it.          Apparently, there had been some

|                     difficulties in this area.        The barrier itself penetrated the central

I                     radial fence immediately in front of the tunnel. The barrier was indeed

                               the barrier is noted on the file.           I can, however, say that I

                           remember the discussion and that none of the persons present objected

                 their purposes it could be useful for use by emergency vehicles in certain

                 (letter from Eastwoods 18th December, 1986 - 3.210) the Club submitted

                 proposals for creating a new entrance to the Sports Hall off Penistone

                 Road so that the public would no longer have to use gate ’O', (Plan No.

                 ).   Another            purpose of the development was to provide separate access for

                 Police vehicles, ambulances, etc.                         on match days; the proposal effectively

                 reduced dangers which could result from vehicles having to pass                                         Iv'v ^ j

     5.      The Licensing Section deals with 33 licensing systems, for example,

             those involving taxis and private hire vehicles, operators and drivers,

             cinemas, theatres and places of public entertainment.


             Legislation

     6.      On 1st August, 1975 Royal Assent was given to the Safety of Sports Grounds
                    Coioe.                         .■
              Act 1975^which established a "Certification" system for sports grounds

             capable of holding more than 10,000 spectators.            When a sports ground is

             designated by the Secretary of State an application needs to be

             made to the Certificating Authority for a General Safety Certificate under

             the 1975 Act.


     7.      At the time the Safety Certificate was granted in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday Football Club the South Yorkshire County Council (the

             Certificating Authority) was obliged to attach to the Safety Certificate

             such terms and conditions as they considered necessary or expedient to

             secure reasonable safety at the sports ground when it is in use for

             specified activities,        ^.hfise— requi-reHiejats^The terms and conditions at this

             time had to include

             (a)    The maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium and;

             (b)    Terms and conditions as to the number, size and situation of
                                                             or o.vv^   ^
                    entrances to and exits from the stadium and the means of access to

                        any such entrances or exits and requiring those entrances, exits and

                        means of access to be properly maintained and kept free from

                        obstruction and as to the number, strength and situation of any

                        crush barriers. (Section 2(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act

                        1975).


                 1 \^                         1 Act was repealed by the Fire Safety and
                        Section 2(2) of the 19jB5
                    i

             V      I Safety of Places of Sports Act 1987.     However, Home Office Circular

                        71/1987 advised that similar conditions should still be included.


     8.          Certificate conditions must also be framed with reference t o ^ plan

                 attached to the Certificate, where appropriate.


     9.          Section 10 of 1975 Act provided for an emergency procedure which could be

                 used by the Council if it thought that there was a serious risk to

                 spectators at a sports ground.     The procedure involved applying to a

                 Magistrates' Court for an Order prohibiting or restricting the admission

                 of spectators to the sports ground.


    10.          Under Section 11 of the 1975 Act        person authorised by the Local

                 Authority or the Chief Officer of Police, or the Building Authority, or

                 the Secretary of State, could on production of his authority enter a

                 sports ground to make inspections and examine records and make enquiries

                 as he thought fit.   On local government reorganisation on 1st April, 1986

                 (when the South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its functions

                 passed in the main to District Councils) the reference to the Building

             Authority was changed to the Fire Authority.


     11.         In 1976 the Home Office issued the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

                 (Football)" which is a guide to measures for improving spectator safety at

             Football Grounds, i.e., at rugby union and rugby league grounds as well as

             at soccer grounds.       A revised edition of the Green Guide was issued in

improving spectator safety at sports grounds generally.          It is a voluntary

crush barriers, estimation of safe ground capacity, terraces, etc.             The

Guide makes the point that deviations from individual guidelines are

possible without necessarily detracting from the overall safety of the

ground.         A flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the

The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended the 1975

legislation in a number of areas.          In particular, the old Section 10 of

the 1975 Act was replaced by a more wide ranging provision which gave

local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition Notice in respect of

either a whole sports ground or parts of it. A Prohibition Notice can

only be issued where the Local Authority is of the opinion that a serious

risk to spectators is present in the sports ground.         A Prohibition Notice

may include directions as to the steps which will have to be taken to

reduce the risk to a reasonable level and these may require alterations or

additions to the ground or things to be done or omitted, which would

contravene the terms or conditions of a Safety Certificate for the ground

or for any stand at the ground.         (Section 10(4) of the 1987 Act).   A

prohibition or restriction contained in a Notice may take effect

immediately if there appears to be reason for it, or after a specified

period contained in the Notice.         An appeal may be lodged with the

Magistrates' Court against a Prohibition Notice but that appeal does not

stop its operation.         The Court may either cancel or affirm the Notice.


In the new Section 10B of the Act it is the duty of each Certificating

Authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations made under

it and also to carry out an inspection of each designated sports ground

at least once every 12 months and to act in accordance with guidance given
to them by the Secretary of State.


The 1987 Act also made provision for Safety Certificates for various

stands at sports grounds.        Also, in order to give effect to various

Popplewell comments on indoor sporting activities, the definition of

public entertainments which require licensing was extended.


The Safety of Sports Ground Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument

1987/1941) sets out the prescribed form of application for a Safety

Certificate and also refers to appeal procedures, etc.

                Administration of the Certificating Function by
                         South Yorkshire County Council

Background to Certification

The County Council set up an "Officer Working Party^(Sheffield District)"

which consisted of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the

Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the South Yorkshire County

Council Administration Department.       This Working Party was set up

following a report to the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee on

8th January, 1976.      There were four such Working Parties, one covering

Sheffield, one Rotherham, one Barnsley and one Doncaster.


In the early part of 1976 discussions took place between the South

Yorkshire County Council and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about
                                                  -6 -




             the possibility of certification in view of the commencement of the Safety

             of Sports Grounds Act on 1st September, 1975.   On 30th March, 1977 the

             South Yorkshire Police became involved in the discussions and wrote

             to the Home Office indicating that they felt certification should be

             considered when the matter was next reviewed, owing to the large scale

             events that were held at Hillsborough.


   20.       At a football match held on Saturday, 23rd April, 1977 there were

             incidents at Hillsborough involving some injuries and a number of arrests.

             This prompted further discussions about certification and the involvement

             of the Fire Service Committee of the County Council as well as the Police.

             At the meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council on 27th April, 1977

             questions relating to the problems at the football match were raised and a

             specific complaint was later made by a member of the public in connection

             with an incident that allegedly took place at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.


   21.       The Chief Constable subsequently agreed to take up the designation

             question once again with the Home Office.   On 24th August, 1977 the Home

             Office wrote to the Chief Constable stating that the case for designation

             of Sheffield Wednesday was not overwhelming at that time - but they would

             reconsider the matter later.


    22.      The County Council continued to press the case for designation with the

             Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

             played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had

             been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards

             of safety within the ground.   The Home Office once again declined to

             designate the stadium.


    23.      In April, 1978 the County Council prepared and submitted a lengthy paper

             to the Home Office on the case for designating the Hillsborough Stadium


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                               -7-


              under the 1975 Act.

     24.      In August of 1978, the Home Office wrote to the County Council

              indicating that they would recommend to the Home Secretary that an order

              be made designating Hillsborough in due course.                  The County Council then

              began the Safety Certificate drafting exercise.                  The exercise was carried

              on in consultation with the Police, the Fire Service, the Building

              Surveyor and the Club.


     25.      The Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 1978 (Statutory

              Instrument 1978 No. 1091) designated the Sheffield Wednesday Football

              Stadium as requiring a Safety Certificate with effect from 1st January,

              1979 .

                                                                                                CDoc*

              reference to the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

n 'j 28".     In support of the Club's application, a report was submitted to the County

              Council by Messrs. Eastwoods & Partners, Consulting Engineers, in January,
                       ht.c. * ?
              1979 (Url-3A) which dealt with questions of ground capacity at the

              stadium.        The report ".     .   .   deals in broad terms with the necessary

              strengthening and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces,

              and calculations are made of theoretical exit times .                     .   All the

              stands and terraces were dealt with in the report.                    Page 4 of the report

              indicates that the west terrace (which is at the Leppings Lane end) has a

              total area of some 1,480 square metres, but there are no gangways.                      It is

              suggested that the full area would justify about 8,000 spectators, but

              after making allowance for gangways a capacity of 7,200 would perhaps be

              more reasonable.        The report says that the barriers should be designed to

              match this figure and that those barriers which could not withstand test

              load should be appropriately strengthened and extra ones provided where
                                                                        C.P(«i/\. \.j

             three exits from the west terrace have a total width of about 11.5 metres

             which would permit some 1,250 persons per minute to leave the terrace.

             The terrace could, therefore, be emptied in about 6 minutes.           The report

             goes on that the Guide suggests that everyone on the terrace should be

        v    within 12 metres of a gangway or exit.       As there are no gangways ^nd/ some

             spectators would be 25 metres from an exit.           The report goes on to say

             that this is felt to be of no consequence as movement horizontally along

             the terrace will be easy and quick.


       28.   The north west corner reinforced concrete terrace is also referred to in

             the report which is noted as covering an area of approximately 565 square

             metres.   The recommended number of spectators was 2,900, bringing the

             total standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.            It was also noted that

             the exits serving the north west terrace were adequate and emptying should

             take place within 8 minutes.   The significance of the 8 minute time

             relates to the recommended maximum time for ^ departure of spectators from

             a terraced area of a football stadium.        This recommendation is contained

             in the original "Green Guide" at Paragraph 8.            The last page of the

\            report/ recommends a ground capacity of 50,100 spectators (consisting of
A                   <
              approximately 24,000 seated spectators, 16,000 standing on the spion kop

             and 10,100 at the Leppings Lane end).        j(-3rrl'13Ajj'


       30.       Following the submission of Eastwoods' report to the County Council there

/ fi         was a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) on 12th

             February, 1979 (1.124) at which the west terrace and north west corner

             reinforced concrete terrace were discussed.           As far as the west terrace

             was concerned it was agreed that ".      .     .   in view of the lack of depth of

             this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the spectator limit to 7,200 and

             the discharge of 6.6 minutes, the Working Party agree that it will be

             unreasonable to insist that gangways or additional exits must be

             provided." The Working Party also noted that special attention would be

              required to the crush barriers in addition to the ordinary testing in view

HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                      -9-

             of the apparent sharp edges, corrosion, etc.        The Working Party agreed

             that there were no real problems with the north west terrace but reference

             is made to the corrugated sheeting would be required to pass the

             appropriate tests, along with the crush barriers.


   30.       On 30th March, 1979, (l,r!3-8) the Officer Working Party considered further

             the question of the west terrace and the north west terrace.         As to the

             west terrace it was noted that the terracing in small areas near to the

             stand was in poor condition and that the cross-fall on the steps on the

             north west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw

             people forward.   The height of the crush barriers was also mentioned as

             being below the Guide recommendations.         The Working Party agreed that

             these points should be drawn to the attention of the Club.         As far as the

             north west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now took the view

             that the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in order to meet the

             requirements of the Green Guide.

                                  iioc. lO
   31.       On 2nd April, 1979              the Officer Working Party visited Sheffield

             Wednesday and a joint meeting was held with the Club representatives.            The

             Working Party agreed that the Club's proposals (including a capacity limit

             of 7,200 spectators) was acceptable, without the need for additional

             gangways.   It was also agreed that the question of the cross-fall on the

             steps on the north west corner exit, the height of some of the existing

             crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp edges in places,

             should be the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the

             Building Surveyor.   The Club's proposals in respect to the north west

             terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900 and the

             improvement and addition of some new barriers.         It was also agreed that

             the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting should

             be subject to discussion between the Building Surveyor and Dr. Eastwood.

              Stadium.   The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club

              accepted that the cross-fall steps should be rebuilt and that the other

              matters previously   raised will be reconsidered after it was seen which of

              the crush barriers   failed on testing.            Whilst accepting the need for

              improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting on the

              north west terrace, the Club wished to consider whether to carry out more

              extensive works so as to bring an existing unused area in to use for the

              accommodation of further spectators.

      33.     On 1st May, 1978 (L.4-4-8) the Sheffield City Council's Building Surveyor

              wrote to the County Council indicating that as far as the west terrace was

              concerned, the downward slope of the exit steps needed to be corrected and

              that the limitation in capacity should remain.                  It was noted that, on the

              north west terrace, the replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear

              was required, as was the removal of understrength barriers and a
<r            replacement by new ones constructed to Guide recommendations.

              Council with a work schedule in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.                   It is

              noted that the west and north west terrace exit routes were regarded as

              satisfactory.   It was noted that the capacity of the west terrace was

              7,200 persons and that of the north west terrace of 2,900 persons.

             July.   It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

             corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.

             corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.           It was finally

             agreed that a horizontal timber member should be fixed to the front of the

             corrugated sheeting to improve its safety to an acceptable level.           (Lv488,

             Example of Inspection
                                                                              Doc. 2 0
   42.       At the Working Party inspection on 11th August, 1983 (3-r£"50 there were two

             representatives from the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club (Dr. Eastwood

             and Mr. E. England), two from the South Yorkshire Police (J.                Barker and

             C.     Calvert), one from the South Yorkshire County Fire Service (J.

             Miles), two from the Sheffield City Council (Building Authority) (A.

             Roberts and D.       Sheriff) and one from the South Yorkshire County Council

             Administration Department (D.            Vaughan).    For illustrative purposes, I

             would refer to the last two paragraphs on the first page of the notes of


HB4AAA/JJJ
                                                   -13-

             the Working Party visit.    In the first of the two paragraphs it is clear

             that a problem in relation to the brickwork at the rear corner of the

             stand nearest the north west terrace had been raised at the previous

             meeting of the Working Party and this was further explored at the meeting

             on 11th August.    In the second paragraph, Dr.   Eastwood (the Club's

             Consulting Engineer) gave details of testing of the crush barriers on the

             terrace and indicating that appropriate remedial action had been taken,

             where necessary and that the first five year cycle of the barrier testing

             had thus been completed.

             Issues arising other than on inspections

     43.     The County Council was made aware of various problems in connection with

             the use of the stadium.    An example as to how these matters were dealt

             with can be seen by reference to a letter from the South Yorkshire County

              Fire Service (3-r33) to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding a
             ^test
           [/--which the Fire Service did of the emergency procedures at a match on 4th

             October, 1983.    There was particular concern that stewards could not hear

             the emergency procedure announcement on the public address system, which

             resulted in stewards failing to carry out their emergency procedure

             duties.   Consultations then took place between the Club and the Fire

             Officer (with reference to the County Council) which resulted in &Ee

             Sheffield City Council as Certificating Authority (with effect from

     44.     At the meeting of the General Purposes Panel on 3rd March, 1986 (which is

             a Sub-Committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme

             Committee of the City Council) a report was considered from the Head of
                                                                           f,!)&<■;•aq)

             Panel adopted the recommendations contained in the report which were:-

                   (a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports

                         Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel.


                   (b)   The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be

                         delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in

                         consultation with the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the Panel or of

                         the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as

                         appropriate.


                   (c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

                         delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.       The

                         Panel's decision was subsequently confirmed by a full meeting of the

                         City Council which took place on 9th April, 1986.



          45.      The General Purposes Panel considered a more detailed report on the Act

                   Review of the Administrative System

          46.      At its meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel

                   considered a report ($cc.2(q ) on the future administration of the Council's

                   Certificating function.


          47.      The report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority, will

                   act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service), the

                   question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.       In this

                   respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

                   Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

                   the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the

                   Department of Health and Consumer Services.    Both the Building Surveyor's

                   Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

                   existing Council structure.   It was envisaged that the Advisory Group

      HB4AAA/JJJ

                 would function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most

                 regular use would probably be the discussionis of advice to the Council

                 before •they' were finally formulated by the appropriate Authority.


       48.       It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

                 request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

                 Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

                 list of items to be discussed.    At the conclusion of the meeting a further

                 list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to he

                 taken by each Authority would be noted.      It was then envisaged that

                 detailed written advice would be provided by each discipline and acted

                 upon as appropriate.


U      ,50.      The report went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

                 Authority:-


                 Authority                           Area of Responsibility

                 The Building Surveyor,              All matters relating to the structure
                 (Sheffield City Council)            of stadia, including crush barriers,
                                                     walls, etc.

                                                     access of emergency vehicles and
                                                     emergency planning.


        50.      It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

                 would have an input into the Advisory Group on:- aspects of general

                 safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items

                 such as first aid requirements.    These lists were of course not

                 exhaustive and several of the functions overlapped.


        51.      The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

                 that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried

                 out each year.   It was noted that the proposal was in line with the


    HB4AAA/JJJ

              Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other areas.


        52.   The Panel approved the revised administrative system which therefore came

              into effect immediately and delegated all routine matters in connection

              with that system to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.                      The

              system remains in effect.


        53.   The report was seen in draft by all the interested officers and its

              proposals modified in the light of comments made.            Prior to the

              preparation of the report the administrative system was discussed at
                                                              pvAg>o$6s4   jVAw.liS’i i   ».   Ad\/\S.cv-j C ^fau^ .

              Role of the Administration and Legal Department
              in the Certification System

        54.   The basic role of the Department is to co-ordinate the administration of

              the Certification System and also to keep the records of it.

                               i?
        55.   An example (5-t13) of an Agenda and notes of a meeting are attached, dated

              28th April, 1988, which shows the sort of items discussed at the Advisory

              Group.

              The Inspection System operated by Sheffield City Council

        56.   Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

               and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

               authorities.     Inspections have taken place on the following dates
\                                                  :
    \         7th August, 1986 ^rl58}'; 6th August, 1987 {4.45):’: 19th May, 1988 (4.72).

        57.   Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

               Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and Consumer

               Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.         Often, the Club is

               represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

               another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

               The inspection is carried out by the various officers who meet at the

               ground and then disperse to various areas in which their particular

               interest lies.

  58.     The Officers can draw points to each other's attention during the

             inspection and Club representatives are sometimes asked for

             information.


   59.    If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

             taken to secure its rectification.                  If rectification is not possible prior

             to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

             to issue a Prohibition Notice, if appropriate.


   60.       Officers at the conclusion of the inspection write to the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department setting out their comments on matters

             which ought to be raised with the Club.                           These are then collated and

             discussed with the officers (when necessary at an Advisory Group) and

             finally formulated into a list which is sent to the Club for action.


   61.       As an example, a copy of Officers'                comments following the 1987 inspection
                                                          Vff*- ■I f

   62.       The actual time spent on background! inspection usually exceeds two man

             days per year.   This does not include the subsequent administrative work

             or the consideration of proposals submitted by sports ground owners.                            Home
                                    [D S c   If)
             Office Circular 72/1987^states that inspections are not expected to take

             more than about two man days per ground on average.


                                      The role of the Home Office

    63.      The Home Office is the Central Government Department which is responsible

              for safety of sports grounds.             Its functions can be described in brief as

              follows:


              (a)   To advise Parliament on legislation;

              (b)   To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
                    and to offer guidance;



HB5AAA/JJJ
          (c)    To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to
                 inspections); and

          (d)    To issue the "Green Guide" which is an advisory document to assist
                 the improvement of safety standards at sports grounds.


                   The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
                   and the Popplewell Report

  64.        The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,
                 0>ffc
             1985 (-3-S-8-9) outlining the certification system in operation throughout the

             County.     The press release went on to say that   the forthcoming "Summer"

             inspections will take into account the lessons      of the recent tragic event

             at Bradford and any revised advice and requirements which may be issued by

             the Home Office. (3.89).     On 13th May, 1985 the South Yorkshire County

             Council sent a letter to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday
           Voc
     ,v   (3-^-9Q) enclosing a copy of the press release and stressing that it is

             vitally necessary for safety stewards to be fully aware of and trained in

             their duties on the manning and opening of doors and gates on egress

             routes and in the use of fire fighting equipment.


   65.    The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again         to Sheffield Wednesday on
                                     5s')
             9th August, 1985 (,1.-112) indicating that the Interim Report of the

             Popplewell Inquiry had been produced and advice had been received from the

             Home Office.     The letter drew attention to a review on the evacuation

             procedures in consultation with the Police and the Fire Service and also

             to the duties of safety stewards.      It also indicated that the Police

             and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in training stewards.

             Detailed comments were also made about the first aid facilities at the

              stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.       There

             was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

             materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently
                                                Dspc ?a
              displayed.     The Club responded (3.116) to the County Council's letter of

              14th August and comments were made about steward training procedures which

              were to be reviewed before the next home match.

   66.       The Sheffield City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday on 15th October,

             by H. M. Government following the Popplewell Report drawing attention to

             the new Guide and particularly to Chapter 2, which is entitled "Management

             Responsibility".   The letter asks Sheffield Wednesday to confirm in

             writing that the Club intends to retain a copy of the revised Green Guide

             on the premises and that they should take immediate steps to appoint a

             safety officer as defined in Chapter 2.    The Club responded to that letter

             on 23rd October, 1987 (          ) confirming that a copy of the Guide was

   67 .      On 7th April, 1981 the Officer Working Party (2.59) inspected the

             Sheffield Wednesday Stadium, bearing in mind that an F.A. Cup Semi-Final

             was to take place on 11th April, 1981.

             April, 1981 C2-r61~) outlining an incident which took place at the Leppings

             Lane end of the ground at the Semi-Final Match on 11th April, that year.

             It is noted that there were injuries to spectators because of crushing.

             The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it appears that the

             crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late due to

             travelling problems and rushing to their places after the game had

             commenced, thereby causing problems to spectators at the front of the

             terracing who had been in the ground for a considerable length of time.

             The turnstile readings indicated 335 persons in excess of the

             capacity for Leppings Lane end which was the result of Tottenham fans

             having purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival at turnstile

              'N1 (in Penistone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were

             directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

             were standing.        Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. John

             Ambulance for minor ailments and at the Royal Hallamshire and Northern

             General Hospitals 8 spectators were treated.             According to the Police,

             three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

             unspecified injuries.        The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

             both inside and outside the stadium was very good.

             incident.


   70.       Mr. Brownlow, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, wrote to the
                                                                      (Per*-
        v    Secretary of the Football Association on 3rd June, 1981 (2.68)

             commenting in detail on the incident at the match on 11th April.              The

             Chief Constable starts by noting the basic facts relating to the stadium

             and indicating that there had been many similar Semi-Final matches at

             Hillsborough without previous incident.              The Police apparently envisaged

             difficulties prior to the match because both sets of supporters would need

             to use the Ml motorway.         There were a number of problems which slowed down

             the arrival of spectators, namely a major road accident, a coach breaking

             down and extensive road works.         These resulted in Tottenham Hotspur fans

             being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.              This all resulted in

             ".     .     .   a sudden influx of large numbers of football supporters to the

             Wednesday, or the Football Association about this situation and the mixing

             of supporters was not properly catered for.       Some 400 Tottenham fans had

             to be removed from the kop and accommodated in the Leppings Lane end.


   72.       According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early

             took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

             the Leppings Lane enclosure " . . .   thereby creating a jamming effect at

             the extremeties of it . . ."   The late arrivals then caused a problem

             because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

             Hotspur had scored an early goal.     The resulting injuries included broken

             arms, legs and crushed ribs.   It is noted that some 38 people received

             treatment.   The pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane

             enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

             perimeter track to relieve pressure.      Police Officers also refused access

             to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

             the crushing problem.   In Mr. Brownlow's view, no other course of action

             could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


   73.       Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

             had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

             similar events.


                     The installation of, and alterations to, the radial fences
                     on the Leppings Lane terrace

             The 1981 Proposals

                   Sec
   Y         1981 (2,Sfy) indicating that ". . . w e have been instructed by the Club to

             organise the installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the

             Leppings Lane end of the ground . . .".        It was noted that the intention

             of these fences was to divide the terrace into approximately three equal

             areas, each served by its own entrance.        The object of dividing the




HB5AAA/JJJ
terrace was to exercise more control over supporters and for example, a

visiting team with only a few followers would be allocated one section

with the other two sections retained for home suppoers.   A 1.15 metre wide

gate was proposed at the rear of each fence, to give access for

maintenance and also policing during the game.   The gates could be left

open, but fastened back to connect the areas during the game if

appropriate. In order to preserve spectators' views Eastwoods recommended

that the top of the fence should be approximately 1680 mm above the

terrace.   It was noted that a fence of this height would not prevent

individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should eliminate a

mass "invasion" from one area to another.   Apparently, fences of this

height worked successfully at St. James' Park (the Newcastle United

ground).   The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2 and 3.

On 9th September, 1981 (2-r85) Eastwoods wrote to the County Council

indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in early October,

subject to their being no objections from the Council.    Eastwoods

indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be received by

23rd, 24th or 25th September.

The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September CZ^-87-)

considered the question of the proposed new radial barriers on the west

terrace.   It was noted that there were drawbacks to the division of the

terrace into three equal areas, but the Working Party felt that increased

control on the terrace should result.   A "for instance" was quoted in that

there could well be problems with opposing fans mixing at the rear of the

west stand and/or the final exit gates, but the Police considered that

they could cope with these problems.


The adequacy and positioning of the gates was discussed as well as the use

of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.   It was noted that the

plans did not indicate the headroom which would be available at the rear

          of the terrace should the radial barriers and gates be installed.               The

          Working Party agreed that there was no objection to the proposals subject

          to further calculations as required by the Building Authority being

          satisfactory, confirmation of the headroom at the rear of the terrace and

          those gates being under Police control.              The County Council wrote to

             January, 1982 about, amongst other things, the new radial fencing at

             Leppings Lane.       It is confirmed in the letter that the fences are working

             well, but since there have been no large games which resulted in the whole

             of the terracing being occupied by one group of fans.             The Chief Constable

             goes on to say that as crush barriers penetrate or come close to the new

             radial fencing, fans could climb over them.            Also, it was noted that there

             were some ".     .    .   dangerous pieces .      .   ." protruding from the cut off

             ends of some barrier rails.        The County Council wrote (2^'Tj?8) to Eastwood

             and Partners indicating that the radial fences appear to be working

             satisfactory and also outlining the Police views on them.

             the radial fence, but it would be unacceptable to leave a gap along side

             each radial fence completely free of crush barriers as that would present

             a major hazard.       The Police comment on the dangerous peices of rails is

             noted.

                                                                          c V 'jtj

              Police views on the barriers was again discussed.            It was however, agreed

              that the existing arrangement was necessary and the problem of fans

              climbing over from one pen to another would have to be lived with.             It was

              agreed to review the issue at the end of the current season.

                   modification to the Leppings Lane end was prepared and shown on drawing

                   6705/2 which involved the construction the two new banks of turnstiles and

                   various runs of fencing and new gates.

                   They were agreed, subject to a number of conditions.

                    satisfactory, providing the gates have minimum widths as indicated on the

                    plan enclosed with the letter.       The Fire Service also mentioned that it

                   was understood that these gates would be supervised either by the Police

    \   84.        Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 8th May (3*87) and

                    indicated that several of the points made had already been incorporated

                    into the latest scheme.        Eastwoods say in the letter:- ".       .       .   However I

                    would ask that further consideration should be given to the request in

                    radial barrier and for the new radial barrier which you have asked for to

                    have two gates.     If these gates meant for use in emergency it would mean

                    having a steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which

                    would hardly be justified.        It is our view that in the event of emergency,

             spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the gates on to the pitch

             and by the normal exit gates at the rear.                   We will of course be prepared

             to discuss the matter with the Fire Officer's staff should you so wish

             indicating that the Police were prepared to concede the request for two

             gates per radial fence, provided that the remainder of the points raised

             by the Officer Working Party were incorporated.


   86.       Subsequently, Eastwood & Partners submitted a further detailed proposal

             for a revised layout of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th

             noted the progress of works to segregate supporters at the Leppings Lane

             end of the ground and on the terrace.          The Working Party agreed "(b) that

             the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be extended

             or have steps to provide easy of access from the new two metre wide gap

             formed by the new radial fence; (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter

             fence should be provided from the south central terrace pen".          There are

             several other comments about general matters in the west terrace.


   89.       At a meeting at the Police Sports and Social Club at Niagra, Sheffield,

             the Officer Working Party on 13th November C3-rl28) considered the Club's

             proposals in relation to various projects at the stadium.          It was also

             noted that the Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the

             merging of spectators at the Leppings Lane.          The Working Party noted that

             it was difficult to see how this could be overcome as any physical

             restraint could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present

             situation to continue.        When notified of these problems by the County

    V        Council in a letter of 14th November (3.129) they found it very difficult

             to envisage anything more which could be done at reasonable expense.

             well on by far the majority of occasions.          Other minor matters were

             referred to in relation to advertising hoardings, spalling concrete and

             the north west terrace.


   91.       Although there are few later references to the Leppings Lane terraces in

             the file, it should be remembered that the stadium was inspected annually.

    92.         On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of

                the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates that in the north west corner

                of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

                pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should
                                                                       (p # c   6* J

                the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.   It was noted that the Club had received

                quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete at the north west

                terrace, which will be considered shortly.     The Working Party also heard

                the Club outline the consideration it was giving to the siting of caravans

                outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell

                tickets.   It was hoped that if this took place, increased entry flow of

                spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the

                turnstiles.

                the concreting at the north west terrace had been attended to by injecting

                material from the top.    The results had been satisfactory, except in two

                small areas where water seepage had taken place and which would receive

                further attention.

were alluded to on 21st February, 1983 at a Working Party meeting. (3-.il)


On 8th September, 1982 the annual inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium

was carried out by the Officer    Working Party        ) and it was noted that

the two radial fences had been    installed on the Leppings Lane terrace.

The fact that the crush barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace had been

tested was noted by the Officer Working Party on 11th August, 1983
           <£u?c. 6?
(3-4-25) which testing had completed the first cycle of crush barrier

testing at the stadium.     There was also mention of water seepage again at
                                                    yO
the north west terrace.   On 29th August, 1983 (3^29), Dr. Eastwood copied

a letter to the County Council confirming the testing of crush barriers at

the Leppings Lane End of the Ground and amongst other things, certified

that in his opinion "... the various structures on the Ground are in a

satisfactory condition and are appropriate forthe Stadium to be used        to

the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of Ground Safety..."


The former A.R.P.   building adjacent to the boundary wall near to Gate 'C'

of the Leppings Lane entrances to the stadium was in the process of being

demolished when the Officer Working Party visited the stadium on 29th

February, 1984 (3.-41).   Once again, water seepage was noted on that day at

the north west terrace.     In June, 1984 the crush barriers at the north

west corner were tested by the Club's Consulting Engineers (Eastwood &
           fiiftf it
Partners) (3.52) and (3 .54) .


It was noted that there was some cracked brickwork at the rear of the west

stand and that there were damaged angled support brackets to the pitch

security fence at the front of Leppings Lane terrace, at an Officer

       100.   There was some discussion at an Officer Working Party meeting on 23rd

        \ ■   January, 1985 C3L.77-) about the segregation of home and visiting supporters

              at the rear of the west stand at certain matches by erecting temporary

              barriers.   It was noted that it was policy of the Police to aim for the

              exclusive use by visiting supporters of the west stand and terrace.      The

              Working Party agreed that the Club should consider a scheme for permanent

              barriers at the rear of the stand subject to the necessary approvals.       It

              was also noted that the cracked brickwork previously mentioned should

              continue to be monitored and that the apparent rusting of steel columns at

              the rear of the stand should receive appropriate treatment.

                                  f\u£
       101.   There are no other .fire references in respect of the Leppings Lane End of

              the Sports Ground other than those dealt with elsewhere in the statement.

              It should also be noted that inspections were /also/ taking place on a

              regular basis throughout this period.


                               Further Comments on the Certificating System


       102.   At the time the current Safety Certificate was issued, the terms and

              conditions contained therein were those thought by the South Yorkshire

              County Council on the advice of the various interested parties to be

   /          necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of spectators at the

              sports ground.    There is no evidence from the files that the Certificate

              Holder or any other interested party has appealed to the Secretary of

              State (up to 1st January, 1988) or to a Magistrates' Court (thereafter) in

              respect of the Certificate Conditions.


       103.   Section 2(4) of the 1975 Act indicates that the Safety Certificate must

              have attached to it a plan and the terms and conditions must be framed by

              reference to it, where appropriate.     Paragraph 5 of the General Safety

              Certificate refers to plans.    Under Schedule 1 of the Certificate, the

              definition of plans is "document or documents attached to and forming part



HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                                  -30-


               of the General Safety Certificate and signed by the person signing the

               Certificate".          When the files were handed over to the Sheffield City

               Council in April, 1986 a copy of the General Safety Certificate for

               Hillsborough was in an envelope, together with a number of plans, none of

               which were signed by Mr. Mallett (the original signatory of the

               Certificate).          The original Safety Certificate and plans are lodged with

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited (the Holder).


       104.    Under Section 3(3) of              the 1975 Act applications for Certificates had to be

               copied to the Police,              the Fire Authority and the Building Authority.

                Sheffield Wednesday applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September,
                     (l>et c)
                1978 (L-i?^}. Copies of the application were sent to the Building

  J,           1.82 a&dl,83) relating to consultations with other parties was also

               complied with.          There was no formal notice issued by the County Council

               requiring the Holder to supply further information to enable it (the

               Council) to determine the terms and conditions of a Certificate.                The

               matter was dealt with in lengthy correspondence and by consultation.


       105.    The amendment and replacement of Certificates is governed by Section 4 of

               the 1975 Act and the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976, which were
  )
               superseded on 1st January, 1988 by the Safety of Sports Grounds

               Regulations 1987.


       106.    The 1975 Act provides that a local authority may, if it feels it

               appropriate to do so, amend a Safety Certificate by notice in writing to

               its holder or replace it.               A Safety Certificate may be amended or replaced

               either with or without the application of the Holder of the Certificate.

                 the notice.    The Regulations make further provision with regard to the

                 amendment of the Certificates.     Regulation 7 provides that where a local

                 authority issues or amends the said Certificate it shall forthwith give

                 notice in writing of the issue or amendment . . .         to all specified

                 interested parties and any unspecified interested parties known to the

                 local authority.    In addition, the local authority in giving notices must

                 inform the persons to whom notice is given that a copy of the Safety

                 Certificate and the application for the grant, amendment or replacement .

                         may be inspected and where and at what time such inspection may be

                 made.    In addition,   the local authority must publish a notice in a

                 newspaper as soon as maybe after the amendment of the Certificate with the

                 information referred to in the last sentence.


        107.     On 3rd September, 1981 the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

                 resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

                 Certificate by replacing Conditions 10 and 26 of the Safety Certificate.

                 The amended Condition 10 contains slight wording differences to the

                 original.     Condition 26 varied the time limits in relation to

                 electrical certificates.      There is no evidence from the file that these

                 revised conditions were in fact properly brought into effect.

                                                       T>oc      ?
V       108-     At a meeting on 21st August, 1986 (3.1~71~) the City Council's General

                 Purposes Panel resolved to amend the capacity of the Spion Kop at

                 Sheffield Wednesday to 21,000 spectators.      The Panel agreed to amend the

                 Certificate on the basis of a number of conditions, one of which related

                 to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until such certain works

                 on crush barriers on the new spion kop were completed.        This condition

                 related to two matches.      The amendment to the Certificate only affected

                 the capacity at the Spion Kop end of the ground and had no effect

                 whatsoever on any other parts of the ground.        The Inquiry has prompted a

                 review of this amendment and it transpires that no notice was inserted in



    HB5AAA/JJJ

             a newspaper in connection with this amendment; as previously rehearsed the

             notice would have set out the amendment and detailed where the Certificate

             could be inspected.    The Panel's deliberations attracted considerable

    }(       publicity and copy of a          report^ is attached to this Statement

    y        (     tiff ).   Additionally, the General Safety Certificate is regarded as a

             public document and it seems to me that the spirit of the legislation has

             been more than adequately met.

                                                                                                   pat tt-
   109.      On 1st December, 1986 the General Purposes Panel resolved (3-r20#) to amend

             Schedule 1 of the Certificate so as to extend the definition of specified

             activity to include Royal visits.         Again, the notice provisions of the

             legislation were not observed.


   110.      Under Section 5 of the Act interested parties may appeal against or about

             the terms and conditions in a Certificate and the Council's refusal to

             amend or replace it.     According to the files, there have been no appeals.


   111.      The Certificate Holder must give notice to the Council if he intends to

             alter or extend the sports ground or any of its installations (if that

             alteration or extension is likely to affect the safety of persons at the

             ground).    To the best of my knowledge, this Section has been complied with

             by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club; the developments which have taken                                          i   )

             place have been the subject of lengthy correspondence in each case.


    112.     The Council as Certificating Authority may issue a Prohibition Notice

             under Section 10 of the Act if it feels there is a serious risk to

             spectator safety.     No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of

             Sheffield Wednesday.


    113.     It is the duty of the Council under Section 10B(1) of the Act to arrange

             for the inspection of stadia at least once every 12 months.                                At its

             meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel noted the

             details contained in a report by the Head of Administration and Legal

             Department about the operation of the Council's certification function for

             the safety of sports grounds.          One of the details mentioned in the report

             relates to inspections and the proposal that one large scale inspection

             per stadium should be carried out.           In fact the report itself does not

             make clear my intention that these inspections should be annual.            My

             intention at the time, and the Council's practice since has been to

             inspections which proposal was in line with both the Popplewell Report and

             with licensing practice in other areas.             I am aware that the Fire Service

             visit the sports ground and of course the Police are present during most

             specified activities.

             Sheffield Wednesday - The Up to Date Position

   117.   On Wednesday, 10th May, 1989 the annual inspection of the ground

             commenced.    Police Officer, Fire Officers and Council Officers from the

             Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building Surveyor's Division

             and the Administration and Legal Department.     Detailed enquiries are being

             made of Sheffield Wednesday pursuant to the inspection.


             Response to comments made by the Treasury Solicitor in a letter dated the
             9th May, 1989

             Potential Danger on the Leppings Lane Terraces


   118.   In the earlier part of my statement I refer to the full history of

             discussions and decisions between the interested parties (the Police, Fire

             Service, the Building Authority and the Club, and its Consulting

             Engineers) leading up to and following the installation of the radial

             fences on the Leppings Lane terrace.     It will be recalled that the

             installation of fences took place in two distinct stages in 1981 and 1985.

             The result of these discussions and decisions is the creation of the pens

             at the Leppings Lane terrace.    It is clear from the correspondence on

             file, which is particularly referred to in my statement, that the fences

             were erected only after careful and thorough consideration by the

             appropriately qualified experts.


  119.       In early 1985 the Club, via their Consulting Engineers, Messrs. Eastwoods

             & Partners, submitted proposals to alter the Leppings Lane end of the

             ground and to construct two new radial fences on the Leppings Lane

              terrace.    I propose to deal with only the radial fences at this stage.

             The reasons for the additional fences on the Leppings Lane terrace involve

                     the better supervision by the Police of spectators, both entering and

                     leaving the sports ground.           Once again, full and careful consideration was

                     given to the proposals by the County Council involving the Police, the

                     Fire Service, the Building Authority, the Club and its Consulting

                     Engineers.         There is correspondence on file dealing with the positioning,

                     width and proposed stewarding of the gates in the radial fences.            Full

                     details of these discussions are related in the earlier part of my

                     statement.


     120     .       As far as the Green Guide is concerned, paragraphs 101 to 103 (in Chapter

                     8) refer to the division of spectator accommodation.            These paragraphs of
 /
                     the Guide are drafted in general terms.            There is no evidence on the file

                     to suggest that the penning arrangements at Leppings Lane conflict with

                     the general statements contained in the Guide.           Obviously, the pens were

                     constructed over a number of years, and were installed and approved

                     in that situation by all the interested parties I have already listed.


      121        .   There is no evidence on the files to suggest that provided the capacity

                     limits for the Ground and the Safety Certificate Conditions were complied

                     Means of egress onto the pitch from the Leppings Lane Terrace

     122     .       There is no clear record on the files as to when the pitch perimeter fence

                     at Hillsborougih was in fact installed, but it appears to have been in

                     place when the County Council first looked at the stadium from the point

                     of view of a Certificating Authority.


     123.            According to the files, the pitch perimeter gates at Leppings Lane were

                     next considered in 1985 when the second radial barrier development was

                     considered.         It was agreed by the Officer Working Party and the Club and

                     its representatives that one pitch perimeter fence gate was to be provided

                     per pen.

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                 -36-



  124.       There is no information on the files relating to whether or not the pitch

             perimeter gates should be signed.


  125.       The means of access laterally between the pens on the Leppings Lane

             terrace are the gates at the top of each radial fence immediately adjacent

             to the west stand wall.   The gates are so designed so that when they are

             open a clear 1.15 metre opening remains.    The gates should be attended

             either by stewards or the Police.  (See the letter from South Yorkshire
                                                                       DtVC
             County Council to Eastwood & Partners of 30th July, 1983


  126.       There are no gangways as such on the Leppings Lane Terrace.     Annex 'A' of

             the Green Guide defines gangways as being channels for the passage of

             spectators through a terrace running across the slope (lateral gangway) or

             running with the slope (radial gangways).     Paragraph 96 of the Guide

             indicates that the aim should be to ensure that every spectator on the

             terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit so that they can move

             quickly on to exit routes at the end of an event or in the event of an

             emergency.   In fact, owing the the pen size, spectators within the

             Leppings Lane pens should not be more than 12 metres away from an exit.


  127 .      All the proposed major alterations to the terraces have been considered by

             the Working Party and subject to full and careful consideration by all the

             interested parties.


             Directional Signs in relation to access to the ground

  128.       There has been criticism about the adequacy of directional signs within

             the stadium which would lead people to gain access to pens other than the

             two central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace.     The point is made that

             fans entering through the turnstiles could only see the tunnel which leads

             to the two central pens and no other signs.     There is in fact one small

             directional sign to the right of the west stand which says "standing".




HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -37-



  129.       It is appropriate to point out that matters relating to the actual flows

             of spectators on match days are matters on which the Council would need to

             take advice, either from the Club or the Police.      Obviously, where exit

             routes need to be signed, the Fire Service also has an involvement.        There

             is no record on any of the files that there was any inadequacy in signing

             arrangements for the terrace at Leppings Lane and had it been a

             significant factor i would have expected that the matter would have been

             brought up by the Police or the Club.       The provision of signing is not

             usually a complex or expensive task.     It must be borne in mind that the

             direction of spectators on match days is largely the responsibility of

    )        stewards with some involvement from the Police.


             The siting/strength of crush barriers.,in the pen             .•

   129.      On 7th August, 1986* the Sheffield Wednesday Fdo'tball Club was subject

             to an annual inspection.     During the course of this annual inspection I

             recall that the Police representative requested that crush barrier number

             144 be reduced so that the persons entering the terrace from the tunnel

             would not be obstructed by it.    Apparently, there had been some

             difficulties in this area.     The barrier itself penetrated the central

             radial fence immediately in front of the tunnel.       The barrier was indeed

             removed with the result that barrier 144 now contains only one section,

             that is in the north central pen (see plan 1610/64E).       The barrier

             question was considered at the time of the inspection in the presence of

             representatives from the Fire Authority, the Police, the Building

             Authority and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners, the Club's Consulting

             Engineers.   No problems with this revised barrier arrangement have been

             brought to my attention.


   130.      I should, however, point out that no written record of the decision to

             remove the barrier is noted on the file.      I can, however, say that I

             the remember the discussion and that none of the persons present objected

             to the removal of the barrier.

  .131.      As far as the strengthof the barriers is concerned, they      were tested by

   ■^1       Messrs. Eastwood & Partners on 14th, 15th, 18th and 19th July, 1988 and

       V     the report         is attached to this statement.      There were one or two

             defects discovered on the test which are noted in Eastwoods1 letter which

             were remedied during 1988.      All the barriers in the two central pens were

             tested and found to meet the Green Guide strength standards.

             The Access Tunnel to the Leppings Lane Terrace

  ^.33.      This tunnel which runs      beneath the west terrace is not of a constant

             gradient and at the end increases to a 1:6 on the approach to the terrace

             itself.


   134.      The files in my possession indicate that there have been no discussions

             about the tunnel itself.      No complaints have been received about the

             tunnel.   As far as I am aware there have been no problems with the tunnel

             and as it has been used for many years by many thousands of spectators

             without apparent difficulty or incident.       There is no evidence from the

             files that problems have arisen.

             Access for emergency vehicles

   136.      The Fire Service has commented (16th May, 1979) that adequate

 y-)         roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct access can be

             obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of the stadium.        They

             also mention that it was necessary to ensure that parked vehicles would

             not obstruct this access.      I understand that the Fire Service only require

             vehicular access to the exterior of each building in the football ground.

                the   Club would in consultation with the Fire Service and the Police mark

                out   a lane from the       main gates to the south stand in        which parking would

                not   be allowed.     It     was also agreedthat the hydrant        outsidethe south

                stand would have to be kept clear.       The Police noted on 26th March, 1980

        V       (i^-45-) that they did not have any current problems in        relation to the

                access for emergency vehicles.      Access for ambulances   does not feature

                prominently in the files.

                enable fire engines to get to the pitch area.       The Fire Service responded
                                                                                          boctum   *~T   ( !

                to this at an Officer Working Party meeting (22nd January, 1986 - 3-ri41)

                by saying that whilst they felt that such a facility was not essential for

                their purposes it could be useful for use by emergency vehicles in certain

                situations and should generally be supported.       Towards the end of 1986,
                                                            Doc
                (letter from Eastwoods 18th December, 1986 - 3-*-2±fr)' the Club submitted

                proposals for creating a new entrance to the Sports Hall off Penistone

                Road so that the public would no longer have to use gate '0' , (Plan No.                       J\   -r   T

                ).    Another     purpose of the development was to provide separate access for

                Police vehicles, ambulances, etc,       on match days; the proposal effectively

                reduced dangers which could result from vehicles having to pass

                spectators to gate 'O'.       This development did take place.     As I

                am not aware of the evidence on which the criticism about emergency

                vehicle access       is based, it is difficult to comment further.     Obviously,

                if that evidence is forthcoming, I can give further consideration to this

                question.       I understand that meetings have taken place between the Police,

                the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service on the emergency evacuation

                 comments were made:-

                  (a)   The walls of the first aid room should be lined with a suitable
                        non-combustible and easily cleaned material, which would not need to
                        be redecorated.

                  (b)   Lockable storage facilities for blankets, stretchers, etc. were to be
                        provided.

                  (c)   A telephone point was to be provided in the first aid room.

                  (d)   The floor was to be of easily cleanable material (such as quarry
                        tiles, etc.)

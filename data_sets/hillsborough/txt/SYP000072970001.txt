                cost me £6.00              and was     for    the Leppings Lane             standing area at           the

          I could not see any             police officers         or stewards        now    in this are a and

                    and I then w a l k e d freely through the tunnel,                       keeping       to the

          left    hand side and e n t e r e d the t W a c e s            in the     pen ma rk ed 4 on the

          referen ce map.

          Having     entered the         pen,    we made    our w ay to the first            crush barrier            on

          the    right       handside w here      I saw a tall,        well    built man to my            left who

          was    obv io us ly suf fe ri ng       considerable       disco mf or t    in that he was

          p res se d against        the barrier.          Ho wa rd and    I ducked u n de rn ea th the

          barrier      staying      down there for about 30 seconds,                   not being able           to go

          b ackwards         or forwards.        E v e n t u a l l y we m a n a g e d to stand up in front            of

          the    barrier and        in an effort         to try and help the man we,               w it h others

          t ried to      push him bac kw ar ds awa y from the              barrier.        However,         in trying

          to do this,          we only s u c c ee de d    in pushing      ourselves        further       down the

          ter ra ci ng and because we were                pushing wit h our arms we             created a gap

          in front       of us w hi ch was        quic kl y filled.

          At this      point,      it was    becoming an e x t r e m e l y tight        crush and having

          t ur ne d a wa y from the          pitch to help the man,            we found that            in it ia ll y we

          did not have the            room to turn back again.

          I looked upwards           to the stands where            I could see three            police      officers

sta nd in g   d i re ct ly above me.          I could not       identify them but at                    least

two of them were            sergeants.        I shou te d to them          "There are            people

getting       crushed down here"            but whet he r    or not       they heard me            I cannot

say.     T h e y d i d n ’t look     in my dir ec ti on and a pp e a r e d to be

looking       towards      the front of the terracing.

I w o u l d add at this        point      that when        I first went onto the terraces,

both teams were            on the    pitch but the game had not started.                           From this

point    I was      not aware       of any    players a c t i v i t y as      I was        too    concerned

w it h helping myself and others.

Eventually         having    turned    round,                 and I made our way down towards

the front         of the    pert, by the      right    hand side dividing                fence,     where

there s eemed to be far              less    pushing and shoving.                 We a c h i e v e d this

partly t hro ug h m a n o e v e r i n g     through the       crowd but ma in ly            because       the

people      corning into the         pen behind forced us towards                    the    front.

            and    I ended up just          in front       of the foremost,           right       hand    crash

b arrier w i t h i n 2 yards         of the dividing          fence and 3-4 yards                 of the

peri me ter       fence.     I then noticed a youth about 20 years                          of age

crou ch ing       on the dividing         fence to my        right    very    close        to the

p erimeter        fence,    leaning    into Pen 4 trying             to    pull    people        out.

T he re were       several    young    girls and one teenage                lad nearby who were

b ecoming      hysterical      an d shouting         for help.        A l t h o u g h the       crush was

severe,       I found that      I was able          to breathe       freely and at              no time did       I

p e rs o na l ly feel my      life was       in danger.        I tried to          reassure        those

a r o u n d me who were       distressed,        bas ic al ly by talking             to them,

I could see that            people were       being    pressed against             the     perimeter       fence

but the       police o ff icers       on the other side,             there were only two or

three were m o t i on in g wit h their arms                 for the       crowd to move           back.

H owever,      it became a pp a r e n t      that    the    pressure was          not going        to ease       up

and               stated he was        going     to attempt      to get out.               He    reached    up,

             c limbed back up the                   perimeter       fence.        He then bent       some of the spikes

             attempted           to pull me from the                crowd     but     Iwas we dg ed    in c ompletely and

             it p roved          impossible at             this   time.       There was a youth of about             16

             years        s tanding       i mm ed iately      in front        of me and I pushed him upwards               as

             reached the            foremost         barrier and the          crush became more           severe w i t h

             people        trying      to make        their way to          it.

             had got        down.

             girls a ged beteen                13-15 years.           I used my arms           to form a bridge        over

             them so that            they w o u l d        not get    crushed against            the fence and       I was

             a ware       of the scramble             nearby to get thro ug h the gate,                  I told the girls

             to stay w here            they were and that              they w ou ld be alright.

             A fter a couple of m i n ut es                  I felt    the    crowd     pressure      start   to ease and

             upon     passing         comment        to a lad to my          right,     he    replied that      people were

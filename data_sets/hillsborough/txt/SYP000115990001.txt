               At    the    above           football            match          I was       deputed        to       work       at       the    Leppings

              '^duty      from       approximately                   12    noon       (1200)        at    the          turnstiles.                 We       were

              ^instructed             to       search       all          fans       entering        the       ground,          these          being          the

               Liverpool             supporters.                 In       the       main    the     flow          of    supporters             were          in

               good       humour          and     general            searching             carried        out          without          problems.                 In

               the       initial          stages          there          was    a    considerable                 amount       of       canned          alcohol

               found       and       the       supporters                were       given     the    opportunity                   of       giving          it    up

               or    not    entering              the      ground.              Most       decided        to       hand       it       to    the    turnstile

               operators             as    a    gift.           As       the    kick       off     time       neared,          the          crowd       outside

               the       turnstiles             began       to       swell          from    the     orderly             line       of       about       3

               abreast          to    6    and       7    abreast.              All     the      turnstiles                 queues          then    merged

               into       one    crowd          in       front       of    the       turnstiles           and          it    became          impossible                to

               ensure       the       fans        had      the       correct          tickets        or       to       carry       out       any

               searching.                 The     crowd         was       pressing          forward           to       such    a       degree       that          I

               was       pinned       to       the       wall    at       the       side    of     the    turnstile                unable          to       move.

               Fortunately                I being          at    No.1          turnstile,           next          to    Gate       A    on    the       SWFG          map

               I was       able       to       force       my    way       out       and    go     towards             Leppings             Lane    where

             there       were        Mounted       Officers             and       inform             them       of    the       position.              The

             Mounted          Officers        came          to    the       front          of    the       queue        and      forced          the    fans

             back    into        some       sort       of    order          but       still          not       sufficient             to    search          or

             check       tickets           properly.

             There       was     a    large       artbunt         of    fans          that       had       the       wrong       tickets          for       the

             turnstiles              and    some       having          entered             the       stile        had      to    force          their       way

             out    causing           more    problems.                 Without             any       more        real      problems             the    game

             was    started           and    I and          PC    Hickman             stayed          at       our    turnstile             until       half

             time    for       any     late       comers.              There          was       a moderate              amount         of       these.           I

             recall        there       were       several          youths             who       had       no    tickets          and       they       were

             trying        all       sorts    of       tricks          to    get       in.           Producing             half       tickets,          that

             had    obviously              already          been       used       to       gain       entry          and    by    some          means       had

             been    brought           out    of       the       ground.              Despite             fans       wishing          to    get       in,    even

             to    pay ,      none     were       allowed          in w i t h o u t             the       requisite             ticket.

             At    half       time     1' e n t e r e d      the       ground          and       stood          at    point       S    on       the    map.

             There       was     no    other       incident             worthy             of    note          that     I can         recall.           I was

             right       at    the     back       of    the       crowd          until          about          10 m i n u t e s       before          full

             time    when        we    were       deployed             in    the       area          behind          the    West       Stand.           At

             this    time        as    the    crowd          were       leaving             the       seating           area,         they       had    to

             walk    down        two       covered          stairways             and       it       was       apparent          that       there       was       a

             lot    of     banging          and    kicking             going          off       as    the       sheeting          to       the    stairways

             was    bulged           and    dented.              Quite       a    number             of    youths          had    to       be    spoken          to

             and    advised           re    their       conduct.                 It    was       apparent             that       they       had       been

             drinking          alcohol        to       excess.

             When    the       crowd        had    subsided             we       as    a    Serial             continued          along          Leppings

             Lane    towards           Halifax          Road       and       supervised                   the     crowd.          Minor          public

             order       problems           were       encountered                these          being          dealt       with       by       advice.

                        HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND


                  FA SEMI-FINAL LIVEBPOOL v NOTTS FOREST SAT 9thAPRIL 1088


At the above football match I was deputed to work at the Leppings Lane end
turnstiles numbers 1 and 2 with |3c3223 Hickman. We were on duty from approx#
 12 noon at the turnstiles* We were instructed to search all fans entering
the ground,these being the Liverpool supporters. In the main the flow of
supporters were in good humour and general searching carried out without
problems. In the initial stages there was a aconsiderable amount of canned
alcohol found and the supporters were given the opportunity of giving it up
or not entering the ground# Most decided to hand it to the the turnstile
operators as a gift. As the kickoff time nearelt* the crowd outside the turnstiles
began to swell from the ordBely line of about 3 abreast to 6 and 7 abreast,
all the turnstile queues then merged into one crowd in front of the turnstiles
and it became immpossible to to ensure the fans had the correct tickets or to
carry out any searching, the crowd was pressing forward to such a degree that
I was pinned to the wall at the side of the turnstile unable to move. Fortunately
I being at No. 1 turnstile, next to Gate A on the S.W.F.G. map I was able to
force my way out and go towards Leppings Lane where there were Mounted Officers
and inform them of the position. The mounted officers came to the front of the
queue and forced the fans back into some sort of order but still net sufficient
to search or check tickets properly.
There was a large amonnt of fans that had the wrong tickets for the turnstiles
and some having entered the stile had to force theie way out causing more
problems. Without any more real problems the game was started and I and PC
Hickman stayed at our turnstile until half time for any late comers. There
was a moderate amount of thse. I recall there were several youths who had
no tickets and they were trying all sorts of tricks to get in. Producing
half tickets, that had obviously already been used to gain entry and by some
means had been brought (put of the ground* Despite fans wishing to get in,even
to pay, none were allowed in without the requiste tickejr.
At half time I enteral the ground and stood at point S on the map. There was
no other incident worthy of not«that I can refall.I was right at the back of the
crowd until about 10 minutes before full time when we were deployed in the area
behind the West Stand. At this time as the growd were leaving the seating area^
they had to walk down two covered stairways and it sras apparent that there was
a lot of banging and kicking going off as the sheeting to the stairways was
bulged and dented. Quiet a number of youths had to be spoken to and advised re thisr
conduct. It was apparent that they had been drinking alcoholto excess.
When the crowd had subsided we as a Serial continued along Leppings Lane towards
Halifax Rd and supervised the crowd. Minor public order problems were encountered
these being dealt with by advice.

FA SEMI FINAL LIVERPOOL V NOTTS FOREST SAT $TH APRIL 1988

The ingress of mounted police officers assisted greatly in alleviating the
crushing at the turnstiles where I was present, although it continued to be
tightly packed.

I could not give an indication that the problem was short lived. I would liken
the crowd to the flow of water from a tap which then ran down the plug hole.
The flow became greater and the turn stiles could not cope. i.e. the basin
would fill up. It was only when the flow of supporters to the stiles slowed
that the position eased,that to my recollection was a few minutes before kick off.

Having watched the video recordings of Leppings Lane end on National TV only,
it was apparent that the crushing in 1989 was far, far more severe and sustained
than in the previous year of 1988.

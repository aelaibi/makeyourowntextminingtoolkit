     The Prime Minister has asked me to reply to your letter of
5th September 1990 about the decision not to institute criminal
proceedings against any person following the Hillsborough
disaster.  I am sorry you have had to wait so long for a reply.

     The Prime Minister shares the continuing grief of those
whose friends and relatives died or were injured in the tragic
events at Hillsborough.  She understands why such a depth of
feeling persists well after the event, and she and other
Ministers are determined that all the lessons which can be
learned from the disaster and from the subsequent very thorough
report by Lord Justice Taylor are heeded so that such a tragedy
may never again occur.

     The Prime Minister recognises equally that the decision not
to institute against anyone criminal proceedings arising from the
Hillsborough tragedy has been a severe disappointment to you and
to others who have been bereaved.    Nevertheless she has to point
out that questions regarding prosecution in matters of this kind
are the ultimate responsibility of the Director of Public
Prosecutions.  He holds a statutory office which is independent
of the Government of the day, and is subject by statute only to
the superintendence of the Attorney General.  Our constitution
guards in this way against any risk of the criminal justice
system being manipulated for political purposes.  Accordingly
the decision in this instance, which the Prime Minister
understands to have been taken personally by the Director, is not
one which it would have been open   to the Government to have
sought to influence at any stage.

        I am sorry this reply cannot be more helpful.

/frDRAFT LETTER FROM PRIVATE SECRETARY TO THE PRIME MINISTER TO:

  Mrs P Joynes




                                           (L^A

  The Prime Minister has asked me to reply to your letter of 5th
  September      1990   about   the   decision      not   to   institute            criminal
  proceedings      against      any   person       following       the    Hillsborough
  disaster.


  The Prime Minister shares the continuing grief of those whose
  friends and relatives died or were injured in the tragic events
  at Hillsborough.  She understands why such a depth of feeling                                \
                                    , t f k . / v u ' ^ r u / <sv\i
  persists well after the event ;.and
                                 c    ls^ierself -anxlouo to ercauge
  :hat all the^ lessons which can be learned from the disaster and ^
  :he/ report           Lord Justice Taylor         are heeded }so that              such a
  :ragedy may never again occur.           ghe~~q'uesMon of prosp^vitioa-
 /however a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who, for
  sound   constitutional        reasons,   is       independent          of    Government
  although he      is answerable      to Parliament through the Attorney
  General under whose superintendence he discharges his duties.
                                                       /
  I understand that the Attorney General is writing tg/your Member
  of Parliament, Mr Martin Flannery, who has written to him about
                                                                   /
  the decision.


  I can however say that the decision tak^n by the Director was
  based on a careful consideration of a l ^ t h e evidence and relevant
  law   having    also    had   the   benefit At      advice       from       two    leading
                                               /
  counsel very experienced in criminal matters.                     The law relating
  to manslaughter has developed through common law rather than by
  statute and recognises the balance necessary between on the one
  hand ensuring that society is protected from risks arising from
  the grossly negligent ot reckless conduct of individuals and, on
  the other hand,        not/punishing individuals simply because they
                         /
have been unfortunate enough to be or c o n t r i b u t ^ t o the cause of
a tragic accident.       A person is liable to be/found guilty of
manslaughter    therefore    only if a fatal accident results               from
gross or reckless negligence on his part.               Efroadly speaking, it
is deliberate or gross neglect of rules and/safety considerations
rather   than   honest   errors      of   judgment/ which      could   lead   to
prosecution.    Each case has to be judged on its own merits and
the Director had the benefit of a thorough and detailed criminal
investigation carried out by the West/Midlands police as well as
the   very   full   report      by   Lord   /Justice     Taylor.       Careful
consideration    was    given   to   the position       of   all   those   whose
conduct could be regarded as having a bearing on the tragedy but
                             CN~ /
in the case of no individual organisation was there sufficient
                             A /
evidence to justify criminal proceedings.


I recognise that the Director's decision was disappointing to you
and hope that you will be -reassured that it was taken only after
the   most   thorough    consideration       of   all    the   evidence.       I
understand that the Attorney General himself concurs with the
decision that was takori.




                                                                                   <

I am writing to you regarding correspondence, from Mrs Patricia
Joynes, which was sent to the Home Office with a request for a draft
reply by today.  This correspondence was transferred to this office
for reply, arriving this morning.

It is in fact a matter for the Attorney General’s Office to whom I
have faxed a copy of the papers and they have agreed to take the
correspondence.

I notified your office this morning by telephone of the transfers in
view of the fact that you had requested a reply by today.

Dear Mrs Thatcher,
I am appealing as one mother to another mother for help and
mercy regarding the Director of Public Prosecution's decision
on the Hillsborough Tragedy.  I would like your opinion on the
following questions which have tormented me and other victims
families since the decision :

1.   How can one man alone make this       decision        after      Lord
     Justice Taylor's Inquiry Report ?

2.   How can the Police, who were in     charge   of   crowd    safety
      and control not be responsible ?

3.   Sheffield Wednesday Football    Club's ground was and is
      still not up to controlling crowd safety, i.e. they did
      not open the gates, nor did they close the tunnel. Why ?

4    Public safety must come first when lives are at risk.
     The week following the Tragedy I met with   you in the
     cript of the Anglican Cathedral when you promised there
     would be no "whitewash" of the Tragedy.   What happened
     to your promises ?

After 16 months of grief and heartbreak (a living hell) we
were presented with the DPP's decision.    As ordinary families
we find that it is a hard cross to bear to think that our
loved ones died and no one is responsible.

What has happened to British Justice ? Or is Justice only for
the rich and famous who can pay for it ?
                                                       /


 We are sad and broken families.   Please will you come and meet
 with some of the mothers to hear our pleas ?

 Yours sincerely,
                                           5th September 1990

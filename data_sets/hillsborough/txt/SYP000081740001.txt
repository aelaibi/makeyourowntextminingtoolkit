outside       the turnstiles who were            being a s ke d by various            supporters

where     to go.         I cannot    recall    seeing any stewards at this                point.        I

Once     inside      the Ground,      my colleague was         s e a r c h e r by a Police Officer.

We then bought our            programmes.        I checked o /s r      tickets     to see w h ic h way

to go.        We saw the signs         to the W standing area and there were

thro ug h the tunnel.

S h o r t l y after     this,      a m bu la nc es       started a rr iving and            parked behind the

goal area and I could see fans                           lying all    over      the    pitch        in a

d i st r e s s e d state.       By this          time the game had been stopped by the

referee and the            players           led o f f    the field.          At about       1520 hours        I saw

fans and Police Offi                          kicking down a sect io n of fencing                      to the       left

of the goal         post           this a pp ea r e d to help grea tl y w ith the fans

already       in the Pens a n d /ease              the     coj^pbstion.         I also       noticed fans were

taking      up a d v e r ti si ng h o a r d i n o a ^ a n ^ c a r r y i n g    fans away.

At about       1540 hours my cp'fleague who had a small                               radio w ith him told

me that      h e ’d heard a t ra ns m i s s i o n stating               there were five               people       dead

at the H i l l s b o r o u g h football            match.      That was w hen            I realised the

e no rmity of the trag ed y w h i c h had enfolded                        in front         of me.

I did not witness any                   person dying         in the     centre section but                  I do

recall      seeing      injured fans            or possibly even dead fans                    lying        in the

centre sect io n and on the footpall                         pitch.       I cannot give any

d e s c r i pt io n of these           people.

We   left    the Ground after                 hearing         at>rrouncement over the                 loudspeaker,

initiall y to         remain until             the EtasM^ertcy S er vices             had cleared,          and then

leave     in an orderly manner.                    This would be at a ro u n d               1630 hours,

I did not witness a ny thing which                         I consider w ou ld be a criminal

offence.

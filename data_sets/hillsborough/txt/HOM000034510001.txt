               Sir Cecil Clothier,
               10 Great George street,                  Cv? ft;
               London SWl                                          V f LC[cUy(f<^

               I am writing to request that you institute an immediate enquiry
               into the propriety of the remarks passed yesterday by Police
               Officers of the SouthYorkshire Police Force about the conduct of
               fans at the FA Cup Semi-Final at_JHijLlsborough on Saturday last •

               Given that the Home Secretary had announced the judicial enquiry
               into the disaster the day before, and the solicitor for 30 of the
               victims1 families had begun proceedings against the Chief
               Constable and his Force these remarks should never have been
               made.

               By what right did Police Officers make statements calculated to
               be prejudicial to the reputation of Liverpool football club and
               its supporters, and which seem to be part of a smokescreen of
               propaganda aimed at diverting attention from the truth.

               Lord Denning once said that "be they ever so mighty they are not
               mightier than the law". I trust that you will use your good
               offices to examine how such statements came to be, and on whose I<
               authority they were issued. Perhaps you would let me know what
               guidlines exist.

               What guidelines exist for the publication of statements once a
               judicial enquiry has been announced. I am copying this letter to
               the Rt Hon Douglas Hurd MP .

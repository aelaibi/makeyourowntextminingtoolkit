At    approximately                 2 . 5 5 pm    I went             up    to    the       Soutl\ jjr'yand to               have    a    look at

the    crowd.            I could          see     that          all       the    stands          w e r e ^ p a c ^ e d ^ f u l 1 of

South Stand              seats        and      I watched              the       kick       off.        I did       not       see    anything

unusual          at     this       stage       and        everything             appeared             to    be    normal.

After       th e      kick     of f      I went           back       down       to    the       rest^fdrant a n d              within         a few

Nottingham             Forest          supporter       came       up    to me       and       asked             if    I was          working

at    the    ground.              I told       him    that    1 was          a waitress              and         he       s a id,         "Don* t

             In relation to this matter I enclose a copy of the briefing the Director received on 18
             February indicating that the abuse of process argument had failed and as such it is
             anticipated that the case will proceed to trial in June of this year.

             Please let me know if you have any queries regarding this or require any further
             information at this stage.

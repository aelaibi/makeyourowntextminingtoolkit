I WAS WITH THREE OTHER MATES I DONT WANT TO GIVE THEIR NAMES AND ADDRESSES
WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION BUT I KNOW MY BEST MATE WILL BE RINGING IN
AFTER WE ALL GOT OUT OF THE STAND ONTO THE FIELD WE WERE RUNNING AROUND
SEEING IF WE COULD HELP ANYONE I MUST HAVE SEEN AT LEAST FIFTY DEAD PEOPLE
WE STARTED TO RIP DOWN THE ADVERT BOARDS AND CARRY THE INJURED ACROSS THE
PITCH TO WHERE THE AMBULANCES WERE EVEN THEY SEEMED TO BE CONFUSED.
i A s o THOUGHT THAT THE POLICE COULD HAVE HELPED MORE INSTEAD OF STANDING
AC^SS THE MIDDLE OF THE PITCH BUT I SUPPOSE THEY WERE DOING AS THEY WERE

FROM THE FRONT FENCING. AT ABOUT 2.50 PM I WAS WATCHING THE CENTRAL AREAS AS
I COULD SEE HOW PACKED THEY WERE. PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING THAT THEY WERE BEING
CRUSHED, PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OUT OF THE AREAS INTO THE SIDE PENS, PEOPLE
WERE ALSO GETTING LIFTED UP INTO THE STANDS ABOVE. OTHER PEOPLE WERE
ATTEMPTING TO CLIMB OVER THE FRONT FENCING, BUT AS THEY DID SO THE POLICE
JUST PUSHED THEM BACK INTO THE CROWD. IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT SOMETHING WAS
DRASTICALLY WRONG AND SO I STARTED WATCHING THE POLICE BOX, THERE WERE POLICE
IN THERE WITH CAMERAS SO THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN STRAIGHT AWAY WHAT WAS
HMPENING BUT NOTHING SEEMED TO BE DONE.

3 FACTORS CAUSED INCIDENT,
1..MENTALITY OF PEOPLE TRAVELLING 80 MILES TO GAME WITHOUT A TICKET
2..AT 10 TO 3 THOSE WITHOUT TICKETS HAVE ONLY ONE THOUGHT IN THIER MINDS AND
THATS TO GET IN
3..5.W LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS(MY SON IS A LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER BUT NOT WEARING
COLOURS AS WE WOULD BE SITTING WITH FOREST FANS) URINATINING ON THIER OWN
■ ■ D , LARGE NO OF PEOPLE ASKED ME TO SELL THEM MY TICKET, AND I AM SURE SOME
OF THE GATE PEOPLE WERE THREATENED'OR BRIBED.
SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY CANNOT BE BLAMED THEY HAVE HELD OVER 30 SEMIFINALS AND
THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, HAVING ALL THE EXPERIENCE
NECESSARY TO RUN A LARGE MATCH.

I WAS WITH ONE PERSON ;                 24 YRS,
         NORTH YORKSHIRE^
AND ASKED THE POLICEMAN ON THE TURNSTILE IF WE COULD GO IN WITH THE WRONG
TICKET AND HE SAID IT WOULD BE OK IF THE GUY ON THE GATE SAID IT WOULD BE OK.
 SO, WE WENT INTO THE LEPPINGS LANE STAND WITH NOTTS FOREST TICKETS FOR THE
KOP END, AS THE STEWARD ON THE TURNSTILE SAID IT WAS OK.
W M O T IN ABOUT 1.45 PM. IT WAS FAIRLY QUIET OUTSIDE, A FEW MILLING AROUND
Bw F n OT MANY GOING THROUGH THE GATES.
THE ONLY VISUAL ENTRANCE ONTO THE TERRACES WAS THROUGH THE TUNNEL ACCESS, TO
THE CENTRAL AREA BEHIND THE GOAL. WE WENT IN AND FOUND IT WASN'T A VERY GOOD
PLACE TO BE BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TOSEE BEHIND THE PERIMETER FENCE, IT WAS
FILLING UP AND WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BEPUSHED AROUND IN THERE.
WE CAME BACK OUT THROUGH THE TUNNEL, WE SAW A BETTER PLACE TO THE LEFT OF
THAT PEN, THE WING, THE TERRACING THERE GOES VERY HIGH, THERE WAS PLENTY OF
SPACE UP THERE AT THAT TIME. SIGNIFICANTLY I THINK IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE
HOW TO GET UP THERE, WE HAD TO SEARCH FOR THE ACCESS STAIRS. HENCE, ALL THE
WAY TO KICK OFF TIME, WHILE THE CENTRAL AREA BEHIND THE GOAL WAS OVERFLOWING
THE TWO WINGS WERE LESS THAN HALF FULL. I'M SURE THAT THAT WAS BECAUSE
PEOPLE SIMPLY COULDN'T SEE HOW TO GET INTO THE WINGS.
BOTH ME AND MY COMPANION WERE AT THE SAME SEMI-FINAL LAST YEAR, AND THE AREA
BEHIND THE GOAL IN THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE WAS TOO FULL THEN, WITH SOME
PEOPLE BEING PULLED UP ONTO THE SEATED STAND BY THE PEOPLE ABOVE.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE ROUTE WE TOOK, DOWN THE A61, ALL THE PUBSWERE
SHUT, AND THERE WAS A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE IN PUB CAR PARKS MAKING IT
OBVIOUS THAT THE PUBS WERE SHUT, AND TO KEEP PEOPLE MOVING TOWARDS THE
GROUND. HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN OFF LICENCE OPEN ON THE ROAD BEHIND THE NORTH
STAND, THERE WAS A LARGE QUEUE OUTSIDE AND LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE COMING OUT
WITH CANS, AND PEOPLE WERE SITTING AROUND OUTSIDE THE GROUND DRINKING FROM
CANS AND EATING. THIS ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO HANG AROUND OUTSIDE.
I SAW NO HOOLIGANISM WHATSOEVER, AND NO TROUBLE BETWEEN RIVAL SETS OF FANS.
I ALSO THINK THAT THE STANDS WERE WRONGLY ALLOCATED, AND THAT LIVERPOOL
SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE TICKETS AVAILABLE, AND THEREFORE THE KOP END.

              HILLBOROUGH ON A NUMBER OF OCCASSIONS. THE LEPPINGS LANE END IS
              VERY DANGEROUS. THERE IS NO EXIT TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT. THE FENCES
              ARE FIXED AND THERE IS A CONCRETE WALL AT THE BACK. TWO OTHER
              GROUNDS I CONSIDER DANGEROUS ARE THOSE AT OLDHAM ATHLETIC AND
              BRIGHTON WHERE THEY ARE CAGED. I CAN THINK OF TWO MATCHES PLAYED
              TWO YEARS AGO,PTO .

BURNLEY V LEIGHTON ROVERS AND TRANMERE V EXETER WHEN LARGE CROWDS WERE
PRESENT, THE KICK OFFS WERE PUT BACK AND THIS WAS ANNOUNCED OUTSIDE THE
GROUND. I THINK THIS WOULD HAVE SETTLED THE CROWD OUTSIDE ANXIOUS TO GET IN.
THE ID CARD SCHEME WOULD MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE. IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT
THAT AT LUTON TOWN THE COMPUTERS ARE SWITCH OFF FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE KO IN
ORDER TO GET THE CROWDS IN. PLYMOUTH ARGYLL ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THERE

IT SEEMED CLEAR THAT THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF
PEOPLE STILL O/S. THERE WAS ALSO AN OFFICER TRYING TO DO THIS. THERE WAS ALOT
OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHICH TURNSTILES PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE APPROACHED.NO-ONE
CHECKED OUR TICKETS EXCEPT AT THE TURNSTILES.THERE WERE ONLY A COUPLE OF
STEWARDS INSIDE AND LOOKED AS THOUGH NO ONE WAS CHECKING THEM AS THE AISLES
IN THE WEST STAND WERE FULL.THERE WERE VERY FEW PEOPLE ASKING TO SEE TICKETS.

LACK OF POLICE PRESENCE WAS ONE OF MAIN OBSERVATIONS BY CALLER.
CALLER FELT THAT THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE OTHER END
OF THE PITCH.
CALLER FELT THAT THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF THE POLICE WAS UNACCEPTABLE DURING
THE ENTIRE DAY. THEY SEEMED AGGRESSIVE FROM WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE ACTUAL

THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD JUST MOVE TO ANOTHER PART OF THE GROUND.
I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE WAS GETTING KILLED.
PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM VERY BAD, NOTHING CAME OVER THE P.A. OR IF IT DID I
DIM'T HEAR ANYTHING.
Th U e WAS AN ELECTRONIC SCORE BOARD, WHILE ALL THIS WAS HAPPENING THE SCORE
BOARD WAS SHOWING ADVERTS, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO BETTER EFFECT.
I DIDN'T LEAVE UNTIL ABOUT 1545, WHEN THERE WAS ONLY ABOUT 40 OR 50 LEFT ON

I THINK IF THERE HAD BEEN STEWARDS OR SOME ONE TO DIRECT THE CROWD BETTER
THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED.

I ASKED POLICE ON HORSES WHERE TO GO BUT NOT EVEN THEY KNEW. IT WAS BAD WHEN
WE FIRST GOT THERE WE DROVE AROUND FOR ABOUT HALF AND HOUR BECAUSE IT WAS SO
CROWDED. I THOUGHT BECAUSE WE WERE SO LATE WE WOULD JUST WALK INTO THE GROUND
BUT I WAS SUPRISED THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY MORE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE GROUND
THAN INSIDE. WHEN WE GOT TO THE PEN PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCING TO
GET OUT. ACCOMPANIED BY                                AND SON ADDRESSES
UNKNOWN, BUT HE WILL ASK THEM TO CONTACT I.I.C. THE TELEPHONE NUMBER GIVEN IS

THIS SECTION TO THE LEFT WAS RELATIVELY EMPTY EVEN WHEN THE CRUSH HAPPENED.
WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE TURNSTILE ANDTOWARDS THE TUNNEL THERE WERE NO
STEWARDS TO DIRECT US WHERE TO GO. I COULD SEE INTO THE PENS NEXT DOOR AND
IT WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE CRUSHED. THIS TERRACING GOES DOWN IN A SLOPE
TOWARDS THE PITCH AND PEOPLE COMING THROUGH THE TUNNEL DID NOT KNOW THE
PEOPLE AT THE FRONT WERE GETTING CRUSHED. AT 15.01 PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER
THE FENCE TRYING TO GET OUT BUT THEY WERE BEING PUSHED BACK AGAIN BY POLICE.
I ALSO WENT TO HEYSEL AND IT WAS APPARENT TO ME EVEN BEFORE THE KICK OFF THAT
S((BtTHING WAS WRONG.

THERE WERE A COUPLE OF STEWARDS BY THE STAND ENTRANCE. WE WENT THROUGH THE
TUNNEL AND THERE WERE NO MARKINGS OR SIGNS, NOTHING TO TELL YOU WERE TO GO.
THE TUNNEL WAS MARKED BB ENTRANCE WHICH IS WHAT IT SAID ON MY TICKET. WE WENT
INTO THE SIDE PEN AND THERE WAS SO MUCH ROOM IN OUR PEN IT WAS RIDICULOUS.
WHEN THE CRUSH STARTED, I SAW A POLICEMAN GO OVER TO THE REFEREE AND THE GAME
STOPPED. THE ONLY ONES WORKING ON THE CRUSHED FANS WERE THE SUPPORTERS.
I WAS WITH THREE OTHER PEOPLE:
                                      f   1 MERSEYSIDE.

 Dear Sir

 Hillshorough - Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

 I was concerned to hear that George Croston is on leave and will not be available for the next
 two weeks. I trust that his absence from the office will not result in any delay or impinge on
 fhe handling of the case in any way bearing in mind our duty to the Court on 20th August.

 I would point out that although our Leading Counsel is out of the country for two weeks he is
 prepared to advise the Group at any time.

 In addition, I refer to item 6 of the schedule of material known to have been considered by
                                 [). I should be grateful if you would forward a copy of Appendix



  Yours faithfully

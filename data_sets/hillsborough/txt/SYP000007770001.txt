On S at ur da y          -15th A p r i l ,       1989       < 15 0 4 89 )     at    about        093 0 am D a v i d Mather

arrived          at m y     house      in      his      car      which      is a      green Morris                Marina,       in

company          with               and                     I went        out      into     the       car    a n d we w e r e        then

joined       by



We    initially           stop p e d at          a    local        shop     in o r d e r     to       purchase       sweets          and

pop.        We    then made           our      way      to S h e f f i e l d       via    the     M62       f o llowing        the

signs       for S t o c k p o r t      and       then       on     to S h e f f i e l d .        As    we a p p r o a c h e d

Sheffield          we     were      stopped           by a P o l i c e        point       and     the P o l i c e        made    a

check       of    our      tickets        and also              as     to w h e t h e r     we    had a n y       beer    in    our

car.        During         the j o u r n e y ,       the         passengers          including myself,                   had    our

dinner       whilst         the     vehicle           was       in m o t i o n ,    a n d we a l s o         ha d 3 or 4         cans

of    lager       eac h,      except        David        who       d i d n ’t h a v e     anything           to    eat    or    drink.

We    were       i n f o r m e d at    th e      Police          point      to     drink     the       beer       before       going

into    the       ground.



We    arrived         in S h e f f i e ld s o m e           time       between        1130 am a n d m i d d a y             (12 00

hrs)    and       parked       the     car       in a n e a r b y          road     on    the     direction          of P o l i c e

officers,           but     which      was       only 5 minutes                  walk     from        the    ground.




After       parking         the     car,       we all           decided       that       it w a s      too    early       to    enter

the    football           ground and             so w e n t        into a        betting         shop which          w as      only

about       30    seconds away              from      the       football         ground.




We    stayed        in     the b e t t i n g     shop            for    about       2 0 m i n u t e s or      so a n d      then went

to    the    ground.           We     all      had      "W e s t     E n d * t ieke ts a n d w h e n we a r r i v e d

at    the    turnstiles             there        was       no    crowd      or     queues        whatsoever.              At    the

turnstiles           1 could          see      t h at    there         were      about      30    or    40        uniformed

Police       officers          standing              around        togethe r w i t h a few                  stewards.           We    we re

searched          prior      to     entering            the      ground       and     our    tickets          were       collected

as    we    went       through         the     turnstile.                  The     time          of    our a r r i v a l        at       the

turnstiles             was    between          12      (1200       hrs)       and       1230          pm    I di d       not    noti ce a n y

of    the    large          gates      next       to     the      turnstiles                to    be       open.




On    entering          the       t u r n s t i l e s , we        all      headed           for       the     tunnel        immediately

ahead       of    us.        I did       not      see       any    signs          to    direct             us a n y w h e r e , it was

just       a matter          of    seeing         the       tunn e1 entranee                     and       heading        towards          it.

ye    received          no    direction             to      our    viewing             point.              After     we     walked

through          the    t u n n e 1,     whi ch        brought          us    out       into          the W e s t        S t a n d , we        could

see    that       there       were       only       approximately                  20       or    so       people        in the          two

middle       pens.           There       was      about         the     same       number             in the        outer       pens.          Due

to    all    the       available          space,            we all         laid        down       on       the     te r race        steps      and

sunbathed,             whilst        reading           the      match        programme.




At    about       2    pm    (1400       h r s)     the      West       S t a n d , and           in       particular,              Pen 3 ,

which       we    were       in,     started           to    fill       up a n d        we       therefore           had       to s t a n d       on

our    fee t.          I noticed          that         the      ground        was       starting              to    fill       up    in

particular,             the       opposing          terrace,            I believe                is    k n o w n at       the       Spion      Kop,

was    beginning             to    look       full       with Nottingham                     Forrest             fans.         The       pen

in w h i c h      we    were       in w a s       starting            to     get       full       from around               2, pm        ( 1400

hrs),       although          I would          not       sa y     that       we    had       to       jostle        for     our      space.




Up    until       £.45       pm     <1445      hrs)         I would          say        that          our    P e n no     3 and          P e n no 4

were       quite       pa eked,        although             we w e r e       s t ill        fairly          comf o r t a b l e       -    it was

after       this       time       that    things            started          to    become             uneasy.            We,    including

David,       all       stood       in a       line       along        one     of        the       b a r r i e r s in      Pen 3          and I

believe          it was       behind          the      barrier          which           later          broke,.



From       past       experience          we      understood               that        if    there          wa s    to    be a s u r g e          in

the    crowd,          we w o u l d      be    protected              from        the       push       by     the    barrier             behind
                                                                                                                                             PAGE                4
                                                                                                                                             S681

us.        Normally              in our        own       "K o p ’ at         Anfield          we     could         l e an       back    on the

barrier           and       normally           if we        were           p u s h e d , we       could       just        lean        back       o nt o

it.




Slowly,           and       building           up     to a f e w mi n u t e s                befo re k i c k - o f f time,                   I       could

feel        people          being       pushed             past       infront            of    our       p o s i t i o n . I could

sense           that    the       crush        wa s        greater than usual                     a n d we        ha d       to use       our

strength           in o r d e r         to     keep        o ur       position          infront          of      the      barrier.               I

noticed           that       one       or    two      people           were        trying          to p u s h       u n d e r the       barrier

that        we    were       standing             infront             of    so     that       they could             also have           the

protection              from          the    su r g e .




Whilst           I was       in the          Pen,          I could say             there          was     more       discomforting

noise           than    there          would        usually            be,       due    to    the       crush.            When        I say

discomforting,                    I am        referring               to a w o m e n         screaming             and men            groaning

due        to    the    crush.              I also         noticed            that      approximately                    10 L i v e r p o o l         fans

who        had    initially             been        standing               in the       West       Stand,          not      parti c u l a r y             our

because           it    happens             throughout                the     season         at    the      matches.              I construe

this        to    be    fans          wanting         to    get        better          positions            to     view         the    match and

not        because          of    the       cru s h .       By        this       time,       the     players             had     come     out         onto

th e       field       and       by    now,       I could             really       feel       the       i m m e T-'<=a r'rensure

and        sense       something             to     be w r o n g .            I noticed            th a t     David Mather               who          w as

originally              on m y         right        hand      side          as    we    faced       the       p i t c h a n d at          the         end

of     the       barrier          or    near        to     the        end,       but    the       last      of    our       group,       was          no w

about           4 or    3    people          away        infront            of    me.        We    were       all        unable        to m o v e

willingly              and       it    just       happened             that       whatever          position you were                        in,          wa s

dictated           by       the       crowd.          When        I    saw D a v i d         inf ront         of me         I    shouted             to

       the     seriousness                of     th e    crush.           David     looked          b a c k at     me       fay t u r n i n g    his

       head       but     did     not      say anyt hi n g.                By    this      time      I was        forced          side       on to

       the     pitch and was                   facing         towards          pen 4.       I was     unable           to    turn       round and

       that       was     the     last         I saw       of D a v i d .        I believe           it w a s      not       D a v i d ’s

       had     been       pushed with                the      crowd.           I myself        had also           been        pushed

       forwards           by    the       crowd         a nd w a s       unable     to      regain my           s p o t . I not i ced            t h at

                                  I said           to    him     "Look         where     Mathers'           going"          I d i d n ’t hear

       By    n o w , the        game       had       started         and       I was     s ti l l    in a t u r n e d            position

       being        pushed        forward            g r a d u a l l y . I now          not i ced      t h at     people          started        to

       panic        and    more       people            began       to    scream.           I could         see    that          a s m all      gate

       at      the      front        of pen 3           had    now b e e n       o p e n e d , I d o n *t k n o w             exactly when

       it      was      opened        or       by w h o m ,    but I w o u l d         sa y    it   wa s    at     the       same       time     or

       j ust      after        ki c k - o f f .         I could          see    about       2 or 3 P o l i c e m e n w h o              were

       standing           on a       raised          platform,,           waving        their       arms     towards             the    f a n s as

       if    to     i ndi cat e to             get      back.        I could         see      that     their       lips w e r e             moving

 ^     but     I wa s      unable          to      hear       what       they were          saying,         although             it was

       obvious          to me        that        they      were      signalling             for     the     crowd       to m o v e          back.

       At      this       stage       I was a p p r o x i m a t e l y           three      quarters         of the           way       down     the

       terrace          towards            the f r o n t .          I could       see     t h at    p e o p le     started             to   climb

       over       the     fencing          in o r d e r        to    escape        the      crushes,         and       initially when

       they       got     over       to    the       other       side      next     to      the     actual        p i t c h , the           first

ffj]   one     or    two       got        grabbed          by the     p o 1 ice a n d          led a w a y , but            by    then       other

       supporters              had        started          to c l i m b   the f e n c i n g    and     it         became          apparent          to

       the     fe w P o l i c e           officers            who    were      at t h a t     end,     t h a t the          supporters          were

       only       trying        to        escape         the crush.

At    the    same       time,          I could          see     about         ten Poli cemen                 standing          around          the

gate     a r e a at         the       bottom       of ,pen 3 b e h i n d              the       goal.           I could        see     that                  |

they    were          t ryi ng        to    pull     people          out      of     the       pen a l t h o u g h       at    first        they

were     only able               to    pull       one    or     two       out       due    to       the    number        of    people          all

t ryi ng     to       get     out      at    the     same       t i me,         I    was       aware       that     at       the    bottom          of

the    pen    there           was      ob v io us ly a drop                of       some       3 - 4       feet and           the

policemen             were       struggling             to    pull        them       up a n d        out     and    I    could        see      that

o nee       the    offi cers               realised          the    severity              of    the       situation           they    seemed

to    act    frantically.




Although          it    seemed a             1 ong      time,        but      at     the       same       t i m e as     the       events

described             above       were       happening,              I    could       hear          people      screaming             words         to

the    effect          of     "Oh G o d          I ’m goi ng         to    die"        I did         not     myself          have     those

thoughts          and       was       actually          shouting           to       those       who       had    climbed           over       the

fencing       to       run       on a n d        stop    th e      match,           h o w e v e r , it wa s         obvious           that

they     c o u l d n ’t h e a r            me.




Although          I    w as      only       some     short         di s c t a n c e       from       the     barrier which                I

later       discovered                had    broken,          I r;ever h e a r d               or    saw     this       happen        and      I

believe       even          if    it       had    b r o k e , it w o u l d           not       have       caused        any    further

problems          because             the    crowd were              t h at     tightly             packed      that         there     was

nowhere       forward             to       move    and       in fact          I could           have       taken        my    feet     off         the

ground       and       I would             still     have       remained             upright,             owing     to       the    sheer

pressure          caused          by       the    volume        of       people       around          me.




Whilst       this       was       all       happening,             I n o t i c e d a ^h.ite ^male                   aged ^

was    wearing          or a n y           further       descriptive                 details           but      I think        he     had      a

L I v e r poo 1 a c c e n t .              I noticed          he     had      his     eyes          closed and           he    wa s    being

that    I    am 6*2          I    was       able       to       have       my    arms          free       and     so      I    started              to    slap

his    face       to m a k e          sure       he    was       all       ri g h t .          I    could       see       that          he w a s         pale

and    didn't        seem         very          a l e r t , but        after          I    slapped             his       face       a    couple           of

times,       he    opened             his       eyes.           By    this       t ime         I    found myself                up a g a i nst

another       barrier             towards             the       front       of    the          p e n ,a n d     towards             the       left

handside          as y o u        face          the    pitch.          I    realised                that       if th e         pressure

continued          on me          I    would          have       crushed          the          young       lad       I    had       helped           so       I

managed       to     do      an about              turn         and    put       my       backside             onto       the       said        barrier

with    the       young          lad       in    front          of m e .         The       pressure              continued               although

the    crowd       seemed             to    divert          either          side          of       us.     I    kept          ho 1d of          the

back    w a ll.         W h e n we          reached             the    w al l ,       the          pressure          ceased             and     I    asked

the    lad wa s         he       okay and             he    replied             " Y e s , thanks               m a t e ".       We       split           up

and    I had an           o p p o r t u n i ty         to       be    pulled          up       i nto      the     above         stands              for       my

protection.




From    the       above          st a nd ,       I could             see    what          I believed              to      be    dead          pesons

propped       up a g a i n s t             one     another            on    the       front          fencing             in    pens 3 a n d 4.

The    reason        I be 1 i eve               them       to    be    dead was                be c a u se      their          faces          we re       blue

to    purple,        with         blood          coming          from       their          mouths.              I d i d n ’t            continue              to

look    at    them,          as       I was        more         concerned             at       finding          my       friends             wh o    1

thought       may       be       on    the       pitch.



                                                                                                                               fv 3 G *r? ? ?
At    this    point          I noticed                another          friend             whose          name     is                                          wh o

lives       near    me,          pul 1 i ng at             the       fencing          at       the       front       of       pen 3,          from        the

pitch       side.         A P o 1 iceman               then          c a m e , pushed               him away             and    started              trying

to    pull    the       f e n c i ng a w a y           a s w e 11.          From          the       stands        I could               see    a     lot          of

people       lying        on      the       pitch          and many             more       fans        walking/running                        around

them.       I could        see       that       people          on    stretchers               or    boards        were      being      taken

away     by   supporters              and       some       Police.




Throughout           this       incident             I did       not       see a n y o n e          die    in m y      vicinity         that

I noticed,           I    did       not    see       anybody          being       trampled            either.           I didn't         see          j

anybody       in th e          ground          drinking          alcohol.               W h i 1 st    I   was      in the        upper

West     Stand,          I heard          the       Nottingham Forrest                     fans       chanting          at    the                     j

Liverpool           Supporters             and       at    this       stage       the L i v e r p o o l          fans       on the      pitch         <

ran     towards          the    Kop       end an d w h en             they       go t     three       quarters          of    the      way    up ;

t he    pitch,       the       Liverpool             fans       realised          they weren't                  helping       matters

and     stopped.           After          t h is     action,          I    saw    the      Police          line       the    centre      of

t he p i t c h .




1    went     to    the    semi-final                game       he 1d at         Hillsborough                  last y e a r      and    I

would       like     to    point          out       that       there       seemed         to    be m o r e       checks       made      on

tickets        by    the       Police          prior       to    our       arrival         at       the    ground       and      further

checks        inside       the       ground,          last       year.           On     entering           the     ground        this

year,       I was        aware       that       there          were       side    entrances               to    the    outer      pens       on

the    West     Stand          terraces             but    it    just       seemed         that       the       tunnel       entrance

was     the   most        prominent             entry          point       to me.          There          was    no    Police

officers        or       stewards          directing             people          to     the     side       entrances          and      I sa w

no w r i t t e n     directions                to    them.

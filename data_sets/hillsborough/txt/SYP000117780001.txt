                  commenting           that       things        were       going      well      and      t hat    traffic          seemed         to

                  have       arrived        much       earlier        than     last       y e ar.        Most     of     the     routes         to     the

                  ground        were    clear          by H . 3 0     pm    there        was    certainly           no    ho 1d up          for

                  S u pt .    Brougham           coming        over    the     radio          about      2.40     pm s a y i n g       t h at     all

                  the     routes       to    the       ground were            clear       and      the    motorcyclist               wanting

                  to    go    in for m e a l           early.         They were           told      to    stay      out       mainly        because

concerned              there were             no u n u s u a l    problems           with traffic                it w e n t      very

well.       The        m o t o r c y c l i s t s a n d all        officers           engaged           in g e t t i n g         people        to

the      ground        did a f i r s t          class         job.        There       was       never       any       suggestion

t ha t    fans        were       he Id    up b e c a u s e        of     p r o M ems       on    the     roads.

Al l     the     time       we    had      been m onitoring                   Hillsborough             Ground Control                   on

channel          25    via a       repeater             set      in the        Incident          Ro o m .        I recognised

PS Goddard             as    the       main     operator            at    the       ground       and     on      occasions

Suptn       Murray          used       th e    radio.          Up      to 2 . 1 5     pm    the      r e c e p t i o n was           good

and      there         were       no     unusual        problems.               Then       for          the       n ex t   20••••?.'.5 m i n u t e s

the      radio         was       very     poor it       broke       up a n d        there was          a    l o ud w h i s t l e .            It

was      obvious         they were             having         problems           with      the     r a di o      in f a c t      I

remember          them       saying           they were           having         problems          over       VS* r a d i o      a n d we

asked       if    they       needed           communi cations                 people       to    help.           <3r o u n d    c on tr o l

said      they        were       present        and      trying          to    fix    it.        After        that      time         it was

much      improved           back        to    the      good      r e c e p t i o n we      had      heard         earlier           that

day.        This       would       be     about         2,40      pm a n d       after      t ha t     the       r e c e p t i o n wa s

cl ea r ,        I heard          Superintendent                  Marshall           saying        to m a t c h        control          that

he     ha d a     l a rg e       crowd        outside         the L e p p i n g s         Lane    en d      of    the      ground.            I

think       he a s k e d         for     more     horses          but     I' m      not    sure      whether           the m a tc h

control          got     in t o u c h w i t h any.                  I do       know       that    they        asked        us    v ia

for      a vehicle           with        a PA     system          to     go    to    Leppings          Lane        because           there

was a       1a r g e c r o w d p u s h i n g a n d t h e y                f e a r e d s o m e o ne w o u 1d b e h u r t .                    We

did      send     a    car       but     when     he     got      there        he    radioed         back        that      there        was       a

car w i t h       PA     si r e a d y     there.

It w a s       more      and      more        apparent           listening           to    the    match          control         r a dio

officers-              I remember              them asking               Inspector          Sewell          to    send more             men

and      I remember              someone        asking           for     the     kick      off    to     be      delayed.             I d o n ’t

kn ow who         that       was       but     the      reply       from m a t c h         control          was       that      there        was
      •                                                                                            PAGE

             no     chance          as    one    of       the    t e am s    was        already       out.            It m u s t     have          b ee n

             about        2.50       pm    fay t h i s      time.           S u p t . Marshall             then asked               for       the     gates

             to     be    opened          as    he    feared        for      the        safety       of    all        the    people           at

             Leppings           Lane.           He    said       they were              being       crushed and              he     thought           a wall

             was      going         to    go.        Supt.       Murray        himself             replied        to    t hi s      and       said       there

             was      a need         to    check          tickets.           S u p t . Marshall                then      repeated             his     plea

             and      I could            hear    the       crowd        in the          background             w ho    were       obviously              very

             noisy and              urnruly.              1 think        other          persons       asked           for    the     gate          opening

             but      1 c a n ’t s a y who.                 I wa s       convinced             by w h a t       I heard           that        people

             would        be    hurt       so    I a s k e d my          staff          to    contact          match        control           and     ask

             them        if    they       needed          any    ambulances.                  They    said        not at          that        stage         but

             we     were       to    keep       on m o n i t o r i n g       th e       radio.        This        was       about        3    pm at         the

             t i me      and    I heard          PS Goddard               in g r o u n d       control          sa y     ’o p e n    the       g at e       we

             do     not       want       anyone       k i l l e d ’'.       X am        sure       these       were      more       or       less     his

             exact        words.           This       was       done     and       after       a minute           S u pt .       Marshall           told

             Match        Control          that       the       situation           outside          had       eased        and     that       the       gate

             w as     c l osed.

             I could           then       heard       the       officers           at    the       ground       saying           persons           were

             we     we re      requested             to    get    a fleet           of a m b u l a n c e s        and       we    did        via    the

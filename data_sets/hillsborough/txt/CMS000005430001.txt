FOOTBALL: MR SANDFORD’S LETTER OF 28 DECEMBER


I attach a self-explanatory draft reply to Mr Sandford’s letter of
28   December enclosing a draft questionnaire on the implementation
of the Taylor recommendations.


2.      I myself have no points to make on the questionnaire,                   though
I agree with those in your manuscript note on Sandford’s letter.


3.      I   understand     the questionnaire was in fact issued some time
ago (I am sorry I did not deal with this earlier,                   but   I   was     on
leave       till   6 January).    I have shown copies of the questionnaire
to Mr Baden in DES and Mr H^ugh in          the    Home         Office.   The       Home
Office       may   want   to   feed in some thoughts separately.              The fact
that the questionnaire has issued should not, I think, prevent you
from writing.

QUESTIONNAIRE ON TAYLOR IMPLEMENTATION'



Thank you for your letter of 28 December.                         I am glad that you have

been     able     to       cooperate        closely       with   the   Football     Licensing

Authority        and       the        Football    Trust     in   drawing   up     your   draft

questionnaire on the implementation of the Taylor recommendations.



When    we      met        on     1   November,     you     said you thought it would be

possible to obtain monitoring information on the                           ground    capacity

and     the     number           of seats at each ground on a six-monthly basis -

for 1 April and 1 October each year.                        It still seems to me that it

would     be an advantage to obtain information on this basis.                           Would

it be possible to amend questions 1 and 2                         accordingly?       I   would

not     insist        on        the    April and September monitoring dates if that

would not suit; an alternative would be 1 January and 1                             July.       I

do not, however, suggest that questions 3 to 5 need to be drawn up

on anything other than a 12 month basis.



My only other point is that I would like to see in                           question       7   a

table     showing           plans       for capacity and seating at each monitoring

date over, say, the next 5 years.                     It seems to me that this           would
he-1.lw/jamie/3.08.01.91



represent        the     simplest   and clearest summary of how each club is

planning to implement the Taylor recommendations            over   the   years

ahead.      It     may     also be helpful in focusing the attention of the

clubs themselves on what needs to be done.

RESEARCH INTO THE PROVISION OF VIDEO TAPES TO YORKSHIRE TELEVISION

I refer to our discussions on 24 September 1997, my letter of 8 October and Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith’s letter of 13 October 1997 on the above subject. A search of the indexed material within
the Hillsborough Archives has failed to reveal any correspondence from Yorkshire Television. A
search of non-indexed material and in particular the personal file of Chief Inspector Norman
Bettison (now assistant Chief Constable West Yorkshire Police) has revealed a letter from
Yorkshire Television dated 4 July 1989 and an internal memo dated 7 July 1989 from Mr Bettison
to the Chief Constable (Copies attached).

I have not spoken to Mr Bettison, nor to Superintendent Pratt, who is now retired, but is
mentioned in Mr Bettison’s memo, nor to Peter Wright the former Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire Police, all of whom may be able to recall the response given to Yorkshire Television.
The YTV letter does however, make it clear that the West Midlands Police had agreed to assist
them make a documentary into the Hillsborough Disaster and was seeking the approval of South
Yorkshire Police to copy tapes and photographs for possible use in the programme. At that time
all the original Hillsborough video tapes and photographs were in the possession of West
Midlands Police and if approval was given it would have been the originals in their possession
that were copied in order to maintain picture quality.

Inspector Michael Layton of West Midlands Police (Now Superintendent at Willenhall Police
Station, John Street, Willenhall, WV13 1PU Tel No 01922 439121) was responsible for the
management of the video and photographic evidence for Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, the
Coroner's Inquest and the preparation of discipline files. I have spoken to Mr Layton and he
recalls West Midlands Police co-operating in the making of the documentary and feels that the
copy tapes and photographs used by Yorkshire Television must have been provided by West
Midlands Police as they were in possession of the originals, but he cannot specifically recall it.

Another serving officer that Mr Layton suggests may be able to assist is Detective Chief
Superintendent Michael Foster, who works at the Regional Crime Squad Office, Bournville Lane
Police Station, 341 Boumville Lane, Birmingham, B30 1QX, telephone number 0121 626 4052.
Mr Foster worked directly to ACC Mervyn Jones on the Hillsborough Enquiry and would have
been privy to policy decisions. Alternatively Mervyn Jones recently retired as Chief Constable of
Cheshire Constabulary could be contacted for his recollections, or a search of his paperwork
from the Hillsborough Enquiry presently still stored at Cheshire police Headquarters may reveal
correspondence between Yorkshire Television and West Midlands Police.

I enclose a copy for your viewing of the actual Yorkshire Television Documentary, which was
broadcast on the ITV Network on Tuesday 6 February 1990, in the "First Tuesday" series of
orogrammes and entitled "Disaster at Hillsborough".

PC Greenway and myself have viewed the programme and have prepared a schedule that
identifies the source of all the still photographs and video clips used in the programme. The tape
running time identified in the schedule is the actual elapsed time from the start of the enclosed
copy video tape. All the still photographs and video clips have been identified with the exception
of a 3 second clip shown at 20 minutes 12 to 15 seconds actual running time of the tape. Where
possible we have also indicated the actual time of the video clip on Saturday 15 April 1989. In
the case of the BBC Video there are nine separate tapes of their footage on the day and it would
have taken us an inordinate length of time to identify the actual tape that the clips come from and
so this has not been done. With the exception of the 3 seconds we have not been able to
identify, we can categorically state that none of the video clips or still photographs used in the
programme is new and that all of them were available to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry and the
Coroner's Inquest.

It is also worthy of note that in her introduction to the programme the presenter, Olivia O'Leary,
says "Lord Justice Taylor allowed us to film the 9 month enquiry... We used police video footage
seen only by the enquiry team..."

I do not feel that I can take this matter any further forward without speaking to people I have
named above or without access to Mr Mervyn Jones' paper.

If you feel I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Mr Wright

We are writing to you at the suggestion of Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant
Chief Constable (Operations), West Midlands Police.

As you may know, Yorkshire Television is making a documentary with the
help of West Midlands Police about the inquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster. We intend the programme to be shown nationally on ITV when the
final report 6f the judicial inquiry is published. We understand this is
' \ely to be some time next year.

We would welcome an opportunity.to discuss the programme with you in
general terms, if you feel such a meeting would be desirable. In addition,
there are two specific matters which we would like to raise with you now,
in the hope that you will feel able to give your approval. It is these
which Mr Jones suggested we write to you about.

1. We would like to copy for possible use - by way of additional
illustrative and explanatory material - some of the tapes and photographs
which were supplied by South Yorkshire Police to West Midlands Police for
use in the inquiry. We have discussed this with Mr Jones and he says
neither he nor Lord Justice Taylor have any objections, but Mr Jones points
out that the decision must rest with you, since the copyright is held by
South Yorkshire Police.

2. We would like to film some.of your officers presently helping West
Midlands Police locate the positions of some of the deceased. We
understand some officers are viewing tapes and giving their comments,
while others are simply giving statements. We would like to film either or
both of these activities. We fully realise the sensitivity of this, and
recognise that it would require careful handling.

On this last point, we would much appreciate an early decision, since the
work will continue for only a few weeks more. If you feel you would like
more details of our proposals before making a decision, we would be
pleased to come and discuss them with you.

Yours   sincerely

            SUBJECT:                  YORKSHIRE TELEVISION DOCUMENTARY

            I have contacted Superintendent Pratt who claims to have something similar
            in train with the BBC and the West Midlands Police to be produced in January-
            1990, but he has no knowledge of a YTV documentary.   No other 'Hillsborough
            Inquiry Team' member is aware of such an arrangement.

            Initial thoughts:

            West Midlands appear, already, to be fully committed to assisting in the
            production of a national television documentary (see paragraph 2 of the
            attached letter).

            IF South Yorkshire Police agree        to assist we could find ourselves playing
            'second fiddle', however . . .

            IF South Yorkshire       Police   decline   the   opportunity       we    may    be   depicted   as
            the 'accused'.

            The conclusion, therefore, is that we agree to take part in the production
            of this documentary on our own terms.

            Those terms might ensure that we are presented as a caring and professional
            organisation, doggedly pursuing the facts surrounding the disaster, eg

            i)          The conspiracy theory.

            ii)         Position of bodies - Pen 3.

            iii)       . Viewing  and reviewing the video  evidence  todetermine   when,
                         precisely, barrier 124A failed (possibly before the opening of
                         Gate C).

            iv)         Obtaining over 800 statements    on behalf of the                    West Midlands
                         investigation team - and our attempts, from them,                   to build up a
                         picture of events.

            In other words, presenting the South Yorkshire Police as                          active   rather
            than simply a passive subject of the West Midlands enquiry.

            We should not underrate the value of our comtemporaneous film material,
            video and stills (without it the proposed documentary would consist of
            images of West Midlands detectives knocking on doors).    Perhaps this could
            be traded with great care.  (See paragraph 4 of the attached letter).

            Superintendent Pratt returns to duty on Monday 10 July 1989 and will have
            a view on this matter.     I have left a copy of these documents for his
            attention.

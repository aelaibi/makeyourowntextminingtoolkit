I am a Constable in the South Yorkshire Police.



Further to my statement of the 2 June 1989, relating to the Semi-Final

Football Match between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest

Football Club on Saturday, 15 April 1989, it has been brought to my      -

attention that on that afternoon I was spoken to by Mr LOCKE who is in

charge of Ground Security at the Hillsborough Football Ground.   I now

recall that whilst I was on duty that afternoon on the Directors'

Entrance, Mr LOCKE cane fran inside the Directors' Suite; he appeared

agitated and passed a comment to me relating to the large number of

fans still outside the ground and that there may be difficulty getting

them all in (indicating toward the Liverpool end of the ground).     I

was not given any instruction or directive by Mr LOCKE and was unaware

whether the comment made meant that all the fans may not get in at

all, or that they would not be in before kick-off tine.



I do not recall the exact wording of the canment made to me, or

whether I replied to it.    I know Mr LOCKE personally and during my

duties over the years at the football ground we have had many short

conversations.   The tine he spoke to me would have been approximately

2.30 pm - 2.45 pm

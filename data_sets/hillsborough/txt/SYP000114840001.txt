         edges.       The empty cans were in good condition.



         At    1.24    pm     I    drove       into       the     Woodhead          lay-by     where      I    saw

         further beer and lager cans strewn around the lay-by. Located

         in the lay-by              is apublic telephone box.                              I parked near to

         this    telephone box.             From        behind the telephone box,                      I found

         two    carrier       bags    containing               numerous            empty    beer   and    lager

         cans,     and also empty Vodka and Rum bottles.                                       I showed        the

         bags    and    contents          to   Pc     Rodgers             who was pointing          the video

         camera towards me.



         I climbed over a small embankment and into a gulley, where I

         found numerous            empty beer,             lager and wine cans and bottles.

         Some were          strewn    around,           some were              in carrier bags.           I was

         joined by Pc Rodgers and together we collected the empty cans

         and     bottles      and    all       the     carrier bags.                 We     returned     to    the

         road     surface          bythe car.           I emptied the contents                     of all      the

         bags onto thefloor, while                      Pc Rodgers returned to the car and

         operated       the       video     equipment.                    When     I emptied       a blue      and

         white carrier bag,               among the empty cans and bottles,                            I found

         a "LIVERPOOL CUDDLES                  'N CASH"          Lottery Card.              I retained this

         in my possession.                 I can identify it by the exhibit                            label I

         have attached and signed.



         From here,          Pc    Rodgers          and     I went            to a refreshment           caravan

         situated       in the       lay-by.          We     had a private             conversation           with

                   At    2.21     pm and          2.24    pm I found empty cans in a further                           two

            tra ff ic delays          as   I came      in the        back way*         I     arrived   near   to

            down on the grass w ith a couple                         cans of beer.

 a w a y f rom the ground*                   I w a l k e d up the ground           it was    just a straight

 Road,       I saw a lot            police     o ff i c e r s    in the area but          I did not      recieve

 a ny d i re c t i o n s     from them as               I knew where       I was    going*       I a r r iv ed at

  the g r o u n d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y          1435pm*     I went       to the    turnstiles         area

 where      t here was a large                number       of people*        There was a queue but                it

  was    only about          10-15      people          long*     The queue was more wide               by that        I

  m e a n e v e r y o n e was       trying     to get          into the turnstiles,,         they were          not

  s t an d i n g    in    long quese         but    pushing       to get    into    the    small    queue at the

  front*           I saw 4 police officers                     on horseback,       they were       trying to

  push     people         into queues         but due          to the    large    number    of   people       it was

  not wor ki ng*            Whe n     i got    to the          turnstiles    I saw two       police officers

  s ta nd i ng      o utside     them,       but    I recieved no            d i r e ct io n from*      I did    not

  see a ny         s tewards     at    the    turnstiles*           I had no d if fi c u l t y       in finding

  m y e ntry        point    but      it took me          15 minutes         to a ct ua ll y get to the

  t u r n st i le a n d     through      it*        All    this    time    I was wit h .

  we had split             up from      the    rest       of      our friends*

  W hilst      I was       q ueuing     to get          into      the ground      I saw no gates         open and I

  did not see             anyb od y getting             into      the ground by any gates            or other

  was    r ip pe d off and            I retained          the    stub*     I am prepared to tender my

  ticket*          (Ref Ext No                 ) (MK1              )*     Once    I got    through      the

  I walked          along    the tunnel            quite       freely,    it was    not that busy,            people

  were     just w a lk in g         through.            I saw no police officers             or stewards          in

   I was      s t an d in g     on pen 3.           I saw no disorder or                   people       drinking whilst

   I was      taking       up my viewing             point.        I got onto             the terraces at about

   1443 - 1450pm.                The     terraces         were    full,       but e.veryone was               laughting

   and jo eking           still.         At about         1455pm the teams were a nn o u n c e d and

   a ft er    the L i v e rp oo l        team had be a n n o u n c e d             I felt a t ightening up.

   I could not move,                                and    I were       standing          just behind a b a r r i e r :

   we b oth had one              person       in front       of us who was                a ct u a l l y at       the

   barrier.             At this    stage       I was       concious          of    people     trying         to    climb out

   of the      pen but          I was w at ch in g                      as    he had been pushed forward

   onto      the    barrier.           The    barrier       was    across          his    hips,    he    looked back                   at

   me a n d    I could see             that    he was       in pain and very                 red in the face.                      I

   managed         to    push my way to the                front    of the          barrier where                             was.

   By the      time       I struggled          there                    was       bent    double     over         barrier

   with      his    head hang in g           over    the    front.           As    I was     trying      to get          round

   to the      front       of    barrier       I got       pushed against                the edge       of    it and my

   knee      t r a p pe d on one         side but m a n a g e d         to get       round to

   s t a rt e d s h ou ting at           people      to move       back and to help me                   to       pull t

   up.       Alot       of hands        a pp ea re d then and helped                              to s tr ai g h t e n up.

               was       still    s li gh tl y bent         as    the    barrier was            still        across          his

   hips,      he m a n a g e d     to    put his      hands on the barrier                    and to tried to

   a livate        the     pressure.          During        all    this       time       pressure was         still

   coming      from        the    back and          it was       obvious          that    I w o ul d not be able               to

   push                    back.        So    I pulled him a long                  the barrier towards                  the    edge

   of it.           But at the           corner      of    the barrier             I could see that            he was          in

   great      pain again,           as    he was      stuck on the                corner     of the      barrier.              I

   a gain     t ried to help him but I lost                      him as       I was       pushed forward                in

   the    crowd.          It was       getting worse,             my arms were             down at my sides and

   I c o u l d n ’t even m an a g e           to    lift my arms             up.     I could see             peple

 was    stilled        closed.        I h eard s o me on e shout                 that a young girl was

 trapped.           I looked to           right and saw a girl                   aged 2 0 - 2 2 yrs standing

 by me,       she     looked f r i g h t e n e d an d         in pain.           A man behind her m a n ag ed

 to    pick her        by her hips             and I then helped to                pass her forwards              over

 people       heads.        I l ooked down towards                   the gate,         hoping       that    it w o u l d

 be o pen so that             the girl          could get        out but         it was stil le d closed.

 About    four        police    officers             were    s ta nding       on the    raised       concret      area

 in w h i ch     the     barriers         are    set,       they were         telling     us to move back and

 were    p ointing at          the exit.              E v e r y o n e w-as shouting          that    they    could

 not move        back and that             they       sh ou ld open the           gate.       It seemed a long

 time    before        the gate was             opened,       I did not          see   it being       opened

 but    I b ecame aware            that- it had been opened.                       I could see that               people

 wgre    lying        on the floor at                the    front    of the       pens.       Every on e was

 trying       to move       back     to    prevent          these    people       on the floor         being stood

 on.     O nce      the gate was           o pe n e d      it was    the      people    lying on the           floor

 that were          pulled out by the                 police      first,       everyone       else stood back

 and    let    them get        out.        By now          I quite     near      the front      of the       pen,

 I have m a r k e d       on the grid w i t h a number                     two w here        I was    standing.

 Suddenly        I felt       that    I space           had a p p e a r e d    behind me       and I

 m a n a g e d to move        back    up to the             terrace where          I had been o riginally

 standing.            I saw                    leaning agai ns t           the    barrier,      I went       up to

 him.     Just        by _______ I saw that                 a man was         lying    on the floor and he

 was    very blue         in the face a nd two                  other men were            trying      to give him

 the kiss        of    life.       The     two men          doing    this      kept    looking up at us for

    could be t en d ed to.               At about        1 5 3 0 - 1545pm                  and    I went

    back     t ro u gh     the    tunnel    and then sat outside                   the    ground       by a gate.

    W hi l st      I was    in the       ground     I did not see anything                     that    I consider

    to be       criminal         offence.

    police         except    that    the    police       inside       the ground were             telling      us

    to move         out    by the    exit       and the      police        outside       the ground were

    telling         people       to go    in.      There     s ee m e d    to be no       commuinicat ion

    g ro u nd there was            police about          but      they did not           seemed org an is ed

    never       saw a steward.             There      was    no signs        directing          people to the

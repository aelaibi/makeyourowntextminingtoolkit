              Dear Mr Wright

              CRIMINAL AND DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATIONS

              As you know Mr Anderson and myself met with the representatives of the
              Director of Public Prosecutions office and the Police Complaints
              Authority on Friday 25 August 1989.   We have talked through the necessary
              issues which we will invoke as investigating officers once our
              appointment has been implemented.   You will recall that it awaits a
              response from your Police Authority regarding the financial issues. In
              the meantime the possible disciplinary issues arising out of the
              complaints, which I understand Mr Hicks may have made, will be addressed
              by Mr Cooper until we formally take over the appointment.

              However, until our appointment we continue, on your behalf, the Coroner's
              inquiries.   This means we are making contact with a number of your
              officers to help us, as witnesses for death continuity purposes.    I
              understand that a number of members- of your Force are concerned that
              these contacts are for criminal/disciplinary enquiry purposes.   This is
              not currently the state of affairs and is not likely to be so in the
              near future.   I have already been approached by the Police Federation
              Solicitors and the Superintendents Association to clarify our precise
              role at present.   I have told them that we are seeking to interview
              police officers solely as potential witnesses at this stage.   As you
              appreciate, should anything emerge during the course of the witness
              interviews which would suggest some culpability, then the normal
              protections afforded by PACE and Regulation 7 will apply.   However, I
              would stress that we are not making contact with officers where we think
              that these aspects could apply.
I trust that this may be of assistance in reassuring members of your
Force as to the nature of our enquiries at the present time. As and
when that should change I will afford you the courtesy of advising you
accordingly.

Yours sincerely




Assistant Chief Constable
(Hillsborough Inquiry)

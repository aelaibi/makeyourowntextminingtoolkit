However, in the a b s e n c e of p r o p e r CFRs M i n i s t e r s may w i s h to

Our Ref:   FCP/90 35/48/135(S)




Your letter of 1 March on behalf of the Hillsborough Family
Support Group about safety at football grounds has been passed to
this Department because the issues arising from the Final Report
by Lord Justice Taylor are principally matters for the
Home Office.

The two main functions of the Football Licensing Authority (FLA)
will be to ensure, through the licensing system which it will
operate, that all seated accommodation is introduced into football
league grounds.  The FLA will also keep under review the functions
of local authorities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
It will have the powers to amend terms and conditions of safety
certificates should it be necessary to do so.

We have still to make a Commencement Order (which will be subject
to the negative resolution procedure of Parliament) to empower the
FLA to keep under review safety certificates issued by local
authorities.  We shall do so as soon as the Authority is able to
take on the role.

We have already made the Order to set up the FLA as from the
1st June, although clearly it will be a little longer before the
new authority is fully operational.  Its membership has not yet
been announced.

National guidelines on safety at football grounds are already
given in the Home Office/Scottish Office Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds.  This is being revised to take account of the
recommendations made by Lord Justice Taylor.

I understand the Family Support Group's feeling on pitch perimeter
fencing - by which I take it you mean high, barrier, fences rather
than fences or walls of, say, crush barrier height or below.
We do not have details of which grounds have such fences.
The provision of this sort of fence is a matter for local decision



                                                                   /by the

Alistair Burt Esq MP
by the club in consultation with the police and the local
authority responsible for the issue of the safety certificate.

Lord Justice Taylor did not recommend the removal of pitch fences.
We have supported his recommendations on their height and on the
removal of spikes and other obstacles from such fences. The FLA
may well wish to take into account the nature of any crowd
segregation arrangements, including any pitch fencing, when
considering a licence for,a football ground.

When reviewing the safety'certificate the new authority will
almost certainly wish to consider the requirements stipulated in
the safety certificate for the safe egress and for the evacuation
of spectators.  These will all be matters within the Authority's
discretion.

                                   w i t h me        and     I then       walked       down          to     the f o o t b a l l      ground

                     leaving           the     car    n ear    to    the       pub.

                     a very        relaxed atmosphere.

                     We,                      and myself        got       to    the    Leppings           Lane     entance           of    the       ground

                     at    about         1'    O'clock,        walked          through         the    main       gates.         As    we       did    so,     I

                     saw a mou nte d              policeman          to rny right,              I thought           I recognised                him    to     be

                     a    liverpool            policeman,           he    was    stopping            fans       from    entering           the       ground

                     without           tickets.            Apart     from       being      in u n i f o r m ,       I remember             he    had     a

                     black        moustache.

                     There        wa s    a    fe w L i v e r p o o l     supporters            milling          about     at     t h is       time,     s o me

the    Hillsborough                  stewards           met    us at       t hi s      location and               t oo k    us    through,.

I c o u l d n ’t r e a l l y           describe          him a s i d e       from        the       f act    that     he w a s      about

m y age.           Other         stewards          were       standing        behind           the     gate.

              and       myself         followed          the    steward,            he    took        us    to    the      canteen area

at    the     rear       of      the    West       Stand.

There        was     another,           older         steward        there,         both were              wearing         fluorescent

waistcoats,              he      told      us    to     go    into     the    seating              area     of    the a n d       see       one

of    th e    stewards            there         and     he was       to    explain            what                   and     myself

were    to      do      during         the      match.         The     older        steward          was     a white         male          in

his    fifties,            a     bit    smaller          t h a n me,       1 c a n ’t         really        remember         anything

else    about           him.         Before        we    left     him,       he     hadned          me a f l u o r e s c e n t

waistcoat.                              and      myself        walked        up     the       stairs        into     the     stand

itself        where        we     saw      two     further        stewards.               Again        we    explained            who      we

were,        showed        him       our     identification               and a s k e d            how we        could      help.




was    speaking            to     him      for     quite       a while        and        I detected              a Sheffield

accent.            I can         only      remember           he was      weearing             a    fluorescent             waistcoat

with    his        identification                  on his       lapel,        I cant           remember           what      he w a s

wearing         underneath.                  The      other     fellow        was        older,        around        retirement                 age.

I think        his       h air       was     thinning.           All       I do        remember            about     him     was       again

he w a s      wearing            the    waistcoat             with     his    identification                     on his      lapel.              I

remembered              t hi s    quite         clearly        because        in       the     majority           Liverpool

stewards           do    not      adopt         ttri^s p r o c e d u r e .        At     no    time        was    I told         the

emergency            procedures              adopted          inside      t he      ground.                       <^ ,

I was        told       to d i r e c t       supporters           to      their        allocated            s e a t s , as       is rny

usual        j o b j o b as          a steward          at     Anfield.             I then          remained         with        these          two

st e w a r d s , with                            at     this    post,        a gangway              about        three      quarters             of

the    way along               the     West      Stand.         I d o n ’t k n o w            the    number        of      the    gangway

but    it     is     the       last     gangway          on    the     left       as     your       f ace    the     ptich.            I

stood       about        halfway           along          the    gangway,           about       in the m i d d l e           of    the

and                 who       were     supposed             to       be    in    the     pens     but      I c o u l d n ’t see            them.

There       wa s    a surge,           constant             movement,             within        the       c owd      but    nothing

unusual        from my           experience                as    a steward              from    this       type       of    ga me.         I

remember           saying        to                       Lhat       it w as      just     like a          cattlepen,             it was

that    packed           but     the       strange          thing          was,    as     I looked across,                   the       other

pens    were        relatively              e mpt y .

After       a whi l e ,        we     then mov ed               b ack      to    the     gangway,          and       carried       on

directing           f ans      to     their          seats.           From where           we     sto o d ,       had a g o od          view

of    the    pitch        but       the     height          of       the    stand        meant       we    only       had a       limited

view    of     the       lo wer       pens,          I could          only       se e    the    front          row of       people.

We    carried        on       until        ten       to    three,          five     to    three,          I c a n ’t be          too

certain,           the    number           of    supporters                entering        the       s t a n d wa s        getting

greater       and        1 was        k ept      too       busy       directing           them.           By    this       time,       the

stand       was     filling           up    really          fast.           In    fact,        there       were       so    many

supporters,              I c o u l d n ’t d i r e c t            all       of    them.

The    match        had       started.               The    stand          itself        had    filled          up    to    such an

extent       that        f ans      were        sitting          in       the    aisles,        it was          full,       they       were

even    sitting           on     the       stairs.              Over       ten minutes,              the       stands       had    filled

I remember           all       the     supporters                standing           once       the    kick        off      had    been

taken.           Looking          down       the       fro n t ,     I could            see       one       or    two     fans       beginning

to    climb       o ver      the       fence       from        the      pens.           One       of    them,          I could         see         was

                   an e l e c t r i c i a n            who     l i v es      in                             Liverpool,            he      was

standing          by a       policeman             on       the    pitch.              I cant          be m o r e       exact        as    to

where

                                                                  but     1 c a n ’t r e m e m b e r              wh at    he     was      wearing

a pa r t fro                  s , he         was       s t a n d i ng     on      the       edge       of    the       pitch      with         his

arms    outspread and                   holding             his    h e a d as          if    to    say       "What        happening,"                he

looked       half       confused,             half          ups e t .        I c o u l d n ’t d e s c r i b e             the     policeman.

It s e e m e d     to     escalate            more and             more          people       were          trying        to    get       out       over

the    fen c e .        Supporters                by    this       time,          had moved             to       the    front        of    the

seating          area     and       I could            see     som e      had      their          hands          over     the     parapet,               it

appeared          to    me    trying          to       pull       people          up.

I d i d n ’t r e a l i s e         what       was       happening                1 would          not       be a b l e     to     describe

any    of    these        peop le,           it was          so    packed          and       people          were       s t ill      coming          up

the    stairs          into       the      stan d .

One    or    two       supporters             were          being       l aid      on       the    pitch and              police          were

giving       first        aid along               with       supporters.

The    whole       scenario             seemed          to     stop       for      a minute.                 As    I was        looking             down

you    c o u l d n ’t r e a l i s e          what       was       happening             then       the       fans       started           to       spill

out    o nto      the     pitch         over       the       fence        more         than       ever.           The     match        was         still

going       on    I saw       one       of    th e      f ans      running             out    onto

the    pitch and             up    to      Bruce        G A O B B L A R , the           goalkeeper,                grabbing            him and

pointing          to    the       p en s     as    if       explaining             to       him.        I couldn't              describe             him

as    I was       too     busy         keeping          an     eye      on       the    fans       in       the W e s t        Stand.          I

could       see    that       several             of    the       supporters                had    been          covered        in     coats,

from    my       experience             at    Heysel,             I knew          they       were       dead.           One     was       a woman,

white,       with       a white            top     on,       in her          late       thirties,                early     forties             I

would       say.        She       was      laid        on    the     pitch,            virtually             directly           in     front         of

me.     I remember                so    clearly             because          a    policeman             with       a flat         cap      on

removed       the w h i t e           cardigan                covering          her     face         and     nodded        his     head,             he

further       along         the       pi tch.                 This must           have       been      a b o u t half         past t hr e e .

At    about       this      time,          maybe          slightly           before,            an    ambulance            came         o nto       the

pitch and            drove       down          the     left         hand     side       coming          behind         the    goal        where

it    stopped.

Fans     were        running          to       the     sides          of    the      pitch,          pull^^ng        hoardings            off        the

pitc h ,     hei>qaing them.                    I pointed                this     out      to                        "i-^Xidn't          notice

            and      I was       worried.

By    this    time,         a    cordon             of P o l i c e         officers          had      formed along               the      halfway

line,       I don't         think          they        or      the N o t t i n g h a m          Forest         f ans    knew       what         was

ha p p e n i n g .

After       this,      I said             to                        "I     cant      stay       here,        I ’ve     got    to     get        out

of    the    ground.”                We    walked             out     of   the       ground          through         the     entrance               we

had    entered         previously.

Just     outside           the       ground,           on L e p p i n g s         L a n e,      I saw       a man        I know          to     be

                            of                                                                        I've      known        him     for

twenty       years.             He    was       cry i n g ,         he     looking         for       hi s    brother

had    been       in the         seats          while                      , he      told       us,    were         in the       pens.              We

started       to w a l k         back          to    the       car, L i v e r p o o l        fans      were         everywhere,

angry       and      crying.              I remember                three       police          officers            on h o r s e s       in the

Leppings          Lane.          One       of w h o m          was l a u g h i n g ,         I r e m e m b e r he        had a

moustache,            nothing             e l se.         A    Liverpool             fan went           up to h i m a n d          started

having       a go at            him,       swearing              at      him,     saying,            "Wh a t    are     you      laughing

at?     You       should         be       in t h e r e         h e l p i n g . 11                     had      to    pull     him        off

eventually            trying          to       calm       him       down.       He    walked          away      and      I lost          sight           of

him    I would         not       be a b l e          to       describe          him.

Then    we    got      to       the       Sportsman             L.H wi th            the     other          supporters           and      waited

             for                 and                 Eventually          they    both   turned       up,    I rang   my

             brother        in    law    from a      public       phone    box    a n d we    then    left    for

             Liverpoool.               That's    all    I can      remember.

             I usually           get    paid £ 4 . 50p      for   my     duties    at   a football          match.    I was

             too    upset,        I didn't       even    think      of    being    paid      for   t hi s   one.

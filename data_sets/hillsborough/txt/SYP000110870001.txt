                  On Saturday              15 A p r i l     1989       I commenced               d u t y at    Dodworth         at    8.30am,

            y/   /' about    9.40am         that       day.       Serial            15 wa s      made    up e n t i r e l y     of    officers

                   from     B2 S u b       D i v i s i o n and was            commanded           by PS       1 75 7 B u r n s .      We w e r e

fr     & (* ■      deployed          to    the    inside        of     the L e p p i n g s        Lane      turnstiles          and    were

                   detailed          to    search       persons          entering           the     ground         for   missiles        alcohol,

                  and     o t h er    prohibited            items.            Ou r    initial        order        was    to    cover

                   turnstiles             9 to    16 w h i c h       afforded             entry     into      the L e p p i n g s     Lane

                   terrace,          and    the    West       Stand.               Shortly       after      the      turnstiles        were

                   opened       it w a s      noticed         t ha t     the w r o n g        s i g n wa s     over      turnstiles           9 and

                   10,    and    these       were       partitioned                 off    from    us    by m e a n s      of a m e t a l

                   barrier       inside          the    gr o u n d ,     so        that    people       entering         through       these

                   turnstiles             were    afforded           access          into     the N o r t h S t a n d .         I was        not

                   deviated          from     this      location.

From      the    time    the     turnstiles                 opened        there       wa s      a .steady f l o w             of

persons         into    th e    ground,            and      on the        whole       they       were       good       natured with

few      objecting       to     being        searched and                 s o me     even       enjoying          the       se a r c h .

Two      males    who    entered            the      ground         during         the     early       stages          announced

that      they were          Police         officers            from Merseyside,                     although          they        did      not

show      any    identification                  nor     were       they       required          to.        They       did       express

the      opinion       that     th e    number           of     searches           seemed        to    be     excessive             unti l

t he     reasons       were     explained              to     them       and    then       they acce p t e d               it.




I wa s     aware       that     th e    number           of     people         entering          the       ground          seemed        to

be     very     slow,    and     then when               I could          see      that      the      outside          of     the

turnstiles            seemed     to     be       filling           up    I remember             looking          at    the       time,        it

was      2.15pm.        Large      c r ow d s        were       massing         outside          the       turnstiles              and

people         began    to     scale        the      perimeter            w a l l.        These       th at      had       scaled        the

w al l    did    not    come     down        into m y a r e a             but      climbed           along       the       top     of

door      *B ’ a n d    onto     the        roof       of     turnstiles             A/G.        Some       sat       it    out     on      the

roof      of    turnstiles         11       to     16.        By    now     the      flow       of    people          into       the     ground

had      increased       immensely,                and      the a c t u a l        j ob    of    searching             became           more

difficult.             There     were        people           entering          the       ground       who       were       obviously

very agitated            by w h a t         w as     happening            outside,           and were            pleading           to

help      with a       situation            t ha t     a p p a r e n t l y was        becoming             out    of       c on t r o l ,

and      that    people        were     being          h ur t      in the       crush        outside          the      ground,           of

people         trying    to     get     into         the      ground.           As    t h ey     got       through          the

turnstiles            some     were     sweating              profusely            and were           screaming             that

friends         and    members         of    t h e ir       families           were       still       outside          the       g ro u n d ,

and      that    if s o m e t h i n g       was      not      done       then      someone           was    likely          to     die.         I

explained         that       I was      able         to do a n y t h i n g           about       it a n d        that       there        were

officers         outside        who     would          deal        with     it,      but     obviously                this       d i d n ’t

appease         the    people      and       they went              to    other       officers             screaming             the     same

s to    them.         Inspector          Bennett,            I believe             it was,          arrived            on    the       scene

  and     climbed       o nt o     the      roof       of    turnstiles              9 to         16 a n d       began       to       get

  people        down    into       the      ground.           One       such         person was             a youth          who was

  wearing        a turquoise             T shi rt ,          who     I. h a d      kept      watch          on    because             he was

  one     of    the    first       to    c l i m b o nt o         the     roof              I had          told    him       earlier

  t hat    if    he h a d a           t i c k e t he c o u l d       get     down and             he       would       be    allowed

  into     the     ground,            but     he r e f u s e d m y          of f e r .     I saw           a man       approach             and

  hand     to    the    youth,          who      was    s t il l     on     the       roof,        a ticket.                This

  obviously           caused       him      to    get       down and          on     doing         so      I told       him       t ha t      he

 was      being       ejected         from       the    ground.             There         were        l a r ge    numbers             of

  people mil l i n g          around          the      turnstiles             and        I had        to    stand abuse                from

  them     as     I led the           youth       away,       they        obviously wanted                       him    to       remain           in

  the     ground.           1 was       already         aware        that       any       ejections              had    to       be m a d e

  through Gate              *C * a n d      I moved          towards          them with               the    youth.              As    I

  passed        behind       turnstiles             A/G      there        were       a similar              number          of    people

  milling        around       the       turnstiles,               and     because           of     these         people          whilst           I

  could        see G a t e     *C',      X c o ul d         not     see w h o        was     operating             it.           As    I got

  approximately              five       yards       away      from        the      door         I saw       that       it    had       b ee n

  opened and           then       a flood           of p e o p l e    began          to    e nt e r        the    ground.              Such

  were     the     n u m b e r s of     people          entering            t ha t    I feared             for    my    own        safety

  and     I released my               hold       on the y o u t h            I was        escorting              and    t o ok        refuge

  in a     turnstile          until         the     flood         had     subsided.                As      these       people          ha d

  entered        the    ground          there       was      obvious          p anic        and       they were             literally

  climbing            over e a c h       other         in a n a t t e m p t to            get     to the         terraces.                  Afte

  they     had p a s s e d    I   gave        what      assistance                 I could         to      those       injured              and

  trampled and when                   the     situation             appeared             c a lm    I returned               to my

  saw     that     people         were      handing          tickets          to      people           in the      turnstiles.

They were             obviously            people         wh o    h ad      entered          illegally             and were         trying

to    get       others       into      the       g ro u n d ,     two       of    these       I managed             to    r e ta in .     As

w e ll     as    full       tickets         they were             also       trying          to h a n d       b a ck     parts      of

tickets          and       these      I also        managed            to    r e ta in .       The       problem with

climbing          the       perimeter            wall      ceased           when a mounted                officer            took     up a

position          outside          turnstile              16.




Some       ti me a f t e r        this      two     uniformed               officers                           the       doors within

discussion             t oo k     place         between          them       which       unfortunately                  I did       not

h e a r.        A few       seconds         l ater        that        gate       was    opened       by       the      two    officers

and      once     more       I had         to    s ee k     refuge          as    the    c r o w d -r o a r e d        into     the

ground.           After         the     rush       into      the       ground          the    doors       were         closed and         the

two      officers           went      a w a y.      They were               not       officers       from Serial                13 or

Serial          14.




Shortly          after       this      a    number          of    officers             entered       the        ground and            rac ed

towards          the       terraces         but      at     this       stage          I was     unaware            of w h a t      had

happened,             as    there       was      only       the       one    r a di o    issued          to     the      serial

sergeant,             and    at    that         time      the     serial          sergeant         wa s       busy       elsewhere.

Shortly after                this       Sergeant            Burns          returned          and   ordered             the    turnstiles

to    be     cl os e d.



At    about       this       time       a man        emerged           from       the    area       at    the       rear      of    the

terraces           in a v e r y         distraught               cond it ion a nd was                only w e aring                the    one

shoe.           He w a s     sweating            and      told        us    that       someone       wa s       likely        to    get

hurt       on    the       terrace         if    somebody             d i d n ’t do a n y t h i n g .              When      the    crowd

                          Cabin,            I showed          the        shoes        to    the       man and       then made             m y way,          with        the

                          rest      of      the    serial          towards            the    tunnel          beneath       the       West       Stand.

                          As     I entered             the    tunnel         I could             see       people    coming          towards           me,       s o me

                          and     I attempted                to    do     this,        but       t hi s     wa s me t     with       a    torrent           of a b u s e ,

                          and     the       only       people       willing            to m o v e          away were       those          who        were       injured

                          or     in n e e d       of    space        because           they       had      been     caught          up    in the         incident.

                          Eventually              people          di d    begin        to m o v e          back d o w n    the       tunnel,           but       they

  E N D OF              REPORT
                  INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND
                     ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989




STEVEN RICHARDSON
POLICE CONSTABLE 265^
B2 DODWORTH




On Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Dodworth at 8.350am, fro® there

I travelled to Wombwell and met up with the rest of Serial 15 before

travelling to Hillsborough, arriving in the North Stand at about 9,b0am

that day.   Serial 15 was made up entirely of officers from B2 Sub Division

and was commanded by PS 1757 Burns.   We were deployed to the inside of the

Leppings Lane turnstiles and were detailed to search persons entering the

ground for missiles alcohol and other prohibited items.   Our initial order

was to cover turnstiles 9 to 16 which afforded entry into the Leppings Lane

terrace, and the West Stand. Shortly after the turnstiles were opened it was

noticed that the wrong sign was over turnstiles 9 and 10, and these were

partitioned off from us by means of a metal barrier inside the ground, so that

people entering through these turnstiles   were afforded access into the

North Stand.   I was not deviated from this location.



From the time the turnstiles opened there was a steady flow of persons into the

ground, and on the whole they were good natured with few objecting to being

searched and some even enjoying the search.   Two males who entered the ground

during the early stages announced that they were Police officers from

Merseyside, although, they did not show any identification nor were they

required to.   They did express the opinion that the number of searches seemed

to be excessive until the reasons were explained to them and then they

accepted it.
                                 2




I was aware that the number of people Entering the ground seemed to

very slow, and then when I could see that the outside of the turnstiles seemed to

be filling up I remember looking at the time, it was 2.15pm.      Large crowds were

massing outside the turnstiles and people began to scale the perimeter wall.

These fiat had scaled the wall did not come down into my area but climbed along

the top of door       and onto theroof of turnstiles A/G.   Some sat it out on the

roof of turnstiles 11 to 16. By now the flow of people into the ground had

increased immensly, and the actual job of searching became more difficult.

There were people entering the ground Who were obviously very agitated by what

was happening outside, and were pleading to help with a situation that

apparently was becoming out of control, and that people were being hurt in the

crush outside the ground, of people trying to get into the ground.      As they got

through the turnstiles some were sweating profusely and were screaming that

friends and members of their families were still outside the ground, and that

if something was not done then someone was likely to die.      I explained that

I was able to do anything about it and that there were officers outside who

would deal with it, but obviously this didn't appease the people and they went

to other officers screaming the same to them.       Inspector Bennett, I believe

it was, arrived on the scene and climbed onto the roof of turnstiles 9 to 16

and began to get people down into the ground.      One such person was a youth who

was wearing a turquoise T shirt, who I had kept watch on because he was one of the

first to climb onto the roof.     I had told him earlier that if he had a ticket

he could get down and he would be allowed into the ground, but he refused my

 ffer.    I saw a man approach and hand to the youth, who was still on the roof,

a ticket.     This obviously caused him to get down and on doing so I told him

that he     was being ejected from the ground.   There were large numbers of people

milling around the turnstiels and I had to stand abuse from them as I led the youth
                                                                                      i
away, they obviously wanted him to remain in the ground.      I was already aware

that any ejections had to be made through Gate 'C and I moved towards them
                                  3




with the youth. As I passed be&ind turnstiles A/G there were a similar number

of people milling around the turnstiles, and because of these people Whilst

I could see Gate 'C', I could not see who was operating it.    As I got approximately

five yards away from the door I saw that it had been opened and then a flood of

people began to enter the ground. Such were the numbers of people entering that

I feared for my own safety and I released my hold on the youth I was escorting

and took refuge in a turnstile until the flood had subsided.    As these people

had entered the ground there was obvious panic and they were literally climbing

over each other in an attempt to get to the terraces.   After they had passed

I gave what assistance I could to those injured and trampled and when the

situation appeared calm I returned to my position.   At this time I believe

the doors were still open. I would estimate that there would have well in

excess of a thousand people having entered through Gate 'C'. Wien I

returned to my position I saw that people were handing tickets to people in the

turnstiles. They were obviously people who had entered illegally and were trying

to get others into the ground, two of these I managed to retain. As well as full

tickets they were also trying to hand back parts of tickets and these I also

managed to retain.   The problem with climbing the perimeter wall ceased whan a

mounted officer took up a position outside turnstile 16.

Some time after this two uniformed officeBs came to the doors within my section,

Gate 'B', and took hold of the handles as if to open them.    A steward

remonstrated with them not to open the gates and a discussion took place

between them Which unfortunately I did not hear.   A few seconds later that gate

was opened by the two officers and once more I had to seek refuge as the crowd

roared   into the ground.   After the rush into the ground the doors were closed

and the two officers went away.    They were not officers from Serial 15 or

Serial 1^.



Shortly after this a number of officers entered the ground and raced towards

the terraces but at this stage I was unaware of what had happened, as there
                                  k




was only the one radio issued to the serial sergeant, and at that time

the serial sergeant was busy elsewhere.       Shortly after this Sergeant

Burns returned and ordered the turnstiles to be closed.



At about this time a man emerged from the area at the rear of the terraces

in a very distraught condition and was only wearing the one shoe. He was

sweating and told us that someone was likely to get hurt on the terrace

if somebody didn't do anything.       When the crowd had surged through Gate 'B'

a number of shoes had been left behind and these had been placed at the side

of the programme sellers Porta Cabin. I showed the shoes to the man and then

made my, with the rest Of the serial towards the tunnel beneath the West Stand.



As I entered the tunnel I could see people coming towards me, some injured

and others helping them, some making their way on their own.       It was obvious

that people needed to be moved out of the terracing and I attempted to do

this, but this was met with a torrent of abuse, and the onlt people willing

to move away were those who were injured or in need of space because they

had been caught up in the incident.      Eventually people did begin to move

back down the tunnel, but they did so reluctantly, and I could see that

the main activity was taking place on the toueh line.       I made my way down

to the touchline through, the Centre North section of the terracing, because

I could see the incident was taking place in the Centre South section which

I couldn't reach.    As I neardd the touchline I saw a Police officer

attempting to kick    away the wire mesh of the fence at the track side. People

were still trying to force a way through, in the Centre South section.

Once onto the trackside a gave what assistance I could to the dead and injured.



I can only describe what happened on the terraces on my arrival as a form

of mass hysteria and possibly frustration at being told to move when they
                                      5




    wanted to watch the game.



    I was not aware until later that the game had been started.

coming       f r o m the B a s s e t t P u b l i c H o u s e .     These youths were running along

the    road       and       stopping       Public       Service              vehicles                as    they       travelled                in    the

direction          of       Hillsborough          F o o t b a l 1 ground.

At    approximately             3.00       pm    on    this        day       X had             made       may    way       with       the       other

Claywheels             Lane,    we       were    approached              by       a    Police             Inspector          whom          I    do

not    knw    and       informed          that    there       was        a    disturbance                   at       the    football

ground       and       they    required          immediate           back             up.        A    Police          transit          van          then

conveyed          us    to    the    Leppings          Lane        end       of       the       ground.

As    we    approached          this       entrance          gate        1 saw             a    large       number          of    fans

standing          around       outside          the    gates        and       a       cordon          of    Police          Officers

preventing             entry.        We    were       informed           that          assistance                was       required

inside       the       ground       so    I made       my    way     through                   the    entrance             gate       and       made

my    way    to    the       tunnel       which       lead     to    the          terraces.                 As       I did       so    I saw

people       running          out    of    the    tunnel           and       there             were       also       people       laying             on

the    ground          outside       the    tunnel          and     inside             its       entrance.                 Some       of       the

people       were       being       sick    but       I was        unable             to       see    any       further          injures             to

them.        Many       of    these       were    being       assisted                 by       St    Johns          Ambulance             men       and

                 I then       made          my     way         onto       the     terraces           where             I saw       a    large       number          of

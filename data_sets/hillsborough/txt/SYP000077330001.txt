informed          by PC       1789 F / a t m a n , w h o          was    stood       at    th e S u p e r m a r k e t         door,

that    the M a n a g e d       of/the        store       had      closed          the    drinks          counter          following

a    disturbance          ins i d e .       P . C.      Rimmer          and myself             at    the       request        of    the

Manager       remained          present        in the         a r e a as       a    preventative                measure

for    further          likely       disturbances.                 Customers             requesting             to    purchase

alcoholic          drinks       whether        Football            supporters             or L o c a l

customers          were       tur ned away.             As    a    result,         numerous           supporters

attending          the    fixture        requested            the w h e r e a b o u t s         of    other          licenced

premises          from which          they     could         buy    drink.           They were             told       t hat    no

licence       premises          around       the       stadium would                be    open       for       business.            A

large       amount       of    these     supporters               had    been      drinking,              but w e r e n ’t dru n k ,

they    were       informed          that    anyone          being       drunk       attempting                to    gain
admission           to     the      stadium would              be     t u r n e d away.



At     approximately                1 pm PC       Rimmer       and myself              resumed        pa trol        along

Catchbar           Lane.           At    the    junction           of C a t e h b a r      Lane     and Leppings             Lane          it

was     evident          that       there       was     a    build       up of        supporters.              There       was    a

large        Police        presence            and    there        were     no      disturbances,               We w e r e

repeatedly asked                    by L i v e r p o o l      supporters              where       they    could       obtain

tickets        from and             in    particular           a group           of    7 youths          who were          climbing

onto     the       roof       of    the    PoliceBox           situated             in C a t c h b a r    Lane       and    the

adjacent           tre e s ,       from    the       North     Wales        area were             without       tickets.              These

youths        were       removed          without           incident.            This      location appeared                 to       be a

popular        place          for       ticket       less     supporters              to   congregate           in a n      effort          to

see     into       the     ground,         constant           a t t e n ti o n was         being      paid      to    this       area

during        the     day.



After        visiting           the      Penistone           Road     end      of     Parkside        Road making            our w a y

towards        Leppings             Lane       end    of     the    stadium around                 S.53pm again             there

were     a    number          of    supporters              climbing        onto       the    roof       of    the    Police          Box

in C a t c h b a r       Lane,          three     youths       were       also        climbing        the wall         of a       school

across        the     road.             These     supporters             were       removed.          Around 3pm            the F o r c e

Coach        stopped          in C a t c h b a r      Lane     and       the     civillian          driver       informed             us

that     additional                Officers          were     required           in L e p p i n g s      Lane    at    the W e s t

Stand.         PC R i m m e r           and myse lf          immediately              went    to    the W e s t       Stand       in

response.             On      our a r r i v a l       there        were     around         S00     supporters          scattered

about        the    street          in L e p p i n g s       Lane     and      Police        Officers          were    in the

process        of     cordoning            of f      the     stadium        entrance          to    the W e s t       Stand.           We

were     unable          to     locate         other        officers        of      our    serial        and    following

1 iason wit h            officers          at     the       gates     we w e r e       informed          that an       incident

had    occurred whereby                    supporters              had    been        injured.           It was       not    known          by

t he   Officers            as      to    the    extent        or    seriousness              of    the    situation.              I

the    pitch.



We    were    instructed            by a n       Officer        pr^Tent          of    the        rank     of C h i e f

and    Fire    Service,            ernergelctey v e h i c l e s .             This     was        complied with and                 the

Supporters          began        evacuating            the    ground.            We    were        then     instructed             to

assist       the    evacuation             of    th e W e s t      Stand        keeping           supporters         away         from

the    sterile          area,      where        there    were       a     number       of     injured          persons        being

attended       to       by A m b u l a n c e     crews,       Firemen,           Police           Officers        and

supporters,             following          an a nn o un ce me n t          over       th e    tannoy        system,          t hat       the

fixture       had       been abandoned.                 During          the     evacuation            supporters             were

making       various         comments           regarding          th e    organisation               of    the     game      and       put

the    whole       responsabiIities                   onto    the       shoulders            of    the P o l i c e      and       the

Football       Association               for     what     had      happened.            Supporters               were     reluctant

to    comply with            anything           the    Police       Officers           asked        of     them and          several

supporters          confronted             individual           Officers,             but w e r e        dragged away              by

fellow       supporters.              An    elderly Liverpool                    supporter            and a youth             in a

track    suit       assisted          the       Police       greatly and              the     supporters            accepted            his

instructions             without         question.            Numerous           supporters              requested           the

whereabout          of     the     injured        and    they were              informed           t hat    they would             be

taken    to    the       Hallamshire             and General              Hospitals.



Following          the     evacuation            of    the W e s t        Stand       I rejoined            other       mernebers

Halifax       Road area.              We    were      then      instructed             to     return        to    the N o r t h

Herries        Rd.         There       were         a     lot        of    supporters           t hat      we     passed who             were

drinking         from        cans,         presumably                 beer,.          As    I have      said,        I am     not a

follower         of       football          and          I could           not     say whose          supporters            t h e y wer e.

       When     1 first             saw     this     lad     I think        he w a s     alive        as      he    had      some    colour

       in him.            After        the    resuscitation                attempt        I saw       the P o l i c e         Officer

       ;tand      up

                                                                                                         T h e o t h e r g uy m o v e d

       I c a n ’t say w h e t h e r               h e ’d r e g a i n e d    consciousness                or    not      but    his       b ody

       d i d mov e .           He     then    appeared         to    just        ’f l a k e    ou t ’.        People         round       him

       started           massaging           his     heart     again        but     this       appeared            to   be    of    no    use.

       I then       assumed            the    iacl ha cl died.              fhis w o u l d        hav e       b e e n at      about.      1_KiU

       I had      not      noticed           much       else    going       during        t hat       incident          but     I then         saw

       that     there          were       supporters           ripping       down adv e r t i s i n g              hoardings         to

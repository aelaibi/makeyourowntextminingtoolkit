              I am a single man living at the above address.

              On .Saturday April          15th 1989 (150489)              I went to the Liverpool -v-

             Nottingham F o r ^ t        football match at Hi 1lsborouah. S h e f f i e ld to see my

              team Li v e r n a l      play in the semi-final of the FA Cup.

              I am a season ticket holder and obtained my ticket from Anfield for

             £6.00.          The ticket was for the terraces at the Leppings Ln

              end of the g r o u n d .

              I travelled to the game with a friend of mine named                     of

              We arr ived in Sheffield at about 10.40 am (1040) although there were

              a lot of Liverpool suppgMsgrs on the train.it w a s n ’t a football

      special.      At the statj^fn in Sheffield there were already a lot of

      Liverpool     suppArta/s t h e r e .         The Police took us all outside to a

      ’double decker*        bus which took us to the g r o u n d .       We got there about

      11.30 am <1130).

      When we were at the ground^fffy friend bought a picket                       The game

      f rom a ticket taut f t y r f L e Z 5 .Q Q .     Altho ugh he is also a

      season ticket holder for Anfield,                  he was not allocated a ticket.

      We then went and had something to eat and then to a                                             ,

      there was a lot of Liverpool                 supporters drinking in the pub,      but

      there was no trouble and I d i d n ’t see anyone who was drunk,
                            m s - r f ku*> .
      We got back to the enti
                           itnancejto the grot      at about 2.00 pm <1400) and

      I saw no Police or Stewards giving directions.                    There wasjKf^queue at

      the time and we walked straight up to the tufraffles a nd through to

      the area at the back.                  We then went through the U ^       / L eadinq to the

      terraces and turned right                    o       area    (Pen 3.)     At that time
      ----------
      there  was a lot of peop                     the pen but it was not full,      there was

      enough room for me to get my programme out of my pocket and read it,

      From the time I went through the turnstiles to my match position,                           I

      did not see any Police or S t e w ar d s giving di rection./*fhe only reason
V'd   I knew where to go was because I went to the same^/fiatch last y e a r .

      At no time whilst            I was      in the ground did I see anyone drinking

      alcohol.

      At about 2.30 cm (1430)                      left the pen to go to the toilet,        and at

      that time the crowd was getting w o r s e , your movements were restricted

      but at this stage no more so than at any other Liverpool                      game.     I

      have indicated on a qrij^sheet my position in the pen at this time.

 \    At ajaout 2.50 pm (T350)                the crowd was getting w o r s e, in fact it was

      quite bad.       Lots of people were still entering from the t u n n el, in

      fact          was carried fjy'ward with this crowd when he returned from

                                                                                   8363

the toilets, and ended up about ten feet             in front of m e ,     There was

no way we could have reached each other at that time

S hortly afterwards the teams c             out and that's the last I saw of

them.     The whistle went to start the game and from then on it was

total    confusion and chaos,        nobody knew what was happening.          I could

hear    people screaming down the front.          They were screaming for the

Police to open the gates,        I could hardly b r ^ t h e and had difficulty

keeping on my feet.        The Police on theyj^ltch ignored the people's

screams and turned away towards the-^pitch.

Quite a few minutes       later the Pol i c g/ stood on the f ront railings

shouting at the people to get b«rck, people were               climbing over the>lf9rp

and onto the pitch.        About that time they must have o penedJ>l^?e g a t e

because more people were getting onto the pitch,                but the one gate

w a s n ’t enough and the people were all trying to get through,               it ended

up with the Police        dragging     people through. I had got myself against

a crush barrier     and managed       to keep upright, this chaos lasted for

about    15 minutes,   then slowly the crowd in the pen became less, with

lots of people now on the pitch.            I then saw lots of ^fj» ~ t h e

floor    ij^tba— p e n , and lots on the floor near                gate.    There was

a great    ’clump’ of bodies by thi^ gate and together with some others

1 heJLped carry these bodies bock through the t e r r a c e s , through the

tunnel    to the area at theypa c k .

I then started looking for               but c o u l d n ’t find him,   I made my way

back to the pen     and onto the p i t c h .   I still    could n ’t find him so

started to help     the    injured on the pitch.         I pulled a ’bill b o a r d ’

down and with others helped c a r r y y z h e   dead and injured to ambulances

at the other end of the groui

I was not physi^c^ly injured myself

                                                         I could still not find

        and just sat on the steps of the stand and was crying.                 A

         policewoman came up to me

                        I d i d n ’t receive any treatment there,     in fact I helped

         some   lads with broken legs from the ambulances.          I ’ve no idea what

         time    I left the ground or arrived at the jafospital

         I later found out that              lad been ijpured and was on a life

         support machine at the North ern G e n i a l    H o s p i t a l , but he is now out

         of hospital and slowly recovering

         As I said earlier,      I attended the match at Hillsborough last year and

         on that occasion the PolJ.ee stoppedy^ou prior to getting to the

                           :| y s f c r
         turnstiles to check              ticket'T this resulted in a more orderly

         entry to the ground.

         Another    point I I m n k    is important is that   if the Police had reacted

         sooner    in operutng the g a t e s , lives may have been saved.

         The    last thing I wish to say concerns the way the % i ckfl#f were

         <pl l^QCjg^edU Liverpool     has twice the travelling fans and should have

         had a bigger share of tickets and allocated the larger stand.

         Average gates at Anfield are 40,000,         they were given 24,000 tickets

         which leaves 16,000 genuine supporters disappointed and many going to

         the game without tickets.

         I have been told about the facilities of the           ’Help L i n e ’ although I

         have seen details in the presi

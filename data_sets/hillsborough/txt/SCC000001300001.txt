(4)       IMPLEMENTATION OF POLL TAX
                     The City Treasurer submitted a letter received from the
           Department of the Environment in response to the representations
           made to the Government by the City Council for additional funding
           for local authorities towards the cost of implementing the Poll
           Tax and in particular the cost of the enhanced computer facilities
           required for this purpose.
                     The reply referred to the fact that the provision made
           in the 1989/90 RSG settlement ini respect of the current costs next
          year for preparing for the introduction of the Poll Tax was in
           line with the estimate of those costs made by Price Waterhouse
           and was consistent with the figures put forward then by the local
           authority associations.  It was stated in the letter that it had
          never been the Government's intention to pay all of the preparation
          costs incurred by charging authorities because this would leave
          no incentive for efficiency and cost effectiveness.    The Government
          considered that the central support which was being made available
          was reasonably balanced and provided some taxpayer support (through                t
          grants) such that there was no need for costs to fall unfairly on
          local taxpayers and chargepayers, if their authority implemented
          the new system in an efficient and cost effective way.
          RESOLVED: That (a) the contents of the letter now submitted be
          noted and copies of the letter be supplied to the Sheffield Members
          of Parliament; and
                     (b) the City Treasurer be requested to continue to pursue
          this matter through the Association of Metropolitan Authorities.

(5)       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL

          City Council in accordance with Section 138 of the Local Government
          Act 1972 to the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal which has been

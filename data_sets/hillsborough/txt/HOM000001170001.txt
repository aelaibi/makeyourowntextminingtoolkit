PATRICK HIGGINS states :
1   ,                                                                     I am a Station

        Officer with SYMAS based at Batemoor, which is situate at

        the south end of the city of Sheffield.                            My call number

        when on duty is
2   .   I joined the ambulance service in March 1975 and undertook

        what       was    then a basic training course over a two week

        period.           Each ambulanceman had to complete this course

        before going out on to the road.

3   .   x followed           up     this    course with a six weeks            intensive

        training course at Markfield.                           This was a residential

        co u rse.           Thereafter,           I have undertaken various other

        courses          that      have    been       made   available,    i nc l u d i n g   an

        Instructional              Methods Course,           a First    Line Supervisory

        Course and also a NEBSS Course.                        This latter course was

        also residential,                 based at Stannington,          and lasted eight

        weeks.           I have not undertaken any paramedic training.

4.      When       I     joined      the    Ambulance          Service    my   title      was

        Ambulanceman.               In 1980 I became a Leading Ambulanceman and

        in     O ctober,           1983    I was      promoted to Station Officer.

        Promotion           is      gained       on    m e r i t and   involves     taking

        examinations and attending on interviews.

5.      Following the Bradford Disaster,                        and Justice Popplewells'

        Report,          SYMAS drew up their own Incident Plan in the event

        of     a    si m i l a r    tragedy taking place at Hillsborough and

        Brammell Lane, which is Sheffield United's ground.                                    The

        plan envisaged a similar fire breaking out in the south




                                             /
stand at Hillsborough, which is the only wooden stand left

at the ground.        I attended a meeting for the preparation of

the Incident Plan at Hillsborough in July 1986.                   The draft

was prepared by Mr Wilkinson,           the then Assistant Division

Officer     (HQ) with SYMAS,       but who is now the Deputy Chief

Ambulance Officer for one of the ambulance services in the

Hampshire area and Station Officer                        and I then put

in the details.        The Incident Plan was drawn up             prior to

the start of the 1986/87 season.

The   meeting    in    Ju l y   1986   was attended by myself,            the

Assistant     Division Officer          (HQ)   (Mr Wilkinson)      Station

Officer                  Police Inspector Calvert and a Police

Sergeant,    I believe                 and two people from the Fire

Brigade.     When we arrived we were introduced to Mr Chester

(the Club Secretary) who then left us with                             (the

Groundsman) who showed us round.

It was during the tour of the ground that we discussed with

the Police and Fire Service where the casualty clearing

post/mortuary would be in the event of a major incident,

this was agreed to be the gymnasium.                   We also discussed

vehicular access to the ground, but not to the pitch.

Following the tour we were taken to see the physiotherapist,

Mr Smith,     in his room.       At that point I believe that the

Police and Fire Service representatives left.               Mr Wilkinson,

                and I spoke to Mr Smith about Ambulance Service

cover.      Mr Wilkinson told Mr Smith that we could provide

Ambulance     Service      resources       for   the    ground,    i.e.    an
ambulance and crew and that this would involve a charge.      Mr

Smith said that the Club would not wish to pay a fee and

that they were happy with their current arrangements with

the St.    John's   Ambulance Brigade which att e nd e d   th eir

matches and which gave first aid training to the Club's

personnel at the beginning of each season.        He said that

whenever the Club had needed the ambulance service they had

relied upon making a 999 call.

Mr Wilkinson told Mr Smith that,      if we could not actually

provide an ambulance at the ground we would like to have two

officers inside the ground in the interest of crowd safety.

He said that if an ambulance was required they would be able

to contact Control to arrange for an ambulance more quickly

than the Club could do so.       Mr Smith asked Mr Wilkinson if

a SYMAS vehicle could attend the ground with crew, for the

players,   if injured.   Mr Wilkinson said there would be a

separate    charge    if there was a designated vehicle       for

plsysrs•     Mr Smith said that he did not think the Club

would pay for that facility, and the matter was not pursued.        |

Mr Wilkinson suggested that the Club should provide us with

 two tickets in order that we could put liaison officers in

 the ground so that we could get resources to the ground as

 quickly as possible if the need arose.      Mr Smith said that

 if Mr Wilkinson wrote to the Club then he could arrange for

 two tickets to be provided.

 We discussed where these complimentary seats should be.       Mr

 Smith offered us two seats at the back of the trainers box
      at pitch l e v e l .         We went to look at the trainers box and

      went up into the stand.                   I suggested to Mr Wilkinson that

      seats in the stand would be better because we would have a

      better view,         the radios would work better and,             if we were

      near the end of a row and close to an exit we could get to a

      telephone.          As    far as     I can recall         there was never   any

      discussion that we should be in the North Stand beeause all

      the Senior Police Officers,                  the Control Room and the Club

      Office were all              in the South Stand and it was generally

      agreed that we should be in a position to liaise with Senior

      Police Officers as quickly as possible. It is right to say,

      however, that Mr Smith was also anxious that we should be in

       the South Stand so that if one of the players was injured we

       could get to the physiotherapists room more easily.

12 . F o l l o w i n g    the    meeting        S t a t i o n Officer         and I

       received two season tickets.                   The tickets were    in row T,

       seats 152 and 153.                Season tickets do not cover cup matches

       and when          the    f irst    cup   match    came    along

       contacted         the club who provided complimentary tickets;

       since then two complimentary tickets have been left for

       collection for all cup games with the exception of the F.A.

       Cup semi finals.             Each year since 1987 (including 1989)           I

       have contacted the club prior to the F.A. Cup semi final to

       request two tickets but the request has always been refused.

13.    Station Officer                           and I completed the Hillsborough

       Incident Plan shortly after the meeting in July 1986.

14 . At the start of the 1986/87 season we were provided with 2
      season tickets, by Sheffield Wednesday, for the South Stand,

      and 2 free passes giving access to any part of the ground.

      That was when Mr Chester was the Club Secretary. I believe

      Mr Chester left in January 1987. When the FA Cup semi-final

      between Leeds and Coventry approached I tried to speak to

      the new Club Secretary, Mr Mackrell,      as regards semi-final

      tickets,     as separate tickets were required.     I tried to

      speak to Mr Mackrell on at least 4 occasions, but on each

      occasion     I was put through to his secretary, who told me

      that Mr Mackrell had said that there were no tickets for us.

      The   F.A.   controlled      the distribution of complementary

      tickets. SYMAS did not attend the 1987 F.A. cup semi-final,

      but I attended outside the ground and we had 2 vehicles on

      standby in case of emergency. I attended in my own time.

15.   Prior to     the start of the 1987/88 season we had received no

      tickets and on the Wednesday before the start       of the new

      season,    Alan Smith,   the club physiotherapist telephoned me

      and asked if the ambulance service was still involved.         I

      said so far as I was concerned Mr Mackrell did not wish us

      to be involved and the season tickets and passes had been

      taken off us.       Within a few days,    thereafter,   2 season

      tickets arrived (for the 1987/88 season) but no passes.      The

      season tickets were renewed by the Club for the 1988/89

      season;      we still have seats 152 and 153 in row T of the

      South Stand allocated to us.

16. For the        1988 and 1989 semi-finals I tried to contact Mr

      Mackrell to see if there were tickets available but I could




                               5
      not get through to him and I was told by a telephonist in

      the Enquiry Office        that there were no tickets       for   us.

      However,     I was   concerned    to be in the ground with an

      ambulance,    and David Jones arranged this with Inspector

      Sewell. SYMAS attended the 1988 and 1989 semi-finals at its

      own expense,    and with the two Liaison Officers being off

      duty.   The Wednesday before the 1988 semi-final the police

      had invited me to attend the police briefing at the ground

      which I did together with Station Officer_______

17.   On   a typical    Saturday     home    league game   for Sheffield

      Wednesday     I attend Hillsborough with my          fellow Station

      Officer,     Paul Eason    (who replaced                 |as Station

      Officer at Longley in 1987).          We each take a handset     with

      us to the game and would give a test call to Rotherham

      Control Room between 1445 and 1500 hours,         in order to make

      sure that the sets were working properly.

18.   Bearing    in mind the potential size of the crowd for the

      semi-final, and as has occurred on the two semi-finals which

      had taken place at Hillsborough in 1987 and 1988, Mr Page

      decided to deploy an ambulance crew for the match at the

      expense of SYMAS.         I understand that contact was made with

      the police prior to the game, probably by Assistant Chief

      David Jones and Mr Jones would have asked the police if Mr

      Eason and myself could attend the match.             Permission was

      given by South Yorkshire Police, and Mr Eason then contacted

       Inspector Sewell of South Yorkshire Police,            who was the

       Officer     in charge of the football match,        and asked if we




                             %
      could    attend the match as we had done for the 1988 semi­

      final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.               On that

      occasion,    we had parked our ambulance vehicle between the

      Spion Kop     and the North Stand,     at   a point   facing          the

      gymnasium which is marked on the plan in red as point X.

      Mr Sewell was delighted to have us attend the semi-final on

      15 t h   April,   and   to follow the arrangements    as     for the

      previous     year.      I understand   that Mr   Eason     s p ok e    to

      Inspector Sewell regarding this matter on the Tuesday prior

      to the 15th April.

19.   Apart    from our vehicle one other ambulance specifically

      designated for the Hillsborough semi-final,        positioned at

      Middlewood Station approximately half a mile away from the

      ground.
20.   I travelled to Longley Station on 15th April directly from

      home and met up with Station Officer Eason,        and the other

      two crew members,        ambulancemen Worrall and Chippendale.          I

      briefed them as to their duties, namely that minor injuries

      were to be dealt with by St. Johns Ambulance Brigade,                 and

      that we were there for serious injuries.              We left the

      Station at approximately 1350 hours and proceeded straight

      to Hillsborough.           We proceeded up Leppings      Lane     from

      Herries Road South Bus Station, alongside Parkside Road and

      then around Penistone Road into the ground at the point

      marked Y on the attached plan.

21    We arrived at the ground at approximately 1410 hours and

      very quickly spoke to Inspector Sewell who had seen our




                                1
      ambulance.       We asked him if everything in the ground was

      fine and he replied in the affirmative.         The Nottingham

      Forest end,     at the Spion Kop, was already full whilst the

      Liverpool end, at the West Stand, was very empty.

22 . We stood for some time outside our vehicle around the gap
      between the North Stand and Spion Kop which allows vehicles

      to obtain access on to the football pitch itself.

23.   Upon arrival, we checked all radios were working properly.

      Mr Eason and myself both had handsets, and the crew had a

      pocketphone between them.          We also checked the vehicle

      radio,   and   in all   cases,   the means of checking was        by

      phoning Control at Rotherham. I further briefed the crew as

      to our duties.

24.   We remained in this particular area until approximately

      1450 hours and then proceeded down between the Spion Kop and

      the North Stand to a point marked Z, where we could see the

      pitch.       At this point there were a number of St John's

      Ambulance Brigade and some police, in addition to ourselves.

25.   My next point of recollection is shortly after the kick-off

      I noticed      a crowd disturbance   behind   the   goal   at   the

      Leppings Lane end.      It is natural for Station Officer Eason

      and myself to look out for such problems.      It appeared that

      there were people just simply jostling, although I do recall

      one man trying to get over the fence behind the goal onto

      the pitch.

26 . I asked Mr Eason and Mr Chippendale to proceed down towards
      the Leppings Lane end to find out what was happening.           They




                              %
      proceeded to walk down alongside the North Stand.

27 . I went back to the top of the passageway between the North
      Stand and the Spion Kop, and used my radio handset to inform

      Control (Track 19, Page 1).        I informed Control to have the

      other   ambulance vehicle     in   the   immediate    vicinity   of

      Hillsborough ready for the purposes of assistance.           I said

      that there was an incident in the ground but it did not

      appear serious at that point in time.        Control confirmed to

      me that the ambulance in the vicinity was on its way down to

      the ground.

28.   I came straight back down between the Spion Kop and the

      North Stand, and at this point the players were still on the

      pitch, and I believe they were still playing.          I then saw a

      police officer run on the pitch and ask the referee to stop

      the game.      This was done immediately.

29.   Soon afterwards,      Mr Eason came back up alongside the North

      Stand and told me that his radio handset would not work done

      at that end of the ground. Mr Eason told me that there was

      one person on the pitch with a suspected broken/fractured

      leg.

30.   I quickly      went   back towards the ambulance vehicle and

      contacted Control with my handset at 15.08.00            (Track 19,

      Page 2).      I went back down between the Spion Kop and North

       Stand and accompanied Mr Eason and Mr Worrall alongside the

      North Stand towards the Leppings Lane end.           I was still not

       aware at this point in time that it was a Major Incident.

       It did appear that there was simply a crowd problem because
      the police had brought a number of supporters out                             from

      behind   the Leppings           Lane end onto     the       pitch,      and   the

      supporters were sitting against the fence and wall behind

      the goal.

31 . We joined ambulanceman Chippendale with the casualty with
      the suspected broken/fractured leg.               He appeared to be the

      only   supporter         with    serious   injuries         at   that     time.

      Ambulancemen Worrall and Chippendale continued to treat this

      casualty.          I recall that Mr Chippendale was being kicked

      and pushed by fans, at a point on the lefthand side of the

      goal, on the actual playing area, at point A.

32.   I received kicks and punches from the Liverpool supporters

      at   tha t   end    of   the     ground,   I b el i e v e    out     of   sheer

      frustration on their part. By this time the players had left

      the pitch.

33.   I tried to contact Control from this point with my radio

      handset but was not able to do so.               I made a decision that

      it was going to be a Major Incident and immediately ran back

      alongside the North Stand to our ambulance vehicle in order

      to make radio contact,            at 15.08.49 (Track 19, Page 2).                 I

      used the vehicle radio and contacted Control,

      Control asked me if it was the same incident that had been

      notified to them by the police concerning Leppings Lane.                          I

      told them that it was an incident at the Leppings Lane end

      and that the only point of access for ambulance vehicles on

      the to the pitch was from the gymnasium end of the ground. I

      knew this from my own knowledge of Hillsborough and I asked




                                IO
      for ten ambulance vehicles.        I remained at the ambulance at

      this time because there were casualties in the ambulance by

      this time,     including a little boy with a fractured arm.       I

      treated the casualties.

34.   At 15.13.52     (Track 19,      page 5) I contacted Control.....

      whilst making     this   call    a Police Sergeant came    to   our

      vehicle,   shouting at me to go down to the Leppings Lane end

      to assist because on the police cameras inside the ground

      they   could    see that at least 30 people had died.             I

      informed Control     immediately of the number of probable

      deaths,    and then went to the gymnasium, which at this point

      in time had been used by the police as an eating area.            I

      asked a police inspector to clear the gymnasium because of

      the need to make room for casualties.         The police responded

      immediately.    It should be noted that the gymnasium was the

      designated point for such an incident, a fact of which I was

      aware o f .
35.   At this time,     Mr Eason came back to the area around our

      ambulance and informed me that bodies were now being brought

      over the fence behind the Leppings Lane end,          and he also

      informed me that his radio handset was still not working at

      that end of the ground.           We then tried to use the vehicle

      radio set to confirm to Control that bodies were now coming

      over the fence,      I am not sure whether Control received the

      message because we received no reply.

36.   I then checked the slip road area back out to point B to

      make sure that there was enough room for vehicles to exit




                               H
      onto Penistone Road.      It was envisaged that the entrance of

      ambulance vehicles would be through the gate marked at point

      Y,   but   to leave   the ground at point B.     The area was

      blocked by a number of vehicles, and I am not sure whether

      these vehicles had arrived before the start of the game or

      following the commencement of the incident.

37.   I then went back to my ambulance vehicle, and at this point

      in time,     both supporters and police officers were bringing

      out bodies on advertising hoardings.       There were a number

      of dead and severely injured people on these hoardings.       I

      was endeavouring to direct the police and fans to take the

      bodies     (whether dead or injured)    to the gymnasium,    in

      particular to assess the more serious injuries.

38.   I can recall that two dead bodies were dumped beside our

      ambulance vehicle by fans who then went back on to pitch via

      the gap between the North Stand and the Spion Kop.        These

      fatalities had been brought out on hoardings.          By this

      time,      there was several injured supporters in the area

      surrounding our ambulance.       I recall treating a young boy

      with a fractured right arm,       who was also suffering from

      shock.       I put his arm into a sling.       I also remember

      dressing three head wounds and resuscitating a teenage fan

      who had been brought to the ambulance.

39.   Soon afterwards at 15.18 ambulance S209 ('             & Flack)

      arrived and I directed this vehicle onto the pitch.         The

      crew of this vehicle picked up one man who had stopped

      breathing and another man with a suspected broken leg.      The
          vehicle itself had managed to gain access onto the football

          pitch fairly comfortably.       When this vehicle left the pitch

          en route out of the ground, the driver informed me of the

          suspected injuries and also the fact that they were taking

          the casualties to Northern General Hospital.             I informed

          the driver to come       back   to the   ground   as    quickly   as

          possible. —   This vehicle had to leave the ground by the same

          gate as it had entered because the exit gate was still

          blocked.
«   40.   At 15.23 Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer Alan Hopkins and

          Assistant Divisional Officer Roger Morley arrived at the

          Penistone Road end of the ground.           Superintendent Dale

          arrived soon afterwards in a staff car.       Hopkins and Morley

          had arrived in the staff Range Rover, and parked alongside

          my ambulance vehicle.

    41.   I informed Mr Hopkins that at least 30/40 people were dead

          and there were numerous injuries.         Mr Hopkins proceeded

          down between the North Stand and the Spion Kop on to the

          pitch to look at the scene for himself.                By this time

          another ambulance crewed by ’            and Edwards had arrived

          at the Penistone Road end of the ground, which Mr Hopkins

          took with him down on to the pitch.            I remained at the

          Control    point which    I had established at my a m bu l an c e

          vehicle.       I remember still having problems communicating

           with Control because I was receiving no reply.             By this

           time,   several uniformed police had formed a cordon across

           the access way towards the gymnasium, to prevent supporters




                                   /3
      going into the gymnasium to view the fatalities and injured.

42.   Within    m i n u te s ,    Mr    Hopkins    came off the pitch,     to my

      ambulance and at this point assumed control of the incident

      for himself.               I would approximate the time shortly after

      1525 hours.
43.   I continued with the job of assisting casualties as they

      were    brought      out,        and   helped   oversee   the   loading   of

      ambulances with casualties as they continued to arrive at

      the Penistone Road end.                  I continued to manoeuvre between

      the gymnasium and the St John's Ambulance Room which is

      underneath the North Stand in an effort to discover the more

      seriously injured so as to get these casualties away to

      hospital in ambulances as quickly as possible.

44. Superintendent Dale took over control of the area between

      just outside Penistone Road end.                   At approximately 1530

      hours    I would say that some 10-12 ambulances were parked

      outside the entrance on Penistone Road waiting to come in.

      The ambulances were reversed in, in twos and threes.                      The

      casualties were brought out from the gymnasium area and

      quickly put on to the ambulances who drove out of the ground

      at the point they had entered, as the other exit was still

      blocked by numerous vehicles.                   Little time was wasted once

      the ambulances had reversed into the ground because the

       injured were already on "cots" (i.e. ambulance stretchers on

      wheels).

45.    At all times I was in the vicinity of the area between the

       ambulances entering the ground and the gymnasium.                  I would




                                         “t-
      say that this area is no more than 20 metres in length.                 I

      continued with this job until all the injured from the

      gymnasium area had been taken away to hospital.

46.   At approximately 1545 hours,            the Major Incident vehicle

      arrived at the ground.             The Major Incident vehicle has a

      control room on board, with various equipment including body

      bags which    were    required       in the    gymnasium,     and    also

      stretcher poles and carrying sheets.            These items were also

      taken straight into the gymnasium.

47.   I would say at the same time,            i.e. 1545 hours,      a medical

      team   from   the   Northern       General    H ospital    arrived    and

      established themselves in the gymnasium.               I understand that

      one of our ambulances which had taken casualties to the

      Northern General Hospital had brought back the medical team

      in their vehicle.        The medical team took over the role of

      assessing the injured from myself.                  I then continued to

      liaise with the medical staff and the St John's Ambulance

      Brigade   who    were    wo r king    in their own first aid room

      underneath      the   North    Stand.         At    all   times,    I was

      endeavouring to make sure that the most severely injured

      were taken away to hospital first.

48.   At   some time afterwards,           I filled two police vans with

      walking wounded.        These were two of the vehicles which were

      actually blocking the access area.                 At approximately 1600

      hours, this area was cleared of vehicles to allow ambulances

      access into the ground.             We carried on moving patients in

      that manner until approximately 1640 hours when the last of




                                    /6
the injured were taken away in ambulances to hospital.

At   approximately    1650 hours,   Mr Hopkins sent me to the

Leppings Lane end to pick up 11 bodies.              I took three

ambulances with me, taking the route via Penistone Road and

Leppings Lane.       These bodies were covered by blankets and

were put onto the ambulance vehicles and were then taken

back to the gymnasium.        Access was fairly easy.       These

bodies were in the gymnasium by approximately 1700 hours.

As there was no other access point onto the pitch,          other

than the gap between the Kop and North Stand it was not

practical,   in my opinion, to take numerous ambulances onto

the pitch.     This was due to the risk of congestion and

possible collision between ambulances at the one vehicular

access point, and the apparently uncontrolled crowd milling

around on the pitch which would only trap an ambulance and

also aS did happen with a St John's ambulance it would be a

focal point for all the injured and the number of casualties

could not have been dealt with other than using a proper

casualty     clearing   point.      Clearly   the   pitch was not

suitable.

Upon my return to the gymnasium area, Mr Hopkins sent me to

the Medico Legal Centre i.e. the mortuary in Sheffield.        At

this point in time, the police were still trying to identify

the fatalities,   and once the bodies had been identified,

presumably by friends and relatives,      it was envisaged that

ambulances would take three bodies at a time down to the

mortuary, with a police officer for each body.




                         /6
52 . By this time, approximately 40 ambulances were parked at the
      Herries Road Bus Station, but these were no longer required.

       A number of these vehicles were from the Nottinghamshire,

      Derbyshire and West Yorkshire areas.          I would say at any

      one time, approximately 10 to 12 vehicles were kept outside

      the ground on Penistone Road.

53.   I went down to the Medico Legal Centre with Superintendent

      Dale     in   his   Ford   Escort.      I   remained    there   for

      approximately two hours.         During this time no bodies were

      brought down to the Centre.          I understand that Professor

      Usher,    Senior Pathologist,    and Mr Popper, H.M. Coroner, had

      decided       to change their    plan once they had a rrived         at

      Hillsborough.       In conjunction with the police, they decided

      to change their plan for the deposit of the fatalities.               I

      found out this information        at a later stage from Control.

54.   Superintendent Dale, who had actually dropped me off at the

      Medico Legal Centre, came back to the Centre in order to

      pick me up.         We then travelled back to Hillsborough and

      arrived there at approximately 2100 hours.             Thereafter,    I

      assisted in the removal of bodies from the ground, and there

      is a list retained by SYMAS,         of all the bodies removed.

      The process of removing bodies from the gymnasium commenced

      after     2130 hours, and continued well into the early hours

      of Sunday morning.         I left Hillsborough at approximately




                                  />
    2330 hours and went directly home upon instructions from

    Roger Morley.

                I    am    a    Detective             Constable             in    the       South       Yorkshire          Police             Force,

                currently                attached          to    the       Drug    Squad          at    Police       Headquarters.

                Prior          to    15 A p r i l ,        1989       (150489)          I    volunteered             to    work          in       uniform          at

                the       Semi       Final       held       at       Sheffield          Wednesday             Stadium          on    Saturday,                15

                April,          1989 <150489).                       The    teams       playing          on    that       date       were          Liverpool

                and       Nottingham             Forest.

                On    the       morning          of    Saturday,             15    April,             1989    (150489)          I    commenced                duty

                at    8.00am             (0800)       and       attended          at    briefing             held    at W e s t          Bar       Police

                Station             at    9.00am       (0900)

                I was          attached          to    West          Bar    serial          16    under       the    command             of       PS    Swift,

                and       our       initial       duties             consisted          of       attending          at    Midland             Station

                where          both       Liverpool             and    Nottingham                Forest       fans       were       to    arrive           and

                supervise                their    conduct             at    the    station             and    ensure       that          they          were

                directed             into    the       awaiting             PSV    and       together          with       two       Police             officers

                per       PSV       they    were       to       be    escorted          to       the    ground.

                On    completion             of       the       briefing          we    were          provided       with       a    packed             meal,

               and        after          consuming          this       we    walked          to       Midland       Station         as        a    serial.

               On     arrival             there       at    appro:;imately                  10.00am          (1000)       we    remained                there

                and       carried          out    our       duties          as    previously             stated.

     At    approximately                   2.30pm       (1430)         that       dale       our    complete             serial             boarded

     a    PSV    and       was       conveyed          to    the      Penistone             Road    end       of    the       Football

     Stadium.             On     arrival          we    went         directly       to       the    gym       where          we    were       to     be

     held       on    standby.                 I am    unsure         of    the    time       at    this       stage,             however, I

     can    recall             that       on    our    arrival         at    the    ground          there          was       considerable

     Radio       traffic,             all       relating         to       problems          being    suffered                at    the

     Leppings          Lane          entrance          to    the      ground.           I    cannot       recall             any       particular

     officers,             however,             the    situation            sounded          very    hectic.                 We    were

     immediately                told       to    leave       the      gym    and    go       onto    the       track          surrounding

     the    pitch          and       go    to    the    Lepping            Lane    terraces          where          problems                were

     being       encountered.                    As    far      as    I am    aware          we    were       not       told       what       th e

     problems          were          at    that       particular            end    of       the    ground.              As    we       walked

     round       the       track          to    the    Leppings            Lane    terraces          I can          recall             that       the

     match       had       not       started.

     At    that       stage          there       were       only      'Area*       Police          officers             from       F    Division

     on    the       perimeter             track.       Those         I    recognised             were    P C ’s M a r s d e n ,             Walpale

     •and B r o o k e s .            As    I got       to    the      Leppings          Lane       end    of       the       ground          the

     Liverpool             supporters             were       throwing         coins          and    verbal          abuse          at       the

     police          officers.                 The>    w e r&    also       spitting          at    them       and       shouting

     'Fucking             murderers,             do    something'.                The       whole    feeling             of       this       crowd

     was    one       of       aggression             directed            towards       the       Police       officers                on    th e

     track.           It       was    at       this    stage         that    I actually             saw       the       crowd          inside        t he

     pen    and       I    realised             what    was      happening,             I saw       people          being          physically

     squashed             against          the    mesh,         their       faces       bulging          through             the       holes,

     they       were       vomitting             on    the      person       next       to    them       and       those          that       could

     still       talk          were       crying       out      for       help.     This          crush       went       back          for    3     to    6

     rows       and       the    sound          was    one      of    people       crying          and    a    wailing             sound          that

     I have          never       heard          before.          The       supporters             behind       these          were          still

     hurling          abuse          at    the    Police         and       spitting          at    them.           As    I    passed          behind

     the    goal          at    the       Leppings          Lane      end    of    the       ground       the       crush          inside           the

pens    seemed           to    be      getting            worse,          I    could         see        children          and       teenagers

being       physically                 crushed        against             the       mesh,          their          faces    were       turning

purple,        their          eyes       bulging           and      vomit           and      saliva           trickling             from       their

mouths.

I then       saw     a    man       of    about                                years,                         hai r , a n d

jacket,        he    was       at       the    front           of    the       crush         and        his       face    was       totally

distorted           with       being          crushed           against             the      mesh.            He    had    turned          purple

and    it    was     obvious             that        he    was       dead.              I    realised             that    if    something

was    not     done        there         were        going          to    be       more       deaths          in    that       pen.

At    briefing           that          morning        I had          been          issued          with       a    personal          radio          the

noise        from       the       crowd       was     such          that       I    could          not       here    anything             at    all.

I    called        control             several        times          on       the       radio       but       I heard          no    response.

I do     not       know       whether          they        heard          me       or       whether          the    noise       was       such

that     I    could        not         hear     them       acknowledging                      my    call.           Again       I    can

remember           shouting             down        the       radio       that          there       were          dead    people          in    the

crowd.         The       scene          and     the       sound          at    the          front       of    those       terraces             was

u n b e 1ie v a b l e .

I was        new    near          to    one     of       the    small          access             gates       that       lead       into       the

terraces,           and       I     realised             that       this       must          be    opened          immediately             in a n

attempt        to       get       into    the        people          inside.                 I looked             round    for       a

supervisory              officer          but        I    could          not       see       one.        Together          then          with

several        olhe^          officers              using       our       own        initiative               we    opened          the    gate       al

the     left       of    the       goal        leading           into         the       terraces             into    the       centre          pen.

On     opening          the       door        I intended             to       enter          the    centre          pen    area          and    try

to     render       what          assistance              I    could,          however             once       the    door       was       opened

outward        it       became          apparent              that       the        crush         was    such       that       no    one       could

enter        the     pen,         in    fact        the       supporters                inside          were       crushed          together          to

such     an    extent             that        the    two       or    three           actually            in       front    of       the    door

could        not     get      out,       they        were       wedged              together.

Together            with      several           other          Police           officers            I began          to    attempt             to

                                                                            *                                                                R4S4

force       the    supporters                 back,        to     relieve             the    crush,          however          I

immediately              realised             that       this       was      futile          and       there       was       no    way       that

this    crush           of    bodies          could        be     forced          back.           I    then      began        dragging             out

supporters              from       the    pen,       these          however            were       the       ones    that          had    been

stood       several           rows       back       they        were        climbing             over      the     heads          of    the       ones

at    the     front          who    were       still          crushed            together             so    that    they          could-not

move.         As   we        were       helping          these         fans       out       onto       the       pitch       they       were

striking           and       kicking          out    at       the      Police          and       hurling          abuse       at       them.        It

was    obvious           that       the       majority            of    them          were       drunk       and    on       several

occasions           I was          struck       and        kicked           by    these          supporters.

As    I helped           the       first       initial            wave       of       supporters             out    they          mainly

appeared           alright          and       they       made       their         way       round          the    track       to       the    North

stand.            After       this       first       wave         had       come       out       the       supporters             that       we

were     helping             out    were       in    a     worse        condition,                although          I would             say       that

most     of       them       appeared          to     be      still         breathing.                 It w a s     during             this       that

I    lost     my    uniform             helmet,          my      tie    and       my       Police          spectacles,             recovering

my    helmet        later          on    that       day.          I pulled             one       supporter          out       who       was

wearing           all    denims,          and       he     appeared              to    be    still          breathing,             as    I

pulled        him       onto       the    pitch          he      vomitted,             and       at    that       point       I was          joined

by     Inspector             Harvey       and       together            we       walked          him       around       on    the       pitch

until        he    had       calmed       down       and         was    breathing                more       normally.              I then

left     this       man       with       Inspector               Harvey          and       rejoined          other       officers             at

the     gate.           During          all    this        time        we    were          still       being       abused          by    the

rest     of       the    crowd          inside        the        pen    and       numerous             supporters             who       we    had

already           got    out       onto       the     pitch         were         fighting             with       myself       and       other

officers           in    an    attempt          to       get      back       into          the    pen.

On     several          occasions             I had        great        difficulty                convincing             these          people

that     they       could          not    go     back           in a n d     that          they       were       only    getting             in    t he

way     of    rescue          attempts.               The        majority             of    them       after       being          initially

very     aggressive                towards          me     would        simply             break       down and          start          crying,

and    slump        down         onto        the    pitch.

It    was    at     some          point       during          this          I       cannot    recall          exactly          when       that          I

realised          that        the       game       had       actually                started,       as    I led          a    fan       out    onto

the    pitch        and       handed          him    over          to    other             Police    officers                who    were       stood

behind        I saw          the       game    in    progress.

As    I looked           along          at    the    fence          away             from    the    gate       to    either             side       I

could        still       see       people          trapped          who             wer*    either       dead       or       very       near       to

death        that       we       still       couldn't          get          to.

I    then     saw       PS    Knights          and       a    Policewoman                   stood    on       the    hoardings

several          yards           from    the       gate,       lifting                supporters          over       the       fence.              I

joined        them       and       assisted          in       lifting                several       fans       over       this       fence          and

handing           them       down       to    officers             who          were       stood    on    the       track.              These

were       all     still          alive       though          in a          various          state       of    health.

As    we     lifted          one       supporter             over       I       realised          that    there          were       no    Police

officers           to    hand          him    down       to    so       I       climbed       down       still       holding             this
                                                                                                                                                   *v:
youth.              Icarried             him       onto       the       pitch          whereafter I ascertained                           that

he    was         in f a c t       still       breathing.                       I    left    him    and       returned             to th e     fence.

I    then     saw       Superintendent                   Greenwood                   stood    talking          to    PS       Morton          on       the

perimeter           track.              PS    Morton          then          ran       off    towards          the    gym       area.           The

pilch        in    front          of    the    Leppings             Lane             end    was    littered          with          people,             the

majority           of    whom          appeared          to    be       alive          although          numerous             were       being

tended            by P o l i c e        officers             and    other             supporters.              I    realised that                  the

match        had        been       stopped          at       some       stage.

I     then    heard          a    siren       and    on       looking                towards       the    gym       area       I saw          a St.

John's        Ambulance                come    onto          the    pitch             and    drive       towards             the    Leppings

Lane       end.         It       stopped       directly             behind             the    goal       and       a St.       Johns

Ambulanceman                 alighted          from          the    vehicle.

As     I got       to    the       gate        leading         into             the    centre       pen       numerous             other

officers           were          still       there       and       we       were       joined       by C h i e f         Superintendent

Nesbit        who       organised             us    into       a    funnel             leading       out       from          the    gate       onto

the     pitch.              I    realised                that    several        Police             officers          were        now    inside

the     centre          pen,          rendering             first        aid    to       fans       on     the       terraces-           These

officers          inside             began          to     pass    out        bodies          to    us    and       we    were     then

passing          them           down       the      funnel        onto        the     pitch         where        other         Police        were

tending          them.              It    was       obvious        to     me    that          the    vast        majority          of    these

fans     were      dead.                 Their           bodies    were        limp,          their        faces         were    purple,

they     were      covered                 in      vomit?        and     they       all       had    several             items     of

Clothing          missing                or     hanging          off     them       in    tatters.

Chief       Superintendent                         Nesbit        joined        officers             inside        the      pen    and        was

assisting          in           handing            bodies        out     to    myself          and       other       officers           who       were

on    the    track.

Occasionally                    someone            would        shout     "This          one's       still       alive"          and     that

particular             body          would          be     rushed       out     through             the       gate       and    laid     onto

the    field       where             ambulancemen                 had     now       joined          Police       officers              and    other

supporters             in        rendering               first     aid.         The       sight          of    these       bodies        was

terrible          as    none             had       any     apparent           injuries             other       than       purple        faces.

They     were      obviously                    suffering          from        crush          injuries.

I    remained          outside                at    the     gate       helping           to    lift       bodies          out    and     onto

the    track.           I        remained            there        until        the       front       part       of       the    centre        pen

had    been       cleared,                then       together           with        other          officers          I entered           the          pen

and    we   formed              a    cordon          approximately                  half       way    up       the    terraces,              to

preserve          the       scene.                 The    terraces            were       littered             with    shoes,       items              of

p e o p i e ’s    clothing,                   money,       spectacles,               etc.

As    I stood          in       this          cordon       I looked            onto       the       pitch       and      saw     that        other

officers          had       formed             a    cordon       across         the       pitch       at      about        the    centre              of

the    field,          thereby                containing           the    Liverpool                supporters             and     the

injured          and    keeping                them       from     the    Nottingham                 Forest          supporters.                  I

also    saw       that          Police             and    supporters            were          pulling         the     advertising

hoardings          down             that      were        round     the       ground          and     were       using          them    as

stretchers             to       carry          bodies       to     the    gym        area.

                                                                                                                                                       R484

All     during          this        time             we    were          being          subjected                 to    continual           abuse          from

Liverpool              supporters                    who    were             above           us    in       the    seating        in    the       West

star,a,         they        were        also          still           spitting                on       us    and       shouting        ‘T u c k i n g

m u r d e r e r s ” and            "This             is    all        your          fucking             fault".

After       a    period            of       time          the    word             was        passed          along        the    cordon          to     return

onto      the      pitch.               I    did          this        and          along          with       several           other     officers                broVp

up    numerous               fights          that          were          taking              place          between        Liverpool             supporters.

It    became           apparent               that          these            fights           were          the    result        of    one        fan

blaming          the         Police           for         what        had          happened             and       the     second       one

apparently                 defending                 them.            Once          this          situation              had    calmed           down,       I

remained              on     the    pitch                 together                with       other          officers           assisted           in

 carrying              the    wounded                to     the          gym       area          and     also       attempted           to       get       the

 fans       that        could       walk             unaided                 off       the        pitch.          Several        supporters                 asked

 me    if    the        match           had          been       postponed                and        after          asking        other       Police

 officers              I was       informed                 that             it    in       fact        had       been.        During        a    lull       in

 this       action           I met           PS       Morgan             and       after           conversing             with        him     for      a

 period          of     time       we        obtained                a       drink          of     water          from    a     bucket        brought

 round          the     field           by       a    man       in       a    tracksuit                 who       was    an     employee          of

 Or;,       the        pitch       had           cleared              I made            my        way       to    the    gym     at    the       rear       of

 the     North          stand.               On       my    arrival                there           the       scene       was     one    of       organised

 chaos          with        ambulances                    all    over             and       the        injured          laid     out    on       the

 floor.           The        gym        was          being       used             as    a     morgue.

 Supporters                 were        constantly                    arriving                with          injured        people       or       dead       ones

                                                                                                                                        and       together
 on     makeshift              stretchers.                        1      them          met        up    w i t h _____________

 with       him        we    were           assigned              to         security              on       the    gym     door       with       the

  instruction                 that          no       injured             were          to     be       carried          into     the    gym       as       only

  the     dead         were        being             took       in       there.               Any       injured           were    to     be      placed

  outside          on        the    ground                where          ambulancemen                       and    Police        officers             and        off

  duty       hospital              staff             were       caring              for       them.

            I assisted             in    loading         the           injured         into      ambulances,            and       at     one    point          I

            escorted         a     man       who    stated             he    was      an   off     duty       Merseyside            Police

            officer       round          the       gym       in   an        attempt        to     ID    his    brother        he       had     lost.

            He    could      not        ID    him     however               he    broke     down        at    the     sight       in     the    gym       and

            I    lock   him        outside          provided                him    with     a     drink       and     left    him        sat    down.

            I    returned          to    DS    Glossop             on       security        duty        at    the     gym    door.

            Once    the       scene          had    settled             down       all     officers           not     involved           with

            anything          at    that        time         were       directed           to     the    North        stand,        as    we    were

            not     required            any     longer            as    security           for     the       gym     door    myself           and    DS

            Glossop          made       our     way      into          the       stand,     where        we    joined        DC     Helton,          DC

£           Gibson      and        DC    Priestley                and       other      officers.              A- s h o r t    time       later       Chief

            walked       back       to       West       Bar       Police          Station,         where        a    de-brief          w a s Yield         by

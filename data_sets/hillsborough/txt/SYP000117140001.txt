                  informed        of      what       parts       of    the    ground       had     been allocated                 to w h i c h      fans

similar           nature         to     the     previous            semi     Pinal           at     which         1 had w o r k e d            two

years        before           (Leeds         United          v Coventry).                  We w e r e       then         briefed         by

Police          Sergeant          A s h t o n as        to      individual                duties.           We     were        informed

with        Police         Constable            900 Dawson,                our       instructions                were      to a s s i s t

F rom       tak i ng       up    our      " p o i n t 1' t h e r e     was       a    conatant             st r e a m     of    fa n s     go i n g

to     the      ground          from      the       direction          of W a d s ley B r i d g e                 railway           station,

mostly          on th e         opposite            s id e    of    the     road          from      the     bus      station          an d

where        we w e r e .          From       about          1 o ’clock          t he      stream          of     supporters             had

increased            quite         substantially,                   most     of w h o m           were      Liverpool

supporters.                   These       fans       were       directed             to    the N o r t h S t a n d             or    Leppings

Lane        end     of     the     ground           via Leppings             Lane.             At    about         this        time,       I

noticed           t ha t      many      of    the      f a ns      were     carrying              four      p a ck s      and       some       even

ha d    two.         Many        of     them were             drinking           the       beer/lager              as     they       walked

a I ong      t he    ro ad .           8 e tween       t hi s t ime         and ahout               qu ar ter        to    three         the r e

was     a    constant            group        of     people         ranging           for      about        '100-ISO y a r d s             up

Penistone            Road        North,         sat     on w a l l s        and       drinking             from what            appeared             to

be     beer       cans.          When        they      h a d all      gone,           there         were        empty      cans       all         o ve r

the     pavements               and walls.              They        di d    not       appear         to     be     in a n y         great

h u r ry t o g o to              t h e ground.

At     about        ten       past      two     a    la r g e      number        of       Liverpool             f an s    were       escorted

from        the     train        station            along       Penistone             Road        North         to L e p p i n g s       Lane.

They        were     escorted             fay b o t h        foot    officers              and mounted.                   I assumed               that

these        fans        had     c om e      in a t r a i n         from Liverpool.                        There         were       also      a
                                                                                                                                                P ACaE.
                                                                                                                                                R75

l arge     number             who       had      come       along        Penistone                Road North             on o ur          side     of

the      road who             we       diverted            down Leppings                   L a ne .      Some       of       these        fans     had

obviously            been          drinking            and       a f ew w e r e            obviously            quite         dr u n k .

At     so me    point          around            this       time       Leppings             Lane        was     closed         to        vehicular

traffic         due       to       the       volume         of    people         now        using        the       r o a d as        a footpath.

During         all       of    this          there         was    the       usual          behaviour            i.e.         shouting

slogans         and       singing             but      nothing           warranting                Police        action.

At     about        two       thi r ty        I looked            up th e         1e n g t h       of L e p p i n g s         Lane        and     it

was      extremely             crowded and                  I remarked                to P o l i c e         Constable             Dawson         that

it     looked        like          a    ’s e a    of       bobbing          heads’.               Nothing          could        be       seen     except

the      heads       of       those          going         to    the     match,            there        were       no    gaps        on    the     road.

At     this     time          everything               appeared             to    be       going        smoothly             and     there        were

no     incidents              of       note.

At       3.03        p.m.          we    liaised with Police                          Sergeant                  Ashton                   and      the rest   o

the      serial,          together               with another                 serial          a nd an         Inspector              outside           the

garage         at    Penistone                Road North               and Leppings                    L ane,      on    the       opposite

s id e    of    the       road.

We       then        cotnmericedi a l o n g L e p p i n g s                   L a n e ? as a u n it           to        go   to a         Police

coach      to       standby             as    per          our    briefing.                As we        were     d o i n g so        I     heard

via a      radio,             presumably               Police          Sergeant              A s h t o n ’s,       as    he w a s         the     only

one      in m y      immediate                v i c in ity who              had a          radio,        a message              saying          that

th e     march       would             have      to    be       stopped and                almost        immediately                 a    call     went

out      for    all       available               officers             on     standby             to a t t e n d        at    the        Leppings

Lane      stand..             These          messages            appeared             to     be    panicky and                it     sounded           as

though         the       person          passing            them       wa s      unsure           as    to    the       exact,       problem.

We     attended           at       the       Leppings            Lane       turnstiles                 within a          couple           of

minutes,            where          we    were         joined        by      other          serials           and m o un t e d            officers.

There      was       a group             of      people          gathered             outside           the     turnstiles                a n d we

assisted            in    removing               them       from       this       a r e a,        and    then       formed           a    cordon

minutes         during           which       I hea r d ,          via a     nearby           radio?          that     an a m b ula nc e

was     on     the     field and a             few       seconds           l a ter     one       attended           where        we    were,

It     passed        through           the    cordon and                I then        saw       bodies        being      brought            to

it a n d       others        obviously             injured          walking           to     it.        At    this     time       one       fan

walked         from      th e     ground       saying             something           like,          "Is     it w o r t h    it,       there

are     dead       folk      in t h e r e ,        s om e     f o lk     have     died."              He w a l k e d     off      a n d wa s

obviously            distressed.                1 then            became       aware        of a m a n         who     was       lyin g       on

th e    ground         beside          the    ambulance.                 There        was       no    one     near     him,       he was

motionless.                 An    officer          nearby          said     something                about      him    looking             ’ in a

bad way'.              We    were       at    this       t i me     unaware           of     exactly what              was       happening

inside         the     ground.           There          were       announcements                 being        made     o v er     the

loudspeaker              system.

We     were      then       diverted          into       the       ground        where          we    then      passed       the

ambulance.               The      man    whom       1 had          seen      lying         on    the       gr o u n d was        blue       in

the     face       and      did    not       appear          to    be    breathing.,             1 think         he w a s        dead.

Beside         the     ambulance             there       were       t wo    ambulancemen                   giving      mouth          to

only         partly      clothed         and       others          were      obviously               injured.

We     then      passed          through       a tunnel,                about     twenty             feet     wide     o n to     the

terrace          behind          the    goal       at    the       Leppings           Lane       end.         There      was      a    large

gap     on the         terrace          and     1 could            see     that       the       wire       fencing       which

abutted          the     field         had    been       cut       and     peeled          a w ay ,     allowing         access            onto

the     fi e l d .       There         were     officers            on     the    terrace             making        their        way       o nt o

the     fi el d,       where       there       was       a    l a r ge     number          of    people         lying       on    the

grass        and walking               around.           I could           see    a    line          of P o l i c e    Officers

across         the     field       n e ar     to    the       half       way     line.          Myself        and Police

Constable            Dawson        went       onto       the       field       where         I could          see     people          lyi ng

on     the     ground,           apparently             dead,       many       with        jackets           over     their       heads.

John's          first          aiders.            There          were    people            walking          about,           it    s e e m e d , in

a state          of       shock,        some       dazed,          some       being         physically                sick        and     others

lying/sitting                   around           apparently             suffering               injuries.               1 asked           those

who    were        near         if    they        needed          help       and      checked          with many              of     them about

injuries.                 I f elt       awful          at    what       I was         seeing,          the      scale         of     it       left    me

numb.           I felt          inadequate,                 as    if    there         was       absolutely              nothing           I could

do,    it       s e e m e d as        though           everywhere             1 looked             there        w as     another              dead

person.            This         aside,           I felt          that    1 was          s ti l l      within          myself         coping,

until       I saw          a very young                 lad,       about        10-12 years                  old,       he    wa s      obviously

dead,       and       a    fireman           said       to a m a n           nearby         that       there          was     nothing            he

could       do a n d           placed        a jacket             over       the      boy.         T he     man       became         totally

distraught.                    1 felt        very       upset          but    carried            on,       I felt        I should              make

some    sort          of       contribution.                     About       t hi s     time       I lost         contact            with

Police          Constable             Dawson           and       everyone          else         in m y       serial.              I assisted

in    putting             bodies        onto       advertising                hoardings               as     f a ns     carried           the

bodies          back       and       forth        to    the       area       between            the    North Stand                 and        the

Hop.        A    lot       of       fans     on    the       field were               angry,          and     some       were        obviously

i n sho c k , the re we r e p e o p l e                          crying       a 11      a r a u n d me .          I sa w a f i r e m a n

assist          him       by g i v i n g         heart       massage.              We      did     t hi s     for       about        3 ”4

minutes          but       there        was       no    breath          or    pulse         and       eventually             a     jacket, was

placed          over       his       face.         I felt          drained,             this       only       contributed                 to my

feelings           of      being        inadequate                and    unable            to    hel p.         I spent            a few

minutes          just          staring           into       spa c e.         I d i d n ' t k n o w w h a t to do.                         1

decided          to a t t e m p t           to    find       other       members            of m y         s er i a l    and within

minutes          saw Police                 Constable            243 Landers.                    We    then a tt empted                   to     find

some    of       the       others,           without             gain.        There         appeared            to      be   no

organisation                   on    th e    fi el d .           there       were       Policemen             and       fans       walking

Police           and     other         services.                   Not     l o ng     after           I went         onto          the     pitch         the

Forest           fans      began          singing,             which         upset          the L i v e r p o o l           fans,          who       became

abusive           and      aggressive,                   s om e     attempting                to      get      to    their          end       of     the

ground,           prevented               from          doing       so     by P o l i c e           Officers.

Many        of    the      fans        were         blaming           the P o l i c e              fo r w h a t      had       happened,              some

were        blaming            the     F.A.         and,some             poor       organisation,                    saying             that       the

s am e      had     happened              last          year.

Eventually               myself           and Police                Constable               Landers            made       our       way       through

the      crowds          when        we     were         approached               by C h i e f           S u p e r :in t e n d e n t       Nesbit           on

myself           and Police               Constable                Landers           began          to m a k e       our       way       back        to our

original            points.               As     we      did       so we        were        verbally abused,                        Liverpool

supporters               were        calling             us m u r d e r e r s ,          black           bastards,             cunts          etc.          We

were        told       that       all       we      were       good        for      was       fighting              and     kicking             miners.

We     walked          along         the       length          of L e p p i n g s           Lane         to    the     roundabout,

suffering              this        type        of a b u s e         the      whole          way.           The      people          doing          this

majority            of     them were                sober          and many were                    middle          a g ed .

Shortly           after         getting             to       the    roundabout                we w e r e           joined          by    the       rest      of

the      serial          making           their          way       home      quietly.                 We      had    no     further             problems

uncanny           silence.                I h av e           never       known         it     to      be      so    quiet          with       so m a n y

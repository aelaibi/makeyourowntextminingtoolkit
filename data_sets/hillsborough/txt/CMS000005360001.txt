Thank you for your letter of 26 November, enclosing this one from
Mr                 |of                Hersham, Walton-on-Thames,
Surrey,          about football hooliganism.
The Government has been concerned for some time now about
football hooliganism and we have worked closely with the football
authorities and the police in implementing a package of measures
to deal with the problem. For example there are now strict
controls on the availability of alcohol at football grounds, the
police have been given stronger powers under the Public Order
Acts to take action against troublemakers, there is wider and
more effective use of close circuit television and better
segregation arrangements at the grounds.
An important new measure has also been introduced to prevent
convicted football hooligans from going to matches abroad. The
Football Spectators Act 1989 gives courts in England and Wales
the power to impose restruction orders on those convicted of
football related offences. These orders require those in respect
of whom they are made to attend at police stations when specified
football matches are being played abroad.
In his report into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster Lord Justice
Taylor considered that all-seater stadia would do more to improve
safety and cure problems of crowd behaviour at football matches
than any other single action. All seating is a measure which the
Government supports fully and which we intend to see implemented
at all Football League grounds by 1999. David Waddington also
announced last month that the Government will be introducing
other anti-hooligan measures recommended by Lord Justice Taylor
in the form of specific offences related to football. These will
make it an offence to throw missiles, run on to the pitch or
indulge in racialist or obscene chanting.

Liverpool.           The       briefing and     points     raised a p p e a r e d to me to be of a

s imilar      nature       to the    previous      semi-final       at w hich       I had wo r k e d two

years     before       (Leeds U n i t ed v Coventry).             We were then brie f e d by

Po l i c e S e r geant A s ht on as          to individual        duties.      We were       informed

that     the m a t c h was        an all     ticket af f a i r with all        tickets       sold    prior

to that d a t e .

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1115 hours     I took up my        'point*     at    the    roundabout at

Leppings Lane,             P e n is to ne Roa d N o r t h and Herr i / s Road North,            together
                                          K ^                                                      . +
w ith Police C on st a b l e         900 IXFwson, our        instructions were              to assist

suppor ters        to get to thelfr respective               ends of the ground,              prevent

opposing        fans m e e t i n g   and general      crowd       control.;

Prop- taking         up our       'point*     there was a constant            stream of fans          going

tj/1,he ground from the d i rection of W a d s l e y Bridge                         railway    station,

mos t l y on the opposite              side of the        road from the bus station and

where we were.                 Fro m about    1 o ’clock    the    stream of s upporters             had

increased quite                substant ially,     most    of whom were Liverpool

supporters.            These      fans were     direc t e d to the North S t a n d or Leppings

Lane     end of the            ground via L e p pings Lane.          At about        this    time,    I

notice d that, many of the fans were                      carrying    four     packs and some             even

had two.         Many      of them were        drinking     the    beer/lager        as they walked

a long    the     road.         Between, this    time and about        quarter        to three       there

was a constant             group of     people     ranging    for about        100-150 yards          up

P e n i s t o n e Roa d North,       sat on walls and drinking                from what a p p e a r e d      to

be beer       cans.        W hen they had all        gone,    there were        empty       cans all       over

the    pa vements and walls.                 They did not appear        to be        in any    great

hurry     to go to the            ground.

At about ten past two a large                    number     of Liverpool        fans were       escorted

from the train s t a t i o n along P e n i s t o n e Road N o r t h to L e p p i n g s               Lane.

T hey were e s c o r te d         by both foot      officers and mounted.                  I assumed       that

these     fans     had     come    in a train from Liverpool.                There were also a
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                         ; R75

large        number who          had      come along P e n i s t o n e Road N orth on our             side ot

the    road who we d i v e r t e d down L e p p i n g s Lane.                   Some    of these      fans had

o bv i o u s l y   been drinking and a 'few were                     o b viously quite         drunk.

At some        point a r ou nd this time L e p p i n g s Lane was                     closed to vehicular

traffic        due to the           volume        of   people     now using     the    road as a footpath.

D uring all          of this        there was           the usual     behaviour       i.e.   shouting

slogans        and singing             but nothing w a r r a n t i n g Police action.

At about           two    thirty       I. looked up the           length of L e p pings Lane and              it

was    e xt re m e l y      crowded and           I remark^Kto          Police Con s t a b l e D a w s o n that

it looked like a                 'sea of b o b W ^ g          heads'.      Nothing     could be seen except

the heads           of those        going V o          the match,     there were       no gaps       on the    road,

fit this time             ever y t h i n g    a p p e a r e d to be going      smoothly and there were

no/inc i d en't s of           not e ..

At 3.05        p.m.       we   liaised with Poll ce S e r geant As h t o n and                  the     rest, o-f

the     serial,          t o g ether with another              serial    and an      Inspector       outside       the

garage at P e n is to ne Road N or t h and Leppings Lane,                              on the    opposite

side     of the          road.

We then        commenced along Leppings Lane,                         as a unit to go to a Police

coach U r stan d b y as                per our briefing.              As we were       doing    so    I heard

via a/radio,              p r e s u ma bl y Police S e r g e a n t Ashton's,           as he was       the    only

one    4r\ my immediate                vici nity who had a radio,               a message       saying       that

t he /m a r c h w o u l d      have to be stop p e d and almost,                immedi a t e l y a call went

o/t for all              a v ai la bl e    officers       on stan d b y to att e n d at        the Leppi n g s

f-ane stand.              These m e s sages            appeared    to be    panicky a n d      it sounded as

though the           person       passing them was              unsure as to the exact               problem.

We a t t e nd ed at the Leppings                       Lane   t u rnstiles w i t h i n a     couple    of

minutes,           where we were             joined by other          serials and m o u n t e d       officers.

There was a group                 of      people       g a t hered outside     the    turns t i l e s and we

a s si st ed       in removing            them from this area,             and then formed a cordon

ac r o s s    this entrance.                 We   remained      in this area for about               five
                                                                                                            RAGE
                                                                                                            R'75 :

minutes       during w hi c h        I heard,,       via a nearby         radio,       that an a m bulance

was    or! the field and a few seconds                      later one atten d e d where we were.

It passed t hr o u g h the             cordon and         I then saw bodies             being    brought       to

:i.t and others         o bv io u s l y       injured walk i n g    to    it.     At this       time    one fan

walked from the ground saying                        something      like,       "Is    it worth    it,      there

are    dead folk        in there?             some folk    have    died.."       He w a l k e d off and was

o bv i o u s l y distressed.              I then became        aware      of a man who was             lying on

the ground beside              the ambulance.              There was          no one    near    him,    he was

motionless.           An officer              nearby said something about                him    looking       ’in a

bad w a y ’ .       We were at this              time   unaware     of exactly what was                happening

inside       the ground.            There were a n n o u n c e m e n t s       being made       over    the

loudspeaker          system.

We were       then d i v e r t e d     into the ground where we then passed the

ambulance.           The m a n whom            I had seen     lying on the ground was                  blue    in

the    face and did not appear                    to be breathing,             I think    he was       dead.

Beside       the a m b u l a nc e    there were         two a m b u l a n c e m e n giving mouth         to

mouth     r e s u s c i ta ti on and heart mass a g e and there were                      other    people

lying all around,              some of which were              in a bad way,            some of them were

only    partly       clothed and others were                  obviously         injured.

We    then    passed thro u g h a tunnel,                 about    twenty feet wide             onto    the

terrace       behind     the    goal at the Leppings                Lane       end.     There was a large

gap on the terrace              and       I   could see     that the wire             fencing which

a b u t t e d the    field had been              cut and    peeled away,          a l l owing    access       onto

the field.           There     were officers            on the     terrace making             their way onto

the    field,       where    there was a large              number       of    people    lying    on the

grass and w a l k i n g        around.           I could see a line of Police O f f icers

a cross      the field near           to the half way             line.       Myself    and Police

Con s t a b l e D a w s o n went      onto the field where                I could see          people    lying

on the ground,           a p p a r e n t l y dead,      m any wit h jackets            over    their    heads.

I don't know how man y                I saw.        Some P o l i c e m e n were a d m i n i s t e r i n g     first

a state of shock,               some    dazed,     Some    being        physically sick and others

l y i n g/ sitting        a r o u n d a p p a r e n t l y suffering      injuries.         I a ske d those

who were       near       if they needed help and                 checked with man y of them a b o u t

numb.        X felt       inadequate,       as    if there was           obso l u t e l y nothing           I could

do,    it s e e m e d as though everywhere                  1 looked there was another                          dead

person.        This aside,           I felt      that    I was     still        within myself         coping,

until     X saw a very young               lad,    about     10-12 years           old,    he was          o b viously

dead,    and a f ir e m a n said to a man nearby                        that     there was       nothing          he

could do and placed a jacket                      over     the    boy.     The man        became      tot ally-

distraught.              I felt    very upset        but    carried on,           1 felt      I should make

some    sort o'f contribution.                   About     this    time     I    lost    contact w ith

P o l i ce C on st a b l e    Da w s o n and everyone            else    in my serial,             I. a s s i s t e d

in putting          bodies      onto a dv er ti s i n g     hoardings           as fans    carried the

bodies       back and forth to the a rea between the N orth S tand and                                          the

Kop.     A lot       of fans on the field were angry,                           and some were          obviously

in shock,          there were        people      crying all        ar o u n d me.        I saw a fireman

a tt em pt in g     to    r esuscitate a man            by m o u t h to mouth,          and    I a t t e m p t e d to

assist       him    by giving        heart massage.              we did this for about 3 — 4

minu t e s    but    there was         no breath or         pulse an d e v e n t u a l l y a jacket was

placed over          his     face.      I felt     drained,        this    only     co n t r i b u t e d    to my

feelings       of being         inadequate and unable                to help.           X spent a few

minutes       just       staring     into space.           I didn't       know what        to do.           I

decide d      to atte m p t       to find other memb e r s              of my serial          and w i t h i n

minutes       saw Police Con s t a b l e          243 Landers.            We then a t t e m p t e d         to find

some    of the others,             without       gain.     There a p p e a r e d to        be no

o rg an is at io n on the field.                 There were P o l i c e m e n and fans walking

a ro u n d aimlessly.             By this time all           of the       bodies an d         injured had
                                                                                                                   PAG E      6

been     removed from the                 field.        Hr D a lg li sh had spoken to the fans                       via

the    loudspeakers               and    calls     had been made             for them to assist              the

Police and other                  services.          Not    long after           I went    onto    the      pitch the

Forest      fans        began singing,             w hich upset           the Liverpool        fans,        who    became

abus i v e and a g g r e ssive,                some a t t e m p t i n g    to get     to their      end of the

ground,          p r e vented      from doing          so by Police Officers.

Many of the fans were                     blaming       the Police           for what      had happened,            some

were     blaming         the F.A.         and some          poor    organisation,          spying       that the

same     had h a p p e n e d       last year,,

E v e n t u a l l y myself         and Police C o n s t a b l e Landers made                  our way through

the    crowds w hen we were a p p ro a c h e d                     by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Nesbit       on

the field.              A short         time     later the m a t c h was           o fficially a b a n d o n e d and

myself      and Police C on st a b l e Landers                      began to make          our way back            to our

original          points.          As we did so we were                   verbally abused,          Liverpool

supporters           were     calling          us murderers,           black      b a s t a r d s , cunts    etc.        We

were     told that all                 we were      good for was           fighting and kicking miners.

We wa l k e d along          the        length of L e p p i n g s Lane            to the roundabout,

suffer ing         this     type        of abuse       the whole way.              The    people    doing         this

were     not all         drunk         or youths,        some      h a d .been    drinking,       but     the

m a j or i t y    of them were            sober and many were middle aged.

S ho r t l y after        gett i n g      to the       roundabout we were                joined by the            rest of

the serial           ma k i n g    their way home quietly.                       We had no further               problems

and were          stood down            to go to C la y w h e e l s        Lane at about 6 p.m.

Up on our arrival                 at    the garages at C l a y w h e e l s Lane              there was an

uncann y silence.                  I have       never       known     it to be so quiet w i t h              so many

bobbies          together.             There was       no    laughing,        no jokes      or anything,            it was

deathly quiet.                It had obv i o u s l y a f f e c t e d everyone.                 Although           food

was available,              there were            very few who            felt up to eating.                We

eventually           stood down           from C la y w h e e l s      Lane at about 7.15               p.m.

I can honestly              say that           I have       never     felt    so drained,,* so useless and

 shocked as        I was         on that    day.    The    numbness was s o mething         I have

  never    e xp er i e n c e d    before.     Having •to take the abuse             that   followed

 made     the e x p e r i en c e even more         difficult      to    cope with.     I was        shocked

  by what     I saw * and hope             that I never      have      to experience a n y thing           like

  this again,,         I don't       think anyone         anticipated      such«a    tragedy,        and we

  were    very muc h       left     to get    on w ith things as          best we    could.         Guidance

 was     very thin on the ground.

  I am unaware as to what actions were                       taken at the ground           re

  turnstiles,        gates        etc.   or times    of opening.                                    .

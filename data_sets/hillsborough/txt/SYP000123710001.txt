A LACK OF     INITIATIVE BY THE POLICE.     THERE WERE 200 OR SO POLICE OFFICERS

STANDING ON THE HALFWAY LINE,       I SUPPOSE THEY WERE WAITING FOR INSTRUCTIONS,

       THERE WERE PEOPLE DYING IN THE FRONT AND POLICE OFFICERS,       SOME OF THEM

WERE NOT ALLOWING FANS OVER THE FRONT FENCE.         I SAW A SMALL AMOUNT OF POLICE­

 MEN PUSHING PEOPLE BACK INTO PENS 3 AND 4.        SOME WERE WAVING PAYSTICKS AT THE

 CROWD»     I C O U L D N ’T SEE IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY HITTING ANYBODY WITH THE STICKS.

 THE POLICE APPEARED        TO KNOW WHAT TO DO ONCE THE INC IDEfcU--«AB-©G€yREI>"

 LOOKED LIKE QJKJANIBED CHAOS.          THE FANS

 IT WAS APPAL ING THE POLICE
                      -------- AP£Si«ftfED TO PANIC                SSN'T EVEN A MESSAGE

OVER THE TANNOY THE POLICE DIDN’T APP              TO KNOW WHAT TO DO IT WAS THE FANS

THAT WERE ARRANGING THINGS AND ASSISTING WITH THE INJURED PEOPLE.

054.     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL             IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INGURY?

 I THINK THE WHOLE THING WAS BADLY QRGANIgEff.           I THINK THE FANS SHOULD HAVE

BEEN MADE TO QUEUE OUTSIDE THE TURhMK.ES,             ONCE THERE WERE LARGE CROWDS'."" THE

START    OF THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE^ffEEN DELAYED AND THIS SHOULD HA^fi^BEEN

ANNOUNCED       ALSO ONCE THE   M k   TES WERE OPENEDr IN FACT BEFj&RI-    THEY OPENED THE

GATESy I THINK THE TUj^EL SHOULD HAVE BEEN BARRIC                D, POLICE OFFICERS

SHOULDNT HAVE ALLSEED ANYONE ELSE INTO PENS                    AND FOUR WHICH WERE FULL

THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO THE SIBE PENS WHICH I BELIEVE WERE

REASONABLY EMPTY.

ONCE THE DISASTER HAD TAKEN PLACE             THINK THE POLICE SHOULD H A V E ^ C T E D QUICKER

THEY APPEARED TO BE MORE C O i ^ R N E D WITH TROUBLE THAN S A F E T Y      I SAW OFFICERS

PUSHING PEOPLE BACK INTfl^THE PE N S , I THINK THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH

 INVASION.

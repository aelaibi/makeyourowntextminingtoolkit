      At 8am on Saturday 15th April 1989, I came on duty at Bentley Police station.
      I made my way to Doncaster Police Headquarters parading at S.^am we were then
      conveyed to Hillsborough Sheffield.
      I was in serial 33 with Sergeant Atkin and Inspector Mille tt in charge, we were
      briefed at the ground and were on our static points by 11.15ara.   I was positioned
      on Pennistone Road, to prevent any public disorder or damage to property. I
      remained at this location until 3pm.    Whilst there I saw numerous fans drinking
      and carrying cans of beer, several numbers sat on the wall of the Travellers
      public house to finish off their drinks before reaching the ground.
      It was 3pm before we could leave our points due to the late arrival of fans, whilst
      making our way i:owards our standby location a radio message was received that
      assistance was required at the Leppings Lane entrance.    We made our way there
      and on arrival we were told to form a cordon across the entrance to prevent any
      more fans entering the ground.   We had been stood there a short time when fans
      started coming out of the ground.     I heard one say "YOU'D BETTER GET IN THERE
      THERE'S PEOPLE INJURED."   At that point I left the cordon and made my way into
      the area behind the West stand, there were dead and injured being carried out
      by other fans, I went to assist the injured as best I could there were so many.
      I helped remove the injured from the area behind the stand toan outer perimiter
      wall where several had been placed for removal to hospital.     I helped place them
      in the ambulances and remained with one particular fan who appeared to be
      seriously injured he was subsequently removed to hospital.
      I remained in this area until all the fans had cleared the ground, we then returned
      to the North stand for de-briefing.
      At approximately 7pm we returned to Doncaster going off duty at 8pm that same
      date.

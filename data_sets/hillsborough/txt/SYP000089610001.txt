               Further to my questionnaire I completed,                           I can desp-f'ibe the bodies I

               dealt with on 15 April               1989 <150489) at Hi 1 lsboj^ugh.

               The one I gave mouth to mouth resusc itat ion tjjr was a white male about

               £'Q~£5 years old,

               He was on the pitch to the left of the g o ^ / i n                        the penalty box as   you

               look at the      goal from the pitch.

               The man had      mousey brown hair which/1 /presume was straight                      but at   that

               time it was      very untidy.           He was /fl^an shaven,             about 5*6 — 5*7 tall?

               medium b u i.1d .

               He was wearing a red T shirt wf»i clji was plain red, short sleeves and

               round neck.      That was tak^n dff by other fans when it was obvious he

               was flead a nd it was used to p v e r             the face of a dead woman nearby.

               The body had jeans o r           cords /on.       I remember he had one grey trainer on
                                                                                           PAGE     2
                                                                                           S3387

                one of his feet.     The other trainer was missing.

                Someone got a grey blanket and put it over him /up to his neck.

                After that I moved about 9 bodies from the pi/ch to the gym.           I

V C,     A/a   / remember the last one in particular
fa'
          \S    It was a             woman aged about 30 or m o r e .    She had red ski    pants

                on which had an elasticated bottom that yfent under her feet.          She

                d i d n ’t have any shoes on, her feet were/bare.       She had a flowery

                blouse o n.    She also had a very small/faced watch with a white strap.

                on her left wrist.

                I carried her by her feet onto an Advertising board to the area by the

                North Stand and the Spion Hop.

                Someone    covered her f.ace with a/bright   red Sheffield United stewards

                jacket with Umbro on the back./ She was carried f rom the goal mouth,

                I c a n ’t remember anything el<=/e about any of the other bodies I
m
                carried.

                I can remember that thA di/ad woman who had the red T shirt         put over

                her face was wearing a blue and red Addi das j a c k e t .

                                                                                       SIGNED

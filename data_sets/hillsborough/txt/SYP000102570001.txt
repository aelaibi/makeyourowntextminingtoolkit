Pol ice Constable 3197



I am a Police Constable currently serving at the Communications
S c h o o l , Ecclesfield Training Centre, Sheffield.


I commenced duty at 9.00am on Saturday 15 A p r i 1 1989 at Barnsley
Pol ice Station to perform duties at the F.A. Cup Semi Final at
Hillsborough,         Sheffield.         I then   travel 1ed   to   Hi 11sborough
Football Ground arriving there at 9.30am for a 10.00am briefing.


My duties for the day were as a m o b i 1e patrol in company with 4
other o f f i c e r s .       These officers were PS Hallett, PC Pont, PC
Gillott and PC Frith, using call sign Tango 10.                      We were to
patrol the north side of Sheffield city, which is the Neepsend
and Penistone Road area and supervise the Nottingham Forrest
fans arrivi ng at the g r o u n d .


At 10.30am we commenced our patrol and at this time the area was
relatively quiet with no p r o b l e m s .        Within a short time however
it did start to get busy and there were a number of supporters
gathering at the public houses in the area.                The supporters all
appeared to be Nottingham Forrest fans and they were in good
humour and well behaved.


By about 1 .00pm the Penistone Road area was crowded with people
and all the pubs in the area had supporters outside with their
dri nks    and other than            attendi ng one or two mi nor incidents
everybody appeared to be in good humour.
At about     2 .00p m we attended         at the Royal             Public House as a

result of a call over the radio for assist ance from a Police

Officer.      On   arrival      there     was    a    large        crowd    outside      the

premises     and   it   was    obvious     there       had    been     a    large     scale

d i sturbance with supporters, some of whom were still inside the

premises.      We gave ass istance          in clearing the premises both

inside and outside.           The landlord then closed the premises and

we remained in the area for a short while until the crowd had
dispersed.



After leaving the Royal           Public House we continued on general

patrol and by about 2 .45pm Pe nistone Road was clearing q u ickly

of supporters, most of whom had arrived at the ground.                              It was

at this time I became aware that there was a large build up of

supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                            The radio

transmiss ions were sometimes very distorted and weak but what I
could hear, the voices had a sense of urge ncy in them.



I heard an officer ask several- times for the gate to be opened

and   also    another    office r       asking       for     the    kick    off     to    be

postponed. This was refused as another officer stated over the

radio that the players were already on the pitch.                          I can clearly

remember this because it was at this time about 2.55 pm that we

parked the vehicle up on Penistone Road at its junct ion with

Bradfield Road.
We remain ed at this location for the next 10 minut es or so and
monitored     both   UHF   and   VHF   radio   channels.   The   UHF   radio

t r a nsm issions were continuous but messages were still distorted

and drowned out by screaming and shouting from the crowds in the

background.



It became apparent to me that something serious was happe n i n g at

the Leppings Lane end of the ground because what t r a nsmi ssions I

could- hear on the radio n o w had a real feeling of urgency -a-n d -

so m etime^ prmijp in them. At this point shortly after 3.00pm as a

result of a radio m e s s a g e to all         units on the VHF radio we
a ttended at the Football Ground and entered it from Penistone

Road.     We joined other officers at the junc tion of the Kop and

the North Stand.       We were all instructed by Inspector W a lla ce to

remain there for the m o m e n t which we did.       Also at this location

was a number of Mounted Officers.              We r emained there for some

seven or eight minutes not knowing what had happened or what we

were required for.         I had assumed at this point there must have

been a pitch invasion and we were required for crowd control,

but     I soon   became aware     that" this was not the case because

w hilst stood at this location I saw a number of very distressed

and a p p a r e n t l y injured supporters coming fro m the pitch with

Police Officers and I also saw St John's Amb ula n c e m e n running on

to the pitch and down t o w a r d s the Leppings Lane end.         We were

then ordered by Inspector Wallace to f o l l o w him on to the pitch

and f o r m a cordon infront of the Liverpool supporters sat in the

North Stand.         As we were going on to the pitch a Liverpool

supporter grabbed me and told me people were dying down there,

pointing    to the West       Stand    at the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.
As we walked on to the pitch there was a roar from the crowd.

We formed the cordon as ord ered and I remained there for some 4

or 5 minutes.          W h il st I was there I was subjected to both verbal

and   physical         abuse.       Liverpool         supporters         were      spitting,
punching and poking at us.              We tried our best to calm them but

to no avail.         Th ey asked w h y we were there and not helping with

the dead       and     injured.      I k new by now we had a large scale

disaster to deal with and not a pitch invasion.                            I decided that

I would be m ore e f f e c t i v e l y employed at the West Stand where

supporters      were     obviously     in     difficulties          and        so as not to

aggravate      the      Liverpool     supporters in the North                  Stand      any

further, I left the cordon and ran to the West                          Stand area as did

m a n y other officers.


What I saw was horrific, there were people lying all over the
pitch, a number of          them         o b v i o u s l y dead.        I helped where          I could

and I assisted with the removal               of both dead and injured persons

from the pitch          to the First Aid Room and g y m n as ium                situated at

the rear of the North Stand.


When I first arrived at the First Aid Room it was alrea dy full

with injured people.              There were a number of ambulances parked

under the North           Stand    and other Police O fficers were laying

injured    people on        the ground        underneath the overha ng of the

North Stand.         Several fans were r eceiving medical attention from

St. John's and A m b u l a n c e personnel.


Whilst this was taking place I saw some Liverpool supporters in

the North Stand urinating, and the urine was running through the

spaces    in     the     concrete     stand     and     down       on     to     the   people

underneath.
                                                                        5   .

The fans were well aware what they were doing and were laughing

and jeer ing at Police Officer s whilst they were urinating.



I returned to the pitch and by this time saw a large number of

officers, some of them in a state of confusion and shock.                        Sadly

some    of    the    y o u n g e r officers did   not   r e al ly    know what     had

happened or wh at to do next.               I had to escort a young Special

Constable off the pitch as he was in a state of shock.



The    atmosphere     inside the      ground was very fright e n i n g and           I

formed the opinion that the crowd were not aware of what had

happened and we had to bear the brunt of their anger.                           Whilst

a s sisting with the injured I was both p h y s i c a l l y and v e r bally

abused and blamed for wh at was happe ning and at one point had it

not been for the interve ntion of a m a l e P.C., w hose identity I

do not know,         I would have been            attacked by an angry Liverpool

supporter, who stated          it was m y         fault and he was going to "have

me."         I saw   a number     of Police Officers           and   Firemen     being

punched and kicked w hils t they were helping the injured.                        Some

of the angry supporters I tried to calm were in shock but a

large number were o b v i o u s l y drunk.



At some time         s h ortly before 4.00p m whilst near the First Aid

Room I was informed by Inspector Barker that they were open ing

the Casua lty Bureau at Ecclesfield and that I m a y be required.

We went together into the gymnasium at H i l lsborough and I was

instructed by Sup erin t e n d e n t Bates to attend .at Eccles field as a

m atter of urgency.         I left Hill sborough just after 4.00pm and

was driven by a Traffic Officer to Ec clesfield Train i n g Centre,
ar r iving   there    at    approximately   4.10pm   where   I   commenced
C a s u a l t y Bureau duties ^for the remainder of the day until going

off d u t y at   10.45pm   that day.

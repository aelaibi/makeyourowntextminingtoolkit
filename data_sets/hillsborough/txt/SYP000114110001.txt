behaviour            of those         e n t e r i n g the ground.

To a c h i e v e       this we w o u l d s t a t i o n o u r s e l v e s       i m m e d i a t e l y ouside        the

of persons             into the ground.                                       ^     ^ ^

Our    b r i efing was           s u p p l e m e n t e d by I n spector P U R D Y who was                 the officer

in charge            of our      serial,        and    l a t e ^ ^ b ^ ^ ^ t ^ e T t o r SYKES.

the gro u n d and            s t a r t e d entering.

At that        time the          flow of        persons       into    the ground was                light and

steady,        as did the             other     officers       of my serial           I was able            to search

the m a j o r i t y of          persons       entering        the    ground.

Any    in p o s s e s s i o n of metal             cans were a s k e d         to    leave them           in the waste

bins     outside          the    turnstiles.            E v e r y o n e who was asked did so and

s e a r c h e d and were          good h u m o u r e d about          it.      The weat h e r was            fine and

quite warm,             most     people were w i t h o u t           coats ma k i n g          the s e a r c h i n g    easier.

Very     little         p r o p e r t y was     taken from those             entering.              I am sure of a

small        penknife        being      seized and a y o u n g            couple a t t e m p t i n g        to enter

                   During      the      lulIs     in these         pushes my        p r i ority had          changed from

V T h e s e w ere o p e n but,             ai J d i d ;a couple         of other offic e r ! we               closed tH#

  three      pairs, of gates               to prevent a n y furt h e r               pushing on the              turnstiles.

  The d i f f i c u l t y w i t h those            gates        t h o u g h was     that a l t h o u g h the          right

  hand of the          pair had a bolt w h i c h went                        down to the ground,                 the left

  side    could only            be    closed and held               closed u^ing            physical        strength,

 which       I did.

  B y now     it w a s     b e t w e e n E.50 pm an d S .35 pm and elements                              of the         crowd

  were    b e c oming quite host i l e an d d e s p e r a t e                     to get      into the        ground.           I

  wa s s u b j e c t e d to      quite a lot of verbal                       abuse     from people          d e m anding        to

  be   let    into the          g r o u n d and others             a c c u s i n g me of      causing       people to be

  c r u s h e d up a g a i n s t      the gates         I was       holding         closed.

  It was      impossible             to    reason w i t h the m a j o r i t y of the                  c r o w d who      could

  not see what was               happening           in front.           A     couple of times             I was told of

  w o m e n and     c h i l d r e n being         crushed up a g a i n s t           the gates a n d          so w h e r e v e r

  possible        I allowed           them to filter               through.

  About      three     times         the weight         of the        crowd on the gates was more                          than

  I could hold a n d             large        numbers w o u l d         surge      thro u g h before we               could

  fight      the gates          closed again.              The m o o d of the             crowd was         one of

  d e s p e r a t i o n to get        into the gr o u n d before                  the game started.                   I tried

  to assure         people       that        the start w o u l d be delayed,                   som e t h i n g    I

  g e n u i n e l y believed,             but a c h i e v e d    little       success.

 Eventually          the    crowd at the t u r n s tiles                     d w i n d l e d an d   I saw that the

  other      pairs     of w r o u g h t        iron gates          had been opened.                 O b v i o u s l y the

  crowd      pushing a g a i n s t           the gates          I was    holding         could see        this and so I

  ha d to     let    people          start      flowing t h r o u g h my gate,                although        I only

  op e n e d one half an d tried to slow dow n their                                   entry.

           I went        to a s s i s t   and   saw that the         people       just        inside the gates were

           t r a p p e d up to just a b o v e             the waist.          O f f i c e r s had hold of them and

           people        pressing         on the m from further              up the terraces.

about S O years,                 clean shaven,           w e a r i n g I believe a         dark coloured top,

my a t t e n t i o n was         d r a w n to him because              he was      badly d i s c l o u r e d and

lifeless,          o b v i o u s l y dead or d y i n g an d onl y being s u p p o r t e d by the

people       crushed a r o u n d him.

That was my first                  r e a l i s a t i o n that       this was a m ajor         disaster.          I

f o r w a r d by the mass             of    people       furt h e r     back up the terraces.

I s h o u t e d at         the    people to move              b ack a n d    pointed at the          tunnel

It e v e n t u a l l y      became a p p a r e n t       that       there were      large     numbers         of people

terraces           onto the        perimeter           track w ere       having     little     effect         on the

overall        numbers who            needed help and so m y s e l f and other officers

To do this           it was        n e c e s s a r y to climb over the top of the                     depth of

               *3*    end    passed       onto the       perimeter          track.

               Several       others w e r e        picked up by groups                of    police and s p e c t a t o r s and

               we    carried them either                to gate       *3*    or to where the fence                 had been

          $    br o k e n down near          to the      centre of the             goals.

    ^ ^        I have       little       r e c o l l e c t i o n of the     vast m a j o r i t y of mos t of these

               people as the             n e c e s s i t y was to get        them out of that              e n c l o s u r e as

               q u i c k l y as    possible        to where       they c ould         properly be seen too.

               Du r i n g this       time    I was aware          that      there was        still    large      numbers of

               supporters          s tood a r o u n d    in that         enclosure,         doing    nothing       but their

               very      presence        hindering       the     people      trying        to help the        injured.

               I tried to mov e             some    of these a w a y and told them to                      leave     the terraces

               but was s h o c k e d by the             hostile       reaction        I received from some,                  and

               a m a z e d that      some a c t u a l l y     still      b e l i e v e d the game w o u l d      continue and

               wer e a d a m a n t    that      they w o u l d n ' t move.

               E v e n t u a l l y all    the    injured were m o v e d            out     of that e n c l o s u r e and away,

               I remained          in the area.              A couple of times              I heard the         roar of the

               crowd from          the S p i o n Ho p a n d thought             there was        going      to be trouble

               but    I did not          become     involved        in that.

              farts from the West S t a n d out of the g r o u n d after w h i c h we were

              debriefed.

             Finally       it w o u l d a p p e a r t o mt that the           cause of the     pr#Mera« 'was “the

              vast     numbers     of    people      trying to enter         the ground      in the   tqii   half

              g r o u n d before       the kick      pff and    could    not    be reasoned with.

              I would     have     liked to have seen the start                  of the m a t c h d e l a y e d and

              this a n n o u n c e d    over   the    public a d d r e s s    system.    The   only

              announcements            I h eard was     the    request       for the    "Liverpool    fans to m o v e

              back from the            fences."

Sonia people                 in this are a were                trying      to    r esuscitate         people a n d                     I

remember           ass i s t i n g      one       person,       but    it was      too     late,      the         person was

I then tried to give                         some     comfort         to the      injured.          There were                        no

bodies         left          in the     pens       by now and          I remember         making my way                       back

gat h e r i n g and             I asked       them to keep             back      to give       them some                room.               It

was about               then that an a m b u l a n c e             a r r i v e d at     the    same        time an                 injured

person was               brought acr o s s            the      pitch.       He was       obviously              still            alive            ar;<

dead at that                        time and          the man who was                    still       alive       was taken            on a

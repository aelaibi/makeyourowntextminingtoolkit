                On    Saturday,           13    April       1989       (150489)           I was       on    duty       re    the       Semi-Final

                in     the    Incident          R o om     next    to     O pe rati o n s           Room.        Police          C o n s t,a b I e    1 1 7 f.

                Jones        was    with       me    from    0600       hours        that       date       and    we    were        joined           at

                approximately                 10.00am       (1000)        by       Chief       Inspector          Edmundson.

                Police        Constable             Jones    was       manning           the    radio       controlling                traffic

                mobiles        engaged          in    overseeing              the    arrival          of    supporters              via      major

                roads        and    the       motorways.           On     the       instructions             of    Chief           Inspector

                Edmundson           I was       updating          the     extended             incident          log    on       the    Command            and

                Control        System.

                Throughout           the       morning       and       dinner        time       period       we    had       a    lot     of

                congestion           on       the    roads       but    by     approximately                1400       hours        this       had        all

                but        cleared       and    everything             seemed        to       settle       down    and       go     smoothly              and

               we     had     no    major       hold       ups    anywhere.               I    remember          several          mobiles        asking

                to    go     into    meal       and      this     was     refused.

               Whilst         engaged          on    our    duties        on       channel          1 VHF    we    were          also     monitoring

               Hillsborough               Ground       Control          on     channel          23 v i a a        repeater             set.      PS

               Goddard         was       the    main       operator           at    the       ground.        I    think          that     it    is

                important           to    say       that    this       radio        was       not    being       monitored             constantly

               by     officers           in    the    Incident          Room        in    fact      most     of    the       time       it     was

               turned        down        low    (volume)         as     FJC    Jones          had   d i f f i culty      heariijfc

transmissions                   from          his       mobiles             if          channel             25    was    on       at       a    normal

setting.

I    could       hear       various                transmissions                         on       channel          25    and          at       approximately

2.40pm       <1440)             I    heard          a    supervisory                         officer             whom    I    did          not       know

talking          to    PS       Goddard             saying             he       had          a    large          crowd       outside             the

Leppings          Lane          end       of       the       ground.                    He       asked       for    more          officers             (Mounted

I    think)       and       a       vehicle             with       a       PA       system             to    stop       people             pushing.              I

believe          one    was          directed                to    the          scene.

Transmissions                   on       Channel             25    were             getting             more       frequent                from       this       time

and    you       could          hear          the       sound          of       a       large          crowd       noisily                in    the

background.                 I       heard          the       same          supervisory                      officer          ask          several          times

for    a    gate       to       be       opened          at       Leppings                   Lane.           Each       time          he       asked       he    was

more       insistent                and       he    stated             finally                   that       the    gate       had          to    be    opened

or    else       people             would          be    fatally                injured.                    The    sounds             of       the    crowd

seemed       to       suggest             this          as    well.                 It       was       apparent          that             this       officer          was

in    the    centre             of       the       crowd.              I    then             contacted             ground             control          over

Channel          25    (I       think)             or    it       may       have             been       the       telephone                line       to    their

ground       control                office,             to    see          if       any          ambulances             were          required             at    the

scene,       it       was       so       noisy          and       unruly                over       the       radio       that             injuries          were          a

definite          possibility.                          I was          informed                   by    PS       Goddard          that          ambulances

were       not    required                at       this       time.                 I    cannot             remember          the          time       exactly

but    it    would          be       about          3.00pm             (1500).

Various          messages                were       being          passed                on       channel          25    and          I    heard       an

officer          state          that          numerous             people                were          injured          and       a       request          was

made       for    a    fleet             of    ambulances.                          I    told          Chief       Inspector                   Edmundson             of

this,       he    was       half          way       through                the          connecting                door       to       Operations                Room,

and    then       I    contacted                   ambulance                control                by       direct       line             and    made       the

same       request          using             the       same       words.                    I was          informed          that             the    usual

response          would             be    sent.              On    termination                         of    that       call          someone          at       the
                                                                                                   _______________ a

               Mr.    Edmundson             was       informed                and           I was then             engaged             in       variousduties

               in    relation          to       what       we       thought                 was    a crowd          disorder                and      were

               directing             officers             to       the       ground,             motorcycles                to    cover           hospital

               routes          etc.        At    some          stage          we       knew       we    had       fatalities,                   we    thought             in

               the       region       of    single             figures,                we    even       commented                if    the        game      would

               continue.              We    spoke          of       this       because             if       the    game          was       cancelled             we       had

               the       job    of    seeing          to       the       crowds             leaving          the    ground.                 We       were    then

               informed          the       game       was          off       and       the       crowd       leaving.                 PC    Jones          and    myself

               then       arranged          traffic                cars       to       assist          in    this       task.              This       we    were

               engaged          in    for       the       rest          of    our       tour       of       duty    along             with       assisting                in

               all       the    other       arranqements.                          My       tour       of    duty       ended          at       7.30pm       <1930).

      ^        I    have       read    a    transcript                   which          implies             that    PC       Rook          <2554)          contacted

               ambulance             control.              At       that       time          I    had       no    knowledge                of     this      and       I

               also       contacted             the       ambulance                control             specifically                    requesting a               fleet

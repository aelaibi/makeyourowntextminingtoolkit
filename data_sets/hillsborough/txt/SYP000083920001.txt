duty s c h eduled to be wor k e d            before,       during and after         the game.

This    duty to be w o r k e d on foot,             o n e radio     between two of us which was

tuned    into    channel      19 w hich was         being m o n i t o r e d by a mobile CID

communi cat ion vehicle.



At time     shown     I left       the ground on foot and due to                lack of     people    in

area at this         time    had a general          patrol     covering Parkside R d ?

M i d d l e w o o d Rd and entire         park area.



T o g e t h e r with PC M O U L D I N G    I liaised w ith Park            patrol   officers     who were

on static       duty at H i l l s b o r o u g h    car    park at    the    location    previously

mentioned.         At this      time      there were       very   few    pedestrians     and vehicles

in the area.          We m a i n t a i n e d foot     patrol      in and around the Park up to

1.50    pm (1350)       noticing a general               but   not excessive        build up of

pedes tr ians      i n t he area,



1350 started to make               our way from the Park area towards                   the football

ground.       We wa l k e d along Parks i d e Rd onto Penis tone Rd at w hich time

P e n i s t o n e Rd was    full    of supporters          making    their way to the ground,

man y of these        supp o r t e r s    having    or app e a r i n g   to have     consumed alcohol

of d i f fering      levels.        Quite a large          number    of these       supporters

carrying      cans    of beer       or    lager with them.           General    attitude     of the

suppo r t e r s at this       time a p p e a r e d to be quite           friendly.      Having wo r k e d

both    inside and outside               the ground for the          last    16 years    (including

several     Semi     Final    matches)       the general          build up seemed to be as

normal,     and where        the    supporters       were      carrying     beer and    lager    it was

anticipated        this w o u l d    be taken from them as they a t t em p t e d entry                near

to the turnstiles            to the       ground.

P e n i s t o n e Rd heavily       congested with fans                entering         ground.        Due    to this

we w a l k e d along Pen i s t o n e Rd North,                turned      left       onto Vere Rd,          left

again      into Leppings Ln,             where we       intended to          reach the         park via

Catchbar         Ln,   P a r kside Rd.        As we turned           onto Leppings Ln               I saw a heavy

build up of fans who were                    very noisy w ith           continuous          streams        of fans

still      a p p r o aching    the ground along Leppings Ln both from the                                  d i rection

of M i d d l e w o o d Rd and Pen i s t o n e Rd North.               Many     of these were           rushing

towards          the ground     in obvious a11empts                to enter as soon as                possible.

F rom where         I was walk i n g      I could see that              the entire           driveway       leading

to the       entrances        to the     ground from this             side were            totally    packed with

people.           I could see      the Police Land Rover                  parked on the             perimeter          of

the      crowd and      could     plainly hear          its    public address               system    in

o pe rat i on and        re cogni sed the voice of PC B U X T O N a p p e a 1i ng to

spectators          not to     push as       people were         being     squashed at the front                   of

the      turnstiles.          It was     obvious       that m any       of the supporters              were

taking       no notice and          I could hear          some     jeering       at the appeals.              Many

of the       supporters        in this       area seemed to be the worse                      for    drink.        I

was      unable     to assist      due    to the sheer           numbers       and the fact           1 was       in

plain      clothes.       Upo n    looking around             I could see numerous                  s u pporters        on

Ca t c h b a r   Ln who were       on the       roof    of the Police            section house and

others      who were      climbing        up adj o i n i n g     buildings and trees.                  I went

wi t h    the     intention of       removing        these     for    safety         reasons whilst          en

route      back to H i l l s b o r o u g h    car    park.       We m a n a g e d     to    remove    the    fans

■from the        buildings and s h e p h e r d e d them along Catchbar Ln towards

P e n i s t o n e Rd and away from the               general      d i r e c t i o n of the      ground.           The

Upo n    reaching        the H i l l s b o r o u g h      car    park area ws again                liaised wilts the

Park     patrol      officers,          who       stated their         sect i o n was        only three       quarters

full    and everything             there was all                in order.        We then m o v e d on through

the     centre      of the Park             heading       for the second             car    park s i t uated within

the Park at the Hawks ley Ave                           entrance.



W h i l s t we were        heading          for    the    second     car      park    I. heard numerous

e m e r g e n c y vehicle        sirens and saw P o l i c e / A m b u l a n c e            vehicles     heading

along     P e n istone Rd towards                  the d i r e c t i o n of the ground.               At this    time

I r e a lised that             something was             o b viously    not     right and together             with PC

MOULDING        I ran through the Park                     towards      the ground via Parkside Rd and

P e n i s t o n e Rd North.            At    this       time    there were       still       people a p p r o aching

the     ground along Pen i s t o n e Rd North,                      although         not    in great    numbers.

The     large     d r i veway wi t h i n          the    club's     ground,      which       runs at    the    rear of

the S outh stand was                littered with               fans who were a p p r o a c h i n g      the

P e n i s t o n e Rd N o r t h awa y from the                  d i r ection    of Leppings Ln.           I

c o n tinued      running along Pen i s t o n e Rd N orth heading                            for    the Police

C ontrol      room at the           rear      of the N o r t h stand and               I entered the ground

t h r o u g h the    large access             gate which           is s i t uated between gate               *0" and

Vere Rd.          I could see           numerous          e m e r g e n c y vehicles        scattered a r o u n d    the

 a rea and as          I made my way               into the ground             I could hear          people

screaming,          crying and moaning.                    I was     still      making my way to the

g y m n a s i u m when     I was       gree t e d by people with make                      shift    stretchers      made

of a d v e r t i s e m e n t    boards w hich were               carrying       people,       some alive,       some

o b v i o u s l y dead,        other    people were             carrying       persons       by their arms and

legs.



I went      i mmediately          into the gym n a s i u m and                commenced to assist wit h the

carrying        of bodies and               laying       them out      on the gym floor              checking    for

vital    signs-        Almost      i m m e d iately doctors were               in attendance

volunteering         their     services and were a d m i n i s t e r i n g          first aid to some

of the victims and             certifying       others      to be d e a d .        As the bodies were

being    placed      in      the gym, the      officers ass i s t i n g w ith the             carrying       of a

particular       body       remained with that           body.     To try and form some                 kind of

order    I assisted        in making        rows    of the       corpses as the numbers                 of dead

bodies     coming      into the gym kept            increasing.            I am unable      to     recall       any

of the times         from hereon due to the sheer                       urgency of events,             and full

attention       having     to be     paid to other matters,



When    the    flow of bodies          had stopped         coming        into the    gym    I was

i nstructed to pair            up with one         of the U n i f o r m        officers    standing       by the

the    bodies and assist            him with       the    searching        of and trying          10    identify

that    parti cular       body.      This    particular          body,     that    of a while male,             was

u nkn o w n and. a l t h o u g h    carrying    property         had no means        of    identification.

The    officer       in this       instance was PC         i 7 c!. of    *C*    Division,    who at my

request made a full                log of the      property,        clothing and d e s c r iption           of

the    body.     The      body then had the o f f i c e r ’s details a t t a c h e d thereto,

was    placed     in a      body bag and remained, s u p e r v i s e d            by the Unif o r m

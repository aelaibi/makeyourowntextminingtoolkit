The Mirror article contains a number of inaccuracies.   You could
point out:
1.   Safety standards at soccer grounds are already controlled
by law in safety certificates issued by local authorities under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. They have all the power
they need to implement recommendations from the interim Taylor
report.
2.   The interim report did not call upon clubs to pull down
perimeter fences; merely to ensure that the gates were painted
in distinctive colours and left open during the match.

3.   Perimeter fence gates which release under crowd pressure
would not necessarily meet the criteria for crush barriers in the
Green Guide.   At present the Home Office would regard them as
potentially dangerous for certain uses.

4.   There is no squabbling over the nature of the agreements
between the police and the clubs.    What has been identified is
that there is a wide range of different types of agreement either
in existence or being prepared,         some of which may be
inappropriate for legal reasons. The important issue, addressed
by Taylor, was that the clubs should agree with the police to
what extent each was responsible for crowd safety.       The Home
Office believe that there is in practice agreement at all league
grounds.   The difficulty over the formal documents should not
affect the practical arrangements and in any case we expect it
to be resolved quickly.
5.   The general position is that the Home Office has been
monitoring the way in which clubs and local authorities have been
implementing the recommendations from the Taylor interim report.
All the evidence available to us is that both clubs and local
authorities have gone out of their way to ensure that the
recommendations are complied with. Practical difficulties have
been identified in one or two cases, but in almost every case an
alternative solution has been found to ensure that safety
standards are maintained.

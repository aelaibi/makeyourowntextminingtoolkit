drawings of Sheffield hedhesday football   cum drahh   by qoodhall

Sorae time ago X mentioned to David Brunaell that the Health and Safety
Executive drawings prepared by Bradea showed there were some anomalies on
the police drawings prepared by Miss Dawn Goodhall of the West Midlands
Police. In view of the higher quality of Brades' drawings I suggested to
him, and we agreed, that we Mould withdraw the police drawings totally.
The benefits being that we did not want to get into a debate between Brades
and Miss Goodhall as to who was right. Whilst 1 understand the anomalies
are not significant I still feel that we ought to be fully professional In
this matter.

It was with some alarm today that I saw Andrew Collins, Q.C., Bernard
Phillips and Lord Justice Taylor, produce the original police drawings.
How are we going to get round this? Should we withdraw the police drawings
completely? Should we substitute or what?

I look forward to your early advice in this matter.

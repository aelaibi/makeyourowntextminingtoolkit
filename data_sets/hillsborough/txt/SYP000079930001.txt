     I looked over                  the s tand         into    the terrace.              1 saw a girl           pinned against

     the        perimeter           fence,       she was       facing towards                my    position.         I could see

     she was           getting         the    life      s q u e e z e d out      of her.          She   had blonde         hair,          a

     d eep       purple.

     O ther        lads at          the    front       of the       stand were          shouting        for    us    to keep

     recovered.                It was a hot dry day.                       The    fans       in the West S t a n d did move

     Once        the        game    stopped       I looked again              into the            terrace,     this    time       I saw

     I. saw fans              climbing       out       of the terrace,                over    the    fence.

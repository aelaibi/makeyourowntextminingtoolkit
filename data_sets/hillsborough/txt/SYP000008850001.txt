We    eventually       left        the      gr o u n d at a b o u t / 6            pm.

I would       like    to say         that at               least

but had       been drinking.

At     no time whilst             inside          t.He ground did                 1 see any          crowd dist u r b a n c e s

P r i o r to our arrival               some 20 minutes                        after     k i c k-off a vast m a j o r i t y

John's       people    on duty              inside               the ground.

I    did not       see any        crowd         crush             inside      or outside        the ground,          only an

orderly       d e p arture        of Liv e r p o o l               fans    from    the West Stand.

The whole          incident        happened                so quic k l y        that     I cannot        remember what

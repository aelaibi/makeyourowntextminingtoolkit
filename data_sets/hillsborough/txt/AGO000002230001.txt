MR CLEUGH

cc DEPUTY DIRECTOR




Thank you.

I am content to accept Counsel's advice that there is insufficient evidence
to justify the institution of criminal proceedings against any person for any
offence arising out of this terrible disaster.  I have spoken to both the
Director and Mr Gandy, who are also content for the papers to be sent to the
Attorney General to inform him of that advice.  Subject to the Attorney's
views, we propose to advise the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
accordingly.

Please prepare a set of papers and submit them to Stephen Wooler.   You might
wish to liaise with him to decide precisely what he will require, other than
a copy of the Joint Opinion itself.  As to the  timing, we have spoken about
the anxiety that South Yorkshire Police quite properly express concerning the
opening fixture of the new season between Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool
next Saturday, 25 August.  Any decision on the  outcome of this enquiry must
not be made public until after that match.

Subject, therefore, to the Attorney's views, and if there are no other
reasons for delaying the decision, I should be grateful if you would liaise
with Stephen Wooler with a view to announcing the decision by way of a brief
press release during the week beginning (after the bank holiday) Tuesday,
28 August.  I suggest that the press release be along the lines of that
issued in relation to Clapham Junction, which contained a reference to the
Hidden report.  We should now refer to the Taylor report; as well, of course,
as to the extensive police enquiries by the West Midlands Police and the
advice of Leading Counsel.  Please discuss the wording and timing of the
release with Stephen Wooler and Mr Gandy.  Before it goes out we must ensure
that South Yorkshire Police, West Midlands Police and the PCA are informed.
Please discuss with Stephen Wooler whether anyone else (e.g. the Home
Office?) needs to be informed in advance.

It is possible that adverse comment will be made in some quarters about the
timing of the announcement of our decision in relation to next Saturday's
match at Hillsborough.  That would be regrettable, but I do not think it can
really be avoided.  The alternatives would be to announce the decision before
the match, with possibly grave consequences for public order; or to delay the
announcement for some artificial period after the match, which would be wrong
in principle.

Mr Gandy, to whom a copy of this minute goes, is aware of the proposed course
of action and should be consulted in the event of any difficulties or
uncertainties.

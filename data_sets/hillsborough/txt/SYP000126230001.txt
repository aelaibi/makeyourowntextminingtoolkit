THERE WAS AN IDIOT WHO WENT TO THE FOREST END AND STARTED JESTURING. THE
FOREST FANS STARTED CHANTING AND SOME OF THE LIVERPOOL FANS WENT DOWN TO THE
KOP END AND THE POLICE CORDONED IT. THE ONLY VIOLENCE I SAW WAS A PRESSMAN
WAS TALKING TO A MAN WHO LOOKED VERY DISTRESSED, SOME OTHER LADS HAD A GO AT
HIM, AND THE POLICE LED HIM AWAY FOR HIS OWN SAFETY.

                  THERE WERE LOADS OF FOOTBALL FANS OUTSIDE THE PUBS DRINKING AND
                  THE COACHES WERE PARKED OUTSIDE. I DONT REMEMBER THE NAMES OF ANY
                  FIRMS. I THOUGHT AT THE TIME HOW EARLY IT WAS FOR THEM TO BE
                  DRINKING. ON THE WAY HOME BETWEEN 130 AND 2PM THERE WERE STILL

THE PLAYERS TUNNEL AND STARTED RIPPING THE BOARDS OFF THAT THE POLICE LET THE
SUPPORTERS DO IT. THEN POLICE MARCHED IN 2'S AND BLOCKED OFF THE NOTTS
FOREST SUPPORTERS WHILE LIVERPOOL FANS DIRECTLY BEHIND THEM WERE TRYING TO

THERE HAD ALSO BEEEN OR LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS AFIGHT AMONGST THE POLICE AND
LIVERPOOL FANS ON THE PITCH, I FEEL SURE THAT IF THEY HAD MADE EARLIER
ANOUNCMENTS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FEELING TOWARDS THE FANS.
IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE A POLICE MAN CAME AND CALLED OVER A LOUD HAILER
BUT THIS REALLY WASN'T TO GOOD BECAUSE ONLY THE FIRST FEW ROWS COULD HEAR.

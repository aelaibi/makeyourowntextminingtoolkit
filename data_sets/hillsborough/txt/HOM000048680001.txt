Dear Mr Bone
Hillsborough
Many thanks for your letter of the 9th February 1998.
The transcript of the business meeting cannot be traced in our files and our last hope was
that it had gone down in papers sent to your office. Obviously that is not the case.
We will now have to do a further search in the knowledge that we cannot lay the blame for
the missing documentation anywhere else! With the amount of paper that we have, I
rather suspect that we do hold the document but simply cannot find it. There is only one
part-time member of staff in my office who has any knowledge of the Hillsborough papers
at all.
Perhaps you would be kind enough to confirm to Ann Addlington that we will make a
further search and I will correspond direct with her should we find anything.
As your task is now finished, may I take this opportunity to thank you fro the patience and
courtesy you have displayed in this difficult matter.
Kind Regards




C P Dorries
HM Coroner

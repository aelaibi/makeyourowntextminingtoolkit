Dear Prime Minister,
Thank you for your kind letter but most of all for you and Mr Thatcher
coming last Saturday and spending time caring for the bereaved.

I know from the comments I have received how much                that this   was
appreciated, not only by the families but by many in the city.

I hope there will be opportunity, ere long, for you to visit us again on
an happier occasion, perhaps in connection with our College development.

With very many thanks.

Yours sincerely,




Dean.

following the tragedy at Hillsborough football ground on       15   April,
I shall pass on your sympathy to the families of the victims and
I am sure that they will take comfort from them.

   Hillsborough:   Message from Nicaraguan President

     President Ortega has sent the Prime Minister a letter
of condolence on the Hillsborough disaster.  A translation
is enclosed.  The message is no doubt at least partly
an attempt to sweeten the atmosphere before Ortega's
call on the Prime Minister on 8 May.

     I enclose a draft acknowledgement in the form of
a telegram to Managua.

        Hillsborough: Message from Dr Dante Caputo

     I enclose a message to the Prime Minister from
Dr Caputo, the Argentine Foreign Minister but here acting
in his capacity as President of the UN General Assembly,
over the Hillsborough football disaster.

     We recommend that the Prime Minister should
acknowledge Dr Caputo's message of condolence, as she
did with President Alfonsin's message after Lockerbie.

     I enclose a draft telegram to New York, with a
suggested text for the Prime Minister's reply.

     I am copying this letter to Kate Bush (Department
of the Environment).

                 great difference at times like these and your condolences

                 fear that the toll of dead and injured was very high, with
                 many of them young people, which only adds to the tragedy.

I have just been asked to pass on to you the following message
from our Prime Minister:

   "My dear Prime Minister
   The deaths and injuries sustained by soccer fans at the
   Hillsborough Stadium last Saturday have shocked New Zealand.

   We are both sports-loving nations and the sheer magnitude of
   the tragedy is quite benumbing.
   On behalf of all New Zealanders I offer my condolences to
   those who have lost loved ones and friends at Hillsborough.

   Yours sincerely
   David Lange"

    find it hard to believe that such                   a dis ast er could happen.       I
    am afraid very many families have                   lost loved     ones, and many
    of the victims were young.                  I know that your      words of
    sympathy will help                bring comfort     to the families, and     I
    shall ensure that they are informed of them.

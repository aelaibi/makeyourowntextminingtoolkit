               Hillsborough.             I am a Liverpool          supporter.      I went with a group of

               friends to the game.                   A friend obtained a ticket for the game for me.

               I paid £6.00 for the ticket which was for the Leppirtgs Ln standing

               area.

               I travelled to the game with about fourteen other friends.                              Most of

               tho<;\ went        in a friend's van.              I travelled to the game with Mark

               outside Stockport.                  On route to the game        I didn't notice any fans

                We arrived in Sheffield at approximately 2. 15 pm <1415).                 I d o n ’t know

                where we parked but it was about ten to fifteen minutes walk to. the

                ground.       On route to the ground I saw.police officers scattered along

                the roads.          They didn't escort or direct us anywhere.          We could

                actually see the ground and just followed the crowd down.                  The    police

                officers      I saw along the roads were not       really concerned with

                directing or escorting us.            It was quite normal,     they were spread

                around at junctions and outside shops.             No fans were      causing trouble

                of any sort.          Everyone was   in good spirits.

                The five of us in the''ts^r arrived down at the entrance to the ground

 ^
     o    ■f'
          J— •at sometime after half^past            two   (1430).There W^re no queues,      it      was

      ^         just a mass of people all^'tai 11 i ng about.         I could see the turnstiles           I

                wanted to get in to so I tried going down the right hand side of all

                the people with the river to my right.             Due to all the pushing and

                shoving      I eventually came around to a large wrought            iron gate.     This

                gate,    I think, was one of the main perimeter gates and you could see

                the turnstiles about twenty feet away.

                Due to later events         I can't really say how l"\(ot into        the ground.        All
O f r e
                I
                i can say is that
                             tnai I

                                           go Nirouc   a turnstile,              I went through with

                a crowd of people and ended up i nn\V> courtyard behind the stand.                  At
 I
                this time         I ’d still got my match ticket   intact.    All    I can remember

                about outside the ground is seeing one mounted police officer trying

                to sort the crowd out.          Everything was so hectic.

                Once inside the courtyard everyone seemed to head towards the tunnel

                I knew the layoutN^f the ground and if I ’d have wanted to I c o u l d ’ve

                gone to either side o*R the ground.

                Once I entered the tunned it was crowded and I c o u l d n ’t have turned

                back if I ’d have wanted to.

                When I got out of the tunnel,           in the terraces,     I went to the   left
                                                                                  PAGE     3

intending to take up a position i/rN{jen four.             At the end of the tunnel

I was    carried into the pen by'the crowd coming from behind in the

tWjrtel.    The passage along the tunnel, although crowded, was                 clear

can't\emember       if there were any police or stewards about,               from then

on everything seemed to happen so fast.

Initially as we entered the terraces we were              carried along but       I was

then able to stop, get my bearings and chose where                  I wanted to stand.

It was very packed,        especially by the tunnel, as        people were      coming

out.

By this time I was only with                          all the rest      in the car I'd

lost    in the crowd.     The people        in the van had made their own way to

the ground and I hadn't see them at all.

There was no trouble        in the terraces.       People were just trying to get

good viewing points.         It was    crowded in the terraces but it was

nothing out of the ordinary for that sort of game.                  We made our way

down to the front of the terraces to try and find a less crowded area,

I don't remember seeing anyone drirtkiftg, you weren't allowed to drink

in the ground anyway.

We ended up towards the front of the terraces              in position directly

behind the goal      in an area on your grid of ab m t t L 7 .         I stood with

        with a barrier right       in front of me.     This was the first barrier

from the fence as you walk up the terraces.               I was not aware of any

barXier breaking      in the pen next to us.          I can't really say what time

I t o o k \ 4P my match viewing     position,    I would say it was roughly about

five to tHVee     (1455).      0.0.                        ^£-/s/    ^-J-

A couple of minutes after          I'd been stood by the barrier,           I started

being    crushed from behind up against the barrier.                This has happened

to me before at football matches and normally the pressure gets

relieved.     When this h a p p e n e d ,      |, I think, was stood slightly

behind me.     We were just having a laugh and a joke.                I wasn't worried

          about being crushed up against the barrier.

          Gradually,      however,     the pressure against me on the barrier started to

          get worse.         I then realised something was wrong.        I was stuck against

          the barrier at waist height.

          As the pressure got worse,          it started to effect my breathing.        By this

          stage there was a lot of shouting and screaming              in the terraces.       I

          heard shouting that someone was dyin^.             A lot of people,   including
ovr
          myself,    began to panic.        I remember see frig a policeman, maybe with a
P(5uO£-
AT        steward,      by the front gate at\{ie feVice.         He opened the gate and I

          think he let sonuh^ne out but the gate was then shut

          Also,    pebsple    were   cl'^rnbing over the fence onto the pitch to get out of

          the crush.         1 wondered why the policeman had shut the gate when people

          needed and wanted to get out.

          By this time I was struggling to get off the barrier.               All   I know is

          that I tried getting over and also going under the barrier.

          Everything from here on gets very confused.

          I remember as I was trying to get under the barrier,             when it got to my

          chest height,        I realised there was no lee-way for me to duck under               it.

          If it had got to my neck I knew I would be killed.               I forced my way

  _       back up and stood virtually bent over the barrier.               I was aware that

                  had climbed over and had disappeared towards the front of the

          crowd.     TKg pressure       contitxjed to get worse and really started to

           effect my breathing badly.          I recall   pulling someone's hair,    biting

          the M o k e    next to me on the shoulder,      all this was done in a blind
                  V ~ ----------------
          panic by this time.

                              I was fighting for my life.
                                                                      ---
                                                          I was shouting and

          to me shoutlMKia at me that        I was alright and shotting at other       people

          to get me out.         F^dkHf^t know how but I eventual ly \nded up on the

          floor on two occasions.

          By now I must have been in front of the barrier.              There was    people

                                                                                         S1536

           kicking and treading on nie.          There were people underneath me.        Someone

           dragged me up fay the faac1\of my collar.          Although he was trying to

           help me,     he effected my farearfcn.ng again.        I thought   I was dying.     All

              know is then that       I was    lying on my back    in the nets looking up at

           the 75ky.     What exactly happened in the terraces I can't remember.                   I

           d i d n ’t witness anyone dying.       All   I can say is that the people     lying

           underneath me must have been in a bad state or dead.                The pressure on

           me against the barrier seemed to gradually get worse,                it wasn't a

           sudden surge.

           When I was     lying in the net my friend,              , came to me and assisted

           with getting me back onto my feet.            From there on I was      in a very

           confused and weak state.           I was more concerned with finding my

           brother.      He eventually came down out the stand onto the pitch.                We

           ended up by the Nottingha m Forrest end, watching the mayhem on the

           pitch.      People wre dying with others       ripping their shirts open and

           trying to revive them.

           I had to get away from this and got my brother to take me into the

           North Stand to join the ot'her friends.           We eventually all moved down

           onto fh* pitch where       I collapsed and got     carried into the sports hall

           by my friends.      Here   I was^tV^ided to,^| ^ ^ ~                               F rom

           there                                                               with my

           brother accompanying me.           I didn'-^ see anything which I would consider

           to be a criminal     offence.

C/YT       All   I can say about how theNi ncident was handled was that the police

           and stewards were ve^y^s 1ow to iSealise that was happening.               They
coMM^fiS
           were stood watching people dying doing n o t h i n g .        I knew there were

           stewards on the pitch as I saw some of them wering the floursecent

           bi b s .

           I would like to acfrL '
                                 that         I atXended last year's game at the same
CAT
           ground.      It was far more organised outside,         police officers were

           checking your tickets.           There were actual         queues to the turnstiles

           whereas,    this year,    there was not.          There was the same sort of crowd

           this year as last year.           I'm sure that      if it was organised this year

           in the same way as       last year the crush would not have happened and

           people would not have been killed.

           As a result of being crushed

           I would further    like to add that knowing of the               large crowd still

          waiting to get in the game should have been delayed.                    There was an

           obvious    communication problem.         People who were on the touchline           could

           see the terraces were       packed and knowing that there was a large crowd

           still to corne in effort should've been made for either a policeman or                           |

           steward to block the tunnel          to tell      people   it was too full and direct

           them to other parts of the terraces.

                             By T H E C O R O N E R :

C o u l d you just g i v e yo ur names, p le as e? - A. I am Jo hn
R i c h a r d Sh ortland.           I am a Sen io r L e c t u r e r at the
U n i v e r s i t y and C o n s u l t a n t H i s t o p a t h o l o g i s t .

Dr. S h o r t l a n d if you w o u l d d e s c r i b e to me h o w you came
to k n o w the i d en ti ty ? - A. Yes.              In fact the b o d y of
this p a t i e n t was i d e n t i f i e d to me by p o l i c e of fi c e r s
wh o w e r e in the m o r t u a r y at the time, w h o s e na mes I do
not know, and m o r t u a r y at ten dan ts.            Ad di t i o n a l l y ,
there w e r e m ar ks on the b o d y w h i c h in d i c a t e d not only
his na m e but the s e q u e n t i a l bo d y number, w h i c h in this
cas e was bo d y n u m b e r 1.

N o w can you tell me wh a t you found? - A. Yes, indeed.
T h e r e was e v i d e n c e of sev ere c o n g e s t i o n of the face and
u pp er part of the body, to ge the r w i t h tiny little
h e m o r r h a g e s w h i c h we a s s o c i a t e w i t h an a s p h y x i a l death.
In a d d i t i o n to that there we re sma ll h e m o r r h a g e s
inside, in the i n t e r n a l organs, and p a r t i c u l a r l y this
was p r e s e n t in the b r a i n and it was a s s o c i a t e d w i t h
s w e l l i n g of the brain, a not u n c o m m o n feature.

T h e r e we r e r e a l l y no o th er s i g n i f i c a n t injuries, just
m i n o r b r u i s i n g of the lower limbs and I r e c o r d e d a
d e a t h of t r a u m a t i c asphyxia.

A b s o l u t e l y no n a t u r a l di se as e?   - A. Th a t      is a b s o l u t e l y
right, sir, yes.

W o u l d you go a l o n g w i t h wha t Dr. C l a r k sa i d that loss
of c o n s c i o u s n e s s is fa irl y ra pi d in a tra um at ic
a s p h y x i a l si tu a t i o n ? - A. Th a t is correct, sir.           All
the rep or ts that h a v e be e n w r i t t e n a bo ut tra um at ic
a s p h y x i a i n d i c a t e that loss of c o n s c i o u s n e s s is a very
r a p i d fea tu re in the d e v e l o p m e n t of the injury.

T h e sign ifi ca nc e, of course, is that you do not k n o w
wh a t is h a p p e n i n g a f t e r that? - A. T h e level of
d i s t r e s s and p a i n is reduced.
                   C r o s s - E x a m i n e d by MR.   FRASER:

I h o p e you w o u l d agree, Dr. Sh ort lan d, that in a
y o u n g e r man, that loss of c o n s c i o u s n e s s m i g h t in fact
be s l i g h t l y q u i c k e r than it mi gh t be in an ol der p e r s o n
si m p l y b e c a u s e of his p h y s i c a l size? - A. Yes, that is
right.         He b e i n g i m m a t u r e w o u l d p r e s u m a b l y be mor e
ea s i l y compre ss ed .

        T H E CORONER:            Dr.   Sh ort lan d,     tha nk you very much.

PC G r a h a m B u t l e r found T o m m y on the pitch.                The

Can I just stop you there for a m i n u t e ?                           Is it 3.50 or
3.55?           G E N . 18 says 3.55 and that is in fact wh at we
h a v e put on the front sheet as well. - A. Dr. Bu ll in
his s t a t e m e n t goes on ab ou t sev er al p e o p l e in w h o m he

I h a v e got a f e e l i n g I did not see it in the O f f i c e r ' s

th ro u g h it, the timing, but let's pr es s on.                                 I think
that G E N . 18 is li k e l y to be c o r r e c t b e c a u s e it wi l l

Sir, a l t h o u g h no ti ck et was found on eit her T o m m y or

Yes.          The same evide nce , of course, app li es                     to h i m
e n t e r i n g t h r o u g h ga t e C? - A. Yes, sir.

O n e o th er point.         It is r e a l l y jus t to as k you w h e t h e r
I am r i g h t in sa y i n g that the e v i d e n c e of Ian B o i l e a u

It may we l l be...        My re a d i n g of his e v i d e n c e is that
it is just p o s s i b l e that he was i n v o l v e d w i t h so me b o d y
else? - A. Yes, sir.

T h a t is no c r i t i c i s m of h i m b e c a u s e we can i m ag in e wha t

in s e v e r a l cases.          B e f o r e I go on, I ou ght to e x p l a i n
to you about G E N . 18.               Th a t is a s t a n d a r d form w h i c h is

it rec or ds names and it has got spa ces for w h e n p e o p l e

Th i s p a r t i c u l a r one in fact on the front of it does not
eve n h a v e a name, bu t it does have...                       Th e one thing
that was w r i t t e n on to it was the time w h e n Dr. Bul l

                              By T H E C O R O N E R :

          T H E WITNE SS:      Sir, I am M i c h a e l Layton,               Detective
I n s p e c t o r of the W e s t Mi dl a n d s Police.

Yes, Of fi ce r? - A. An e x a m i n a t i o n of vi su a l ev id e n c e

on a p h o t o g r a p h r e f e r e n c e d M W L . 1 5 / 7 A T o m m y and his
fa the r are shown o u t s i d e gat e C and that p h o t o g r a p h is
timed at 1451.             In fact they are st an d i n g next to eac h
other.

This in fact is the same p h o t o g r a p h that we sa w in the
cas e of Dad? - A. T h a t is right.                  Sir, that
i d e n t i f i c a t i o n has b e e n co nfi rme d, as you ha v e a l r e a d y
heard, by Mrs. H o w a r d and due to their p o s i t i o n and
ti mi ng it can be r e a s o n a b l y a s s u m e d that they did in
fact enter via g a t e C, w i t h the m a i n o p e n i n g b e i n g at
1452.

D a v i d L a c k e y has i d e n t i f i e d h i m s e l f and Th o m a s H o w a r d
s e n i o r on a p h o t o g r a p h PR.1/1 3A, w h i c h is timed at 1503
and shows e n c l o s u r e n u m b e r 3.

A n u m b e r of o t h e r p h o t o g r a p h s sho w the p o s i t i o n of Mr.
H o w a r d se n i o r in the e n c l o s u r e but they do n' t a c t u a l l y
sh o w Tommy.         As we h a v e h e a r d b e f o r e in a p r e v i o u s
case, sir, that is not u n u s u a l h a v i n g re ga r d to the
h e i g h t of the p e r s o n and the fact they we r e on
terraces.

PC F e n w i c k has si g n e d a pl a n of the terr ace s i n d i c a t i n g
the p o i n t at w h i c h h e found T o m m y and this in fact
a c c o r d s w i t h the p o s i t i o n at w h i c h Mr. H o w a r d sen io r
was in fact seen.               Sir, the r e f e r e n c e for that p l a n is
MRF.2.

PC B u t l e r and Ian B o i l e a u are sh own c a r r y i n g Th om a s
ac r o s s the p i t c h on a p h o t o g r a p h r e f e r e n c e d P R . 6 / 1 A and
that p h o t o gr ap h, sir, if you wi l l gi v e me a moment ...
I t h i n k that is p r o b a b l y a typing error.                  It sho uld
re a d 1532 as o p p o s e d to 1536 on the summary.

B e f o r e you turn to the plans, just one small point,
w h e n we say that T o m m y and his Dad are o u t s i d e the
g r o u n d and they are together, they are a c t u a l l y cl ose
to e a c h other.      I don t th ink they are st ri ct ly next
to ea c h other? - A. If you co ul d g i v e me a moment, sir.
I w o u l d say at m o s t there is one p e r s o n b e t w e e n them,
as it were.         In fact, loo ki ng at it that one p e r s o n
b e t w e e n them was p r o b a b l y on the o th er side of the
ba rrier.

I see.     - A.    I mean,     we are      talk ing    feet,     really.

I w a s n ' t s u g g e s t i n g they w e r e mil es apart.         I just
q u i c k l y g l a n c e d at it and I thou ght there was so me b o d y
there, but you t hi nk they are on the oth er side of the
ba rr i e r ? - A. T h a t ' s right.          Sir, can I re fer you to a
pl a n w h i c h has b e e n g i v e n the r e f e r e n c e nu mb e r
MW J L . 1 5 9 ?

T h a t wil l be C.160.        - A. An d a p l a n of         the pitch,       sir,
M W J L .2.

T h a t w il l be C.161.       - A. Do you wa n t PC F e n w i c k ' s         plan,
sir?
W h a t was the first .. .?   I think I was l o ok in g at the
w r o n g plan.  T h e first one was w ha t? - A. MWJ L. 15 9,
sir.

T h e ne x t one?    - A.    If we can        ign ore MW J L . 2   for a
second, sir.

I think M W J L . 1 6 0 is the next one in order. - A. Yes, I
h a v e got a copy of MW J L .1 60 , sir.  T h a t is a pl a n of
the terraces.

T h a t sh ou ld be C.161.        M W J L . 1 6 0 is C.161. T h e n the
ne x t one is Mr. F e n w i c k ' s ? - A. T h a t is right, sir,
MRF.2.

T h a t w il l be C.162.       - A. T h e n    I th ink we go to MWJL.2.

T h a t w i l l be C.163. - A. Again, sir, if we can r e f e r to
MW JL . 1 5 9, that is a pl a n o u t s i d e the ground.                    Tha t
re fe r s to the p h o t o g r a p h i d e n t i f i c a t i o n ou t s i d e by gate
C and that was in this lo ca t i o n h e r e .

T h a t is in fact i d e n t i c a l to Dad? - A. Yes, that is
right.           It is the same ph ot og ra ph .               Then, sir, in
r e s p e c t of M W J L . 1 6 0 , w h i c h is a pl a n of the terraces,
that p h o t o g r a p h i c i d e n t i f i c a t i o n is ma d e on the ba sis
of sh ow i n g Mr. H o w a r d s e ni or' s lo ca t i o n in fact w h e r e
we b e l i e v e T o m m y was.          As I h a v e a lr ea dy i n d i c a t e d he
is in this p o s i t i o n h e r e in e n c l o s u r e n u m b e r 3.           Sir,
MR F.2 , PC F e n w i c k ' s plan, i n d ic at es a p o s i t i o n a g a i n in
e n c l o s u r e n u m b e r 3 and it is in this p o s i t i o n h e r e .

It is al mo st the same, just a li tt le bit d i s p l a c e d ? -
A. Th a t is right, sir.           Th e n if we can go to the p i t c h
plan, sir, there is a p h o t o g r a p h i d e n t i f i c a t i o n on the
pitch.          T h a t is in this lo ca ti on here, so it is
a c t u a l l y towards the Spion Ko p end of the pitch.                 Tha t
is the p h o t o g r a p h timed at 1532.

I h a v e n o t i c e d in fact yo u said Mr.             B o i l e a u is
i d e n t i f i e d on that p h o t o g r a p h w i t h Tom my? - A. He      is,
sir.          It is a long d i s t a n c e p h o t o g r a p h but I am
s a t i s f i e d it does sho w Tommy.

An d Mr. Boil eau ? - A. He is s a t i s f i e d that he is shown
on that p h o t o gr ap h , as, indeed, I th ink is the of f i c e r
that is also shown on it.

In ot he r words, w h e n I said there was a little bi t of
d o u b t in his s t a t e m e n t I p r o b a b l y was m i s t a k e n if the
p h o t o g r a p h i c e v i d e n c e is accurate, that he mu s t h a v e
b e e n a ss oc i at e d . .. - A. I th ink it is fair to say he
c e r t a i n l y may h a v e be e n c o n f u s e d as to the events, or
the se qu e n c e of events, but I thi nk it is als o fair to
                        say that the p h o t o g r a p h i d e n t i f i c a t i o n ,   certainly   I am
                        s a t i s f i e d it is ac curate.

                                 MR.   FRASER:         I h a v e no que st io ns ,       sir.

                                 MR.   LIMB:       No,   thank you,        sir.

                    B           MR. FRASER:            Sir, b e f o r e you c o n c l u d e a g a i n I

                                  T H E CORONER:     T h a n k you ver y m u c h indeed.            It is
                    C   very, very ki n d of all of you to be ab le to say that

                        it.         It is very, ve r y kind of you.

                                  As I try and do in every case, I try and rem in d
                        m y s e l f and r e m i n d e v e r y b o d y else that we are d e a l i n g

                                I want to say, as is o b vi ou s from wh a t has be en

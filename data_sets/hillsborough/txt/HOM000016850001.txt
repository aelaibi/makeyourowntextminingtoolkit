Dear Mr Raffan


You wrote to Mr Moynihan on 28 April 1989
enclosing one from Mrs          about the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss Bannister,
in her letter of 18 May 1989, mentioned that
your letter and your constituent's had been
forwarded to me as the Secretary to the
Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylor who has noted it.

                                Yours sincerely


                                I(_

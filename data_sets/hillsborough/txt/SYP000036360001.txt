The R t , Hon. C. Moynlhan M#P.
Minister for Sport,

LONDON,

Bear Kr. Moynihan,
                     I am writing to you because I might have
something that is relevant to your enquiry into Saturday 1 a
disaster at Sheffield.
                     I have watched football and rugby from the
terraces on & off for 57 years,         I was, for instance* at the
famous Bif-baas v 411 B l a c k 's game at Cardiff where people were
getting past the turnstiles merely by saying they had. *lostf
their ticket* making the official attendance figures nonsense#

                                                   ,
I was possibly the sole Englishm n at the last non all-ticket
match at Murryfield between Scotland and W a l e s one of a 120,000
crowd(estimated)•     I stood wl ,h my . rme piuned down my sides,
unable to wipe my nose, when ieadiag played Manchester City
(Bell, Lee <fc Co.) and stood it Stamford Bridge when Chelsea
played Manchester United (Best, Charlton, Law & Co.) Although
I go to 'ighbury when I watch 7. game now, I ha/e stood at almost
all the London uoccer grounds from West Ham to Brentford m & stood
at rugby internationals at ^ w i c k e n h m , Mu r:r,%yfield, nd Cardiff
Arms i’ark, s oeeer interactional*- ?at llembipjw                         .
                     In Mareh, 197® I was in the Kop, Liverpool,
to watch their match against a fgench club," This was the one
time in all my experience that I felt scared, scared witless*
As the push forward came from the back I felt a y feet come off the
ground and I was swept forward with whet seemed impossible to
stand pressure on my rib-cage*       It is important to say loud and
clear that these surges are no acoident - they are caused deliberately
and they are meant to hurt,       I hope you are ri^ht in being so
quick to exonerate the Liverpool fans* to many old terrace devotees
up and down the country the fact that the same supporters were
concerned with the disaster at Heysel and at Sheffield will not
be seen as a coincidence.

                                       T o n ya timlv.

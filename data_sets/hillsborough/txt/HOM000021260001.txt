FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:     SAFETY ISSUES - APPEALS

Miss Bannister's note of 10 October refers.

2.   I think we can anticipate the views of the Minister for
Sport on the question of appeals raised in my submission of
6 October.   DoE officials advise that a response from their
Minister is still awaited but they do not anticipate that his
view will be different from that already expressed by them. What
we cannot judge is the strength of his views or the extent to
which he might be influenced by those of Home Office Ministers
on the nature of appeals against requirements of the Football
Licensing Authority.

3.   There is now only a day or two available to draw up
amendments for Report Stage of the Bill which must be amended
to provide certainty to what is at present an unclear position.
It would be helpful if the Home Secretary (or Mr Lloyd) would
write to Mr Moynihan to draw out the fact that appeal rights are
not a new issue and that it was always intended that such rights
should be built into the system now created. This was made clear
in the Home Secretary's letter dated 21 June (attached) accepting
the compromise formula whereby the Football Licensing Authority
(FLA) would take on certain safety functions.    The question now
is not whether there should be appeals, but whether they should
be through the existing procedure or confined to the exercise of
judicial review (which is expensive and would be concerned not
with merit but only the reasonableness of decisions).

4.   In view of the urgency   of the matter it would be helpful if
the Home Secretary (or Mr      Lloyd) would write to Mr Moynihan
explaining that we concede    that the local authority should not
have a specific avenue of      appeal, but do not feel that the
judicial review avenue is     an appropriate replacement for the
existing avenues of appeal    available to those who are affected
by safety certificates.
5.   Unless therefore the Home Secretary is minded to concede to
DoE's wishes in this respect he (or Mr Lloyd) is invited to write
as drafted within.

                   LETTER DRAFTED FOR SIGNATURE BY ..Secretary of State...
                                                       (NAME OF SIGNATORY)


                  As you know officials of our two Departments have been
                  discussing but have been unable to reach agreement on the
                   question of appeal rights against terms and conditions in
                   safety certificates where these arise from a requirement
                   of the Football Licensing Authority                (FLA), a subject on
                  which the Football Spectators Bill is at present unclear.


                   I    realise     this   is   a    difficult     area   and    I   shall      not
                   rehearse the       arguments with which,           I am sure,          you are
                   already well aware.              I do wish to make the point though
                  that     appeal     rights     were    always     considered       to    be    an
                   integral part of the arrangements which would be worked
                   up     between    our   two       Departments    on    the    relationship
                   between the FLA and the local authorities responsible for
                   safety certification.             I referred in my letter of 21 June
                   to the need for bridges to be built and for appeal where
                   there    is conflict.         Admittedly all       this was       at a time
                   when the relationship between the new authority and local
                   authorities was still to be fully settled.
We are not proposing that an appeal right should exist
for the    local    authority against an FLA decision.                       The
absence of a specific right or avenue of appeal in these
circumstances would not prevent a challenge against the
reasonableness          of    the    Football       Licensing     Authority's
requirements       by    way        of   an    application      for    judicial
review.


What we are more concerned with is the possible removal
of the avenue of appeal for those who are affected by the
terms    and conditions         of safety certificates,               either to
the magistrates court or to the Crown Court.                       The effect
on them    (including the emergency services)                    is the same
whether the terms and conditions which concern them have
been     imposed     (or       omitted)        by   the   local       authority
themselves or following a requirement of the Authority.


What we seek to do is to amend the Bill to remove any
implications       that the existing appeal rights under the
Safety    of   Sports        Grounds     Act    1975   (the   1975    Act)   are
diminished by the Bill.


I do understand your concerns but I do believe that we
ought not to interfere with the existing rights of appeal
under the      1975 Act.            If our experience         is anything to
judge by, provided the FLA acts reasonably, such appeals
should be      few and        far between and provision to retain
them would not undermine the FLA's authority.


We must resolve this quickly.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

We spoke on the telephone about Lord Justice Taylor's plans to
visit football matches during Part II of his Inquiry, and his
thought that he mig^t visit Chelsea on 30 September to see your
match against Arsenal.

I am very grateful to you for agreeing to this visit.  I will
accompany Lord Justice Taylor, and you suggested that we arrive
at about 12.30 when the briefings start. You kindly agreed to
let us have two car parking passes.

It might be helpful if I gave you an indication of what Lord
Justice Taylor is looking for. The briefings you suggest will be
very helpful. He would then like to see fans arriving, watching
them go through the turnstiles and onto the viewing areas. He
would like to watch some of the match (perhaps the first half)
from the terraces. He would, of course, like to have the
opportunity to meet your Directors and would be happy to receive
hospitality from them if they felt they would like to offer it to
him.

I will be in touch nearer the time to confirm the arrangements,
but please do not hesitate to get in touch in the meantime if any
questions arise.

We look forward to meeting you and your colleagues on 30
September

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


We spoke recently about Lord Justice Taylor's plans to visit
Manchester on 6 and 7 October, and agreed that he might visit the
Salford versus Leigh match on Saturday 7 October. You said that
you and your colleagues would be happy to meet him, and arrange
for him to visit that match.  I am extremely grateful to you and
would like to make this a firm arrangement.

Lord Justice Taylor will be staying in Manchester (Midland Hotel)
on the night of 6 October and will be free to join you at a
convenient time on Saturday.   I will accompany him throughout.
Perhaps you could be kind enough to suggest a programme, with
details of where we should be and when. You also kindly arranged
to give some help with transport, which would be much
appreciated: Lord Justice Taylor will probably be travelling on
to Leeds for Saturday evening.

I look forward to hearing from you.

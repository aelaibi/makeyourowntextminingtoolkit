    1      Matter for Consideration
                                                         Act 1972 as amended.
           To update members on allegations contained in 1 March 1991
           issue of Private Eye touching upon decisions of the Police
           Authority.
           Background
    2.1   At the Authority’s meeting on 30 August 1991 the Clerk and
          Financial Officer reported on the article which is appendix
           L- u j  ?ember was Provided with a copy of counsel opinion
          which deals with the prospects of taking legal action against
          Private Eye for defamation; this opinion is also attached as
          appendix 2.
 2.2      The Authority at that meeting resolved that the Clerk and
          Financial Officer should approach the Editor of Private Eye
          demanding a withdrawal of the statements referred to and then
          report back to the Authority on the result. Correspondence
          with Private Eye and also their solicitors is attached as
          appendix 3.
2.3       At the meeting in August there was disagreement between
          members on the value of pursuing an action through the courts
          against Private Eye. Counsel’s opinion was that the article
          is capable of being helped to be defamatory of the Authority
          in the conduct and management of its affairs. However, his
          advice which was and still is reiterated by the Solicitor to
          the Authority, was that practical considerations should be
          borne in mind not least of which is the careful consideration
          of the question whether any useful purpose would be served by
          reiterating the allegations to a wider audience, such as
          would happen in the event of a trial, and whether the costs
          would justify the benefit to the public of doing so.
2.4       In their consideration members would wish to know that the
          last circulation figures for Private Eye which are for 1990
          show a circulation per issue of just over 200,000. Given
          that the population of South Yorkshire represents about 2% of
          the country this would lead one to believe that at most there
          were 4,000 copies of the offending article published in this
          area.
3         Recommendation

          Members are asked to consider this report and resolve what, I ,h fV/i
          if any, further action is to be taken against Private Eye. / W ' t L

       S   o u t h        Y   o r k s h i r e

    A STR ANGE contretemps is threatening the
  cosy relationship between Inspector Knacker of
  South Yorkshire and the gruff, ferret-eating
  Labour councillors who nominally run the
  county police authority.
       After years o f peaceful co-existence, police
 committee councillors nearly sparked a mutiny
 among the ranks with its sudden and remarkable
 decision no! to pay Knacker's legal bills at the
 coroner's inquiry into police antics at the
 Hillsborough football disaster in 1988.
      Knacker, understandably, was dum b struck —
 but help was at hand. After the police authority
 meeting had finished, a few discreet but very
 meaningful telephone calls were made lo key hacks
 in the national press. Within days, some of Fleet
 Street's grubbier local reps were asking extremely
 embarrassing questions around South Yorkshire
 about an alleged vice ring involving local
 councillors and other murky municipal
 misdemeanours concerning prominent town hall
 officials.
     Naturally, Yorkshire’s finest are keeping
tightlipped about who tipped off the press or whether
indeed the allegations contain a single grain o f truth.
Yet, remarkably, within weeks an amazing change
had overcome the county police committee. It
revoked its previous decision and decided to pay up
K nacker’s legal costs after ail. claiming fresh
information had come to light which had causes a
complete vohefacel
                                                                                   APPENDIX 2




                                                 OPINION




        In       the    issue       of    Private       Eye    for    1st      March     1991     there
appeared          a    short       piece        concerning         the    decision           of   South
Yorkshire             Police       Auth or it y       first     to    refuse       and       later      to
agree       to     pay       the    costs       of     police      officers       attending          the
inquest        into      the Hillsborough disaster.                         The    review of         the
earlier decision came about after advice was taken as to the
relevant          factors          to    be     taken       into     account.          The    article
makes a number of separate allegations:

        (1)       After        the police            authority meeting had finished
        a     few      discreet          but    very     meaningful         telephone         calls
        were made to key hacks in the national press;

        (2)       Within          days,        some    of     Fleet      Street's        grubbier
        local           reps        were        asking         extremely          embarrassing
        questions around South Yorkshire about:

        (3)       an     alleged         vice     ring       involving       local       council­
        lors ;

        (4)       other       murky       municipal          misdemeanours          concerning
     prominent town hall officials;

        (5)       Y o r k s h i r e ’s    finest        are     keeping         tight        lipped
     about             who     tipped          off     the     press      or      whether         the
     allegations contain a single grain of truth.

     (6)          Remarkably,            within        weeks    an    amazing      change         had
     overcome             the      County       Police        Committee...         decided         to
     pay up... claiming fresh evidence had come to light.

     A       number          of    people        are     possibly        affected        by       these
various statements.
 (a)     There       is    an        innuendo        that       the       Police        Force      itself
 tipped off the press, which is taken up by the author of the
 brochure          from     the        Barnsley       Party,          who        accuses        them ,of
blackmail.              It would        be defamatory                of    the    Police      Force    to
 say    that       it    had     engaged        in    such       a    practice          to    secure    a
 change of the Police Authority's decision.

 (b)    the Police Authority is defamed by the allegation                                           that
its     later        decision           was     affected             by    extraneous           matters
concerning              individual           councillors             and     officials.               The
innuendo here is that it acted corruptly in seeking to cover
up     the     misdeeds           of        councillors          and       officials,           without
reference to the merits of the case.

(c)     local       councillors,             who     are    alleged         to     participate         in
some vice ring;

(d)     municipal          officials          who    have       been       concerned          in   murky
municipal misdemeanours.

        As    to    those       in     class       (c),    the       councillors,            and   class
(d) the officials,                I do not believe that these instructions
can relate to their possible claims.                                 They are being accused
of immoral          or illegal          acts,       but    these affect                them in their
private        capacity.                The allegations               do         not     affect       the
administration or management of the Police Authority,                                              or of
local        councils,         but      the private         conduct              of     councillors.
This distinction is clearly drawn in the case of Derbyshire
County Council v Times Newspapers, The Times 8th April 1991.
I should,          however,       add       that the classes of persons affected
by     the     allegations             of     immoral       and        illegal          conduct      are
probably       too wide         to give any one                 individual             Councillor      or
Official       a    cause      of       action.           The    general rule           is   that     the
libel        must        refer          to    the     Plaintiff              with         sufficient
particularity for him to be identified in the eyes of those
who know him, if he is not actually named.                                       However,       this is
a     matter        on        which             individual              councillors          and            officials
should take private advice if they think it worthwhile.

        To       allege              that       a     police           force     has     engaged              in        the
underhand           distribution                      of        allegations           such        as        these        to
secure        a change of mind by                            the police authority,                      or out           of
revenge,           is       capable         of being held to be defamatory.                                        I see
no     reason       why          a    police          force        should       not    sue        for       libel        as
much as any other body.                                There is room for argument whether
the article points to the police force as the instigator of
the    telephone              calls,            since       it is        far from        explicit,               so the
issue       is     likely            to be whether                 the    innuendo        suggested                above
is the right one.


        In the case of any contemplated action by the Force, as
distinct            from              the           Police             Authority,         the               following
observations                should          be       borne        in    mind.         First,           if    in     fact
police       officers                did make             such     telephone          calls,       the        defence
of justification could succeed.                                        Secondly, no damage appears
to     have         been             sustained.                   Although         damage              is     not         a
prerequisite of an action for libel,                                           it is usually pointless
to bring such an action without it.                                            The tendency is to rake
up     and       magnify             what        was        merely        a     malicious              item        in    a
scurrilous              paper,             of    wh i c h        few     people        would       have            taken
notice        at    the          time       and       which        would        otherwise              be    readily
forgotten.                  Thirdly,             it        is    by     no     means     clear              that     the
article       accuses                the    Police          of making           these     calls,             and    the
fact    that        a fringe               candidate             in the        local    election             thought
it    did     does          not       prove          it     to    be     so.      This       question              is    a
matter       for        a    jury          in    a    libel        action,       and     consequently                   no
clear prediction can be made as to the result.

        The        allegation               against              the    Police        Authority             is     more
clearly made out.                       It goes to the way in which it conducted
its    business             on       the    occasion              in    question,        and       accordingly
satisfies           the          test       in        the        Derbyshire        case.               The       whole
article       is' an          attack            on        the     Authority        and       is    capable              of
being held           to be defamatory.                      The only likely defence                      to a
claim by the Authority is justification,                                        namely that it was
substantially             true.            Whether            these        events          occurred       and
affected           the     judgments              of        individual              members        of     the
Authority is not known,                      but clearly consideration has to be
given     to    that      aspect        of       the    matter        before         proceedings          are
brought.

        As     was       pointed           out         in     the        Derbyshire          case,        the
Authority has            to take into account section 222 of the Local
Government         Act     1972,      before           instituting proceedings.                          They
should be          satisfied       that       it is          'expedient for the promotion
or    protection          of    the     interest             of    the     inhabitants           of     their
area'.       This means that the Authority's own wounded feelings
would     not        itself      be     sufficient                reason        to     start     a      libel
action.            The     costs        of       such        proceedings,              which       can       be
substantial,          must be set against                         the benefit to be achieved
for    the     inhabitants            of     South Yorkshire.                       The    observations
made    above        concerning            the    Police          Force        on    the    question         of
damage are equally relevant here.

        Since        libel      actions          are        tried     by       jury,       the   eventual
result cannot be predicted with any certainty.                                              What can be
said is        that      the article             in question plainly                      refers      to the
South Yorkshire                Police       Authority,              and    is       capable      of     being
held to be defamatory                   of it in the conduct and                            the m a n a g e ­
ment    of     its    affairs.             From        a legal point                of view      there       is
therefore a case.                However,              practical considerations                       should
be borne        in mind,         as    set       out        above,       not    least       of which         is
the careful consideration of the question whether any useful
purpose would be served by reiterating                                     the allegations               to a
wider     audience,            such     as       would        happen        in       the    event       of    a
trial,       and     whether      the        costs          would    justify          the    benefit         to
the public of doing so.

Dear   Sir
PRIVATE EYE ARTICLE 1 MARCH 1991

In th?!',PrivatL i ssue no 762 dated 1 March 1991 an article appeared on
page 11 under the heading "South Yorkshire". This article concerned a
decision of the Police Authority and the terms of it were such that the
Authority decided to take a legal opinion from Counsel on the contents. The
Police Authority at its meeting on Friday 30 August 1991 considered that
opinion.

The Police Authority believes that the article is defamatory by the
           that its later decision to pay Police Officers’ legal costs at
the Hillsborough inquests was affected by extraneous matters concerninq
individual Councillors and Officials. The innuendo is that the Authority
28*. .c°rruPj]y in seeking to cover up the misdeeds of Councillors and
Officials without reference to the merits of the case.
Thecal legation goes to the way in which the Authority conducted its business
on the occasion in question and is defamatory of the Authority in the
conduct and management of its affairs.
The Authority has asked me to write to you to demand a full and public
apology.                                               H       '

Dear Sir

Re:               Private Eve Article 1 March 1991

We act on behalf of the publishers of Private Eye and have been
passed your letter to the Editor dated 2nd September 1991.

We are looking into your complaint but in the meantime it would
be helpful if you would let us know the reason for the later
decision to which you refer in the second paragraph of your
letter in order that we may consider the matter fully with our
clients.

It would also be helpful if you could let                                                               us know whether you
contend that the article is defamatory of                                                               the South Yorkshire
Police Authority or individual members of                                                               that body. Perhaps
a brief explanation of the composition of                                                               the authority would
assist us.

We look forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully

 Dear Sirs
 RE:   PRIVATE EYE ARTICLE 1 MARCH 1991

 I have received your letter of 9 September 1991.   The information you are
 seeking is as follows.

 At a meeting in November last year the Authority considered applications for
 financial assistance from a number of officers in the South Yorkshire force
 The applications were for assistance in connection with legal representation
 required by those officers at the inquests into the deaths which occurred at
the Hillsborough tragedy. At that time the applications were rejected.
Subsequently the officers sought judicial review of the Authority’s
decision. As a result of the information provided in this process leqal
advice was taken by the Authority and this resulted in a further meeting in
December at which the applications were considered ab initio. Further leqal
advice was presented to the Authority particularly with regard to the
appropriate presumption to be drawn from a Home Office Circular to Police
Authorities providing guidance on the kind of applications which were being
made by the officers. The legal advice went on to discuss the circumstances
in which this presumption could be rebutted and in consequence the Authority
resolved at that meeting to provide financial assistance.
The contention is that the article is defamatory of the Police Authority not
individual members, I refer you again to my letter of 2 September 1991 which
quite clearly states that the allegation in the Private Eye Article goes to
the way in which the Authority, not individual Councillors, conducted its
business on the occasion in question and is defamatory of the Authority in
the conduct and management of Its affairs.
The Police Authority was established under the Local Government Act 1985 on
abolition of the former South Yorkshire County Council which was of course
prior to April 1986 the Police Authority for South Yorkshire. The present
Authority is made up of Councillors from the four district Councils of South
Yorkshire together with Magistrates. The level of representation is as
follows:

Messrs Wright Webb Syrett



Sheffield City Council      5   members
Doncaster MBC               3   members
Rotherham MBC               2   members
Barnsley MBC                2   members
Magistrates                 6   members
I look forward to hearing from you further when you have had the opportunity
of looking into the complaint.
Yours faithfully



Stephen Walker
Solicitor to the Authority

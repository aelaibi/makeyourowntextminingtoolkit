       by these       lads that          ticket      touts were        selling      other        tickets       for £30.

outside         the ground.              1 e ve n t u a l l y got           t h r o u g h one of      the    t u rnstiles

then      let me through.                  Once      on the other             side    the    crush had gone and                      I

could see            people       running          into    the    stadium        itself.         I w a i t e d until            I

the    toilet and then went ar o u n d                          the    left     hand side of the West Stand^

and walked along                  the    back       wall    in the West S t a n d terrace and went                              into

some      of the       p e n s , t h ro ug h gates w h i c h were                   open at the back               of     the

game      had star t e d and the                   first    signs       of trouble          I s^w was when                I saw

that where was                  I to help.                 and    I then went           to an exit           gate at the

side      of    pen 6 and a d jo in in g               pen 7 and a s k e d 3 p o licemen                    to     let us

wo u ldn't       let me          through,          but then       they did,          and    I went      over        to my

collar an d         light          c o l oured      cords and t r a i n e r s .             This lad had fair              to

light      brown hair            w hi ch was wet.             He d i d n ’t appear               to be scarred        but I

think      he had a few f r e c k l e s .              I went       over    to    this       kid and noti c e d            that

he was       just    lying       there.         His    face was          reddish an d            I   checked    to see if

he had a pulse.                  I checked his wrist                    for a pulse          but was unable to

feel      anything.      I was then joija^cM^y a p o l i c e m a n                          (who      I later     learned

star t e d      to give     the       lad the      kiss of         life.        1 believe            the   lad had also

been sick          but    I am unable           to say whether             or not       he was alive at               this

stage,       as he was          not    resp o n d i n g   to anything.                The    policeman tried

twice      to give him the kiss                  of    life and he then said to me                         "Come      on

l e t ’s get       him over        to the       fir s t - a i d    room."/We           then carried the               lad       in

our arms and went                into     the     g,ymnasiiftn            the    back       of       the West Stand,

We    placed the          lad down        in the g y m n a s i u m and P €             Eiut1er        checked him over

a ga in    for a pulse and stayed w ith him going                                over his body looking                     for

signs      of    life.      After       a short while,              PC B U T L E R     placed his           black     jacket

over      the boy and said              there was         nothing         else    he    could do.             I said       “He

c a n ’t be dead" and the                 copper       said       "He    is" an d      then          the copper      star t e d

crying.          1 then     put my        h and on the            p o l i c e m a n ’s back and said            "He     c a n ’t

be d e a d , h e ’s too y oung              to die."          I also       then began to               cry.

Bot h            land      I sat at some              tables       in the g y m n a s i u m and w a i t e d there

until      about 4. 3 0 p m        s till    in a state            of shock.           Whilst we were             there,

we    could see a lot of bodies                       being       brought       in.     We       left at about

4 . 3 0 p m and     returned          towards      the     terraces,        and we          later      heard an

announcement             over    the    loudspeaker,              asking    us to stay               in the ground,             so

that      the a mb u l a n c e s      could make          their way.

There were          still       people m i ll in g a r o un d on the                  pitch,         although

            ended up being at the                   back of the queue again,                  almost    back     out    into

            L ep p i n g s Ln.       There were           no stewards at this             point at all.           I had no

            real    problems         finding my           turnstile       but due to all         the    people     there          I

            just    could not get to                it.

            At this       point      one    of the P o l ic e me n told me           that a side gate was                open

            an d being at the              back     of this       queue,    I was able to quite             casually walk

            a r o u n d Xa the       right     hand side next             to the    river and walk          through

            an o \jtsp gate.
C/vr
C-r^re      It wJ4       not a mad         rush to get thro ug h the gate and                    I even had time              to
  c^        go to the       lavatory.             It was        only the    people at the         back of this mass

            of    people who         knew the Police were allowing                    people         in through this

            gate,     so the numbers were                  quite    small    really,       compared to the             numbers

            still     fighting         to get       to the       turnstiles.

            I did not see anyone                  open the gates and             I did not see anyone              close any

            gates.       The     one    I w a l k ed      through was a l re a d y open.             Whilst      I was       in

            the mass       of    people       outside          the turnstile,       I saw a couple          of    lads       climb

            over    the top of the             t urnstiles         but    I think    that was more          to a v o i d the

            crush than a ny thing              else.                                             /

            No-one       took my ticket             off me and       I still       have    t h / complete        ticket

            which     I w ou ld      like to keep.                                        /

            I made my way towards                   the tunnel and w al ke d ithrough it because                        I saw

                     went     through the tunnel            expecting           to be able        to turn       right or     left and

                     go to wherever         I w a nt e d    to go,       but o b vi ou sl y this           is not    possible

                     I w al k ed through the             tunnel at about            one minute          to three     <1459 hrs)

                     and     it was a    cairn c omfortable walk                  through,       not a rush or a tight

                     squeeze.

                     There were        no Police Officers               or stewards at             the m ou th of the           tunnel

                     going     down that        tunnel.

                      I saw no      incidents        of disorder,         d ru nk enness         or the      likes all      the while

                      I was    in   the Ground.

                      I went    into Pen 3 and            i mmediately felt              that     there were       going    to be

                     problems.         It soon became          tight an d I realised that more                       people       had

                      come    in behind me.           It was so tight I cannot                    describe       it fully.         From

      ^              the moment        I got     into Pen 3,          the       crowd pushing         behind me made            it a

                     very tight        crush.        I ended up just              past     the    centre     steps   of the

                     terrace and the            pain from being             crushed from all             sides was unbearable.

                     When     the   crush seemed at          its worst            point,       I became      aware of      a man

                     lying on       the terraces ben eath where                    I was standing. I felt                  him under

about     him.     We    passed him through the             crowd and           X think     the St.       Johns

A m b u l a nc e men took       him away.        X then sat       on the terraces               not    really

able     to take    in what          had happened.        It was n' t        until      I had    left    the

G r o u n d that   I realised          the scale       of the disaster.                At one    point       I was

looking      for   somewhere          to w atch the game from,               ijfL ly    expecting       the game
                                     ^A-f T A ts / W O V           /
to   re-start.          I heard on the l o ud s p e a k e r s tty n .         the game w a s y/bandoned

so   I left the Ground.                I cannot say that          /saw        anything y ! a t         day that

I w o u l d say was a criminal             offence. \       /            „              /

It a p p e a r e d to rne that         the Police and o fficials wj^e                    so slow to          react

to the situation,              it was    the fans who       i ni ti al lu /b eg an to tear              down the

p erimeter       fences,       not    the Police.

The Police also           placed a cordon across                the    pitch;      this was a total

w aste    of manpower,          if they had all          helped to       pull      the fences          then more

people rnay have          got out       quicker.

Noth i n g   se e me d to have         been o rganised and            people,      inch/ung           Police

Officers,        were    standing around.              The Fire Brigade arri ve d and                   it

seemed       to pick up from there.               They seemed          lo k/fow exactly what                 to do.

I u n d e r s t a n d there are        video    cameras at the Ground;                  why were       they not

used to their           full    effect.        If they had been used               properly they would

have     seen Pens 3 and 4 full                up at    1413 hrs and           closed off to other

s u pporters a r r i vi ng       later.

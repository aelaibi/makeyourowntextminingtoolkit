            I am a P o l i c e           Sergeant            in the       South Yorkshire                Police,         at    present

            On Saturday               1 5 th A p r i l ,      1989      ( 1 5 0 48 9 )    I was      on d u t y     in     connection

            with        the F A C u p S e mi            Final      g a me    between Liverpool                  and Nottingham

            My     duties       were      as      officer          in   c ha r g e    of a m o b i l e       pat r ol      in a      personnel

            Our area           of     pa tr o l     was      the   Dee    pear/Oughtibridge                  ar ea,      paying

            particular              attention           to    licensed         premises           and    generally            maintaining

            After        briefing,           at     approximately              11a m      (1100)        we   took     up      our    patrol

            a rea.        At    t h is     time      I noticed            that       there were          numerous          people waiting

            about        outside         licensed            premises,         many       of    them wearing             Liverpool

            checks        were        made     of    licensed           premises,          and      several       m i ni      buses     and

            v an s      containing           Liverpool             supporters            were     stopped and            checked.          Four

                people were           reported          under       the S p o r t i n g        Events        (Control         of

Checks         at     public:      houses           showed       that       some       had    few       customers,              whereas

others,          in      particular            the    Silver          Fox,    Manchester               Road,           Stocksbridge

and    the B l u e         Ball,        Wharncliffe              S i d e,    were       heavily             patronised           by

Liverpool             supporters.               Both       these       public          houses          in    particular              were

very     full         from       midday        onwards       and       it w a s        obvious          t ha t     a    lot     of

alcohol          was      being     consumed.               Conduct          of    people          throughout             this        period

was    good         humoured        and        there       were       no    public          order       incidents.

The    area         for    which        I was        responsible             is    s om e     2 0 — 30 minutes                 drive    f ro m

the    football            ground        under        normal          traffic          conditions.                 In the

exceptional               circumstances               on th e         day    had       I been attending                    the       game    I

would       h a ve       allowed myself               at    least          an hour          to m a k e       my w a y      to    the

vicinity            of    the     ground,           find    somewhere             to    park       and make             my way

in s i d e .        Numerous        people           were    advised          of       the     time         factor       by m y s e l f

and    other          officers          b ut    until       well       after       half        past         two    there        were

still       people          in the       public           houses       and    still          quite          heavy       traffic

making         its w a y         towards        the       ground.

By approximately 2.30pm                             (1450)       we    had made             our    way       towards           the

g r o u n d 0 n route , I had                        heard       brokert m e s s a g e s           on the          radio        and

understood               there     to    be     crowd       control          problems             at    the       Leppings           Lane

t u rnstiles.

I asked          Ground          Control        if    they       had any          instructions                and       wa s    told    to

stay     on      patrol          around        the    ground.

Shortly          after       3pm    (1500),           we    were       in the          Peni s t o n e        R o a d N o r t h a rea.

By    now      I had       heard        further           radio       messages          and       understood             there        were

serious          crowd       problems           inside       the       ground          at    the       Leppings          Lane        end.

At    this       t i me    a message            was       passed       from Ground                Control          instructing              all

available             officers          to     go    to    the     ground.

We    went       there       via Penistone                 Road North             and Penistone                   Road.         When

                                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                                             R 33E

to    remain with              the     vehicle,            and with          th e       rest        of m y       officers               I

entered          the    ground         via       the    access          between           the N o r t h S t a n d                and        the

Sp i on Hop.

I looked          towards           the     Leppings         Lane        end and           saw a           large          number            of

Police       officers           and       supporters              standing          on     the       playing              a r e a.          The

game       had    been       stopped.             I could          see     from         t hi s      distance              people

climbing          over       th e    security           fence       onto        the       playing            area.

I was       sti l l     n ot    fully aware                of w h a t      the      s i t u a t i o n was,                and      from what

X saw       I assumed           a    pitch        invasion was               taking            place.            1 walked               w i t h my

officers          along        the     front       of      the     North        Stand,           expecting                to     begin

moving       supporters              either        back       into       th e      Leppings            Lane          Terrace            or       out

of    the    ground.

My    view       of w h a t     was       actually          happening              was     blocked              by    other           people

until       I actually              arrived        at      the     Leppings             Lane        en d     behind            the      goal       and

I then          saw    that     a    l a rg e     portion          of    the       crowd ~ those                     at     the       f r o nt

were       crushed          against         the    security             fence       and were               in d a n g e r          of       being

injured.              The    one     sma ll       g at e    in the         fence          was       open,        and        a number              of

officers          were       trying         to    remove          people        through             t hi s      g a te.          I went, to

a s s i,s t .

My    first       sight        was     of a y o u n g         man       ly i n g    on     the       ground,              h a lf      in a n d

half       out    of    th e    gate.            His    upper       half        was       free,        but       from          the      waist-

down       he w a s     trapped           by     others       lying        on      to p    of       him a nd          it was

impossible             to    puli      him       free      until        those       on     top moved.                     The      person

immediately             on     top     of      him was        a    couple          of     f e et     further              back        with        his

head       level       with     th e      gateway,          the     one      on     top        of    hi m w a s           further            back

still,       and       so    on.       Th e      only      p r a c t i cal      way       of     freeing             people           was        for

those       at    the       back     to     be m o v e d      to    ease        the w e i g h t            on    those           on     the

•floor.          Several        officers           were       on    the      terraces               trying           to     do     this.

The    pressure             from     the       c r o w d w ho      were      sti l l       on       their        feet          appeared            to

me    to    be    relentless,               a n d a f re e         space        behind              l-tnse— cun— tiie f l o o r                  was

only achieved              with       great           difficulty              due     to    the       c r u s h of        p eo p l e .

At    this     time        whilst           I was      waiting            for    th e      man     on the         f l o o r to           be

fr ee d ,       1 was a wa re             of p e o p l e      pushed          up a g a i n s t the           fe n c e .         At       this

time     t h e y all       appeared              to    be a l i v e ,         but     obviously             distressed.

Eventually           the m a n        was        gr e e d ,     and with another                      officer          1 pulled               him

from     the      gateway          and      left       him with              others        on    the       playing            a r e a.        I

returned          and     tried       to       help     others            o u t . The       w h o 1e p r o b l e m w a s             the

narrowness           of    the       gate        through which                  people          had    to     pass        -    there were

sufficient           officers             on     the    track           to    pull       people away,              but         only       two        at

a    time       could a c t u a l l y stand                in the            gateway.

Whilstwaiting              to      try         and     help,           I was     aware          by n o w     t h at    th e        situation

was     really       serious          and        I c o u l d see             people        against          the       fence         who       were

obviously           dying.           I was        helpless              to    do a n y t h i ng d i r e c t l y               to    help          them

and     continued          to      help        pull     p eo p l e ,         both     alive       and       dead,         from       the a r e a

around       the     gateway.               My    only         c l e ar      recollections              of     this           period were

that      I knew        the     area        around         the         gateway        must       not    get       blocked with

rescued        p eo p l e ,     and       I can        remember              running        with several                  p e op le ,

myself       and     others          taking           an arm        apiece,           and       dragging          them well               out

onto     the      playing          area        where       they         could       be     attended          to.          The       only

person whose              description                 I c an       remember           was       a fair       haired            boy a b o u t

ten years           old,      dressed            in a      red      tracksuit,              who       I carried               from       the

gate.        He     appeared          to       have     no      physical            injuries           and     he w a s            pleading

w i t h me     to    go a n d        find        his    Father            in the         crowd.

Ely a p p r o x i m a t e l y      3.45pm         (1545)           the       situation around                  the     gateway                had.

eased       considerably.                  The        crowd        had       been     pushed          back     and     some          sort         of

system       had     been       established                   to   remove           pe o p l e , m o s t      of w h o m n o w

At    this     t i me     I was       standing                so m e    way     onto       the p l a y i n g a r e a w i t h PC

Clough,        who      was     on    the        field a           short        distance          from       us.       People             were

             beginning           to m o v e      towards          him and         I heard       threatening              commentis m a d s

             M y s e l f , PC C h u r m s        and      others,           pushed    our      way    through           the    crowd        of

             people        surrounding             Mr.      Clough       and      went     with      hi m    to    the    safety          of     the

             p l a y e r s ’ tunnel.

             remained        there       preventing               access       by    unauthorised             persons.

             During        the    time      I was         in the      ground         I had      been approached                 by n u m e r o u s

             people        asking     about         casualties              or,     more    often,          being       extremely

             abusive        towards         al l    the      police         officers        present.              A good       many       of

             these     were       definitely             th e     worse      fo     drink      and    I saw on e          man       who    1 had

             cause     to    speak       to,       and      who    was      ex t r erne ly d r u n k , s t a g g e r          a few yards

             away     from       me a n d     fall       flat      on his         face     in a d r u n k e n       stupor.           He       wa s

             subsequently            removed            by m e m b e r s     of     the    crowd.

             At    4.30pm        (1630)       all       ‘

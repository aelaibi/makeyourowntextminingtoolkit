THE PLAIN CLOTHES DEPATRMENT.




At 10.00am on Saturday 15 th April 1989 I commenced duty at Bammerton Road Police
Station. My duties for the semi final were prisoner process duties, dealing with
Nottingham Forest fans . At approximately 2 .50 pm six Nottingham Forest fans
who had been arrested arrived at Bammerton Road. Approximately one hour later when
all six fans had been processed and left the station I went into the C.I.D. office
along with a number of other officers and began taking Missing Person reportd from
relatives who had lost friends of family. At approximately 10 .30 pm when it appeared
that all the relatives had been dealt with I completed my tour of duty.

                On Saturday           15 A p r i l     1989     I was       on    duty       at   Hillsborough               Football

                I attended           at   the    ground       with     other        officers           at     9.45am        t ha t    date     and

                at     10.15am       we   were     briefed          in the       N o r t h 'Stand by S e n i o r             Police

                At     1 1.1 5a m,    together         wit h Serial          14 we        went      to      the     terrace

                immediately           in f r o n t     of    the     West    Stand       where         both Serials               were

                by     turnstiles         1--16.       These        supporters          were      to     be    supporters            with

                tickets       for     the    West      Stand.

open    at    12    noon.

On    the outside          of the       turnstiles were another               serial    who were

searching          s u pporters      before      they entered         the ground.

At    12 noon when the turnstiles                    opened a small           number    of spectators

began to make             their way       into     the ground.

By 2.30pm the             volume     of spectators           increased but even at             this    time

there was          still    ample       time    to search them as they               came    through,,

The    fans     up until         this    point were mo s t l y good natured and                 in a jovial

m o o d ? a l t h o u g h some     had m e n t i o n e d    to me that Liverpool             should have

had the other             end of the ground,               because    they had a bigger            following

than Notts.          Forest..

About 2.40pm a fan a p p eared on top of the                              turnstiles.       He wasn't

wear ing any f ootba 11              co 1 ours »     I shiouted to him to get               back     down to

the other          side    but    he said he        c o u l d n ’t because     crowds were         beginning

to gather          outside,.       I looked through the turnstiles and saw that                              the

crowd was          beginning       to build up but            even at       this   stage     there    did not

appear       to be a n y t h i n g      out of the ordinary.                I shouted       to the youth on

the    roof of the          turnstiles again to               come down       into    the    ground    (It was

my    intention       that       if he d i d n ’t have a ticket              to arrest       him and take

him to the Police Room).                       If he did have a ticket               I w ould have         taken

the ticket          off    him given him a stern warning and allo w e d him                           into the

grgund.        One    or two more youths              then a p p e a r e d on the       roof and       I

looked through             the    turnstiles and saw that                  there was    by now a large

number       of supporters           gathering       and some were           complaining       of the

crush.        An Inspector           then arri v e d at the           scene and went          on to the

roof    of the       turnstiles.           I thought at            that    time to    remove    the youths

on the       roof.        He then went          to the      edge    of the    roof and began to help

supporters          out of the          queue    on the      other    side and over the wall.                 A

number       of fans       came    into the        ground by this method.               I stopped what

fans    I could and took                the tickets         off    them because       some were

a1ternpt ing to        pass    their       t i ckets    back     throagh the tur nst i 1 es ,

o b viously for        s upporters who          had not        got    tickets    on the outside.

A round 2.45pm,         the    crowd outside was               beginning       to grow and supporters

were    complaining.           A number of them were directing abuse at Police

officers again          stating       that they should have               had the other            end of the

ground,       calling    us    "Dickheads" and stating                  that    the o r g a n i s a t i o n

could have       been better.              It was      obvious       by now that       large     numbers           had

gathered       outside    the    turnstiles.             The    fans who were         now    coming       in

were    being more a ggressive               towards      the Police.           The men on the

turnstiles       began having          trouble with some               of the supporters.               Some

s pectators      hd gone       to the wrong            t urnstiles with the wrong                tickets.            I

spoke? to one         turnstile man who was               complaining          that a fan with a

ticket    for    the S pion Hop was attem p t i n g                  to gain entry.          I spoke          to

the spectator          and told him he would                  have to go to the other               end of

the ground and he w a s n ’t admitted.                        I told the       t u rnstiles man that

s hould spectators            have    standing         tickets       to allow them through              in view

of the    crowd that          had gathered.             <1 had also       heard earlier           a rumour

that    a ticket       toat was selling             tickets at         the Leppings Lane            end of

the ground,,          They were       tickets       for the other         end of the ground and

that    he had gone whe n a p p r o a c h e d by the Police).

By this time          things were          getting more         hectic and fans were               still

coming over       the wall       at the turnstiles and we were helping                             them down

in case of       injury.        At one stage            the    top of a stone         pillar      had     come

1 o c)s e a n d 1 a s k e d t h e s u p p orters        to     pa s s i t d own b e ca u s e i f i t f ell

into    the    crowd someone would have                  been killed or ser i o u s l y            injured.

At this stage we were                clearing       people away from the              turnstile area to

get    them    into    the ground.           People      coming       into the ground were              now

complaining       of the       crowd outside.             Some were       breathless.            People

outside were          shouting       for    us to open the gates and were waving                         their

tickets       saying    that    they had got            tickets and to          let them.         Others
                                                                                                    PAGE       4
                                                                                                    R 19

were    complaining      that a lot of them on the outside                       d i d n ’t have

tickets.      I then saw an officer             on horseback            trying    to make     his way

to the front      of the turnstiles           but a p p e a r e d      to be engulfed by

supporters who were          still     blaming      the S outh Yorkshire Police                for

giving    them the wrong       end of the          ground.

A Police C o n stable       then     came from somewhere               behind us and told one of

the    stewards   that     he had      come to open the gate adjacent                 to the

turnstiles.       The    steward       said that     he w o u l d n ’t open the gates.              I

spoke with the officer             and said that we          couldn't       open the gates and

that    1 believed there were a number                of supporters             outside who        did not

have tickets.       He told rne that          he had       come     to open the       gates    because

of the volume       of supporters          outside and that             the other     gate    had been

opened to ease the          s i tuation outside.           This        gate was    then opened and

about    two hundred       supporters       came    through and then with PC F ord and

the stewards we         closed the      gate.      This    had eased the           pressure        outside

considerably a l t h o u g h there was          still several            fans outside.         Most of

the fans that       came    in .by     this gate,       I believe, made          their way to the

N o r t h Sect i o n of the terrace.

Things    then got back       to no r m a l i t y and      I can       recall    looking at my

w a t c h at 3.02 and saying         to PC Ford       “They should have kic k e d off by

now’     Only a minute       or so after        this a fan came            running     from the

tunnel    towards    us and said        that we should get               in there     because       it was

bedlam.

Wit h other   officers       1 ran into the          tunnel       which was       clear apart        from

a few spectators         making     their way       out.     On arrival          at the   end of the

tunnel    1 could see some           spectators      trying       to    climb the     perimeter

fence    but with the amount           of spectators         in that section which was                   the

Centre South S e c t i o n    it was       impossible       to get near the front.                  With

other    officers    I began to move          spectators          at the back        requesting         them

to go down the tunnel.              Some    of them did so without                question.         Others
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         R 19

w o u l d n ’t move,    telling       officers          to    "Fuck    off.     I ’ve got a ticket".

E v e n t u a l l y enough    fans were m oved and               I m oved forward         to the

perimeter       fence and began to help                      people out who       had been     injured.

These    people were          taken to the area                of the    tunnel    and they were           sat

against walls          until    medical          a t t e n t i o n arrived..     At this     stage    1 do

not believe       that anyone             had    realised the enormity of the                 disaster.              I.

then went       back    into the ground.                  I then with another            officer and

supporters       carried out a man who was                      unconscious and took           him to the

back.     I gave       him heart           massage but         he remained unconscious.              I     was

then joined       by a man who             stated        he was a male         nurse.     He exami n e d    the

man and stated he had apulse and that                              he should be         left in the        prone

position.        This    I did.            By this time         I saw that a number of St

J o h n ’s A m bulance Ambul a n c e s           had a r r i v e d at the       rear of the tunnel.                  I

asked    some    supporters          to    *keep an eye*             on this man and       I returned           to

the terrace.           The    sit u a t i o n of the         terrace     by this    time was       chaotic

and more      people were asked to go out                       of the tunnel       taut still       some

took no notice.              I then began to help                people       through    the gate     in the

perimeter-fence,              I saw that             there were       several    people    crushed

against     the wall         just    below the          perimeter       fence.     The y were      'lying in

a pile about        four      feet    high,          there a p p e a r e d to be a large       number.           It

was   obvious     that       these    people were            dead and that a major            disaster          had

occurred.        I assisted          in getting           people      through the gate and on to the

perimeter       track.       A number           of    people were       taken through        this way.           I

e v e n t u a l l y found myself          on the       perimeter       track and supporters and

Police    alike were          taking       these       people    on makeshift       stretchers        to the

other    end of the          ground.        I went        on to the field to assist where                   1

could.      On the fields            I saw some           supporters making         their way towards

the S pion Kop.          The y obviously w a n t e d             to vent their anger at              the

Notts Forest        fans.        I persuaded some               to    return to the       other    end.      A

cordon was       put up in the middle                   of the       field.     This was     short    lived

    1       and    I decided to make my way back                     round to the       rear    of the Leppi n g s

            Lane    end as    I knew that there was                  not a great       number    of Police

            Officers.        I made my way       round to that               end again,       helping    fans at

            that    end of the ground as well                as      other    fans,     A lot of uninjured

            fans were also       in distress and              I helped        comfort    some    of them.           A

            large    number    of officers       had now arri v e d at the               rear    of the West

            Stand    by this    time and       I a s s i s t e d w ith getting          the    injured       to

            ambulances       nearby.     Whilst at the               rear of the stand          I saw a supporter

            come    round w ith a man          I believe to be the C h a i r m a n of Liverpool                         F.C,

            1 heard the supporter              to say to this man, that's the gate                       that was

            opened,    we d i d n ’t break      it down,          it's not      damaged.        I said that no

            one had said that          the   gate     had been forced open.                   Some   fans were

            abusing Police Officers,             some        called us murderers and some were                          still

            complaining about Liverpool                having         the wrong       end of the      ground.

            However,    this abuse was          taken by the            officers and the m a j o r i t y of

            Liverpool    supporters were            s ympathetic         towards       us and kept       the angry

            element    under    control.        Several        fans came and shook              hands with me and

            than k e d me,    some   said      that    they were sorry for the behaviour                      of a

            small    number    of their      fans.

            By 4.30pm things         began to ease,           most      of the       crowds    had   left,        the

            injured had gone         to hospital,            The      relatives       and friends       of    people

            who were missing were             directed towards               the Police       room under          the

            North Stand,        I then       returned        into the        terrace and saw that             there was

            a   lot of debris,       clothes,       shoes      etc     s c attered about        on the       terrace,

            I saw that a crash barrier                had broken and Liverpool                  scarves were

            hanging    from    it.   I then joined other members                      of my serial.           We made          our

            way to the North S t a n d and there we were                       debriefed,

            I also wish to add that whilst                    on duty at        the t u r n s t i 1e s , just after

            the    crowd had been       let through the               gate,    the    steward on the gate

            remarked to me that          it was       the worst         crowd he had ever seen                in all

                      evenly distributed force of either 4.3 K N /m etre width (290 lbs f /

                      handrail as mentioned in Chapter 9.

                      3.    The force is to be in the form of a static load acting on the
                      top rail of the barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal
                      axis and applied in about ten equal increments.

       Dear Sir

       I am currently leading an investigation into the Hillsborough disaster on
       behalf of Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry.

       Lord Justice Taylor has; asked me to contact companies who undertake crush
       barrier testing in order to establish how they go about their research and in
       particular how they interpret Annex C "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds,* On
       initial reading there does seem to be some confusion on the precise
       interpretation of recovery rates.

       I have asked one of my senior officers in Birmingham to make contact with you
       or a senior member of your staff as soon as possible with a view to
       interviewing you or a senior member of your staff on these issues. I do hope
       that you will be able to help Lord Justice Taylor, the information you supply
       will be treated in the strictest confidence.

       If you need any further information on this request please do not hesitate to
       contact me by telephone in order to save time.

       Yours faithfully




       ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE

1.    For crush barriers the test is to consist of the application of      or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case may be, should be

of barrier as mentioned in Chapter 9.                                      7.    A record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails
                                                                           tested and of their performances during the tests.
2.    For handrails the test is to consist of the application of an
evenly distributed force of either 4.3 K N /m etre width (290 lbs f /
foot width) or 2.74 KN/m etre width (188 lbs f/fo o t width) of
handrail as mentioned in Chapter 9.

3.    The force is to be in the form of a static load acting on the
top rail of the barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal
axis and applied in about ten equal increments.

4.    The force to be applied for three consecutive periods, the full
force being maintained for 5 minutes each period. The interval
between applications to be as short as possible, ie to enable
complete unloading and reloading only. A record should be kept of
any deformation during the loading periods, during the periods of
maintained loading, or during the recovery period.

5.    If on the removal of the force for the third time the recovery
of deformation is at least 75% the barrier or handrail may be
deemed to have satisfied the loading requirements.

If this requirement is not met but the recovery is more than 50%
then the test should be repeated and if on retest the recovery is at
least 75% the barrier or handrail may be deemed to have satisfied
the loading requirements.

If the recovery is less than 50% on the first test or less than 75%
on the retest, the barrier or handrail shall be deemed to have
failed to meet the loading requirements.

             5.1.2 The testing head unit has been tested and found to be
                   rigid in exoess of the loads required.

             5.1.3 Hie telesaqpic struts have been tested and found to be
                   rigid in excess of the test loads required.
               5.2 lest Prppedure

             5.2.1. it is the policy of SGS M.T.D. to ensure maximum safety.

                       The load range required for each barrier unit will be
                       ccmputed frtmu-

                (a) The average terraoe gradient, determined by talcing the
                    step width x step rise ratio at not less than three
                    points on the terraoe.

                (b) The horizontal distance between barriers as outlined in
                    the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" graph 1.

                    The spoaific load ranges v barrier dinemsions are given
                    in tables Tl and T12 and will always be between 290 and
                    400 lbs/ft which is classed as 'peak viewing'.
             5-2.2. The distance between the verticals will be measured using
                    a steel tape rule and the central point on the horizontal
                    marked with felt tip pen.

             5.2.3. The distance between the verticals will be used to
                    ccwpute tile required loading on the individual barrier
                    members, that is the end verticals, middle verticals and
                    hotizontals. Hie basis of the calculation is that end
                    verticles will be tested at 50% of specified load/ centre
                    verticals at 100% specified load and horizontals at 70%
                    specified load.

                   This will ensure that each individual member of the
                   barrier unit meets the loading requixeroent of the total
                   structure. It is co£ allowable to test cany one member
                   of the unit.

         5.2.4. The test rig will be placed in position on the end
                vertical with the test head at 45° to horizontal and
                ensuring via the spirit level that the ram unit/struts
                are horizontal. Deviation from horizontal must be
                minimal to avoid offset loading.

         5.2.5. The deflection measuring device will then be placed on
                the opposite side of the barrier, ensuring that thfc
                tripod legs are well removed Aron any area which might be
                subject to movement during the testing. The tripod will
                be levelled, the measuring ruler brought into contact
                with the barrier and the zero position noted.

             5.2.6. The required loading to the member will then be applied
                    in equal increments until the desired loading is reached
                    and the-deflection noted to the nearest 0.05". Hie load
                    will be maintained for a period of 5 minutes, the unit
                    then unloaded and deflection noted* It will then be
                    reloaded as quickly as possible and the above repeated so
                    that 3 x 5 mins loading is obtained..

                       During the loaded period a close visual examination
                       should be carried out of the member under stress and at
                       its fixing point to the concrete terracing, and any
                       results noted.

                       At the end of the period the final total deflection will
                       be noted.

             5.2.7. Hie above procedure will be used on each and every member
                    of the barrier except that when horizontal members are
                    tested idie head is swung to apply the loading over the
                    central S' of the member.

             5.2.8. Where recovery of the individual members is at least 75%
                    then the barrier is deemed satisfactory. Where recovery
                    is greater than 50% but less than 75% then testing should
                    be repeated and if, on retest, the recovery is greater
                    than 75% then the barrier is deemed satisfactory.
                   If recovery is less than 50% on initial testing or less
                   than 75% after retest the barrier has failed. If total
                   deflection is 2" or greater at any time than the barrier
                   has failed.
               6. Frequency of ^testing

                   A minimum of 23% of each type of barrier should be tested
                   annually, if for any reason doubts exist then this
                   testing frequency must be increased to a level at which
                   confidence in the strength of the barriers is restored.
               7. Reporting and Statement of Results

             7.1   Hie report must be clear, concise and contain all the
                   results of the visual examination and mechanical
                   testing. If any problems have been identified then these
                   should be highlighted and where possible, remedial action
                   suggested. With each report a copy of the current
                   calibration certificate will be appended.

    Dear Sir

    I am currently leading an investigation into the Hillsborough disaster on
    behalf of Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry.

    Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to contact companies who undertake crush
    barrier testing in order to establish how they go about their research and in
    particular how they interpret Annex C “Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.* On
    initial reading there does seem to be some confusion on the precise
    interpretation of recovery rates.

    X have asked one of my senior officers in Birmingham to make contact with you
    or a senior member of your staff as soon as possible with a view to
    interviewing you or a senior member of your staff on these issues. X do hope
    that you will be able to help Lord Justice Taylor, the information you supply
    will be treated in the strictest confidence.

    If you need any further Information on this request please do not hesitate to
    contact me by telephone in order to save time.

    Yours faithfully

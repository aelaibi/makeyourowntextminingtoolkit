             I am       a    sinqle          man     living       with       rny p a r e n t s     at       the    above    address.

             On    Saturday             15    April        1989       (150489)          I attended            the    FA    Cup    Semi-final

             between             Liverpool           and    Nottingham             Forrest         at       Hillsborough          ground,

             S h e f f i s Id.

             I    support          Liverpool              I did       not    go    in    an    organised            party       but    I

             travelled             in a       c ar    with       my    two       friends,                            and                                I

             do    not       know       the    addresses              of    my    friends.

             I    got       my    ticket       for        the    match       from       the    Anfield            ground    and       paid       £6     for

             a    ticket          to    stand        in    the    Leppings             Lane    End.

             On    the       way       to    the     ground       we       stopped       off     in     a    small    village,             about

             half       hour       from       Sheffield,              I    cannot       remember            the    name    of    the       Village.

             We    stopped             off    for     a    drink          1 had    two    pints         of    Shandy.

             On    the       way       to    the     ground       there          were    delays         on    the    A57    into

             Sheffield,                 We    d i d n ’t a r r i v e        until       2 . 10pm      (1410).

             The     only         time       I saw        anybody          drinking       alcohol            prior    to    arriving             at     the

              ground         was       in    the     village          where       we    had    stopped.             There       were       two     small

              pubs      and       there       were        about       30-40       football         supporters             drinking.              I ’d

              like      to       add    I didnt           see    anybody          drunk.

When      we         cio't to               Sheffield             we    parked           about        10      mins       from          the       ground          near

to    where               the       coaches             parked          I    did        not    see      any      police            to       escort          us

from      where                we       parked          the       car       to     the       ground.           I d i d n ’t            see       any

On    arriving                     at       the     turnst iles               there          was     a mass         of       people          waiting             to

qo     into          the           ground.              They       were           all    packed          in    an       area       leading             to    the

Thpro          i.iars          3     policemen               on    horseback                 outside          the       turnstiles,                trying             to

control              the           crowd.            I didnt            see        any       stewards.              The          policemen             were

shouting                  to       the       crowd          to    get       back.            The     crowd       were            also       frustrated

at     the         p o 1 i ceme n b e c a u s e                    theywere              s wi ng i ng         the        horses round                  to

scatter              the           fans        who      had        nowhere              to    go.

There          were            no        signs       directing                us     into       the      ground,             so    I waited             on       the

^ j^,jp q f          t,h p         disc rgani s e d               queue           where       there        was      a    small          barrier

dividing                  the        crowds          going         into           the     turnstiles             and         a    small          road

leading               to       the          South       Stand.              I had         great        difficulty                 getting          to       the

turnstiles,                         in      fact     there         was        no     chance          because            of       the    mass       of       people,

I didnt               enter              the       ground         through            a    turnstile            but       through             a    small          gate

about          4ft             past          the    turnstile               leading            to    the      south          stand.              Before          I

got       into             the          ground          I   saw    two        large           blue     gates         leading            into       Leppings

Lane        from               the          small       road      which           leads        to    the      South          Stand,          being          opened

 by     the         police.                   I dont          know      how          many       policemen                there          were. Once               the

 gates          opened                  a    number         of    people             surged          t h r o u g h as        they       were       being

    crushed               I then             went       into       the ground.

 While             I was            waiting             outside,              I    saw       about 20 supporters                        climb          over          a

 wall,         which                ran       between            the     two         turnstiles               blocks.

    I went          to         the          ground,         I did        not         hand      my     t i c k e t in         and       I have          still

did        not               know anybody                               a r o u n d me,                     I had            lost       rrryt w o           friends               before

entering                    the              ground.

At      this             time                the         crowd                were              frustrated,                      people             were             screaming                   and

shouting                    for              help,            they               were               being          crushed              and         were             shouting                to          the

police.

I was              being                  crushed                and             had            been          pushed             from        the            back           to     about              5    feet

from          the           front                 fence                -and w a s                   a     few      feet          right         of           the           gate        which              led

on      to         the            pitch.

 Immediately                              on      my       left               were              two         girls            screaming                  and          crying.

I would                   describe                       them              as          white.                The         younger             one            was           S ’4    to      5-'5           tall,

with          black                    curly             shoulder                          length             hair.              She        wore            a    black            leather

jacket                 I didnt                    see         her              face             she         had      her         back        to         me.

The        other                  one            was       taller                      with             dark       brown           hair.                I tried                  to    reassure

them          because                        I    could                see             the          gate        to       get       out.             By          them           some       fans            had

 climbed                  over               the         fence                 and            the         gate       on       to     the        pitch                had         just        been

Once             the        crowd         eased         I was        able          to    turn         around towards                    the        tunnel.           I

1   ooked              on    t he      g r ound         and       s aw    a    young        man       1y      i ng t h e r e .

I would                   describe            him       as    whits           aged       1B - 2 0 y r s ,          medium        build         blonde          hair

wearing                 a    maroon           leather               jacket          and pink              I    shirt      wi th blue               jeans.      He

eyes             were          open       and     glased.                At    this        time           I thought             he w a s       dead,       but       I

want             sure.              I asked         him       if     he       was       alright            but      there       was       no

response.                       Another           lad        bent        down       and       tried           to    talk       to       him    but       there

was          still             no      response.

This-            lad        grabbed            under         his     armpits             and      I       took      his    legs,          after          picking

him          up        we    attempted              to       pass        him       along       but         the      crowd       was       too       busy       with

themselves                      so      we     took      him       back        through            the         tunnel       and          laid       him    on    the

ground                 by      the      turnstiles.

The          lad          was       still        lifeless,               I managed             to         clear      his       airway          by     lifting

his          head           with        my     right         hand,         pulled          his        chin         up.     A     policeman               was    on

 the         otherside                  of     him.          He    asked           me    if    he         was      still        breathing.                I    place

my        ear          near         his      mouth       and       heard           him     breathing                faintly.               I attempted               to

 nut         him          in    the       recovery            position              and       the         policeman             took       over.          I saw

 thp         lads           hand        move,       up       and     down.              I then            stood      about          6    feet       away

 where             I broke              down      and        started           to       cry.          I       looked      around           and      saw       20-30

 fans            on       the       floor,        in     the        recovery             position               receiving               treatment.              I

Dear Lord Justice Stuart- Smith,

                                   Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter dated 28th October 1997.

I have spoken to Mr. Bone and arranged with him to meet with you on Monday 17th
November 1997 at 11 am.. I understand from Mr. Burgess that that date will be
convenient for him too.

I look forward to meeting you next month.



Yours sincerely,

                  S h e f f i e l d just    in Derbyshire.              We had a couple                of   pints and a bite            to

                  eat.    We    carried on to the m atch and got                              to S h e f f i e l d at about

                  tw e n t y to three         (1440).       We       parked    in H a w k e s l e y Ave         off B r a d f o r d Rd and

                  wa l k ed    to the      ground.       We got to the t u rnstiles at about 5 to 3                                (1455)

            The    crowd outside waiting           to get     in w a s n ’t too          bad,   it was

            r e a s o n a b l y orderly wit h     people queueing at           the turnstiles,           we,     that's

            just               and me then joined the queue.                  The    others went         elsewhere          in

            the ground.        While we were waiting           I saw a P o l i c e m a n standing            on top of

            the    turnstile,       pulling     people    up and over         the wall.         I ’d never     seen

            that    before and       I couldn't      believe     it. As we a p p r o a c h e d turnstile               B a

            copper    on foot asked me            if I had got a ticket,                 I said yes and he

            called me under a barrier and                 round the         side    of the turnstile.            I could

            see    that a c o n certina gate was            partially open and he called me                      in
      CL
            through       it. No b o d y a sked    for my ticket and           I just wal k e d t h r o u g h .

            There was a continual             stream     passing     through        in front and behind               us.

            The    courtyard was       sparse      except    for a few        people.       Both               and me

            had tickets        for the L e p pings Ln pens           but we decided we wanted to try

            the    stand    instead.     We made     our way up the stairs                 for the Y 7. entrance.

            T here was Police and S t e w a r d s         in there,         I d o n ’t know how

            many    because     I just    put my head down and               plunged through.            No b o d y asked

            me    for my ticket and        I d i d n ’t show     it.                 followed       behind.      We got

(/O         into    the seated area and saw hundreds                   of others          had done      the same       it
3*^*— ^ -
            was    crowded out w ith       people      sitting     on the      steps and standing at                  the

            back.    We sat down at about 3 o ’clock,                  we    could see that the            pens       below

            us were       packed out everyone was            really squashed.              Just    on kick     off

            people    started       climbing      the barriers       to get away from the                crush.       The

            P olice were       stopping    them from climbing               over and telling            them to get

            back.    People were       still      climbing    over and        lying and sitting            behind          the

            goal    mouth.     I saw a Police Officer            run onto          the    pitch and stop the

            game.    We moved down as far as we               could to get a look.                 I could see         the

            crush at the front.           Peopl e were       still     climbing          the fences      trying       to

            get    out.    I could see     one gate       open and Police            helping       fans out.      I also

            saw some Police          try to     rip the     fencing     down.       People were         lying all

            over    the    pitch.    I just     thought     it was a crush until                I saw    coats    being
                                                                                                          PAG E           3
                                                                                                          S2 0 0 8

              put    over     people's   heads.         Some   of the Police were      standing   round doing

              nothing.        I even saw some           drinking   from a flask    or urn.   Fans    started         to

              rip the       billboards     up and use them as           stretchers     to carry   people away.

              We staye d        in the ground until about             twenty   past four   (1620),   we     left

              the    ground of our        own accord and made           our way back to the       car. I

              d idn't     see any surge          just    the   crush and the aftermath.      I would      like       to

              say that        in my opinion the Police were              incompetent and u n trained         to

              deal     w ith a sit u a t i o n    like t h a t . At   no stage   did   I see any trouble

              w h a t s oe ve r with the     fans.

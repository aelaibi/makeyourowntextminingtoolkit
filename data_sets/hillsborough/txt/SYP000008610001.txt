                 At    Sam      (0800)      on S a t u r d a y      15 A p r i l       1989       (15040#)        I commenced work              as

                 usual       in the       kitchens         at     the    Riverside              Suitjs at       the    ground.




                 Up    until        3pm    (1500)     on       that     day    everything               went    as    normal    with      my

                 work.           I had      no    need     to     venture         out      of     the    South       Stand   for    any    reason,




                 At    just     after       the    kick, o f f        I w as      informed            that     the L i v e r pool    fans       had

mild     form        of    ve rbal       abuse        from          the    occasional               L i v e r pool      supporter.                   I

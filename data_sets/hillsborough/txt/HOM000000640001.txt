DATED:     260489




             I am       a    single       man        and       I       live       at       the          above       address     which         is   my

             parents          house.           I am           presently                employed                by    Lucas    Aerospace,

             Dunningsbridge                   R d,    Netherton                   as       a       semi-skilled             engineer.

             I am       a    keen       football              supporter                and          have       followed       Liverpool            F.C.       all

             my    life,          attending           matches                throughout                   the       country.

             On    Saturday             150489        I attended                   Sheffield                   to    watch    the     F .A . C u p        semi­

             final          match       between           Liverpool                and             Nottingham          Forest.           I had       purchased

             my    ticket          approximately                       two    weeks                prior       to    the    match,       obtaining            it

             from       Anfield          football             ground,              paying                twelve       pounds       (£12.00p)            for    a

             seat       in    the       West     Stand             -    row       11,          seat       108,       entrance       C,     ticket         serial

             number          150489.

             I went          to    the    match           with          three          friends,                they    are

             o f                                          ,                            ,       »

             was    a       friend       of                   and        I d o n ’t k n o w                his       full    name     or      address         either

             We    left       Liverpool              at       1000       catching                   a    coach       from    the    Strand          Shopping

             Centre          in B o o t l e ,        this          being          pre-booked                   with    ’A m b e r l i n e '    Coach

             Company.              We    went        straight                to    Sheffield                   not    stopping,          the       only    delay

being       an    accident               on       the        motorway.                       We        arrived             in S h e f f i e l d                  at        about

1315    parking             about            a    quarter                    of   a     mile           from          the       ground              near          to

Leppings          Lane,           I ’m       not       sure              of       the     road           name.

Once    we       got        off the              coach         we        went           to    a        nearby          public                 house             w hich was

open.        I do           not k no w            the       name             of       this        pub           except             to        say    it          was        a ’

Bass-House'             and        there           was             a     second           pub          adjacent                to       it        but       that           was

closed.

We    stayed       in       there            until           about                2.30pm               I drank          two            pints,            because

there       were       too     many              Liverpool                      fans      inside.

Once    outside             the      pub,          I knew                    where        the          ground           was            and        walked          straight

there       with       my     three              friends.                       I cannot                recall          being                directed             to           the

ground       by    any        police              but        as          I said           I knew                my    way          around           as          I ’d       been

to    football          matches                  there             before.

As    I neared              the ground,                     I would               say        this           was       1 44 0 ,          I saw           a       c r o w d of

people       outside           the           turnstiles                       -    there           appeared                to          be no       quese              or

organisation.                  I went              over                 to      two     mounted                 police             officers                 -    I d o n ’t

know    who       they       were,               and        asked               them      how          to       get     to         the        West          Stand.                 I

had    the       ticket        in m y             hand.

One    of        the     policemen                  n o d d e d in                t h e d i r e c t i o n of               a           gate        and said                    ’G o

in    there.’           I saw            a       large             crowd           pushing              their          way             through              the        gate

which       is    at    the        right           hand                 side       of     turnstiles                   A       to       G.

At    this       stage       the         only          policemen                      I ’d    seen              outside                the        ground          entrance

was    the         two       on     horseback,                          I saw         no o t h e r s            at all.                Neither              did            I

see    any         stewards              on       duty             at t h e s e          or       any           other        points.

As    I got       through           the           gate             I was           carried              along          with             the        crowd,              I

looked       but       was     unable              to        locate               any        signs              anywhere                directing                 which

way    to    go.

I was       pushed          through               with             the        crowd          into           a    tunnel                this        emerged                 on      the

terracing          slightly                  to    the             right          of     the           goal       mouth.                     As    I had          come             out
                                                                                                                                                             r.*»
                                                                                                                                             PAGE



of    the    tunnel          I had          realised              it    was       leading          to    the       terraces,            and            not

to    the    West       Stand          which       I     required.                 I was       unable          to       turn     round            and

was    just       forced          forward          with           the    surge         and     ended          up    in     p e n 3.

I was       carried          forward,             the        crush       being          fairly          heavy       at     this         point,

and    ended       up       about          four    persons              back       from       the       perimeter             fence.               I

have       been    shown          the       grid        (ex.       no.                         id.       no.                     ) and

have       indicated             my    position              as    E7.         I w o u l d s a y the               time    at this

point       would       be       about          1445.

I    did    not        see one         policeman               or s t e w a r d        within           the    c o n f i n e s of       t he

ground       once       I    gained             entry        via the          gate.

I    can    say     at       this          point        that       Is a w     no    personconsuming                     alcohol          in        the

ground       or        any acts            of    v i o l e n c e or         disorderly                   behaviour.

As    the    minutes             passed          t he    crush          seemed          to    get       heavier          and

heavier,          so    bad       in       fact     that          prior        to      kick    off p e o p le           were

shouting          and       screaming             out        in    pain        shouting             ’G e t     me    out,      g e t me

out. '

By    this       stage       the       friends           I had          been       with       had       split        up,

       joing       to       the       North       Stand,           and                 '/ho h a d       also       been       going          to

the    West       Stand          splitting              up    prior          to    the       tunnel.            I have         since

learned          that       he    did       in    fact        end       up    in       the    West       Stand.

As    it    neared          kick       off,       I found              that       I was       having          great

difficulty             in    breathing,                 not       being       able       to    expand          my       chest,          so     I

ended       up    sucking             in    air     to       breath.              By    this       time       there        was      a    lot

of    moaning,          the       screams          had        died       out.           I saw       several             people,          I

d o n ’t    know       who       they       are,        had       passed          out.        These       were          all    blokes

about       my    OM>n a g e .

The    time       now       would          have     been          about       1500,          the    match           kicking         off.

I was       unable          to    see       any     of       the       pitch,          just    the       top       of    the     cross

bar    and       goal.
The    crush       continued                not       abaiting,             I remember             a    policeman             jumping

onto    the       caging             and    perimeter                wall       and    shouting          get       back       and

making       pushing             gestures             at     the      crowd.           This       was    impossible                as    we

we    unable       to       get       and    foothold                to    push       back.

At    this    point             the    man       on    my       right       hand       side,       I don't          know       him       was

obviously          unconscious,                      I couldn't             see       too    clearly          as    it       was    even

difficult          to       move       your          head.           Anyway       this       man       had    his       head

backwards,             but       I was       unable             to    move       to    assist          him.

I    could    see       there          was       a    l ot      of    vomit       on    peoples          heads          in    front

but    don't       know          when       it       got     there.

The    crush       seemed             to    lighten             from       the    back,          and    the    next          thing       I

realised          was       I fell          backwards                from       the    pressure          at    the       front.              I

was    trapped          from          about          waist        deep      with       arms       and    legs       and       bodies.

I    looked       to    my       right       where           the      man       who    was       unconscious             was,       and

saw    he    was       lying          on    his       back,          his    eyes       wide       open       with       just       the

whites       of    the          eyes       showing,             his       eyes    having          rolled       backwards.

I thought          the          man    was       dead        at      this       point       and    I    lent       over,       pinched

his    nose,       tilted             his    head          back       and       tried       to    give       him    the       kiss       of

life.        After          a    while       I       leant        up,      slapped          him    across          the       face       to

try    and    get       some          response,              but      was       unable       to    do    so.        I    remember

looking       around             and       behind          me     and      I could          see    there       were          about

seven       policemen                standing          around             not    doing       anything.              Their

position          was       such       that          they       were       in    the    terracing             behind          myself

and    the    pitch.

I    screamed          at       one    policeman                to    help       me    saying          'Get    this          guy    out,

I think       he's          dead.'           He       scuttered             down       and       picked       the       guy    from

underneath             the       arms       and       tried          to    pull       him    out       but    couldn't             as    the

man    like       me    was          trapped          from        about         waist       down.        I pulled             at    the

arms    and       legs          to    get    him       free          and    eventually             the       policeman             pulled
The    policeman                carried             him    out,       I    couldn't           see    where       he    went       to    or

whats       happened             to       the       man.

As    I have           said,          I did          not    know this           man     but    would        describe          him       as

about       the        same          age       as    me    (25), b r o w n        collar       length        hair       and      a

moustache.                 I    can't          remember          what       he    was    wearing.               I haven't            seen

him    before          or       since.

The    policeman                who        pulled         him    out       is    also    unknown           to    me,    I did          not

remember             his       number.

I    got    myself             out       of    the    tangle          of    bodies       and        walked       over       to    the

side       of    the       terraces             and       sat    down       in a       daze,        my    shirt       had    been

ripped          open       and       a    shoe       had     come         off,    but    I didn't           have       the       energy

to    do    these          up.

I don't          know          how       long       X sat       there       for,       I didn't           really       comprehend

what       was       going       on       around          me.     I was          too    shocked.

Anyway,          I     eventually                   got up      of m y     own        accord    and        walked       out      of     the

ground,          I     can't          remember which way                        I got    out.            I found       my    way      back

to    the       coach,          which          left       soon    afterwards.                 Nothing           was    said,

everyone             was       too       upset       and     shocked.

I    had    been       hurt          in       the    crush,       my       right       arm     had       been    squashed

between          two       people,             but    I didn't             seek       medical        help       that    day      as     I

was    too       dazed.

The    next          day       I went          to    Walton       Hospital             Casualty           Department,            Walton

in M e r s e y s i d e ,         at       about       1900       where          I was    seen        by    a Doctor          who       gave

me    20    Co       Dydramel             tablets          as    I had          and    still        have    lost       the

majority          of       feeling             in m y      right       arm       from    the        elbow       downwards            along

the    forearm             into          the    thumb.

I am       now       receiving                treatment          at    Walton          Hospital           Orthopaedic

Department.
         In    my   opinion        the    only          reason          for    the       deaths       would       have       been    the

         crush      effect,        people          not       being       able       to    breath.

         I have       heard       stories          in       the    press       but       I can       say    I saw       nothing

         which      I would        class          as    a    criminal          offence          before       or    after       the    crush.

         As    I said       I have       been          throughout             the    country          following             Liverpool,

         and    indeed       to    the    same          ground          last    year          for    the    FA    Cup       semi-final,

         and    all    were       better          organised,             with       queueing          at    turnstiles          and

         adequate       directions                telling          you    where          to    go.

         My    opinion       is    that       I    realise          what's          been       said    in    the       press    about          the

         reasons       for    opening             the       gate,       but    that       situation          should          never    have

   ^     arrived       if    people       had          been       organised          into       queues       and       there    had       been

         better       policing       outside                the    ground.

         I have       already       stated             I kept       my    ticket          intact       for       the    match       and

         still      possess        this       (serial             number       150489).             I do    wish       to    retain       this

         property.

         The    circumstances             surrounding                   this    enquiry             have    been       explained          to    me

         and    I am    willing          to       attend          and    give       evidence          to a n y     hearing          with

         regards       to    this    matter.

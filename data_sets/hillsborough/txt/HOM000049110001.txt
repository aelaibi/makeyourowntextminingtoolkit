              EVIDENCE OF LOUISE BROOKES
)
     1
     2       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I have received your written
     3            submission, Miss Brookes, which I have had a look at.            Is
     4            there anything more that you want to say in addition to
     5           what is in your written submissions?
     6   A       Yes, there is.     The first comment I would like to make I
     7           am still waiting Andrew's body file from South Yorkshire
    8            Police.     They are stating that they have sent me Andrew's
    9            body file, and I have never received Andrew's body file.
10               One particular item in the body file is a Polaroid
11                photograph which I have requested of Andrew.
12       Q       What is that?
13       A       It just says it is the Polaroid photo of     Andrew's body,
14                and I have requested that.
15       Q       First of all, when did you write and ask      for the body
16                file?
17       A       I think it was back in August.      I actually requested this
18               photograph before the body file.
19       Q       When did you ask for the body file?
20       A       That would have been October.      All I asked for was      all
21               relevant documents relating to my brother.         This is back
22               in June of this year.     I didn't know there was anything
23               called a body file.     I just asked for documents.        Now,
24               I've actually faxed numerous times to PC Ken Greenway
25               asking for witness statements etc.
26       Q       Wait a minute.     You say the police say they have sent the
27               file but you haven't received it?
28       A      I have never, ever received it.      Now this is a fax dated
29               l^th August 1997 asking for the Polaroid photo of Andrew,
30               in its original state, and a copy of sudden death report.
31               Out of that fax, all I actually received was the
32               continuity charts.
33       Q      Let's see what you have got which I've got or which you
34               haven't g o t .
35       A      OK.   We actually made a list.
36       Q      So far as the statements are concerned,     there    is a
37               statement by you?
38       A      T h a t 's right.
39       Q      A statement by Mark Richards.
40       A      Which date was that.     Mark has   made two statements.

                                              2
/')
      1   Q   There is a statement dated 3rd June 1989.
      2   A   T h a t 's right.   Thank y o u .
      3   Q   And another one dated 11th August 1989?
      4   A   T h a t 's right.
      5   Q   Those seem to be the two statements that I have?
      6   A   That is correct.
      7   Q   Then                        A statement by him dated 4th May
      8       1989?
      9   A   T h a t 's right.
 10       Q   There is a statement by                      dated 24th May
 11           1989.
 12       A   T h a t 's right.
 13       Q   Have you got that?
 14       A   Yes, I have.
 15       Q   And there is a statement by Police Constable Plumridge.
 16           Have you go that?
 17       A   Is that the 2 0th October?
 18       Q   That's it, yes.       One by Police Constable Howell which I
 19           think is undated.
20        A   That is correct.
21        Q   There is another one by him dated 2nd October 1989?
22        A   That is correct.
23        Q   There is a statement by Sergeant Walton which is undated.
24        A   Right.     I haven't got that one then, if that one is
25            undated.    I have three by Peter Walton.
26        Q   There is another one which is in substantially the same
27            terms, dated 26th May 1989.
28        A   That is correct.
29        Q   Have you got that?
30        A   I have indeed.
31        Q   Why don't we get this one photostatted.       There is another
32            one by Mr. Walton dated 1st September 1989.
33        A   That is correct.
34        Q   Which deals with a whole lot of photographs.       There is one
35            by Mr. Williamson which again seems to be undated.
36        A   That is correct.
37        Q   Right - got that?
38        A   Yes.




                                                  3
)
     1   Q    And. another one by him dated 8th May 1989.           Have you. got
     2        that?
    3    A    T ha t 's right.
    4    Q    One dated 12th July 1989?
    5    A    That is correct, yes.
    6    Q    A statement by       Dr. Bull dated 5th May 1989?
    7    A    Yes.
    8    Q    Have you got that?
    9    A    Yes.    Now, with regards to that one ---
10       Q    Wait a minute.       There is another one for Mr. Bull.
11       MS   ADLINGTON: That is his submission to Taylor LJ.             We do
12            have a copy of that.
13       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Is it;    I see.   Then there is a
14            statement by Mr. Harris dated 15th April 1989?
15       A    That is correct.
16       Q    A statement by                       a Police Officer, 4th May
17            1989.    Have you got that?
18       A    T ha t 's right, y e s .
19       Q    Then there is a statement by the pathologist,           Stephen
20            Jones.    Right?      A post mortem report,      I think.
21       A    Right.
22       Q    Then there is a statement by a photographer, Mr. Rich,
23            22nd August 1989.
24       A    That is correct.
25       Q    You have got that.         A statement by Mr. Turner, 26th July
26            1989.
27       A    That is correct.
28       Q    A statement by Mr. Fletcher dated 26th July 1989?
29       A    Correct.
30       Q    A statement by Dr. Forrest?
31       A    Is that 2 9th June.
32       Q    No, it's 20th April 1989.
33       A    OK.
34       Q    There is another one, 9th May 1989?
35       A    Yes, that is correct.
         Q    There is another one 29th June 1989?
         A    That is correct.
         Q    One by Inspector Layton,       8th January 1990?
         A    That is correct.

     1       Q   Another one, 12th February 1990?
     2   A       That is right.
  3      Q       And that is it.     That is all I have got.
  4      A       Oh, right.  OK.
  5      Q        So apart from this one which is, I think,        in substantially
  6               the same terms as the one you have got ---
  7      A        There does appear to be some missing though.
  8      Q       What?
  9      A       There does seem to be some witness statements missing
 10               which you have not actually received which I obviously
 11               have .
 12      Q       Which you have got and I have not got?
13       A       That is correct,    yes.
14       Q       What are they?
15       A        The first one is by                      and that was dated 3 0th
16                April 1989.
17       Q       What does that deal with?
18       A       That he was a friend who actually accompanied Andrew to
19                Hillsborough that day.
20       Q       That deals with the early part     of the day?
21       A       That is right, yes.
22       Q       That is not particularly relevant, is it?
23       A       Oh right,   I didn't know that.
24       Q       Is it?   Why do you think it is    relevant?
25       A       I just thought you had the complete body         file of Andrew,
26               and I would have thought that would have been there.
27       Q       It probably has not got that on it.       What   else?
28       A       Another one by Dr. Bull which is actually undated.
29       MS      ADLINGTON:    That is the submission to Taylor LJ.
.30      A       Oh right.
31       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have that.
32       A       That is my mistake.    There is another one      by Peter Walton
33               which is dated 4th June 1989, and he was the Police
34               Sergeant.
35       Q       I have got several statements by him.        I will check that I
36               have not overlooked that.      The first one by Mr. Walton is,
37               as far as I can see, undated.      You say there is one dated
38               4th June?
39       A       That is correct.


                                               5
 1   MR.   BONE:     You got that from South Yorkshire Police?
 2   A     Yes, I did.     Everything which I have received,     I have
 3         received through ---
 4   MS    DURHAM:     Sir, there is also PC Plumridge's statement of
 5         2 0th October refers to his previous statement of 2nd
 6         August.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Just a moment.      Let us deal with
 8         Sergeant Walton for the moment.          I don't seem to have it.
 9         What does he say in his statement.
10   A     That is the copy.     (Handed)
11   Q     I suspect that this is probably the original statement
12         which was then converted into the document I have just
13         given you.     I may be wrong about this.       I have certainly
14         told other people but what happened following Hillsborough
15         was that the police officers were all told to go away and
16         write out in their own handwriting their recollections of
17         the day.     They did that.     They were then submitted to the
18         solicitors for the South Yorkshire Police who made certain
19         recommendations in relation to them.         Sometimes there were
20         wholly inappropriate comments on them and this sort of
21         thing.     They were then resubmitted to the police who
22         drafted statements    (based on the original statements)
23         which got on to the file.           That is a slightly abbreviated
24         account of what happened.        I suspect that this is probably
25         the original document.
26   MR.   BONE:     It does seem to be that, Sir Murray.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          It was then made into thedocument
28         of which I have just given you a copy.          We might take a
29         copy of that.     I think that is probably the explanation of
30         t hat.
31   A     To be quite honest,   I think I disagree on that.       The
32         reason I disagree with    that is because there is a      first
33         statement from Peter Walton dated 26th May.
34   Q     I have got that.
35   A     So obviously that wasn't his original statement because
36         that is dated 4th June.        Now, the content of that second
37         statement, 4th June, starts to incriminate the fans as
38         being drunk and fighting, whereas in the first statement
39         which is dated 26th May, it doesn't mention about fans


                                           6
)
    1        fighting or the drunkenness, so quite honestly I do
    2        disagree with that because obviously the way I am looking
    3        at that     is he had changed his statement quite a lot
    4        between     his first statement of 26th May and 4th June.          The
    5        inference had basically gone from remembering the events
    6        of that     day to basically incriminating the fans, and there
    7        are two     separate statements.    I mean, the content is
    8        completely different really.
    9   Q    I will take a copy of that statement and I will look at
10           that matter.
11      A   Thank you.      There were   two more.    One   I have become aware
12           of today.     My parents made a witness statement, and we
13           have not go that.       I don't know whether you are only being
14           supplied with witness statements relating to the events of
15           that afternoon, or whether you are being supplied with all
16          the witness statements concerning my brother from the left
17          his house.
18      Q   It was you, wasn't it,       who identified your brother?
19      A   No, it wasn't no.
20      Q   Wasn't it?
21      A   It was his friend, John Harris, and also John Harris's
22                   _______________ .      That is also a statement which
23          is eight pages long.
24      Q   Yes, you deal       with him leaving home that morning and what
25          he was wearing and so on, don't you?
26      A   T h a t 's right.   I have got rather a concern about that
27          witness statement which I would like to discuss as well.
28      Q   I see.     What did your parents make a statement about?
29      A   To be quite honest,      I honestly don't know.      I imagine it
30          would have been about when he left the house.           I only
31          spoke to my mother this morning regarding that.            I was not
32          aware that my parents had made a witness statement until I
33          had spoken to my mother and I started going through my
34          file.
35      Q   I don't think       that is very material.
36      A   No.   All I am      trying to say to you is when I requested the
37          full contents of Andrew's file,          I have assumed I was going
38          to be sent all material concerning my brother which
39          obviously I haven't been.


                                            7
')

     1   Q    Not necessarily.      What you have been sent appears to me to
     2        be everything that is on the body file with the one
     3        exception of that statement.          We will check whether it was
     4        the same.     You appear to have the statement but in a
     5        slightly different form.        You have got, as I understand
     6        it, everything that is on the body file.             What the West
     7       Midlands Police in relation to these body files was to put
     8        together the evidence which was thought to be relevant.                   I
     9        know that in some cases they did go right back to leaving
 10           home and almost what people had for breakfast;                but quite
 11           frankly,    it is not relevant.      What I am concerned with,
 12          and what Lord Taylor was concerned with, and what the
 13           Inquest was concerned with, was what happened when they
14           got to the ground and what happened afterwards.
15       A   If that is the fact ----
16       Q   That is so.
17       A   No, no, what I am saying is if that is the fact then they
18           haven't given you the full body file because you are
19           m i s s i n g w i t n e s s                 statement.
20       Q   I have got a statement of        John Harris.
21       A   T h a t 's right;   that's
22       Q   Did I not mention that?
23       A   Yes, you actually said that you hadn't receivec
24
25       Q   I am sorry, it is here.         I must have missed it when I went
26           through.      Just check     on this: 15th    April 1989      - John
27           Harris.      I think I did mention thi s .
28       A   That is correct.
29       Q   I was rather surprised it was on the same day.                He was the
30           person who identified your brother.
31       A   That is right.
32       Q   I am sorry;     I have got     that. If      I did not read    it out,
33           that was my mistake.
34       A   No, you did read that one out.          The one you stated which
35           you have not got a copy of i            s     ^   n      d      that was
36           dated 3 0th April 1989.
37       Q   What does he say?
38       A   It would have been that day.          He attended Hillsborough and
39           also identified Andrew along with John Harris,                so I think


                                               8
 1         that statement is quite important.        It is eight pages
 2         long.
 3   MS    ADLINGTON:      The contents of his statement is more or less
 4         the same as Mark Richards and                      who all
 5         attended the match together.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         What John Harris says is:
 7                 "Enquiries were made to find Andrew Brookes, and
 8                 later that day I attended Hillsborough football
 9                 ground in company with                     and M a r k .   At
10                 1035 I was shown the body of Andrew Brookes, and I
11                 positively identified him.     Andrew Brookes is about
12                 2 5 years of age."
13         Can I have a look at the statement from the brother?
14   A     From              That's 30th April.
15   Q     Does it deal with Andrew at all until the identification?
16   A     Yes, it does.
17   Q     In the early stages, does it?
18   A     Yes, it does.
19   MR.   BONE:     Can we have a copy of that, Louise?
20   A     Yes.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I don't quite know.    He did not
22         give evidence at the Inquest?
23   A     No, nobody gave evidence for Andrew at all.
24   Q     No, I meant he did not give evidence at the Inquest?
25   A     No, he didn't.
26   Q     We will take a copy of that.
27   A     Thank y o u .
28   Q     I doubt whether that actually adds very much to what is on
29         the file anyway.
30   A     There is just one more statement, and that is of PC
31         Plumridge dated 2nd August 1989.
32   Q     Dated 20th October 1989.
33   A     That's right.     In that statement he actually refers to           a
34         statement of 2nd August 1989, and I haven't got that.
35   Q     It may be that that doesn't say anything relevant.           I have
36         not got that either.      The police were asked to make
37          statements.     They did not initially identify people.           They
38         were then asked - practically every police officer
39          involved in the whole operation was then shown various


                                           9
 1       photographs and so on - if they could identify anybody,
 2       and very often they start off their statements, "Further
 3       to my previous statement" but it doesn't follow the
 4       previous statement had anything to do with that particular
 5       person.   We can try to find the statement.      Anyhow,   you
 6       say you have not seen it?
 7   A   No.
 8   Q   I suspect it is not relevant.
 9   A   One of my concerns is that when you ask for the body file,
10       we should be receiving the full body file.
11   Q   You have received i t .
12   A   I have not.     I have not received the full body file.      I
13       have asked for Andrew's body file.       I have never received
14       the full body file.       There is a Polaroid photo which they
15       are saying in one letter that they are going to send on to
16       me at a later date, and I have never received.        You know,
17       one comment I would like to make is, how do I know I have
18       received the full contents of the body file.
19   Q   Because I am going through it with you.
20   A   No, but what I am trying to say is:       how do we know they
21       have not taken certain things out of those body files, and
22       obviously given us a mirrored copy of the body files,
23       because obviously I haven't got a copy of the Polaroid
24       photograph.     I don't know whether you've got it.
25   Q   I don't know, we'll see.      I have not got very many
26       photographs h e r e .   There are a number of photographs which
27       were referred to in Police Constable Walton's statement
28       which are not here.
29   A   That's the one, and I haven't got that at all.
30   Q   You can come and have a look at it.       Do you really want
31       to?
32   A   Yes, please.
33   Q   I d o n 't know that I can do anything about giving you a
34       copy of that.     In fact,   I cannot.   You can ask the police
35       for that if you want to.
36   A   I have, sir, and they have stated they have given it to me
37       and they have not.       It's just ---
38   Q   It looks as if it has got lost.

    1   A   I haven't got a copy of that photograph either.                I haven't
    2       got a copy of that.
    3   Q   You've    got that one, I think,      haven't you?
    4   A   I have    got that one, yes.
    5   Q   Just help me.       Which is Andrew?         Is it that onethere?
    6   A   No.    Excuse me.     There he is.    That     is just like    a side
    7       version.     You can see his shirt       collar there.
    8   Q   You were able to identify that,          were you?
    9   A   Yes,     I think Mark Richards actually identified him on that
10          one.
11      Q   This is one here which       one of the police officers
12          identifies himself, but otherwise you really cannot see
13          anything much.
14      A   That is right.
15      Q   I think that is       either Plumridge       or Howells.
16      A   I have    got those photos.
17      Q   I am afraid mine are not any clearer.
18      A   No.
19      Q   That one you have got,       I think, haven't you?
20      A   That is correct, yes.
21      Q   And that is Howell and that is Plumridge.
22      A   I didn't know which policeman was which.
23      Q   You probably didn't have these markers.             That is Mr.
24          Johnston.
25      A   T h a t 's correct.
26      Q   And one of these others is probably                           |
                                                                          ?
27      A   That is                         Those two young men I am really
28          trying to find because I believe those two people there in
29          the Liverpool shirts, they were          the first to come        across
30          Andrew, and I think they would be able to give                me details
31          on how they found him and the timing they found him.
32      Q   I am afraid the police       have not been able to identify
33          them.
34      A   No, I am trying to do that myself.
35      Q   That is up to you, I think.          You have seen this one I
36          think, haven't you?
37      A   Yes.
38      Q   And that i             s        \
39      A   That is correct.


                                            11
 1       And I don't know whether we can identify any of the
 2       others?
 3       I believe that that could be a doctor, an unidentified
 4       doctor, and that is                       again.
 5   Q   This is the only other photograph I have got?
 6   A   Right.
 7   Q   And that is Police Sergeant Walton?
 8   A   That is correct.    May I show you the other photographs
 9       which I have got?
10   Q   Yes.
11   A   I have tried to put them in time sequence.          Right, there
12       is Andrew timed at 14.49.
13   Q   Which is he?    That is him there?
14   A   That is my brother there.    Now, this photograph        was sent
15       out to another lady, Joan Traynor.        Her son Christopher
16       who also died in the disaster, they were very similar and
17       looked alike.     When Joan received this photograph,       she was
18       told that was Christopher.        It isn't.   The reason why she
19       knew it wasn't Christopher is because he did not wear a
20       hat that day.     I know for a fact Andrew didn't wear a hat
21       either, and I would like basically to have the photograph
22       investigated because I believe somebody has superimposed
23       basically a hat on my brother.        My brother would never
24       wear a hat at all.
25   Q   I am afraid I cannot do this.
26   A   Yes, well,   I think I will do that myself.         That is14.49
27       as well.
28   Q   That is virtually the same picture, isn't          it?
29   A   Yes.   Obviously, you can see the crush.       It is quite -
30       very, very tight, and it isn't even 10 to 3.
31   Q   This is a BBC photograph is it?
32   A   I honestly don't know that at all.        That one you have got
33       that copy.     That is timed at 5 past 3.      This photograph is
34       quarter past 3.     As you can see, there are 27 police
35       officers there.     They are just standing around basically
36       twiddling their thumbs to be quite honest with you.           There
37       is obviously a very serious situation going on in this
38       area here.     I believe - I haven't seen it, but I have been
39       told - that these three police officers are on video and


                                      12
)

    1       they can be seen to be pushing the fans back over the
    2       fence.     These are police officers who should be getting
    3       these people out, and they are just standing there.          That
    4       is a neglect of duty, that is.        That was timed at 15.15.
    5       Apparently, there was meant to be an ambulance which is,
    6       on I believe, at 13 minutes past 3.        There is no signs of
    7       an ambulance there at all, so I believe really the
    8       timing - that's just another copy        of another one.    And
    9       again.     I think these are the ones, you have got copies of
10          those there.      I think you have got that one as well.
11          These are other sequences of the way Andrew was, you know,
12          brought across the pitch.
13      Q   And these are referred to, I suspect, in Police Sergeant
14          Walton's statement.
15      A   Yes,   I believe they are actually.
16      Q   I have not got those.    I think theposition     was   that they
17          didn't put all these pictures on this file.        They simply
18          put the best ones.    They are referred to in the evidence.
19          Have you see this thing?
20      A   Yes, I have.
21      Q   You will see that in this - here, for example,Police
22          Constable Walton says what he did.       Numerous photographs
23          including those two showing Brookes receiving
24          resuscitation on the pitch.      I think those are the best
25          photographs probably.
26      A   To go back to that actually, Peter Walton       never did
27          resuscitate Andrew and he never attempted       resuscitation.
28      Q   I know that is a point you made in your written submission
29          but we'll come to that in a moment.       At any rate, what
30          other photographs do you attach importance to?
31      A   Also that is a body of another person. I believe that the
32          police were not sending out photographs of other bodies.
33          Now, I don't know why they sent me that one.        Andrew is up
34          there, which you can't see.      The only reason I know that
35          is because of the number 50 there.       That is Raymond
36          Chapman.    They said they have never sent photographs out
37          which show the bodies, and that is one typical example.
38      Q   They may have made a mistake.
39      A   They've made quite a few mistakes,      haven't they, really?


                                        13
 1   MR.   BONE:     The whole thing was a mistake!
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           I cannot investigate every single
 3         mistake that is made, you know.            I am afraid you cannot
 4         really expect me to do that.             These are all a series of
 5         photographs.
 6   A     Now, one thing which I would like to make you aware of,                    I
 7         believe if you look at my brother's hand there which is
 8         like clenched ---
 9   Q     Where?
10   A     There.     That is on one photo.         From what       and
11         have told me, this next sequence, that is DE116 and that
12         is DE117, Andrew's hand falls limp like that.                        has
13         told me that somebody said,            "He's stopped breathing" and
14         then placed him down into the centre circle and began
15         resuscitative measures.          So when they came across Andrew,
16         Andrew was still alive.          He was breathing, and I think
17         that proves that Andrew was still alive, because his hand
18         is like that one moment.
19                  If you collapse, you automatically go limp, and it
20         proves that, and that is the person who has actually said,
21         "He's stopped breathing."          When Andrew was placed to the
22         ground these two police officers then went back and joined
23         the cordon on the football pitch.
24                 Police Officers are trained in first aid.         When that
25         person said,        "He's stopped breathing" they literally
26         walked away - literally walked away to joint the cordon.
27         They knew there wasn't any fighting going on. I mean, the
28         only fighting my brother did that day was for his life.
29         So that is another thing I would like to say about the
30         police.     That is definite neglect of duty.
31                 There's no sign of a policeman.         Peter Walton is
32         nowhere around.        He didn't attempt resuscitation.         In
33         fact, Peter Walton was the one who sealed Andrew's fate
34         basically.         He pulled           up ---
35   Q     I thought you told me that that was a doctor?
36   A     It is.     Well,    I believe it is;      that is an unidentified
37         doctor.      I don't know who that doctor is at all.           Another
38         thing:     Andrew could not have been found until at least
39         3.25.     Andrew was still alive at least at 20 to 4.            He was


                                             14
 1       being sick on the football pitch at 10 to 4.              I received
2        three photographs from South Yorkshire Police, and they
3        are stating that Andrew was in the gym and certified dead
4        between 10 to 4 and quarter past 4.         I have got the exact
 5       time of death, and number two, it is impossible for Andrew
 6       to have been in that gym at 10 to 4.         Peter Walton
 7       certainly did not attempt resuscitation ---
 8   Q   Well, you know, it is all very well you making these
 9       assertions.      I can only go on the evidence which is
10       presented to me.      I have got the evidence of Mr. Walton.
11       I have carefully studied it.          He says that he did attempt
12       to resuscitate Andrew, and there is a photograph which
13       shows him - that one there -
14   A   He has got his arms round the doctor.          He's not
15       resuscitating my brother.
16   Q   I am sorry.      If you think that that is proof that he        was
17       not attempting to do it ---
18   A   I have got two witnesses who have said,               and
19       have both stated categorically that Peter Walton never
20       once attempted ---
21   Q   I am sorry.      Perhaps you would like to sit down, and        don't
22       get too excited.
23   A   I am n o t .
24   Q   I have got the police statements from the two witnesses,
25       Mr.              and Mr.               and I have read what they
26       say.    If there is further evidence from them,       I need it in
27       the form of a signed statement.          I cannot accept just a
28       statement from you to that effect.          Miss Adlington,    surely
29       you have appreciated this for some time.          In so far as I
30       am going to have evidence,        I must have at least a signed
31       statement ---
32   A   Sorry to interrupt,        I have got another statement.
33   Q   ---    if this is evidence which in some way adds to or is
34       contrary to what these witnesses have said before.
35   A   Actually,      I have got a witness statement which obviously
36       you wouldn't have because it wasn't supplied to South
37       Yorkshire Police.       It deals with Andrew still being alive
38       at 3.25.




                                          15
 1   Nothing that I have read in the body file suggests that is
 2   so.      So if there is some evidence to that effect then
 3   please let me have i t .
 4   I need             and        to make statements then, don't I.
 5   OK.
 6   Would you like to look at what                         said in his
 7   statement at the time?           It is page 2.    Towards the bottom
 8   of the p a g e :
 9         "I went from the small pen on to the pitch through
10         the gate.          When I got on to the pitch I saw a young
11         lad staggering around.            I tried to help him.        After a
12         while he seemed to be all right and I let him go.                   I
13         then saw a policeman who I later found out was Pete
14         Walton.       He was standing by a man who was lying on an
15         advertising board and looked unconscious."
16   In fact, we think he is mistaken about that at this stage.
17         "I picked up one end of the board and PC Walton
18         picked up the other end.            Also helping was a man I
19         found out to be                          We carried the man on
20         the board, and as we got to the half way line,
21         somebody said 'H e 's stopped breathing'.            We
22         immediately put him down and decided to give the kiss
23         of life.       PC Walton was checking his pulse, and I
24         said to            |, 'Try and give him heart massage' .        I
25         kept breathing into him           until I couldn't any more.            I
26         was physically sick ..."            and so on.
27   A doctor came over and asked            them to carry on but then he
28   said that he was dead.           That is his evidence.        He is
29   mistaken about Sergeant Walton helping to pick them up.
30   Both w h e n a n d | s a w                their statements - they
31   have actually highlighted it as well ---
32   People do make mistakes.           Then                  sa y s :
33          "I saw a man lying on his back with his shirt open
34          exposing his bare stomach.           He was unconscious but I
35         wasn't really sure if he was dead or not.                 I had just
36          thought I had better get some help because there was
37          nobody with him. I got him on to an advertising board
38          to use as a stretcher with somebody else.                Then we
39          carried him down towards the kop end and we put him


                                        16
1               down but there was    no-one there to give him any help.
2               Then I saw someone    giving mouth to mouth and heart
3               massage and realised that because this man wasn't
4               breathing we'd have to do that ourselves.       I started
 5              giving heart massage and the other lad, who I now
 6              know is                      was giving mouth to mouth
 7              resuscitation.   We were doing that for a few minutes
 8              and we just didn't    want to give up.          ]was sick.
 9              At the same time a man who said he was a      doctor and
10              he did the heart massage and told me what to d o .
11              After a short while the doctor said,      'It's too late'.
12              We had been joined by a police officer who gave his
13              name as Peter Walton.    I broke down ... " and so on
14       That is what he says.       Mr. Walton in the undated one which
15       I think you say is dated 4th June, the relevant part is
16       page 3:
17            "I was with these two for some time before I moved
18              towards a man brought across on a stretcher.        His
19              face was purple and he appeared dead.       I could not
20              detect a pulse beat.     A doctor indicated we could try
21              reviving him so I gave mouth to mouth whilst another
22              fan pumped his chest.     After some time, the doctor
23              returned and indicated the man was d e a d ."
24       Righ t .
25   A   Yes.
26   Q   Then, in what may have been an earlier statement, one
27       dated 26th May, on the second page:
28              "I then saw a male person being carried out by about
29              eight fans and then placed on the ground.        The man
30              appeared dead.   His face was purple.      A doctor came
31              over and after feeling his pulse indicated that we
32              should try to revive him.       One of the Liverpool fans
33              did chest massage while I gave him the kiss of life.
34              We did this for quite a few minutes, and I still
35              consider we were too late.       The doctor returned, and
36              after checking the man he indicated that he was dead
37              and there was nothing further we could d o .      The fan
38              who had been giving chest massage was angry about our
39               failure, and seeing bubbles from the man's mouth, he


                                        17
 1               wanted to carry on.     I told him it was merely m y
 2               breath coming out and that the man was dead.
 3               Everyone then left apart from the two fans who stayed
 4               with m e . They were very upset."
 5       That is what he says.       Then his subsequent statements are
 6       all to do with identification.
 7   A             and          tfhen they read their witness statements,
 8       they said that wasn't how it happened at all, and this is
 9       another concern of mine, the way witness statements were
10       actually taken.
11   Q   Whose witness statements?
12   A                             actually;
                  s and even mine, actuallv;            s and        I's.
13       Things have been put into these statements and worded in a
14       way which wasn't actually correct.          I have spoken to and
15       seen)           and     | and I didn't mention anything about
16       the witness statements, and they both said the same.           As
17       soon as they read their statements,         "It didn't happen like
18       that and I d i d n 't say that."
19       I am sorry, but you know, they are grown men, these
20       people.     They signed statements.     Each statement has at
21       the top of it:        "This is statement consisting of   [so many]
22       pages, each signed by me, is true to the best of my
23       knowledge and belief, and I make it knowing that if it is
24       tendered in evidence I shall be liable to prosecution if I
25       have wilfully stated anything in it which I know to be
26       false ..." and so on.        Then they sign it as being correct
27       at the end.        I am well aware that when a statement is
28       being made the language is often the language of a police
29       officer rather than the language of the witness himself.
30       That is the way statements are very often taken.          I am not
31       really disposed to believe that what these people have
32       signed as being true is quite untrue.
33       A typical example of mine is I didn't even know I had made
34       a witness statement.        I was 17.   I was only a minor at the
35       time.     This witness statement which I have signed is dated
36       26th April which is the next day after my brother's
37       funeral.        There are two things in this witness statement,
38       and I know - I can be a million per cent certain on it -
39       that I have never ever stated that Andrew was wearing


                                         18
 1       black Puma trainers.     Andrew never possessed a pair of
 2       black Puma trainers.      I used to go and buy his trainers
 3       with him, and he only ever wore white Diadora or Ellesse
 4       trainers.     There is no way whatsoever I would have ever
 5       said he was wearing Puma trainers.         It doesn't matter how
 6       upset I was about my brother dying.         I know for a fact
 7       that I would never, ever have stated that, because I would
 8       never have even known of black Puma trainers.          There is a
 9       lot of crossing out in my statement, and I don't ever
10       remember ---
11   Q   Have you got the original statement?
12   A   Yes, I have.     It does look like my signature as well.            I'm
13       not saying the signature isn't my signature, but I was
14       never interviewed to make a witness statement.           It is on
15       the first page.
16   Q   Do you mean to say you were never interviewed?
17   A   No, never.
18   Q   How did you come to sign this witness statement?
19   A   This is a concern I have got.        I was never told.       Fair
20       enough,     I was going through a terrible time.       I had just
21       lost my brother.      It was never ever said,    "Louise, can we
22       interview you regarding Andrew."
23   Q   Is it your signature?
24   A   It does look like my signature.        Yes, it does.
25   Q   I mean,    I cannot investigate complaints against the
26       police.      I really can't.   So far as I am concerned, your
27       statement here really has no relevance to my enquiry at
28       all.      You must appreciate that.'
29   A   Yes, I do.
30   Q   If you have got complaints against         the police - it    is much
31        too late now - the only thing to do is to make acomplaint
32        to the Police Complaints Authority and they will
33        investigate it.     I cannot possibly investigate this.
     A    The point I am actually trying to make though is that the
          police who wrote these witness statements have actually
          put in a sequence of events which ties in with everybody
          else's witness statements.         It is so strange that there is
          no photographic evidence showing Peter Walton attempting
          resuscitation on Andrew.      Nothing at all.     But his


                                        19
 1         statement is he resuscitated Andrew.                    and
 2                           joth state that he never attempted
 3         resuscitation.
 4   Q     They don't say so in the statements that I have.       If you
 5         have got statements to that effect, then I should like to
 6         see them.    I have to tell you that I can't wait
 7         indefinitely for these statements.     I indicated in July
 8         that if anybody had any important evidence they wanted to
 9         give me, then they should do so.     I said so again when I
10         met the families in Liverpool.     Miss Adington has known
11         this for many months now, and I really cannot hold up my
12         inquiry by late delivery of further statements.
13   A     No, but I thought the photographs would actually     prove
14         that Peter Walton did not attempt resuscitation.
15   Q     I am afraid it does not prove that to m e .
16   A     I think we'll move on to the next matter because      I have
17         quite a bit really which ---
18   Q     I am afraid I haven't got very much more time so     we had
19         better get a move on.
20   A     Right, OK.    Video recordings of the mortuary.     This is a
21         high concern on my list, this one.     May I show you some
22         photographs, please?
23   Q     Yes.
24   A     I specifically asked for six photographs of VRM2 timed at
25         between 0208 and 0212 inclusive and 0217.     I have received
26         this one, this one and this one.     There is no times on the
27         video which I believe have been deleted off.
28   Q     Has what?
29   A     Has been deleted off the video.
30   Q     I don't think this video has timers.
31   MR.   BONE:   It doesn't have them, Sir Murray.
32   A     PC Greenway actual told me that, that they were actually
33         reading out times stating when people were certified dead
34         etc.
35   MR.   BONE:   It has a sound track on which the officer will say,
36          "This is now 1605 hours.   I am in the gymnasium."
37   A     Well, Ken Greenway has then said in one conversation that
38          there was somebody stating times, and the video which we
39          have got the times announcements have been deleted off the


                                       20
1        video so there is no way of knowing what times these w e r e .
2        With regards to these three photographs anyway, that           is a
3        view by Peter Walton, supposedly, and that is a view by
4         Peter Walton, supposedly.       I cannot see Peter Walton on
 5        that photograph.     Peter Walton was wearing leather
 6        trousers, bikers boots and a long jacket.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     He was behind people.
 8   A   Yes, that's right.      Regarding to Peter Walton's witness
 9        statement, he states that he can be seen in this video
10        with Andrew.
11   Q   Which is Andrew?
12   A   That one is Andrew,     yes.     And Peter   Walton is not in that
13        vide o .
14   Q    I don't think Mr. Walton is going to misidentify himself,
15        is he?
16   A    But he is not on there at all.          Those three photographs
17        which they sent me, they do not refer to the six
18        photographs I have actually requested.
19   Q   Which ones have you requested?
20   A   Timed at 0208.
21   Q    Are these ones referred to in Mr. Walton's statement?
22   A   That is correct.
23   Q   Right.      Shall we just have   alook     at thatstatement   so   I
24        understand which ones you are talking about?
25   A    I think it was also referred to in the mini Inquest          with
26        the other times.     The one photograph in Peter Walton's
27        statement refers to timed at 0217.
28   Q   There is one here,      VRM2.
29   A   That is correct.
30   Q            "I later removed the body assisted by two civilians,
31                the one in the red and white hat and the one in the
32                cream jacket ... "
33        The one in the red and white hat we know is Mr. Johnston.
34                " ... and a Nottingham police sergeant wearing a
35                yellow jacket, to the gym.       I viewed videotape VRM2
36                and the time reference is 0208 to 0212."
37        That is not, in fact, a real time.          That does not mean
38        eight minutes past two.
39   A    No, I queried that with PC Ken Greenway.


                                          21
  o    1    |   q                 »I can identify the same body which is shown lying                            on
       2                          the floor.       The face is covered and the trousers
       3                          pulled up.       This, in fact, I did to tidy the body up.
       4                          I have seen a photograph of the deceased,                    Andrew
       5                           Brookes.      This is the same man to which I made
       6                           reference throughout this and my previous statement.
       7                           I have b e e n s hown a p h o t o g r a p h of the c l o t h i n g w o r n
       8                           by Brookes on the day in question.                  This is the same
       9                           clothing worn by the man to which I have made
      10                           reference.       I have been shown photograph PR1H10                  ..."
      11                    - I don't know what that is -
      12                           "... which shows a man alive in the Leppings ..."
^ ,   13                    I   see.   The only VRM photographs that he refers to                     - well,
      14                    I suppose he has seen the videotape. He doesn't identify
      15                    himself there.        He simply identifies the body.
      16        A           There are others which he actually states he can be seen
      17                    in these pictures.
      18            Q       Says that he can be seen in the pictures?
      19            A       Yes.
      20            Q       Well, where do you find that?                (Pause)     That seems to be
      21                    the only reference to VRM2 that I can see.
      22            A       I think it's in the mini Inquest.
      23                Q   That would be probably Inspector Layton.                      (Pause)     I think
      24        I           we had better move on.             He doesn't say in his evidence
      25                    that he identifies himself in these photographs, but he
      26                    identifies the body of your brother.
      27                a   I will have to look into this again because I can't find
      2     8               anything at the moment.
      29                Q   What is the next point?
      30                a   Well, they have got black bin liners over their heads and
      31                    they had not been certified dead by the doctor then.
       32                   Basically, if they have not been certified dead, how did
       33       I           they know they were dead?              Why did they put bin liners
       34       I           over their heads and they haven't been certified dead by
       35                   the doctor?
       36               Q   What time do you say this photograph is?
       37               a   Apparently,       it is supposedly between 10 to 4 and quarter
       38                   p ast 4.
       39               Q   Where do you get that from?


                                                                   22
1     A       From the letter which PC Ken Greenway sent there.
2     Q       They were certified dead between those times. These are
3             the ones you have just shown me, are they, these prints?
4     A       Those are, yes.
5     Q       Do they show bin liners over their heads?
6     A       Yes, they do.
 7    Q       Oh yes, that one certainly does.
 8    A       As we know, Dr. Bull could not have been      in the   gymnasium
 9            at 10 to 4 because he was examining 40 bodies and
10            resuscitating a dozen bodies which I have stated to you
11            before.     It is impossible for anybody to have done ----
12    Q       Where was he resuscitating 40 bodies?
13    A       On the football pitch.     It is just impossible for
14             anybody ---
15    Q        I am seeing Dr. Bull.     I will hear what he says about
16             th i s .
17    A        Yes, it will be very interesting.
18    Q        A lot of people say it is not possible - nobody with any
19             medical experience has said this to me, but they don't
20             believe Dr. Bull could have done what he said when he says
21             he did.    That is something that I shall inquire into.
22    A        Right.     For instance, body numbering.   Andrew was body
23             number 50.     Referring to Andrew Sefton who he is actually
24             lying next to my brother, he was body number 61.         Dr.
25             Redgrave was the one who certified Ian Glover dead.            Ian
26             Glover is two    persons away from Andrew.    Dr. Bull
27             certified Andrew dead who is body number 50.          Then in Dr.
28             Bull's statement he states he went and examined a row.
29             Dr. Redgrave went through one row and Dr. Bull went
30             through another row.     How come that Andrew and Ian were on
31             the same line    two bodies away from each other and
32             basically the    two doctors were working on the same row.
33        Q    Which are the two?
34        A    That is Ian Glover.     Dr. Redgrave apparently has certified
35              Ian Glover dead, and Dr. Bull certified my brother dead.
35              There is just one body between them.      In Dr. Bull's
 37             statement, Dr. Bull actually states that he went along one
 38             row and Dr. Redgrave went along another row.         So that is
 39             conflicting itself.


                                            23
 1   Q   Are you suggesting really that Dr. Bull did not look at
 2       these bodies at all?     Are you really suggesting that?
 3   A   No, what I am suggesting is I don't think it happened the
 4       way Dr. Bull has described it as happening.        I am so
 5       baffled, to be quite honest with you, how they did the
 6       body numbering because I just don't understand how one
 7       person is body number 61 (that was Andrew Sefton who was
 8       lying next to Andrew) and then my brother is body 50.          I
 9       would have thought that the way they were carried into the
10       gym they would automatically have been placed down ----
11   Q   That might have been a very sensible way of doing it but
12       that is not the way they did it.        I really cannot base a
13       conclusion on the fact that because they didn't them down
14       in numerical order that in some way these witnesses are
15       telling lies which seems to be what you are inviting me to
16       do.
17   A   How can they?    I think what I am trying to say basically
18       is that in Dr. Bull's statement he is saying he went along
19       a row and examined the bodies and certified them ---
20   Q   I have that point now.     I will look at that point and I
21       will ask Dr. Bull about it.
22   A   So when they were certifying the bodies, they were
23       actually giving them     body numbers.     There's no labels on
24       these bodies here to     show the body numbers.    Also Andrew
25       wasn't identified until 5 to 11 that night by John Harris.
26       They had no name.    Andrew had no identification on him
27        that day because Andrew didn't drive.       So basically there
28        is no body number on    Andrew there.     That is one thing I
29       would like to say.       Number two, he had not been certified
30        dead then, and he has got a bin line over his face.
31   Q   You made that point.
32   A   Until you are certified dead, nobody knows that you are
33        actually dead until the doctor comes round and certifies
34        you dead.   I would like to know why some families have got
35        times of death when my brother hasn't.       You know,    I mean
36        when a doctor ---
37   Q   They have not.   A certification of death merely means that
38        somebody is dead by that time.        In some cases the body may
39        have been dead for months;        obviously not in this


                                       24
1        particular instance.      The fact that a body is certified
2         dead at 415 doesn't mean to say that the body died at 415.
3         It may have been dead for half an hour but has not been
4         certified by a doctor at that time.       You can't conclude
 5        anything,    I am afraid, from the time of certification of
 6        death other than at that time the person is dead.           That is
 7        all.
 8   A No, but I do not believe that those photographs are
 9        between 10 to 4 and quarter past 4.
10   Q    I am sorry.     I can't help your belief about that.
11   A    I think it proves really that was a lot later than quarter
12        past 4.     If you see from the photographs, they have
13        actually cordoned the gym off.     The bodies were hot
14        starting to be taken out of the terraces until 315-330.
15        It takes time to set up a temporary mortuary.         I don't
16        know the name of the police officer, but one police
17        officer who had the authority to use the gymnasium as a
18        temporary mortuary,    it all takes time.      He had to get the
19        authority to set that up as a temporary mortuary and it
20        all takes time.     Referring to Dr. Bull, like I say,       I
21        strongly, strongly believe, that it is just so impossible
22        for that man to have examined 40 bodies and attempted
23        resuscitation ---
24   Q    I have got this point.     You have made it a number of
25        times.      I have got another appointment in ten minutes
26        time, so if there is anything else you want to deal with,
27        can we get on and deal with it.        You have written a long
28        letter to me which I imagine you probably had some help
29        with, did you?
30   A    Only a little bit.
31   Q    That is very helpful.     I am glad you did.     It is, if I     may
32        say so, very well put together.        It has enabled me to
33        examine the things that you are saying and I can see
34        whether I think they are correct, or n o t .       I have found it
35        helpful to have it set out like that.          I am not saying I
36        agree with everything you say happened;          I don't.    That
37        is another matter.      Unless there   is anything else, any
38        other point that you want to expand on that you raised in




                                        25
 1         your letter,     I think we have probably covered the ground
 2         very fully.
 3   A     I think I will just leave it.
 4   Q     If you want to say anything more in writing, anything
 5         further on this, please I must ask you to let me have it
 6         by the end of next week because I cannot indefinitely
 7         extend this inquiry.         I have already been on it for
 8         several months, and I have got to report - I am proposing
 9         to report to the Home Secretary - by Christmas time.              So I
10         cannot go on receiving endless bits and pieces,          if I can
11         put it like that.          You have made, if I may say so, very
12         clear submission in writing which I have found helpful as
13         I have said.
14   A     That is where I had my help actually, trying to keep it
15         sharp and straight to the point rather than go round all
16         the houses actually.
17   Q     If I may say so, that is rather more helpful to me.          Thank
18         you very much indeed.         Well, we will leave it like that
19         then, shall we.
20   A     Could I ask for Andrew's body file.          I haven't got a full
21         copy of Andrew's body file.           I really would like that.
22   Q     You have now got everything that is on the body file.
23   MR.    BONE:      That's the body file.
24   A      But I haven't got everything what y o u 've      got.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          You have.
26   A     I haven't .     I haven't got some of those photographs.         The
27          Polaroid photograph.
28   Q     I can't give you that because it belongs to the police.
29   A     They won't release that to me.
30   Q     They won't at the moment because they have handed it over
31          to m e .
32   A      But they are saying        in a letter that they have sent me     a
33          copy, and they have        not sent me a copy of     Andrew's body
34          file.
35   Q     The photograph is the first photograph in the body file.
36          There are two photographs of his clothing.         I suggest you
37          write to them.      Say    that you asked me about it, that I
38          have indicated that        they won't be able to let you have
39          them until I return the body files to them.          I cannot keep

        1          shuffling these body files backwards and forwards.         They
        2         are very important documents.       I cannot send them b y post.
        3         They have to go by courier.       So they will not be able to
        4         send you a copy of that until they get it back.
        5   A     What they are saying to me    is that they have already sent
        6         me - and they have n o t .
        7   Q     They have sent you everything except those photographs by
        8         the sound of things.    Whether they have sent you the
        9         photographs and they have got lost, I don't know.          I can't
    10            help you about that.
    11      MR.   BONES:   What you should do, Louise,is send       a copy of that
    12            letter to me and say in the letter     that you   are sending a
    13            copy to m e .
    14      A     OK, thank you.
    15      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am afraid you won't get them
    16            until I have completed my inquiry and the documents go
    17            back to where they have come from.       It is not for me to
    18            give you copies of these things, but I don't see any
    19            reason why you shouldn't have one, and in due course you
    20            can have one as far as I am concerned, and I do not see
    21            why the police should refuse to let you have one.          Do
    22            please appreciate that the police are not going to get
    23            this file back until I have completed my report,       so it may
    24            be some time.
    25      A     I thought from the beginning that the police were going         to
    26            release all documentation to the families and it would
    27            help with their submission towards you.       You can only act
    28            upon information we give you, and the point I am making is
    29            if we are not receiving the information from South
    30            Yorkshire Police which we are not, then we cannot supply
    31            you with that information, and then you can't, you know --
    32
    33      Q     If I may say so, those three photographs are not relevant
    34            in any way to my Inquiry.
    35      A     But they could have been.    It could have been something
    36            what might have been relevant.
    37      Q     The only photographs which are relevant, or might be
    38            relevant, are the ones which you already have.       You




                                               27
actually have a great many more photographs than the ones
which are on this file.   Right.   Thank you very much.

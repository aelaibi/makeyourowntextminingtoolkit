         6.     About       10 m i n u t e s     into        the      match          there        was     a       considerable                 overflow

         of    people       onto       the     pit ch.          I would          say       there         were          about        60    or    70

         people       on    the      p i t c h at     that       sta g e .           After         that       a    policeman              ran    o nto

         the    pitch and made                 the    referee             stop       the    match.                I was       aware        that       there

         was    s t i ll    a    lot    of     crushing          at       the    Leppings               Lane       end       but     there       was

         s 1 ight ly m o r e        r oom at         ei t her      s ide        of    the        t wo    cent r a 3. pens .




         7.     I did       not     realise          that       people          were       still         coming          in f r o m        the       back.

         People       we re      still       trying        to    get       over       the        pe r i m e t e r       fence        and       then    it

         became       evident          that     there       was       a    lot       of    pushing            and       crushing           at    the

         back    of    the       terracing           and a       lot       of    people           were        being          hauled        up    to

         safety       by    people         in the         stand       above.              Well      o ver         a thousand              people       must

         have    been       on the         pitch      at     times.             I did       see,         at       one    stage,           police

         trying       to    prevent          people        from       getting             ouj/of         the       enclosures              or    over

         the    fenc e .         Then a di ff ere nt               procedure               was      adopted             by    the        police       and

         they    did       everything           possible           to      relieve          the         situation             and        assist

         people       to    get     out.                    CLAjr                                  IT? 0 / \ )

         the    terracing           either       by       getting          on    to       the     pitch           or    by    going        upwards          to

         the    stands          in o r d e r    to    escape.             After           about         £0 minute s,                the    p i t c h was

flooded         by    peo ple.           There       were          obviously           problems            since       there       were

po licemen and ambul an ce                         men    on       the     pitch       and    people          were      being       carried

off     on     stretchers.               A    cordon          of    police        officers            stood       across       a    certain

area      of    the     pitch       to       contain          supporters             I presume.               A   l a rge     number          of

police         were     assisting             people          in t r o u b l e .        It    seemed          to me      that

everybody            who   was      able       to    do a n y t h i n g          seemed       to      be    doing       it.        Members

of     th e    public      and      some       young          apprentice             footballers              in S h e f f i e l d

Wednesday            track     suits          were       hurrying           to a n d       fro w i t h a d v e r t i s i n g         boards

to     carry     the       injured           and    deceased             on.



9.      After        about     half          a h our      a    chap        I did       not    know         came    into       the

d i r e c t o r ’s box        and    informed             me       t hat    there       had      been       10 f a t a l i t i e s       and

that      the m a t c h was          to       be a b a n d o n e d .           However,          he     said      there       would

not     be an a n n o u n c e m e n t          for       sometime           as   th e      injured wou ld               be    dealt       with

fir s t .       Shortly        after          this       a drunken             Liverpool           supporter            accused          me    of

causing         the     situation             so    I went          into       the     d i r e c t o r ’s r oom         behind       the

scene.



"IQ.      I should         say      that       I was          interviewed              in the         prepsence          of    the       F.A's

Solicitor            by C h i e f    Superintendent                      Baker       and     Superintendent                  Fancott          on

the     9th     May     1 98 9 a n d         asked       questions             which       are     contained            in a

"seclected            persons        questionnaire.”                        I should          deal         with    answers          to

those         questions        that          I gave       in       interview           which       are      not    dealt       with       so

far.          I did     not    witness             any    disorder             around        the      ground.           However,          as       I

was     driving         about       a mile          or    two       frora/the          g round        I saw       one    yr    two       pubs

at     between        12.00 and              12.13 with             i'bts of         people        o u t s i de    dunking.




•11.      I did       not w i t n e s s        any       crowd       build        up    or    crushing            at    the    Leppings

Lane     entrance          nor      did       I see      any        of     the   turnstiles                in o p e r a t i o n .        I did

not     wintess         any    unauthorised                   entry        to a n y     part       of      the    ground.

12.      I did          not w i t n e s s      alcohol        being      brought         into    the    ground       or      being

consumed           inside        the       ground.




13.      1 did          not w i t n e s s      any     situation         which       I thought         at    the   time       was

of a d i s o r d e r l y         nature,        nor     did    I see         any    incident        in the     standing

area     of    the w e s t          stand      which      I believe           could      h ave   contributed            to    the

disaster.



14.      I did          not    see     anything         which       I believe         was    directly         concerned

with    the        breaking          of a b a r r i e r       in    pen 3.         Nor     did   I see a n y       unusual

crowd     surge          in e i t h e r      pen 3 or         pen 4,          I did      not a s s i s t     any   of     the

deceased           or    the     injured.            I did     not      witness       any    ac t   by s u p p o r t e r s

which     obstructed                th e    poilce      stewards         or m e d i c a l    persons,          I did         not

witness        anything             that     I consider            to   be    a    criminal      act    nor    have       I ever-

been    at     or       ha d   direct        experience            of a n y       otiw     football         tragedy.          I

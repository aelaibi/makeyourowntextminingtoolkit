            At 8.45 am Saturday,    15th April 1989, I paraded for duty at Woodseats

            Police Station.    From there together with other officers I was

            transported to the Sheffield Wednesday FC ground at Hillsborough

            where at 9.45 am we were briefed with regard to our duties that day

            in connection with the F .A. Cup semi final involving Liverpool F.C.

            and Nottingham Forest.

            I was allocated a serial under the command of S g t . 1288 Payne taking

            up duties   at 11.15 am which were to police the turnstiles at the

            Leppings Lane end of the ground which gives access to the West Stand

            and also to tjie,_ standing terrace at the rear of Leppings Lane goal.

            Our duties Were the supervision of persons entering the ground

            including a search of persons for intoxicants and offensive weapons

            at entrances A to G.

            At approximately 1.30 pm Sgt. Payne and two other officers who I

            believe were from Hackenthorpe Police Station detained a coloured

            youth and a wh~t4^girl and went to the prisoner reception area under

            t^e^North S t g ^ - t o g e t h e r with PC 963 Evans El and one other officer

            I CQntl^SedJ ^v~"all^cyted duties.

            At 1415 hrs the crowd became more dense with large queues forming at
 the turnstiles.       At this stage I formedSthe impression that large

 numbers of persons had arrived without tickets due to enquiries from

 supporters at the turnstiles.

 At 1430 hours the crowd pressure at the turnstiles was becoming

 intense and I could see a large build up of supporters backing up
                              —.   -------— v4c:3Jx)<,tt\7s
 from my position into Leppings Lane.         At this time X could see

 children and females becoming distressed due to the crush.

 At 1440 hours the crowd pressure was so great that a number of

 persons       assisted from the crowd complaining of being crushed.

 At this time I was aware only of being accompanied by PC Evans.                 At

 this time we were unable to communicate with either ground control or

/any supervisory rank as we were not equipped with a radio and Sgt.

 Payne had not returned to our location.

 At 1445 hours we were joined by Inspector Purdy who seeing the

 gravity of the problem we were having at the turnstiles instructed PC
                                           /'         -      •
 Evans and myself to leave the turnstiles and Join him at the side of

 entrance ’A ’ alongside which runs an iron barrier.             We assisted in

 the removal of distressed persons at this location.                 I saw at this

 time a police horse and rider trying to assist in pushing the crowd

 back from the turnstiles but the pressure was so great that the horse

 seemed trapped i n the<rush.

 Large numbers of Liverpool supporters were now becoming extremely

 agitated and were screaming for the large exit gates to be opened as

 people were being crushed at the entrance to the turnstiles.                 At this

 time I was concerned that the walls surrounding the turnstiles would
                   /                                                     •
               V
 give way so great was the crowd pressure.

 At approximately >452 hours I saw the exit gates open.                They remained

 o p e n f o r what seamed on$.y seconds and were then closed again.           This

 relieve^’tHe^pressure at the turnstiles to a manageable degree.                 I

 had noticed that when on inspector Purdy's instruction I had left the
         turnstile# I had had                   to climb over the ^urnstile and   into the ground

         and then vpags out of                  the exit gate that, t„he exit gates were not

         locked but were opened by operation of a catch which can be reached
            U £ . t \ s \ { \ rt\
         from the inside of the gate only.                   No keys were required to unlock

        the gate through which I passed.
                                ------- _ --- * .^  ,A O
        After the gates had been again closed persons were still climbing

         over the walls into the ground.

         I formed a definite opinion that a deliberate effort on the part of a

         sectior^:2^                the crowd   had been made to cause chaos at the turnstiles

%        so that persons could gain entry without tickets.                     A large majority

        of the crowd that I encountered after 1430 hours had been drinking to

        various degrees.

        At 1505 hours on the instruction of ground control I attended on the

        playing area at the rear of the Leppings Lane goal.

         On my arrival at the fenced area behind the goals I could see that a

         large number of persons at the front of the crowd w e r e i n j u r e d and

         that a number of these seemed to be dead.

         For approximately 40 minutes I assisted with the movement of dead and

         injured persons from this area onto the playing area.                      I assisted

        with the removal of a number of obviously dead persons ta the

        makeshift mortuary atcthe Hillsborough gymnasium.

        At approximately 1600 hours I was directed back to the turnstile area

         at the rear of the West Stand where I was again engaged in assisting

        with injured and dead persons.

         At 1730 hours I/attended a de-briefing in the North Stand and was

         eventually returned to Woodseats Police Station where I terminated

         duty at 1900 hours.

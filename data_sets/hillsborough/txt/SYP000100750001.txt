Police Inspector




At 9.00 a.m. on Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Force Headquarters for

deployment       in       connection       with    the     FA    Cup       Semi   Final       between     Liverpool       and

Nottingham Forest.

Together with several hundred other officers I attended a briefing given by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and other senior police officers in the North Stand at

Sheffield       Wednesday         Football       Ground,       Hillsborough.            Following       the    briefing     at

10.45    a.m.       I was       deployed    on     mobile       patrol      in    the    Middlewood,          Oughtibridge,

Deepcar       and     Stocksbridge          areas       with     instructions            to    watch      for     Liverpool

supporters approaching along the A616 route.                                Of the three mobile serials under

my command, I commenced patrol with Police Sergeant Hunt and his serial.

For two hours we maintained a patrol along the A616, paying particular attention

to licensed premises              along     the route.          Throughout this time there was a steady

stream of vehicular traffic apparently bringing fans to the football match.                                               Some

public houses          appeared to be well               frequented by football supporters but during

this period I did not encounter any trouble.

At 1.42 p.m.          together with Sergeant Hunt, I visited licensed premises known as

The     Silver      Fox    at    Stocksbridge.          These     premises         were       crowded    with     Liverpool

supporters       who      were    drinking        and   who     were       in   very    high    spirits,        singing    and

shouting.        As I left the premises I spoke to the licensee who said that the fans

were    not   presenting          him with        a problem.       I told him that              if they continued to

consume drink it was unlikely that they would be admitted to the football match.

As     the    time     for      the   match       approached,          I    deployed      progressively          nearer     to

Hillsborough          and at about 2.30 p.m.                we positioned our vehicle                   in a side road,
COLIN RAYMOND WALKER                                       - 2 -                                        R273

just off the main road at Oughtibridge.                    By this time traffic travelling towards

Sheffield was much lighter than it had been and there                        were very fewfootball fans

still making their way towards the match.

It was our intention to go to Claywheels Lane Traffic Garage to take a meal at

3.15    p.m.   as    we   had      been    ordered       but   as    we   listened   to    the   UHF    radio

transmissions,       it became     increasingly clear that all                was not as it should be in

the vicinity of the football ground.                    Radio transmissions      began to be shouted in

an agitated manner and on several occasions over a five minute period I heard the

phrase "open the gate".            This phrase was repeated at least six times and on each

occasion there seemed to be more urgency in the voice of the person transmitting

the    message.     I have    no   idea        from whom   the     message   originated.   At    this   stage

however,    there was nothing to suggest that there was anything other than a busy

sporting event taking place.

Since    our pre-match duties were complete,                   I ordered the driver to make his way

towards the football ground and from there we would go to Claywheels Lane if we

were not required further.             Radio transmissions continued to be agitated and were

becoming confusing and unintelligible and it became increasingly apparent to me

that something serious appeared to be building up.

I approached the ground by way of Catch Bar Lane and turned left into Leppings

Lane.    There      was   a    group      of    about    six     police   officers   at    the   Catch     Bar

Lane/Leppings Lane junction and they gave the appearance of just having completed

their pre-match duties.

On approach to the turnstile area at the Leppings Lane end of the ground there

were still a few fans milling around but there was no crush and no disorder and

as a result of what I saw, I ordered my serial to remain in their vehicle whilst

I went to find out            if we were required for further duties. There seemed to be
COLIN RAYMOND WALKER                                            - 3 -                                               R273
sufficient police officers at the turnstile area to cope with late arrivals and

the fans were being addressed by an Inspector who was sitting on the roof of a

police Land Rover and using the vehicle’s public address system.                                           I asked Chief

Inspector       Waring     if   my   serial    was required             and at    first       he    said    that   he     had

nothing for us but it was clear that he himself did not know what the situation

was    inside     the ground.        Fans were still arriving in Leppings Lane at 2.55 p.m.

Many were waving tickets in the air and were behaving in a manner which indicated

that they had been drinking. For the number of fans that were in the area at that

time,    I would      say    that    there were       sufficient          police    officers         deployed      at     the

location. At some stage I was told that the ground was closed and that we were

required     to    prevent      further      fans   from    entering.            Together with          officers         from

Inspector Millett’s serial, we formed a cordon across the entrance and prevented

further fans, some of whom were waving tickets, from entering.

Superintendent Marshall then ordered that the area immediately to the rear of the

West Stand be cleared of fans as the area was becoming congested and we thought

that the game had been stopped for some reason which was as yet unknown to us.

As I went to the rear of the West Stand, I passed an ambulance which was parked

on    the   riverside       roadway        which    runs   round        towards     the    South       Stand.      Several

injured      people   were      being      attended    to at       the    rear     of   the    ambulance        and      as   I

strode      over one person I noticed               that he was receiving oxygen and that he was

blue    in the     face.        Inspector Millett          said "It looks as though he's a gonner."

This    person     was     receiving       attention       at    the     time    and    our        assistance      was    not

required there.           With hindsight I now realised that that person was already dead.

As we arrived at the rear of the West Stand near to the entrance to the tunnel,

it became clear to me that it was impossible to clear the area because there were

too many        injured     people    on    the ground.           We    would have        been driving uninjured
COLIN RAYMOND WALKER                                             -    H   ~                                        R273

people       over        the    top     of    people     who    were          apparently seriously       injured.        The

situation at             this stage was confused.               For some reason as yet unknown to me                     the

fans were approaching police officers and saying that it was all the fault of the

police.        In between various outbursts                     of violent abuse from the                fans,    many of

whom were drunk,               I attempted to assess the situation.                        Police officers and fans

were carrying injured persons up the tunnel from the terraces.                                         The injured were

strewn on the ground at the rear of the West Stand and I only began to realise

the real enormity of the situation when I turned round and saw that the head of

one    of    the    injured       had    been     covered      over       and he had been left unattended                and

quite apparently dead.                  This was the first time that I knew that someone had been

killed       and    from       that     point     on    it   became       apparent       that   many   people    had   been

killed.        Injured and dead fans were being carried out of the tunnel continually

and    taken        to    the    rear        of   the    Leppings         Lane     entrance.       I   gave     artificial

respiration to one full grown male person whose face was covered in thick vomit.

My impression was that I was pumping beer out of the body which showed no signs

of    life    at         any    time.    Eventually          I was        joined    by   an     ambulance       attendantwho

administered             oxygen for a short time but to no avail. I left the body and                                  went

to find someone who could still be helped and this was                                          the situation faced by

many officers at that location.                         The area was eventually littered with probably

about       15 bodies none            of which had a police                   officer in attendance.            I tried to

allocate a police officer to each body but I believe that I failed in this task

as the officers were                   eventually each         faced with life or death situations where

they may have been of help to someone who could be saved.

This was a very confused period during which I had little or no perception of

time        although       I     can     remember        several          times    automatically        looking     at    my

wristwatch, the time did not register.

At various        times during this period I saw and spoke to Superintendent Marshall,

Chief Inspector Waring, Inspector Millett, Inspector Bullas and Inspector Sykes.

We were later required to go onto the pitch and face the crowd, most of whom were

still    in     the    stadium.     During   the   time     that    I   was   on    the   pitch,    I remember

speaking to Superintendent Greenwood, Inspector Harper, Inspector Purdy and Chief

Superintendent Nesbit.

I remained in the stadium until it had been cleared of fans and later regrouped

together with about 200 officers in the briefing area of the North Stand.

By   this       time   all   the    officers    were      suffering      from      deep   shock    and     at   the

suggestion of Superintendent Brookfield I assisted in trying to identify Police

officers who required immediate help.

During the main part of this incident I never made use of the UHF radio system as

I judged        that   any   attempt    to have     done    so would have          been   futile.    The    radio

message     was    inaudible,       incessant   and    confused.        After being released from the

ground      I     assisted     in     general      policing        duties     including     organising          the

transportation of equipment for the Major Incident Room.

At 8.30 p.m. I went off duty at Force Headquarters.

                The    only obvious             entra n c e was     the    tunnel,,        We just went          to the

                nearest      entranee.             It was      not at all        obvious       that we     could filter                out

                It was     congested            on the       terraces.       This       is quite    usual?       just     before

                kick     off,      I w ou l d expect          it to be     congested.          Once     out     of the       tunnel

                we tried          to move       s i d eways    to the     right,        pushing    thro u g h    the     crowd.

                About £ minutes              later      the    crush happened.             we had m a n a g e d     to    push our

                way to the          right.        As    I got    further       over      to the    right      there was           no

                more     space.        We    had m a na ge d to get well                over   to the    right,        but       did not

                realise at the time                   that a 9 foot        high spiked          fence    prevented           us from

                going     further.           j. could        see space     to the        right t h r o u g h the       fence.

        W hen we had got                  further      in we          could feel              the    crush.         I saw a crash

        barrier            to our         right and tried to get                        in front       of     it.        I was      pulling

        crash barrier                the     pressure was               very bad         5    it was       coming        not    just       from

        behind but from all                     around.              We m a n a g e d        to move       sidyways           to a second

        crash barrier                until      we    got we d g e d tight.



        People were              scr e a m i n g all        around         us.          There was

people out.



It took me at                 least       10 m i n u t e s      to      recover       enough       from the         crush       to

then tried to find B r i a n again.                                  1 returned            to the    car      to see       if he

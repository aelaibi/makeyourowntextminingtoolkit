 Dear Sir,



                    On behalf of the members of the above named Club,I have been asked to

write to you and inform you that we feel your recent report on the tragic

^ circumstances of the Hillsborough Disaster was very fair and impartial.


                    We understand that this must have been a difficult undertaking and at

 times very harrowing. We hope that the recommendations will be acted upon

immedl*ily,so that we,the supporters,can continue to enjoy, our sport in comfort

 and safety.


                    Recent results have shown that the lessons seem to have been learned,

and for this we feel you should be congratulated.

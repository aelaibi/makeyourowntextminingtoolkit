T h a n k you for your letter of 6 O cto b e r about Lord Justice S tu a rt-S m ith 's
reported c o m m e n t during his recent visit to Liverpool.


I a m sorry th a t you w e re upset by th e Judge's c o m m e n t to M r Phil H a m m o n d .
T h e Judge has said on the record t h a t he deeply regrets this remark, w h ic h he
m a d e o ff-th e -c u ff and w ith o u t any intention to offend or for it to be taken
seriously. He has m ade it clear th a t the behaviour of the fans is not the subject
of th e Inquiry.


As y o u k n o w , the Judge spent three days in Liverpool m eeting the families of
th o s e w h o died and listening to their concerns.     He has said th a t he found th e s e
m e e tin g s fruitful and constructive, and th a t th e y will help him to w r ite his report.


I am satisfied th a t Lord Justice S tu a rt-S m ith will produce a thorough report in
w h ic h th e families and the public can have confidence. I am pleased th a t you
are to m e e t the Judge and grateful for the efforts you have m ade on this very
im p o rta n t issue.

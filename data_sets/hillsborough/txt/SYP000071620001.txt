  We got        to the      pub at about 2.20                  pm    (1420 hrs)      and we all        had a couple

  of    drinks and          left at about 2.33                  pm    (1433 hrs).         We star t e d to walk

  W h e n we a rr i v e d at L e p pi ng s Ln there were                       thousands      of    people about,

  there was          no   proper       queue,        there were         two    or three moun t e d        police

  It was        impossible         to see       the w a y into the turns t i l e s                because     of the

                 When      I got      in front         of it     I could see a man                 being    crushed against      it,

                  the    barrier was           digging         into his stomach,               he was       bent double       over       it.

                  I saw his face             had turned           purple,        people      immediately        in front of the

fence     to     lift her       over and         I saw her arms moving about                     in spasms.           The

only d e s c r i p t i o n   I can give           of this      girl       is that    she was wear i n g a

light     c olou r e d jumper,            jeans,      and black          shoes.

S ome    of the      crowd that had m a n a g e d to escape                   onto    the       pitch were       now

t rying     to    rip the       fence       up from the        bottom,       the    first       ones    that    tried

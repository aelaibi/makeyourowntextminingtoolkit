                          f r i end

            I travelled            in                      car    leaving            Liverpool          at     about        11am.       We    didn't

            stop anywhere               en     route      to    the    game,         but    were      delayed          by h e a v y      traffic

            over      the S n a k e s        P a ss .

            We    arrived        in S h e f f i e l d      at    about         1 . 3 0 pm   <1330).             I don't       know       where
                                                                                                                                       PAGE

the    car w a s        par k e d .           We     went       for    a drin k ,           I obviously               saw    people

drinking,             but    there           was     no    drunkq^ess, t h i s w a s                 in the           pub    but    I dont

know       its    name.                                                          \               _        ,
                                                                                                      L l
After       tha t      we w a l k e d         down        to    the    ground          ar>4^ing           there        at    about       2 . 3 0 pm

( 1 4 30).        Whilst          walking            there       we    received             no P o l i c e       escort       or

d ir e ct io n and           I saw           no     drunkness,             violent          behaviour            or    disorder.

The    queues          at    the       ground         were       fairly          lengthy        b u t no         crushing.             I knew

which       turnstiles              to       us e    having          beeh^ last          y e ar.      Thpe o n l y          officers        I

saw    outside          the       ground            were       a few       on    foot       a n d on e        on h o r s e b a c k ,

although          having          entered            the       ground       I was        searched.

When       I entered           the       ground           I handed          in m y       ticket       and        retained          the    stub.

 On    entering             the     ground           I saw       no    gates          open     or    being          opened       and     I saw

no a u t h o r i s e d       entry           to     the    ground.

Once       in the       ground           I d i d n ’t k n o w          exactly           where       to       sit,     but    we    asked           a

steward          and    he     directed              us,       after       that       I found        no       difficulty           finding

rny seat.

At    no    time       did     I see          the     tunnel          under          the W e s t     Stand and              can't      comment

on    its    policing             or     stewarding.                  Between          my    entry        point        and    my    seat        I

saw    no    disorder             and        I did        not    see a n y           consumption              of a l c o h o l     in the

I took       my       seat     at      2.45pm         (1445)          and       was    sitting        w ith my             brother

                      The    others           were        els&where             in th e      North        Stand.

There       waiNjrtothing              unusual            taking       piace          when      I t o o k m y seat.     But, I

became       aware \ h a t             there         was       some    crushing             g o i n g on b e h i n d the g o a l s to

my    right       in t he w e V t             Stand.

This       incident          slowly           got w o r s e           as    kick       off a r r i v e d         and       people      were

c l i m b i n g ou t        onto       the        pitch and           up    i nt o     the     seating           area       behind       them.

As    the    m a t c K was          stopped           I became             aware       that     people           were       seriously

injured          as    I cmH^d           see        people       lyi'h^around.

At a b o u t      3 . 2 0 pm      I decided               to    go    onto       the     pitch       to       see     if    I could       help

                         in a n y w a y     although            I'm not F i r s t             Aid    trained           I decided           I had          to    do

                         something          and ma na ge d             to    get    onto       the      pitch.           Irfis^ially I w a s               stopped

                         by a P o l i c e       Of f i c e h v b u t        I walked          further          down and           was\able           to    get       on.

                         On     the N o r t h S t a n d         sid)k of          the    penalty area                 I found        a    eol l a p s e d       fan

                         nobody       was      treating             him.      People          were      standing           round         looking          at    him,

                         one w a s       his    friend          I found           out    I asked          if a n y o n e      had        tried       to    revive

                         him and         they       said       they       hadn't.         At      this      stags^the             mans     lips       were        blue.

Whilst          out     on    the       pitch       I sa w P o l i c e       Officers           trying        resuscitation                but

I think          they        sometimes             gave    up to o        quickly and             if t h e y ' d       kept    going

they       may     have       saved a             few    lives.          They    were     passing            bodies      out

assuming           they were                dead and       not      trying       any    resuscitation.

The      officers            seemed more                concerned with               keeping        people        in the       pens,

this       was     at    the          very    start       of    the      incident.           The      Police        obviously

thought           it was          a    Ditch       invasion and            formed a          cordon          in f r o n t     of    the

                                                                                                ved     to    the L e p p i n g s       Ln

e n d .All       in all           the       Police       didn't       seem      to    re^fct to         the     incident           quick

Going          back     to    ti                               ar   at    the    corresponding                match.          The

Policing           outside             the    ground was            far    better,        everyone            was      lined       up

outside          the     ground and               more     horses         were       used,      t his      year     it w a s       just      a

mess.

I would          like        to       say    that       I feel      it was       wrong       of    the       photographers              to

ta k e     pictures           of       the    dead       and    injured when              instead            they      could       h ave

been       helping.

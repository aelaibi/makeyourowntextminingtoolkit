Dear Professor Maunder

I am enclosing as promised:

       (i)   the text of the talk which I gave to a recent Football
             League seminar in Birmingham on the role of the
             Football Licensing Authority;

       (ii) a copy of a reply given recently by Mr Patten setting
            out where we stood (two or three weeks ago) on matters
            arising from the Taylor Report. I have also sent this
            to Lord Justice Taylor;

       (iii)copies of the 2 press notices relating to the
            appointment of the Chairman and members of the Football
            Licensing Authority.

I am sorry that by oversight you were not sent a copy of the
draft revision of the Green Guide.    You told me that you had
received a copy from another source. We shall of course be very
happy to receive any comments which you have on the redraft, but
I think you will find that it picks up most if not all of the
proposals which arose from your own working group.

                                           Yours sincerely




                                           P E BOLTON

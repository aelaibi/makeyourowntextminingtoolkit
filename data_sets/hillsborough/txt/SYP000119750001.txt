                     At 8.20 a.m. on Saturday, 15th April, 1989, I paraded for duty at

(2^ /f    ^^^.^Hacke nth or pe Pol ice Station where I and a large number of other        ’E l '

                     and ’E2 ’ officers, boarded a hired SYT double decker bus and     from

                     there went to Hillsborough     football ground arriving there at 9.20 a.m

                     for the briefing at 10 a.m. in the North Stand.

                     I was previously aware that I was part of serial 16 and Police

                     Sergeant 1288 Payne was our serial Sergeant.      After the main briefing

                     we held a smaller briefing with our serial Inspector giving us more

                     detailed duties.

                     After a packed lunch we took up position on the Leppings Lane end

                     turnstlles.

                     At 12.05 p.m. approximately three of the turnstiles comprising of

                 A-G, were opened and I was         doubled up with another officer on one of

                     the turnstiles where we were searching all    the fans prior to them

                     going into the ground.     The fans who came early were happy and well

                     controlled and presented no problems.

                 At 1.40 p.m. a female,

                                          was searched upon entering the ground (attempting

                     to enter the ground) and was found to have cans of lager in her

handbag.      She, along with her boyfriend who was most abusive and who

refused to be searched, were arrested.       The female by myself and the

male by Police Sergeant 1288 Payne.       These prisoners were walked to

the Police Room along with Detective Constable Evans (El) and Police

Constable 620 Yates (El), who assisted u s .

After the female was booked In at the Police Room I was told that I

would have to sit her in a cell on the prison bus and remain with her

on the bus for the transfer later to Ecclesfield Police Station.          I

got onto the bus with the girl at about 2.15 p.m. and as 3 p.m.

neared, the bus began to get near full and the other officers on the

bus were expecting to be given the word to continue the journey to

’F 2 ' .   However, this was never given, which surprised the officers.

By the sound of the roar that we heard at 3 p.m. it was obvious that

the match had begun .     A short time later we noticed that injured

supporters were beginning to drift towards the gym area accompanied

by St. John’s Ambulance officers.      They were all walking wounded and

did not appear to be too badly injured however, within a few more

minutes more and more supporters were being brought to the gym a r e a .

Neither of us officers on the prison bus were in radio contact with

the control room and we did not hear any radio transmissions

whatsoever.

I was sent to go and see what was happening and I looked at the pitch

towards the Leppings Lane e n d .   I could see a mass of people on the

pitch at that end and a cluster of officers behind the goal m o u t h .

It appeared to me that there had been a pitch invasion and so I

returned directly to the prison b u s .

No sonner had I got back I saw officers and supporters alike running

with injured people on makeshift stretchers.       Soon there was total

chaos in the area .     The obviously dead and seriously injured were

littering the floor and were then being carried off into the gym.

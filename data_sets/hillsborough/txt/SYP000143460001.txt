I arrived at St. John Headquarters at just after    12.30 I then

travelled down on the first ambulance.

We arrived at the ground about    1300 and went straight to the first aid

room where we were told to go to the Leppings Lane end we went and sat

down on the stretcher which we had,   there were three adults and 4

cadets there I saw the players coming out before the match to warm

up then a steward beckoned me and I didn't notice him at first then

I realised he meant me I nudged my dad,    sat next to me and him and

another             went off half way there they told me and the other

Sergeant to come over when we got there I could see the people getting

crushed and the Police   pulling them out and those pulled out were

saying thankyou to the Police and telling them that there family was

in and to go and help them. Then my dad told me and the other cadet

to go back to the stretcher at the Leppings Lane end, where a

Liverpool   fan with a broken ankle was brought to us from the crush

after a while   I was told to take him down to the first aid room with

the other   cadet we put our shoulders under his arms and took him to

the first aid room where we put him on the bench and went back on the

field by now the field was full    I found my dad and he told me to go

and get some water because his bottle was empty he sent me back

thinking that I would stay. But I went back the other cadet was there

and we went outwith a stretcher to bring somebody in but we left      it to

a St Johns member who was more qualified than us I d i d n ’t see them

again because they went out into the Police bus.    I went back out on

the pitch to see if I could do anything on the field near the new cop

there was a man about twenty three on a stretcher with no one with him

there was a relative next to him and I asked him if she would like to
                                                                            PAGE      7

         go to the first aid station.   I picked one end of the stretcher up and

         the man picked up the other end he appeared to be drunk because he

         kept walking off,   finally we got there

         and put him down, and the man walked off then someone else took over       I

        was then called to go into the gym to assist but when I got in there

         I couldn't   cope because that was the mortuary   then I came out and went

         to a man which seemed to have broken his    ribs I made sure that the man

         didn't fall off and kept his head to one    side then at the same time

         talking to a man on an advertising board which had     broken his hips

         and reassured them until the ambulance took them away then gave a

         blanketto a man that needed it by then the rush was over and I had a

         drink of coffee.

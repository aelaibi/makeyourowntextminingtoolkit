                pm    (20G0 hrs)        as a civil\an/ v a n            driver         on the Liverpool                              - N o tt i n g h a m

               Forest Semi            Final    Football    Match at Hillsborough,                                     Sheffield.

                I commenced duty at Main St,                     R o th er ha m then a t t en d ed the B ri gh t si d e Ln

               Station,          S h ef fi el d for a briefing of our                    duties            for that                   day.       I was

                de tailed        to drive      the    van around the PC's                 static                 points a ro un d the

                ground to take their                 refreshments.

                                                                                                 SS92

I completed one           refreshment        run during         the morning,       covering    static

point    officers        from the Ml        into H i l l s b o ro u gh Ground.       At about 2.3 0            pm

(1430 hrs)        as    I drove    down the Halifax Rd at               its junction with S o ut he y

G r e e n Rd    I noticed a large           group of fans outside            the    public house

s i t uated there.         They were        drinking      from glasses,         bottles and     cans.

As    I tried to drive to Penni st on e Rd                 I noticed that          outside most       of

the    public     houses    there were again           large      crowds    of football       fans.        I

c o u l d n ’t say which        club they belonged to.              The y were      packed from the

pub entrance           to the    roadside.        1 had to drive         very     carefully,    if

someone        from the back       had    pushed the ones at            the front w ould have

fallen     into the       road.        Because    I was    in the marked Police          van    I was

being    shouted at,        but    I never w i tn es se d any          fights.

After    completing        this    first     run I decided to           return to the B ri gh t si d e

S t a t i o n to get my own meal           whilst    1/had time.           It was    just after       1 had

eaten that a call           for assistance? came              to all    officers.      I was d ir ected

to go to R ot h er h am Police S t a tion to fetch the accident                        unit    cutting

tackle and spreaders.                  It>was    not until       I reached R o t h e r ha m that      I was

informed that           the two nyftors for this              gear were     not    in store.     I

believe        one was au^av/tor         repair and the other was away on m o t o rw a y

cover.

I then went        to Clove Wheels Ln Traffic Office,                      S he f fi e ld to wait     on

standby.         I remained there           until   released at about 9.15             pm,    after

runn i ng some Po 1 i c ernan home .

A part   from my first           run    into S h ef fi el d     I had no other       dealings    with

the H i l l sb o ro u gh Ground.          I /\s.d no dealings with           injured or dead

people,        or visited any haijrpitals,

I w or k ed     last years      serny final match again as a driver.                    I saw no

great    difference        between the build up of that m atch and this years

game,    in relation to P o l i c i n g ,        a lt ho ug h    there seemed to be more

supporters        this year.

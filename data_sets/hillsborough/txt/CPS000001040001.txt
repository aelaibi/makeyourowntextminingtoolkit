Dear Mr Croston

HILLSBOROUGH : A RLIN GTO N -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

We are dispatching to you by fax, and putting into the Document Exchange the hard copies
o f the following.

1.       Representation on behalf o f Mr Bernard Murray.

2.       Schedules A, B and C referred to in the representations.

3.       Copy o f the report o f R -v- H M Coroner for South Yorkshire ex parte Stringer
         and others.

4.       Copy Yorkshire Evening Post o f 17 September 1998.

So that I know both that you have received the papers and that you have a full set o f these,
could I trouble you to please acknowledge safe receipt.

I can tell you that there will be a very short further submission to be made to you
tomorrow on the further representations that have been made by HFSG. As a matter o f
courtesy, I have copied all o f these documents to HFSG and to save you having to do so,
I have also sent a copy to Winckworth and Pemberton.

I would welcome in due course advices as to the date when you have submitted your report
to the Director o f Public Prosecutions. I think it is then important to try to establish within
what period o f time the Director expects to have made a decision. There seems to be little
point in bringing matters back before the Magistrates’ Court on 30 October if the
Director’s decision is not likely to have been made by that date.

Yours sincerely

     REPRESENTATIONS TO THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS

                          ON BEHALF OF MR. BERNARD MURRAY




1.1      In 1996-7, the HFSG pretext for re-opening the investigation was a claim that ‘new evidence’
existed to undermine the previous findings and decisions. That claim was emphatically rejected by Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny. It was inevitable that any post-Scrutiny attempt to justify a prosecution
would include another claim that further fresh evidence had come to light.

1.2      We are now able to respond to the ‘new evidence’ claim, as well as to the variety o f other claims
in the prosecutor’s representations.

1.3      There are also important points to be made about the declared CPS/DPP policy on the provisions
o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985.

CPS/DPP Policy - evidence
2.1     The CPS letters to HFSG on 27 July and 4 August 1998 set out Policy. They refer to evidence,
public interest and the interests o f justice. The latter is one specific aspect o f public interest. This is not
the moment for detailed argument about policy, but we indicate our concerns.

2.2      The evidence criterion for intervention is wrong. (We do not accept that the private prosecutor
can make out a case to answer. What follows is addressing the principle behind the policy.) It cannot be
right to restrict the Director’s scope for intervening on evidence grounds to cases where there is ‘clearly
no case to answer’.

2.3     First, it has the effect that the Director will only intervene in cases where the Court would be
bound to stop the proceedings in any event, either by refusing to issue summonses, or by refusing to
commit for trial. To that extent, intervention on evidential grounds would never serve to achieve more
than an acceleration o f the inevitable.

2.4      Second, in rare cases such as the present, it has a potential for undermining the public’s
perception o f the authority o f the Director, as well as that o f the Attorney-General. For more than eight
years, the Director has publicly asserted that there is no realistic prospect o f conviction o f any person on
the charges now levelled against the two defendants. This after the most detailed, thorough, responsible
and high-level assessment o f the position it is possible to imagine, carried out more than once, and
coupled with the clear conclusions o f the Scrutiny o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which have in turn been
publicly accepted by the Director, the Attorney-General and the Home Secretary. The policy
contemplates that the Director may conclude that because it is not clearly demonstrated that there is no


                                                                               Mr Murray's representations -1/5
Iu 1h 4 2   M c£& l 1
case to answer, all that has gone before must count for nothing, and that the publicly appointed body
responsible for criminal prosecutions must stand aside and leave it to a private prosecutor. That such an
outcome is theoretically possible suggests that the underlying policy is flawed. Particularly in the unique
circumstances o f this case, where an independent Scrutiny Inquiry under a Lord Justice o f Appeal has
been set up by Ministers o f the Crown to examine whether there is any basis for reviewing the decision
not to prosecute.

2.5      We mention the position o f the Attorney-General at this stage because there is a need to
coordinate the roles o f the principal officers responsible for the criminal process. Were there to be a
committal for trial to the Crown Court, the Attorney’s power to enter a nolle prosequi would be called
upon by the defence. Ex hypothesi, such intervention only arises after it has been found that there is a
case to answer. It cannot be right that the Director is unable to intervene on evidential grounds if there
may be a case to answer, when it is plain that the Attorney can do so in a case where there undoubtedly
is a case to answer. We note section 3(1) o f the 1985 Act. In any case where the Attorney would enter
a nolle prosequi, notwithstanding that there is or might be a case to answer, there is nothing in law or
principle to preclude the Director from intervening to the same effect at an earlier stage, acting either
independently or under the Attorney’s superintendence.

CPS/DPP Policy - public interest
3.1     The public interest factors to be taken into account when considering whether to take over and
discontinue a private prosecution will not be different from or less than those factors which the Code for
Crown Prosecutors requires to be taken into account when deciding whether to prosecute.

3.2    Without repeating 2.4 above, the public pronouncements from the office o f the Director, from
the Law Officers and Ministers o f the Crown have created a legitimate expectation in the defendant that
there will be no prosecution. It is unthinkable that this should effectively be overridden by the
commencement o f a private prosecution. It would set at nought the assurance contained in §10.1 o f the
Code. There is no basis for invoking the exceptions in §10.2.

3.3    Material public interest factors against prosecution as identified in §6.5 o f the Code are:
        (d) long delay, and
        (f) significant ill-health of the prospective defendant.
Both apply here. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found significant instances o f altered recollections in
witnesses upon whom the prosecutor would rely.

3.4     Assessment o f culpability. We do not propose to argue issues o f substantive law at this stage. For
present purposes it is sufficient to refer to the quotation which Lord Taylor chose to cite prominently,
with obvious approval, in his Interim Report, PART II - WHY DID IT HAPPEN? [p.20]:
        “Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don’t usually happen just for one single reason, nor
        is it possible to pin the blame on one single scapegoat... Disasters happen because a whole series
        of mistakes, misjudgments and mischances happen to come together in deadly combination.”
        (The Archbishop of York.)
Lord Taylor’s Report, read as a whole, found the disaster was caused by a series o f factors: ultimately
a failure o f systems as well as o f single individuals, involving the Police as a Force, Sheffield
Wednesday as a Club, their consulting engineers, the Health & Safety Executive, the Local Authority and
the Football Association.

3.5      Regrettably, HFSG has become a campaigning pressure group for what is now a relentless pursuit
of these ex-police officers. Their lives have been and will continue to be seriously afflicted by their
knowledge that they were involved at the epicentre of the disaster. A fair and dispassionate assessment
of the position o f the two proposed defendants would see them as having been seriously affected by their
involvement in the tragedy. But there is no prospect o f this private prosecution being carried on and

                                                                           Mr Murray's representations - 2/5
conducted with any regard to the broader concepts o f fairness and balance o f public interest factors which
any defendant in a criminal trial in this country is entitled to expect.


CPS/DPP Policy - the private prosecutor.
4.1     Even if there were to be a defensible evidential basis for continuing the proposed prosecution,
it would be wholly wrong for the public prosecuting authority to abandon responsibility for the conduct
o f what undoubtedly would be a serious, complicated and important ‘high-profile’ case. Section
3(2)(b)(i) o f the 1985 Act imposes a duty on the Director to institute and have the conduct o f proceedings
where it appears that:
        “the importance or difficulty o f the case makes it appropriate that proceedings should
        be instituted by him...”.
Although this duty is distinct from the duty to “take over” the conduct o f proceedings, it is not a duty
which the Director can ignore. Parliament did not envisage that important or difficult cases (this would
be both) should be left to private prosecution. The scope for intervention by a private prosecutor in such
cases must clearly be confined to situations where inertia, partiality or improper action on the part o f the
public prosecutor can be demonstrated.

4.2      Although section 6( 1) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 expressly preserved the right of
private prosecution, it is clearly not an unfettered right. The purpose in preserving private access to the
criminal courts was stated by Lord Wilberforce in Gouriet-v- Union o f Post Office Workers [1978] A.C.
435 at 477:
         “This historical right..., though rarely exercised in relation to indictable offences, and
         though ultimately liable to be controlled by the Attorney-General (by taking over the
         prosecution and, if he thinks fit, entering a nolle prosequi) remains a valuable
         constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on the part o f authority.”
See also: Report o f the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure (Cmnd 8092 (1981)): it provides a
useful and effective safeguard against “improper action” by the prosecuting authority: cited by Lloyd L. J.
in R -v- Bow Street Stipendiary Magistrate and Another, (1993) 96 Cr.App.R. 405.

4.3     The lengthy history o f public investigations into the circumstances o f the Hillsborough tragedy,
carried out at all stages under the auspices of the Home Secretary and the Law Officers, clearly
demonstrates that this is not an appropriate case for private prosecution.


HFSG -1998 Representations to D.P.P.
5.1      Fundamentally, the HFSG representations amount to claims that, by reason o f fraudulent
interference with and /or concealment o f evidence by the South Yorkshire Police and/or the West
Midlands Police, the Taylor Inquiry, the D.P.P., the Police Complaints Authority, the Inquests, and Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith were all in their turn deceived about the culpability o f the South Yorkshire Police
Force in relation to the tragedy o f Hillsborough. These claims are presumed to be true, then translated
simplistically into a justification for prosecuting the two proposed defendants.

5.2     To overcome the objection that these were the very claims expressly considered and rejected by
the Scrutiny, HFSG contends that it is only post-Scrutiny that material has been released for their
consideration which now enables them to demonstrate the truth of their assertions. It is necessary to
examine this material with close attention to detail, for the claims based upon it are wholly spurious.

5.3     When viewed in conjunction with the serious allegations which were made to Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith. the present claims are seen as the continuation o f a series o f unfounded allegations made
in support o f the long-standing conspiracy theory which has become entrenched in the thinking o f the


                                                                            Mr Murray's representations - 3/5
HFSG, and which now dominates the presentation o f all their arguments. A summary o f certain
allegations together with the findings o f the Lord Justice is set out in the following table.




                      ALLEGATION                              FINDINGS OF STUART-SMITH L.J.

                                                        turnstiles 9 to 16. §21.

                                                        and not drawn to the attention of Stuart-Smith L.J.
                                                        [b] Mr Houldsworth (upon whom HFSG relied)
                                                        said police would not rely on cameras; they had a
                                                        good view out of the window: p.25, §55.
                                                        [c] When consulted by Stuart-Smith L.J., counsel

                                                        the police case that they could not see pens 3 and 4

  3    Evidence from video tapes of what was filmed     There was never any disappearance or concealment
       by camera 5 deliberately supressed and           of video footage from camera 5: p.27, §63. “There
       concealed (by S.Yorkshire police and/or West     is no new video evidence...” p i04 §7
       Midlands), p.20, §33.2                           Allegation that police hid videotape evidence is
                                                        completely unfounded. There was no suppression
                                                        or disappearance of footage from the vital tapes ...

                                                        legal representatives of the families: p.30, §77.
  4    Houldsworth’s evidence was deliberately          Importance of his evidence exaggerated out of all
       withheld from Inquest jury, p.20, §33.5          proportion. His existence and evidence were known
                                                        to Taylor Inquiry and to Coroner: p.36, §97.
  5    Inquest verdicts procured by fraud,              Submissions unfounded: p.48, §53.
       suppression o f evidence or insufficiency of     “The suggestion that the evidence now put before
       inquiry; fraudulent concealment of evidence:     me ... was deliberately suppressed and those

                                                        irresponsible”: p.52, §70.

                                                        is false and I regard it as wholly irresponsible”:

5.4      The prosecutor continues to assert that the South Yorkshire Police and/or West Midlands
carefully withheld important material from the Director and the Coroner, such that the 1990 decision not
to prosecute and the Inquest verdicts were reached on an incomplete assessment o f material evidence.
These claims are dealt with in detail in Schedule A. An illusion o f incomplete consideration is created
by highlighting the fact that not all statements were considered and not all witnesses were called. Of
course they were not. For obvious reasons, many witnesses were repetitive o f others, many were unable
to speak about the focal matters under inquiry. Some sifting process to extract representative sample
witnesses on critical issues was essential, otherwise the Hillsborough Inquiry and the Inquests would
have been unmanageable. Evidence now relied on by the prosecutor as being new and previously

                                                                             Mr Murray's representations - 4/5
unconsidered is substantially the same evidence as has already been thoroughly considered, but from
different sources. This is analysed in Schedules B and C.




Mr Murray’s representations - accompanying Schedules.
6.1      To assist the Director to give detailed consideration to the points and counter-points arising out
o f the HFSG representations, we have prepared responses in the form o f three Schedules:
         A - responses to the 40-page representations o f Mr Jones Q.C. (24 September 1998);
         B - an analysis o f the claims about ‘new evidence’ as it relates to the witness statements referred
to in the HFSG letter to CPS (24 August 1998); (these statements were withheld from us until late
September when they came with the representations);
         C - an analysis o f the claims about ‘new evidence’ as it relates to the 22 statements in Annex D
to the representations.
We respond to the claims made about the 38 statements served in support o f the summonses in schedule
A. Most o f these are general in nature.

6.2      Our submission is that none o f the statements relied on establishes anything o f material
significance, that is, which has not been known o f or available before from other sources. The
prosecutor’s presentation relies on bulk without substance.

6.3     For brevity, we have adopted short-form responses where the same response can be made to
claims about witnesses or points about their evidence, (or deletions or amendments where those
allegations are made). The meaning o f the notation we have adopted is as follows:
         NOT NEW - the witness says nothing which has not been established before by other evidence;
         INQUIRY, INQUEST, or SCRUTINY - indicates that the evidence, point or argument was fully
         taken into account by the relevant body, albeit as a result o f evidence from other sources;
         AFTERMATH - this indicates that the evidence or argument relates to events after the tragedy
         had occurred, which are not material to the charges against Mr Murray;
         NOT MATERIAL - this indicates that the evidence or argument is not material to the charges
         against Mr Murray.

                                              A total of 95 persons died at the Hillsborough Stadium in
                                         Sheffield at a football match in 1989. Inquests into the deaths of all
                                         were held between April 18, 1989 and March 28, 1991, by the
                                         coroner for South Yorkshire. The verdict in respect of each was
                                   tr<
                                   X     accidental death.
                                              An application was brought by relatives of six deceased peisons
                                         to quash the jury’s verdicts and perhaps order fresh inquests.
                                   $          On April 15,1989 Liverpool were playing Sheffield Wednesday
                                         in the semi-final of the Football Association Cup and kick-off was
                                         scheduled for 3 pm. There was build-up of supporters at the Leppings
                                         Lane entrance and at 2.52 pm the chief superintendent of police in
                                         charge of crowd control decided to let the gates be opened. There
                                         was an influx of about 2,000 supporters resulting in the build-up of
                                         intolerable pressure. Many supporters were crushed and 95 people
                                         were killed and 400 physically injured.
                                              On April 17, Taylor, L.J. (as he then was) was appointed to
                                         conduct an inquiry into the disaster. On April 18 the coroner formally
                                         opened and adjourned the inquest. The coroner was faced with the
                                         complication not only of the sheer number of deaths but the fact that
                                         the Taylor inquiry was proceeding and the D.P.P. was being asked
                                         to consider bringing criminal charges arising out of the incident.
                                         After discussions with the D.P.P. it was decided the coroner could
                                         proceed with determining "who" the deceased were and "when" and
                                         "where" they met their deaths but the question of "how" ought not
                                         to be dealt with for fear of prejudicing criminal proceedings. (See
                                         similarly the narrative of R. v. H.M. Coronerfo r Inner West London,
                                         ex parte Lockwood-Croft ("The Marchioness Disaster") 157 J.P. 985).
                                               The families, who were distressed at having to wait an eternity
                                         for the hearing of the investigation into individual deaths, were

                              He says, first, that what the coroner was suggesting was not        t          "(1) The proceedings a:

                              he says would have been. I mention two o f these. First,             ;         nam ely -

                                   H is second criticism was that the coroner was suggesting

        Statement of Eric Smith PC. 2196, Police Station, Wath-on-Dearne:




On Satur d a y 15th April 1989, I was designated duty at Hil lsb r o u g h Football

Ground.           The game       to be played           for the F.A.           Cup was between Liverpool and

Notts.       Forest.




At about          11.00 a.m.       that date,           I was        taken by the G roup Inspector Charles

to    our     duty        point.        We    were       at     the    S heffi eld        Transpo rt      bus    depot    at

Herries       Road        and   the    task was         to    board     every bus         and     brief   all    the    fans

regarding          what    would      be     allowed      to be        taken into the g round and that any

prohibited item wou ld be conf iscate d whilst after the game.                                            I      was      in

Serial       52 and        these      fans    we   were       to     supervise were         the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

fans.




There    was        a steady       flow of buses              all     day,   some    seventy-six          or    so.     Most

were    full        and    orderly      but,       to   the     latter       end,   about        five    arrived      empty.

The    drivers          stated     that      the   fans       had jumped out of the bus whilst                        it was

moving       steadily near            to     the   ground.            There were      little or no buses               after

2.40 p.m.           Almost all Forest               supporters          had gone      to the ground there were

just    'dribs and drabs' who were l a t e ^

At about 3-00 p.m., our Inspector told us that we had better go and have a

meal,        so    we     slowly      made    our       way     to    Claywheels          Lane,    where       the    mobile

canteen           was     situated.           We    were        halted       on     two     occasions         whilst     the

Inspector li stened to his radio,                         as he said there a ppeared to be a problem

at     the        Leppings       Lane       end    of     the        ground,      this     the     end    allo cated      to

Liverpool          supporters.             We were       not       required,      so we     slowly carried on            for
                                                                                                                                           4f
                                                                   - 2 -

our    refreshments.                     We    had    only       gone     100       yards    or     so    when       we were       again

halted.         Our       Inspector              said     that      we    had        to    make     haste       to    the    Leppings

Lane,    as     there          had       developed           a    major    problem.               We     went    quickly       to    our

destination,            and as we arrived,                       just short of Leppings Lane,                        I saw a large

group     of       Police,           all        in     rank       file.         We        were     put     in    rank       file     and

identified and checked by Se rgeant Hodgkinson.                                              We appeared to be the last

to arrive          at    this       time        and the          first to be deployed.                    I think there were

two Serials of us and we were taken to the concerti na doors at the rear of

Leppings       Lane.           Just outside              these      doors       I saw two ambulances and quite a

few    persons          on    the        floor,       they       a ppeared          either       dead,    unconcious          or    some

quite    badly          injured.              All     appeared          to have       someone with them,                so we went

into    the    area          just    through           the gate.           There          I saw quite       a large          crowd of

supporters,             all    mull ing          about.           There    were           injured       persons      all     over    the

place,       some unconcious,                   some most probably dead,                         or seriously injured.




With    PC.     1344          Hanson,          we     just       gave    all        the    assistance           we   could     to    the

injured       and       carried           the    badly        injured      people           to    the    waiti ng      ambulances.

All    the     time      we     were          doing     t h i s , the      supporters             were    hostile       to u s , and

spat    at    us    calling              us '"MURDERERS"            and     "BASTARDS"             and    blamed      us     for what

had happened.                There were appeals over the tanoy for calm, and gradually

all     the    injured              in        sight     were       taken       outside           the     ground       and    made     as

comfortable             as     we        could        make       them.          I    put     several        who       were     not    as

seriously          injured          as        some    against       a wall,          so    that     they were          ready       to be

picked up by the ambulance.




Near to a wire fence on the other side of the inlet door were several dead

bodies,       I saw a Doctor in casual                          clothes        and a blac k Doctor and they were

treating or trying to treat                           these people,             but it was          all in vain.              It was

obvious,       by    the    colour          of    some      of        these    bodies       that    they were             dead,     and

some had been covered up.                         We then gra dually came under the su pervision of

Inspector Sykes who told us                           (that would be about 12 or so of us) to form a

cordon around the bodies to keep them out of view.                                                A while later,             someone

brought       some    barriers          and       a     tarpaulin           sheet     and    this       was    put    around        the

bodies.        All        the    time       there          were       supporters        in    the       upper        part    of     the

covered stand and they were                           shouting abuse                at us.        Bystanders kept coming

up   to us     and    calling          us    names.             When all the injured had eve ntuall y been

taken    to Hospital,             transit          vans         and    ambulances        arrived         and we removed,              I

think    about       10    or    11     dead       bodies         in    the     vehicles          and    we    were       told     they

would    be    taken       to     the       gymnasium.                Afte r    the     bodies          had    all    been        taken

away,     we    were        found        by       our       Serial          Sergeant         and    were        taken        to     the

cantilever stand for a briefing.                                 Whilst        sitting there,             In spector Bateman

called    our       Serial       and    said          he   wanted        us    all     to    go    with       him    to     Ba rnsley

H ospital      to    assist       with       the       arrival         of     the    overspill          of    bodies.         We    all

agreed,       and were          taken       by    transit         to B a r nsl ey       District         General          Hospital.




On arrival we were               told by Ins pector Bateman                           that    they were not using the

Hospital m o r t u a r y        and we           were      to    return       back to Claywheels                Lane.         It was

by this       time   about       8.00 p.m.              and we were m u s tered               together and taken back

to Section to go home.

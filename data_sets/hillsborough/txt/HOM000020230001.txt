             Thank you for your letter dated k September, I have noted the interest
             of the parties involved in the Chapman case. I also note your concern
             as to what should now happen with the barrier and in particular the
             requests for samples for tests.

             We have been invited by South Yorkshire Police to undertake the criminal
             investigation. We have accepted this responsibility subject to an
             assurance with regard to the financial aspects. Once that assurance has
             been given to us we will embark on a detailed criminal inquiry and as
             you know from an earlier letter, it is likely that I will be making
             application to your Director for assistance.

             Given that we are likely to be responsible for the criminal
             investigation, I would like to say immediately that we would wish to
             retain the broken barrier in its present condition and without any
             further tests to be carried out on it, or any samples released until I
             have been consulted. The broken barrier has now effectively become the
             property of the criminal inquiry until such a time that we return it to
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club against signature. If you do receive
             any further applications for the supply of sample materials I would be
             grateful if you would pass them to me to respond.




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T
                                   -   2   -




If there is any further work to be done on the barrier, and it is to be
with your assistance, then this will be a matter to be debated with the
Director of Public Prosecutions and his advising QC.

If you wish to discuss this matter further please do not hesitate to
contact me. I have copied this letter to Mr Whalley and to Professor
Maunder for their information.

   Dear Mr Whalley

   HUISBORODGH INVESTIGATION - CIVIL CASE

    Representatives of the five parties involved in the case of Chapman versus the
    Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
    Sheffield City Council and Eastwood & Partners visited this laboratory on
 ^ ^ 5 August 1989 in order to examine the broken barrier. This visit was agreed
 ^ P y the Inquiry via Treasury Solicitors.

   Several parties have new requested samples of the barrier for their own tests,
   or loan of the samples vised by HSE. Since our work on the failed barrier was
   completed seme time ago, it would be simpler frcnt our point of view, and
   considerably less time consuming, if the pieces of this barrier were returned
   to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. Hcwever, in view of the fact that a
   criminal inquiry is new underway, it may be advisable for all pieces to be
   retained by HSE in the condition they are new. I would welcome your views, and
   also those of Mr J M Jones and Professor Maunder to whcm this letter is
   ccpied.

   In addition, several parties have expressed the desire to witness any further
   tests that HSE may carry out. Hie need for tests on the other barriers in our
   possession is currently under discussion with Professor Maunder but it would be
   helpful, at this stage, to have your views on whether such tests should be
   witnessed. Incidentally, my previous request for assistance in purchasing
   hydraulic rams for further testing should also be held in abeyance until our
   technical discussions are complete. Should they be required, the rams will
   cost approximately £1600.

   Yours sincerely

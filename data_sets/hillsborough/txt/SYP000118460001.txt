            At 10.30am Saturday 13 April        1989 commenced duty on turnstiles at

            Leppings Lane entrance S.W.F.C.

            11.30am seconded to coach reception.        By this time a few fans were

            milling outside ground.

            12.05 approx.       turnstiles opened but nobody made any attempt to enter

            the ground.

            Football    special    buses began to arrive but fans invariably wandered

            away from ground,        loads of youths touting for tickets and a lot of

            people with cans of beer.

            Crowds then began to increase steadily but still only a few were

            entering the ground.

            By 1.30pm crowds so dense that traffic had to be stopped,           as the

            crowds were spilling over onto the road.        Not enough officers to

            clear roads so any attempts to do so were futile.            Although officers

            on horses made several attempts to clear the roads,           this only

            aggravated the crowd many of whom were now turning up drunk.

            From about 2pm everything was pretty static due to the throng of

            people and very large crowds gathered outside the turnstiles but

            there was no sort of order just one big mass of people, a lot of whom

            did not have tickets and were trying to buy-^^em off

         I was then ordered fay Inspector                       Sykes to assist PS Proctor and his

         serial at the perimeter railing                        gates (to ease the crush at the

         turnstiles)-                    The crowd was so dense that         I could not see any other

         officers to close the gates which lead to the access road tdwards

         already at the turnstiles from pushing and crushing each other                                    indeed

         some fans were                   climbing onto the turnstile         roofs.    2/3 mounted were

         trying to bring order to the turnstiles and there were 2 housed

         directly in front of the railing gates trying to keep pressure off

         myself and PS Proctor,                      so we could keep the gates s h u t .        The mass of

         people outside the railing gates who were pressing against myself and

         PS Proctor were becoming very aggressive and objects were being

         thrown at mounted officers who were already covered in spittle.

         I had rammed the three quarter                       inch securing spike for the gate into u

         its locating hole in the ground but by now the pressure was such that

         the spike bent and the gates sprang open under the pressure and the

         crowd surged through the gates.                        All   I could do was pull out people

         who wre being trampled by the mass of peopie rushing through.

         A very short while )later the crowds disappeared.                             A few minutes        later

         I was in the pens pulling out bodies.

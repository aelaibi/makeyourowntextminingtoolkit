    i n v o l u n t a r i l y towards      the     fronv'-S'nd towards                 the gate,        that w o u l d be

    f o r w a r d and to my         right.         I then came up against a crush barrier,                                        I

    tried to           lift myself        up over this           barrier           because        of the ever

    increasing           pressure        behind me,         I managed            to get        up a couple            of    inches

    off the ground and then got stuck, like a cork in a bottle.           My pelvis

    was crushed up a ga in st the b a r r i e / and the top half of my body was

    bent     over the        barrier       at    they^ame        time.           At    this     stage     I th o u g h       I wa;

    going      to die the         pressure         continued m o u n t i n g            up.       There was a man

    be h i n d who       just    se e m e d to fall         down o b v i o u s l y          on to the        floor         of the

    terrace         because      this    gave rne those            precious few              inches      e n a bling        me        to

    drop down beneath              the     bar    of     the barrier             an d move        to the        other side.

    When     on the other          side     I      tried to get up but couldn't.                             I was         in like

    a crouching           position,        it      was     dark and hot,               Icould not         catch my

    breath,         I started      to    panic,        I started           to scramble and              punch my way

    to the surface              during    which        time    people were              being      sick      on me and

    u ri n a t i n g   on me     from behind,            o bv io u s l y       they were       up agai n s t         the

    barrier         and the      pressure        was     making      them do this.

    I e v e n t u a l l y m an a g e d   to get upright and                     bre a t h    properly,          however       the

    crush was still              intense,        this seemed to go on for two or three

    minutes.            I then saw some           of the       fans who were a l r e a d y on the                          pitch

    start      to      rip at the m e s h on the fence.

    We    then all        of a su d d e n m ov e d / l u r c h e d             to o^r left and there                 seemed to

    be s u d d e n l y more       space.           I w ould then see at least two                         bodies           rolling

    around       on the t er ra c i n g         near    to the wall.                  T hey were       obviously            dead,          I

    could see,           their    faces were           grey and        blue        they were         just       being

    b u f f e t t e d about.

    I then saw someone               fall       onto the t e r r a c i n g            near     to me    so      I    picked him

    up,    I a sk e d him        if he was alright               but       he    could not speak.                    1 hung       him

    over a crush barrier                 to keep him upright                     then       I scr a m b l e d       onto    the

                  On the       pitch       I saw     people         receiving          artificial            r e s p i r a t i o n and heart

                  resuscitation.               This       was mostly from St Johns A m b u l a n c e                           people and

                  other      football         s up p o r t e r s with a few             p o licemen helping as well.

                  There were P o l i c e m a n             not     doing a n y t h i n g         but this was         I think          because

                  they were t ot a l l y s ho c k e d and numbed                        by       :i.t all.     1 a s k e d one P o l i c e m a n

                  what     I should do but                 he just s h r u g g e d his             shoulders,         he s e e m e d to be

                  in a daze,          it was        the     enormity of the situation.

                  In the       c i r c umstances           I do not blame              the       police      on the    ground          but    they

                  were     all    e q u ipped w i th          r a d i o ’s and       I wonder         why they were              not    given

              I held the          only    radio       for our       serial      and     liaised    wit h other       members

              of my serial          v er ba l ly     by,walking; from                point    to point.

              In charge of my sector                   was     Inspector S e l w o o d of E Division.

positions.           Tak in g     up points about       11.45am.

By this        time the      first    supporters were         beginning          to arrive      in small

numbers.        By    12.30pm       large numbers       of   persons were making               their way

a long Leppings Lane               towards    the ground.          Many of them were            drinking

from cans and bottles and                carafes       of wine,        and    I saw one y ou th

drinking        directly        from a 7 pint      ’party     can8.          Many s u pp or te rs were

a sking    for the nearest            pub and o f f- li ce nc e and whether                 they were open

to s u p p o r t e r s .

Ely about 2pm there were               hundreds    of suppo rt er s           in L ep pi ng s Lane

Standing and sitting                on walls    etc.,     drinking,          many were walking            up

and down asking             for    spare tickets       from others           but there were

a pp ar e nt l y very       few    spare tickets       for s a l e .

I spoke        to many Liverpool         s upporters and some Notts.                  Forest

supporters who             had tickets       for the Liverpool           end.      Most were        f ri endly

arid in 'good humour a l t h ou g h some were                drunk.          I a dv is ed    some   groups

initially that             they    w ould not be   per mi tt ed to           enter   the     g round either

wit h alcohol         or    drunk    but as    larger     numbers a pp ea re d        it     became a

wa s t e d exercise.

To the      best of my knowledge              there were      no    incidents        of dis order         in

the vicinity of my serials                   points.      The mai n      problem was          one   of

litter with          literally hundreds          ofbeer       and pop cans            and bottles and

chip papers          etc.    strew n about.

This     was    commented         upon to, me by an elderly             lady resident          of

B i c k e r to n Road who         said she was 84 y e a r s , a n d had lived there most                       of

her    life and h^d never             seen sii.eh a mess        o f ’cans e t c .     at any        previous

gari'ie or evgnt at Hillsborough.

By about 2 . 3 0 p m        the    bulk of the s up po rt er s who had been mi ll in g about

in Leppings Lame             drif te d toward and         into the ground.              T her e was       then

a lull of about             ten mi nutes whe n          ita p p ea r ed that there           were very         few

supporters         left outside         the ground.
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                              ;            R219

At about 2 . 4 0 p m there was a sudden surge                        of supporters            coming along

L ep p i ng s Lane       toward the ground,              m an y of whom were         running.            Some

were    still      carrying        cans and bottles           of beer and          I saw some           pouring

it onto      the    road as        they were moving.            At this       time       I was     still     on

the barrier at B i c k e r to n Road.                A short    time       later    I became        aware,        via

radio messages,               of problems at the L ep pi n gs Lane entrance.                            I stepped

out    into L ep pi n gs Lane and             could see       the    entrance and that              it was a

mass    of b o d ies from the             turnstiles       r i g h t ba <::k t o the, r o a d a nd that

more and more were adding                   to     it.    There were        still    large        groups

m a k i n g ; th e ir way to the ground and                I a tt e mp t ed to slow down several

groups who were                running by pointing out              that there was            nowhere for

them to go.             The    crowd and      crush at      the turnstiles was                clearly

visible      but    they       continued      regardless       to    rush and add to              it.     The

m a jo r it y of these           persons were male          in late teens,           early        twenties age

groups.        There was          very    1 ittle    shouting       or    chanting and all              seemed

intent on getting                to the ground.

I then heard,            via     radio,    of rnount i n g problems          i n side    t he_g_ro_u n d .        I

h eard a call           for officers        to the       perimeter        track    but thought           that     it

was    f ig h ti n g/ p it c h    invasion.        ..'There''-were, no -.transmissions to the

contrary.          After a short           time     there was a radio mess ag e                for further

assi st an ce at         the ground.          1 then made my way to the L e p pi n gs Lane

entrance where               I joined a mirnbsr of other                 officers.        There were         still

some    supporters             mill in g about      outside    the       gates and a few were              still

arriving.          As    I     a r ri v e d some   people were       starting       to    leave     the ground.

Sorne ■were      o b vi ou sl y sh oc ke d. an d upset and were               crying.         O t he rs were

abus iv e and began shouting at the                       officers        outside.        C om me n ts    such as

"Black, bastards",               "You've     done, it this      time",        "You're         to blame       for

t h i s 1*, "You should all              be a sh amed"      "You should all              be   locked up",

"Why aren't yo u              in there     doing     something,          you only want         the money"

"You're; only good for                 kicking m i n e r s " , interspersed wit h the                   usual.

           expletives and           profanities.         The      offic er s    outside       the gate         including

           m yself were       held outside           to monitor       the    crowd     leaving.          I believe          the

           i nstruction was          given v er bally by C h ief             Inspector P u r d y,         who was          the
fi
           only senior        officer        I saw at that         time.       After    the    call      for

           assi st an ce     there was        very    little      of an     intelligible        nature         passed       by

           radio.        Persons w e r e      tra ns mi tt in g    over     each other        i n te rs pe rs ed by

           silences w h e n no        instructions ■:qr. d i r e c ti o n were           given.          The    officers

           outside       the gr ou nd       including myself         had no      idea w h at s o e v e r       what was

           happening       inside.          Initially    persons who were              shouting and swearing

           at us were        spoken to firmly and t h re a te n ed w ith arrest,                         however,          as

           more    reasonable        persons        began to emerge          and explain to us             some       of

           what- had h a p pe n ed      inside we began to a pp re c ia t e              the    reason for the

           anger    d ir ected at us.

           However,       we were     still     not f or ma ll y     informed of the s i t u a t io n             in the

           ground and        it seemed        ludicrous     later      that     *O p ^ ^ t ^ ^ ^ u p i p o ^ t * had

           officers       t ra ve ll in g   from all     over      the Force       to assist         in the      ground

           when there were            at least 50 officers                stood o u t s ide the Le ppi ngs Lane

           entrance almost            in limbo       not knowing what was              h appening and not being

           reqii'i red     to ass is t .

           When the        rescue    op er at io n was      complete        all officers were            then     called

           into the        N orth stand              about 5pm.        O nl y then            did    I begin to            realis
     -A,
           scale    of     the   problem inside        the gr ou nd         and I saw the           p ro found effect

           which    it     had on some of my          colleagues.            He were     left       to   ponder       for

           sometime before            we were given a short                 de-brief and a d j o u r n e d to

           Cl aywheelS       Lane     to re-muster        our serials and await t r an sp or t                   to

           return to Doncaster.

           The mood of officers was very quiet,                        some Were        o b vi ou sl y m ov ed by the

           events and were           close to tears.

           We returned to Don ca st er and retired from duty at 7 .45pm.

           Only when       I a r ri v e d home and saw the             incident        on t e le v is i on did I get
                                                                                            •;. ■         . PAGE

            a true picture of what had h ap pe ne d and                  I. then felt very, a ng ry and

            f ru st ra te d that my      colleagues      had been sub je ct ed to deal in g w ith such

            a   large    scale    traumatic     incident and       that, for all      intents       and

        .   purposes,      1' and the other         officers     at the Leppings Lane          entrance        had

            done    nothing      to assist     them and had not          had the o p p o r tu n it y to do so.

            From my      point    of view,     once    it became    k nown of the nature            of the

            incident      in the N orth stand,          no one    took    control   o f the    radio

            communications.           Mo one d ir ected officers           or serials     to assist and           it

            was very m uch        left to e ac h to do his         own thing.       The   scale and nature

            of the      incident was      c ertainly not       cofrirounicated to officers          outside

            the ground,       who were left         in the dark w h i ch      could easily have

            resulted      in real     problems with       public   disorder      outside      the ground.

            The    horrific      h appenings   of this     day   could not      be f or es ee n by anyone,

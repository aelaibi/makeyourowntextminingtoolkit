        CROWD CONTROL AND HOOLIGANISM IN FOOTBALL GROUNDS


        You will be aware th a t Lord Justice Taylor's report on the Hillsborough Stadium
        disaster recommended the creation of three new specific offences in connection
        with football hooliganism: throwing a missile; chanting obscene or racialist abuse;
        and going on to a pitch without reasonable excuse.


        In his sta te m e n t of Monday, the Home Secretary undertook to look carefully and
        quickly a t the suggestions.            He also commented th a t the suggested new offences
        did seem to duplicate to some e x te n t offences which are already available in the
        Public Order Act. The A ttorney General was not consulted about the term s of the
        statem ent;      indeed, he only saw a copy of                      the    sta te m e n t a t    the   weekend.


        I am enclosing with this le tte r a copy of the full te x t of the s ta te m e n t together
        with correspondence between various departm ents.                            You may wish to note, in
        p a r t i c u l a r , th e c o m m e n ts of th e C h ie f S e c r e t a r y c o n c e rn in g th e s u g g e s te d
        offences.       The A ttorney General has not offered any com m ents a t this stage;
        clearly, it will be necessary to take the m a tte r forward a t official level.                             Would
        you be good enough to ask the person to whom you delegate this m a tte r to keep
        me in touch with the discussions which take place.

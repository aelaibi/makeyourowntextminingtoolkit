The    various        stages & a s pe ct s          of the       policing      in keeping w it h the

operational           order was o r al at ed 't o              those   in attendance.

At    11.00am        <1100hrs)         that   day,       I went w it h the two serials under my

command & joined others                    on the S pion H op w here all               of the staff          on

duty at that            particular         location were           briefed by S u pe ri nt en de nt

conduct       of the a n ti c i p a t e d Liverpool               support.

As    in the main briefing & at this                           second briefing,         the order      of the

day was       reiterated          in that        "the     policing      was to be firm but             fair with

the sa fe t y of the             public       being of         prime   importance".

supporters.            He spoke of the need to be vigilant & he had seen that

these      particular           s up po rt er s would          not h es itate    to take a d va nt ag e &

atte mp t     to     cause      problems       if things were           not    going their way or            in

favour       of their          team.

The    nature        of the a n t i c i p a t e d    problems & the            relevant    c on ti ngency

plans     being ex ha us te d           I then took my two              serials       to the area where

they were          to be       initially engaged for               phase      1 of their    duties.          I

brie f e d    them speaking             of what      I e xp ected & a d vi se d them of their

s pe cific      r e s po ns ib il it y     touching        on the      three    phases of duty.          In

addition        to what        had been said at the other                     briefings    I also      proferred

my thoughts           on what       I deemed an           important      issue w hich was        the

w e l f a r e & safety of each other.                      S uch matters        as the exercise         of

discretion           in a rr e st i ng     people or acting             impuls i ve ly with ou t

c on s i dering       safety.          I m e n t i on e d s p e c i f i ca l ly how    it was   important         not

to u n n e c e s s a r i l y    denude     our    presence        by rigid & inflexiable

a p p l i c a t i o n of the      rules with ou t          thought      of the objective        of the day.

                                                                                                     SI 861

I stated that such a policy on such an o cc asion w ould benefit                                   to show

not    only good        relations     but should ensure the safety & welf ar e                       of all

not    only at the t urnstiles           but     in later          crowd   control.     I gave       example

for    the benefit        of those w ith        lesser    e xperience of how acting

in isolation w o ul d or could             leave officers at the m ercy of the                       crowd.

I d ic ta t ed that any           public order matters              inside the ground during               the

game w ou ld be dealt wit h by teamwork at my d is cr et io n & instigation.

I also     touched on the           need to exercise           caution      in the s earching         of

suppo rt er s & of ticket            inspection.

At the     c ompletion of my address,                 the officers were            paired off &

a l l o c a t e d or s el ec te d specific       turnstiles w h er e by they w ould supervise

a d m i s s i o n of fans    during    phase     1.

I s at i sf i ed myself       that    the are a we were             required to      initaliy      police

was a d e qu a te l y    covered & spoke to each officer                    under my command as              I

patrolled the           location.     D uring    this    patrol       I identified that          there

were    some       turnstiles      numb ered 65 to 88 w hi ch did not appear                    to have

had staff a l l o c a te d to s up rvise          them.        On a sc er ta i ni n g   that some       of

these     turnstiles were           to open & a c om mu n ic a ti o n wit h ground              control,

•further officers           but    not under my command were deputed.                       In a d d it i on

to staff        directly under my command,              the   police       resources were

rein f o r c e d by the      presence       of several        officers on horseback. There

were    eight m o un te d officers a v ai la bl e             to    control      any build up of

suppo rt e r s     outside    the ground whilst           q ue ueing       for    entry.The     turnstiles

op e n e d at      12 noon & from that          time     there was a steady &

e asily m an a g e ab le     flow of,       in the main,           well    behaved supporters.             The

progress & a d dm i ss i on s at        this sect io n of the ground seemed steady,

there     never a p p e ar e d to be any major            build up at any of the

t urns t i l e s   & the only conge st io n was whe n the occasional ticket

tout(s)      made a presence          but any one stage              there was      never    to my

r e c o l l e c t i on any more     than about        fifty at any one of the turnstiles

              I only     recall     the u ti l is a ti o n of one m ou nt ed             patrol     officer    to assit

              in crowd movement & this was                  caused     primarily by the              presence of a

           The m a j o r i t y of the s pect ators a r ri v ed at this                      end of the ground

              either     on foot or by the            provided double             deck     buses which were

              br i nging    s upporters        from the      railway station.

              In general         the mood of the spectators was good & a lt ho ug h there was

              evidence      of    people    drinking       from      cans       in the   immediate     v ic inity or on

              the a p p r oa c h to     the g r o u n d , all       complied with          requests    to desist &

              either     d isgarded      the    contents      down the gutter              or    left the viciinity.

              Some     time after      half     past two,      I received a radio t ra ns mi s si o n to the

              effect     that     there was      people      trying    to break          down a turnstile at my

              location.          However,      I was d ir ec tl y outside            the    particular    turstile

              qu ot e d w it h two      m ou n te d officers         & there was         no evidence     of such a

              s i t u a ti o n being    in existence.           I    related this          to ground    control.      In

              fact     the only s pe cific         i ns tr uction & a c ti o n           I had to take was       to

              cause a p r og r am me /s el le r       to    close a c on ce rt in a type gate from which

              she was      selling     programmes          from inside          the ground to persons           passing

              grourufi to assist wit h           crowd control.

              I realised from          radio transmissionjK that there was a c ongesti on &

I Cr          b uild up of s upporters            at the other         end of the ground & I recall

              t hi nking    how clear       it was     at our       location.

              F r om   the turnstiles          opening at       12 noon to the             period when the m o un te d

              officers      were    released       I had had several              visits        from & brief

However,        my staff were             still    outside       the ground due to a small             number

of suppo rt er s          still     being    in the       locality & a d d i t i on a ll y the fact that

some of the t urnstiles were                      to r#rttfain open until      half    time.

The    next thing           I recall       w as V^nat     there was an address         over    the     tannoy

sy st em     requesting           specta^rars to either            stay off or get off         the     pitch.

Very     shortly after             th/s    there was a police            radio message       for all

a v aila bl e     of fi ce rs /T o    go    into the g r o u n d .       I saw both my serial

s er ge an ,s, ie F^f/67 J e s s o p & P S 1 Q 8 Q H o yl a nd            instruct    their    staff        to

close      t h V tjj^nstiles & they               proceeded       into the ground.          I went     into

the    ground via gate              'O'    in company wit h S up e ri n te n de n t Chapman.                As    I

ente re d the section betw ee n the north stand & the S pi on Hop,                                I

saw that        there were          numerous       supporters       on the    pitcj>^t the Leppings

Ln end of the ground & there was a hostile a t m ^ p h e r e                           in

the    crowd.         To all       intents & purposes,             it seemed that there          had been

a pitch        invasion from the L ep pings Ln a*4d terrace.                         I could see        that

there was a good police                    presence at/xhat          end of the ground & I

th er ef or e     i nstructed the staff                 on the    perimeter    track at the S pi on Hop

end to ensure              that    there was       no    pitch    invasion from that end.There

were     numerous         officers        a rr iv in g at the ground several were going to

the L ep pi ng s Ln end & some                 remained at the Kop end.               It se em ed that

numerous        spectators were             coming from the L ep pings Ln end of                 the ground

up to the Kop.               Several       were    r estrained & held back from

a n to a go n i s i n g   the     crowd    in the Kop.           After   some time    I could see that

s pe ct at or s ar ou nd the          ground were          beginning      to break down several              of

the a dv e rt i si n g       h oa rdings w hich they began to                carry back      in towards

the L ep pings Ln end of the ground.                         I then saw what were            obv io us ly

injured       people       being     carried from that             end of the ground to the Kop

end.       The a t mo sp he re       in general         a pp ea r ed very volatile w ith spectators

in these        intial       stages       jeering & shouting & venting               their    frus ta ti on

at the       pitch        invasion.       I caused several          officers at this         end of the

                      little       control          was    being    gained & there were still                people after what

                      approached               by a y outh of about 20 years                 dres se d    in a blue sweat sh ir t

                      picked up & ffcund to contain a heavy object                                 but w hi ch   I did not

Whilst      I was      in t he y^rea ar ou nd the          centre     of the     pitch,      I remember

hearing a t an n oy y Sr o ad c as t        from the Liverpool            Manager a lt ho u gh         I do

not    recall     its/content.           I was also at one stage                instructed by Chief

Superintende/t           Nesbit       to secure      the S pion Kop           perimeter        by the use of

some    dog myfn         to   release further officers               from that         side of the groun

to    reinforce        the    cordon    in the    centre     of the      pitch.     Having      done      this,

I a ga in      returned to the          central area & had by this time                   learned that

there were at           least    two    people dead because             of crushing on the

L ep pi n gs    Ln terraces.           It was    not until      this     time w hich must          have     been

at    least 30-35 minutes after                 I had entered          the ground that         I

became      aware        that    the s it u at i on was     not simply one             of a mere          pitch

i nv as i o n but       was     som et hi ng    of a greater        p roportion         & complexity.

A g a in ar ou nd this         time    I became aware        from a tannoy broadcast                 that     the

m a t c h was    to be abandoned.

In consequence           of the m a t c h a b a n d on m en t       I spoke    to either Chief

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit    / Mole    or S u pe r i n t e n d e n t C ha pm an & was deputed

to take        half of the        cordon w hi ch e xt en d ed from the            centre      spot     to the

north stand outside              the g round at the S pi on Kop end to assit                       in the

loading        of the buses & to ensure a safe dispersal                         of the      crowd.       The

leaving        spectators were          s afely d is p er s ed as had been planned for                    phase

III & about 5 .1 5 pm           (1715hrs)       I returned      to the ground.            It was at         this

point    that     I became aware          of the m ag n it u de        of the    incident & of the

di sa st er     that    had taken       place.

After a de-brief              in the    north stand,        I assisted         in reorganising

personnel        who had a t t e nd e d the ground as a                result of o pe r at i on support

into    serials        for d es pa t ch to the town centre               in a n t i c i p at i on of    public

order     incidents.                                            /

           was    later     engaged     in the       reception of          relatives who viewed            photographs

            of d e c e a s e d    persons    fatally    injured at the               ground & in the general

            running & a d mi n i s t r a t i o n of the         id en ti fi ca ti on       procedures.

            I retired from duty at 3.0 0 a m                 ( O S O O h r s ).

            I did not       spe ci fi ca ll y handle any bodies w hich                     were   removed from         the

           Lepp in g Ln end of the ground my only                         involvement        with bodies      was the

           make     shift mortuary.

            In relation to command structure at the time of the                                   catastrophe      I

           would say that Cheif S up e ri n te n de n t Nesbit & S up er in t en d en t C ha p ma n

           were     the only two officers              in the       initial         stages with whom       I had

           any    contact.         Radio     communications          were         very   restrictive & the       radio

           was    either         down or when       it was    utilised            could not be heard due         to the

           volume      of the       crowd.

           At the time & during               the    time    I was      inside       the ground     I only became

           aware      in the very       later       stages that there               had been fatalities.           To

           all    intents & purposes,               from where        I had been          it looked    like there        had

           been a pitch            invasion.

            F _a.       Cup Semi-final,              which        was      played        at    the    home     ground        of   Sheffield

            Wednesday            Football         Club,       which        is    HILLSBOROUGH.                This     match       was

            against           NOTTINGHAM        FOREST         FOOTBALL              CLUB.

             This       year     I again       bought         a ticket           to    attend        the     F .A.    Cup    Semi-final

            again against              NOTTINGHAM             FOREST,           and    this        mat ch was        also    to    be    played

             at    HILLSBOROUGH.               I bought           the      ticket        through       my     season        ticket       and       I

this         man        was     a Steward            because           they           then       went     out        of    the       bar    and       into

the         corridor,              and     as     I passed            them,           I could          s ee     him       show       the    lads          his

not         see        any    money        change         hands.             The       steward          w as       about        30    yrs       of    age

with         blonde           hair.

We      then           left     the      pub      and                  a nd       I went          i nto       LEPPINGS           LANE       stand

and                 and                     went        into      the        NORTH          STAND *

We      waited              in a q u e u e        for     a few          minutes-            behind           f o u r or     five         people          and

then         got        into       the     ground         by     t his           time       it    was    about 1*30pm                 (1 330 )*            We

did         not        notice       any     directions                to     the       standing           area^but              we    did       not

look         as        we    already        knew        the     w a y*           We    walked          along         the     tunnel         which

ran         underneath              the     main        LEPPINGS             L A N E STAND,             we      had       free       passage          way

along            the        tunnel,        as     there        w a s n ’t a           large        crowd        in    the       tunnel.              We

got         to     th e      end    of     the      Tunnel        and        went       to       the    left         hand       side       terrace

    i nto    p e n 4,         and     stood         directly            in       front       of a       crush         barrier*             At    this

    time      the       terracing           was       pretty          f u ll      and        it w o u l d n ’t t a k e           many       more

    people         till        it was       f ull,        but        th e        crowd       k ept      c o m i n g in*          At    about          2*30pn

    ( 1 4 3 0)     the       whole        crowd       surged          forward           a        couple       of     f e et ,    but

    unlike         a    normal        football            crowd        surge           we    d i d n ’t m o v e           back       and    where

    crushed            up    and    couldn't            move         o ur    arms       or m o v e        about.

We       were          like     t h is     till      about        3*G0pm              ( 1500)       and       all     th e      time       I could

see     people          still        coming         onto          the     terracing               although          there       was       no

room.         At    about          3.00prn         (1300)          there        was         another          push       forward        which

crushed        us       up     even        more     although             we     didn't            move       anywhere.           We       where

stuck       l ike       this        f or    about        £0       minutes           and      had       moved       about       4 to       5 f eet

forward        down          the     terracing.                   People         started            climbing            over    th e      fencing

o nt o t he        pi t c h     and        o v e r t he       side        f enc i ng         i nt o o t he r pens              and

oi,ontuali'' we                where        able        to    move.,                        disappeared             and       I eventually

got     onto       the       pitch         through           an    emergancsy                gate       where       I meet       up w i t h

                        ant                         We       made        sure       we      were       all       alright       got     a drink

of    water        of     pee D i e        who     where          going         round        giving          people       drinks.              We

then       went     back        onto        the     terracing                 where         we    had       stood.,      back    through

the     tunnel          out     of     the       ground           and     back         to    t he      car.        Compared          to    the

last       year     the        policing            of    th e      football              match         seemed       to    be    completely

different.                Last       year        when        we    c ame        off      th e     M63       we    were    stopped          in the

rar     and    the        car       was     searched              f or    drink.             We     where         then    told       to    park

the     car    some          distance            from        ground,            and while              we    where       walking          down       to

the     ground          you     were        checked           to      make       you        had     a ticket,            then    broken

in to      small        groups         and       filtered             through,              so    no    one       without       a ticket

got     near       to     the       ground.

This       year     we       where         not     challaged              by     the        police          untill       we    got     right         up

to    the     turnstiles               and       then        t hi s      was     only        a    quick          frisk.

To    my    knowledge               once      you       got       into        the      terracing             you    where       penned          in

by    the     wall        at    your        back        and       the     fences            down       the       sides    and     in      front

of y o u      so     there          was     no     space          for     you       to m o v e .            This    is    unlike          ANFIELD

where       although            there         is a       fence           at     the      front         there       are    no    fences          at

the     sides        so       the     crowds        ca n         spread         ou t     sidewards               when    the    middle

sections           are       full,         th is    reduces              th e    pressure              on    the    front       sections             of

the     cr ow d .

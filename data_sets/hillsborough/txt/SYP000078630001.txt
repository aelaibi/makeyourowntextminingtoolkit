Most    of the       people         I saw were          drinking      f r/fw . cans?   bottles and 2 l i t r e

By 2.00      pm the       pavements and             roads were            congested with fans 90% were

earring alcohol.

Fans    were asking            for spare          tickets and         complaining       that    unlike       last

year    there were         no ticket             touts and that            loads of them had          come

expecting          to buy tickets,

The    crowds were         heavier and heavier and the                        hill was a total mass             of

bodies and as            it a p p ro ac he d 3.00           pm people were           running towards          the

Leppings       Lane Stand.                I heard       it said that         the Vere Road Off Licence

A few fans had been asking where                            the Beehive and another              pub was as

they knew the            landlord and were meeting                        there.

3.00    pm as the game               start ed fans were             still     pouring down the          hill    and

P eople were askyng                 to    pass    our    barrier and so 2 dozen old and young

people were a / I owed down the                     centre       of the      road.     People were still

running ar o u m d trying                 to get around to the West Stand,

PC S t u b b i n / then joined              us and said to fans              that    there     was   no point

running      -Js    the game         had    started and 2 70QQ were queuing to get m .

P eople were         coming         out of the ground stating                  it was     chaos and      that

people were          sitting         in their       seats      (apparently with tickets).

The    crowd       in the ground            were        5 r o a r i n g 5constantly and still         there     were

people      running       down the          wads ley Bridge Hill.

coming out saying                its terrible         in there    ’people are           dying."        Heard

fans     saying       something        had     collapsed and we asked                passing    senior

officers           what we should do about              the barrier and they just                   told us to

hang     on there.

A   rumour         began that       the m atch was        off and      the    pitch had been invaded

by fans,            I heard this from              passing spectators,

T h e wo man who           lived at                                    came and told us she had

seen on TV that              the wall         inside had collapsed and that m any were

s e r io u s l y    injured.       Other       traffic mobiles         then began to arrive and                   it

was    decided        that 2732 w o u l d stay with the barrier and                       I would go          into

the ground           to assist,

I entere d the ground at about 3,15                        pm from the entrance                betw e e n the

N orth S t and and the S pion Hop.

I was      directed to Join a line of officers across                             the    centre      of the

pitch.         In front        of me fans and          police officers          were     intermingled,           the

m a jo ri ty       of fans seemed           to be dazed but there was                the o c c asion when             I

saw fans shouting at officers and                         pointing at them,             but other       fans

tried to           calm     them down and           lead them away,

The    f ans       in the West S tand were             poi nt i ng and       chant i ng and        people were

climbing           from the stand           into    the terrace.

The    fans        behind us were           f airly quiet and seemed            to sense        that

s om e t h in g w a s a m is s .

A scuffle           began     in the area          be low the Police Control             bo>; and as we

m oved forward             it a p p e ar ed   so did the     crowd and a cry rose,                  so we were

ordered        back       by one    senior      officer    in front       of the       line.

Standing           on the     line,    the ground a p p e a r e d      to be a b s o l u t e l y    packed and

I felt       that one         cheer from the Spion Hop would have brought                            the    fans

out    of the Li verpoo I terraces and onto                      the    pi t c h »

we were        then directed           to     leave   the ground and deal              with crowds         leaving

the ground.

              There was        no trouble with       crowds after the m atch at the j u n ction of

             F i e lding Road and Pen i s t o n e Road,      although    I received a number     of

             questions along           the    line of where was the     nearest   pub/off   licence.

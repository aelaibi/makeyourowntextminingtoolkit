m o s t l y on the opposite                side of the          road from the          bus stat io n and where

we were.         From about             "I o ’clock      (1300)     the s t ream of s u p p o r t e rs had

1n cr eased quite              s ub stantially,          most    of w ho m were Liverpool               supporters.

These      fans were           d ir ec te d   to the N S tand           or L ep pi ng s Ln end of the

g r ou n d via Leppings              Ln.      At about       this    time,      I noticed       that m an y of

the      fans were      carrying           four       packs a nd some      even had two.              M a n y of them

were      drinking      t he b e er /l ag er as           they w a lk e d along         the    raod.        B e tw e e n

this      time and about             quarter          to t h r e e there was a constant               group       of

people      ranging        for about           100-1500 yards           up P e ni st on e Rd N,         sat    on

w alls and drinking                from what           a pp ea r ed to be beer         cans.        Whe n   they had

all      gone,    there were            empty     cans all       over    the    pavements and walls.

T h e y did not appear               to be       in any great        hurry      to go to the ground.

At about         ten past         two    (1410)        a large    number       of Liverpool          fans were

 They were         escorted         by both foot o ff icers and mounted.                    I a s s u m e d that

 these     fans had       come       in a train from Liverpool.                   There were also          a

 large     number who          had    come along P e n i s to n e Rd N on our              side of       the    road

 who we diverted              down L ep pi n gs Ln.          Some    of these      fans    had o b vi ou sl y

 been    drinking and a few were                    o b vi ou sl y quite       drunk.     At some

 point     around this          time L ep pi n gs Ln was            closed to vehicular            traf fi c        due

 to the      volume      of    people       now using       the    road as a footpath.             Du ri ng all

 of this      there was         the    usual       behaviour       ie.   s ho uting slogans and           singing

 but nothing w a rr a n t i n g Police action.

At    about        two thirty         (1430)      I looked up the           length of     L ep pi ng s Ln and

 it   was    e x tremely        crowded and          I remarked to POL PC SANSON that                 it

 looked      like a      'sea of bobbing             heads5.        Noth in g    could be seen

 e xcept     the heads         of    those       going    to the match,         there were     no gaps         on

the     road.       At   this       time    e verything a p p e a r e d     to be going s mo ot h ly and

 there were         no   incidents          of    note.

At 3 . 0 5    pm    <1505)      we    liai s e d with POL PS A S H T O N and the             rest    of the

at P e n n i s t o n e Rd N and L ep pi ng s Ln,              on the opposite side of the                  road.

We    then      commenced along Leppi ng s Ln,                    as a unit      to go    to a Po li ce coach

to    stan d b y as      per our           briefing.       As we were         doing so    I heard via a

 radio,      pres u m a b 1y ^POL PS A S H T O N *s , as           he was      the only one       in my

 i mmediate        vicinity who            had a radio,       a m e ss ag e     saying that       the march...-

These messages a p p e a r e d              to be    panicky and         it sounded as tho ug h the

 person      passing      them was          unsure as to the exact               problem.      We a t t e n e d at

We    remained     in this a re a for about              five minu te s            during w hich        I heard,

via a nearby          radio,    that an a m bu la nc e was            on the field and a few

 seconds    later one a t t e n d e d where we were*                      It    passed thro ug h the

 injured walking         to    it„     At    this    time one fan wa lk ed from the ground

saying     something       like,      "Is    it w orth    it,      there are dead folk                in there,

some      folk    have died."          He w a l k ed off and was                obv io us ly distressed.              I

then      became aware         of a ma n who was             lying on the ground beside                   the

am bulance.        There was       no one near         him,     he was motionless.                  An officer

nearby said something about                   him looking          'in a bad way*.                We were       at

this     time    unaware      of e x ac tl y what was         h ap pening          inside     the ground.

There were ^ nn ou ce m en t s         being made over the                  ioupspeaker s y st e m.             We

were     then d iv erted       into    the ground where we                 then      passed the

a mbulance.        The man who        I had seen         lying        on the g r o u n d was         blue     in th

face      and did not ap pe ar           to be breathing, I think                    he was     dead.       Beside

the a m b ul a nc e   there were        two a m bu l a n c e m e n    giving m ou th to m ou th

round,     some    of w hich were           in a bad way,          some        of them were        only     partly

clothed and others were               o bv i ou s ly   injured.

We then     passed thro ug h a t u n n e l , about              tw en ty        feet wide      onto the

terrace     behind the goal           at the L ep pi ng s Ln end.                   There was a         large        ga

on the     terrace and         I could see that           the wire             fencing w hi ch a b u t t e d

the    field had been cut an d               peeled away,          a ll owing       access     onto     the

      a nd    checked with many                of them about          injuries.       I felt awful        at what          I

      was     seeing,       the scale          of     it left me numb.         I felt      inadequate,         as    if

      there was a bs ol u te l y             nothing      I could so,       it seemed as though

 calls     had been made          for them to assist            the Police and other services.

 Not    long after          I went    onto the        pitch the For es t       fans    began singing,

 doing     so by Police Officers.

 Many    of the fans were             blaming       the Police      for what        had happened,           some

 were    blaming       the F *A . and        some     poor o rg anisation,          saying      that    the      same

 began to make          our way       back       to our original       points.        As we did so we

 were    v e r b a l l y abused,      L iv erpool      s up po rt er s were    calling us murderers,

 black     bastards,         cunts,       etc.     We were   told that all          we were       good      for

 was    fighting and          kicking miners.            We w a l k e d aloung       the   lengthof

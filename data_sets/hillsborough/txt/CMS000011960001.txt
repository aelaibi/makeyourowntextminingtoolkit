LIVERPOOL:           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

1.     You will have gathered from your phone call today on
behalf of the Permanent Secretary that while no member of MTF
staff or immediate family members (so far as we know) was
involved in the Hillsborough disaster, Mr Jack Anderson,    a
Security Guard for the building, died in the incident.

2.     Jack was the "62 year old" who was referred to in reports
yesterday.  His son had done everything he could to save him in
the crush - but in the event was lucky to have survived himself.
We believe he is with his family again - though suffering from
major bruising etc.

3.      At a meeting of MTF staff this afternoon we took a view on
how we would respond to the tragedy.     We shall contribute to a
fund which the Charity Commission are organising for Jack's
family.    The Commission is the major occupant of this building.
But I will represent MTF at the funeral - and I expect many other
members of staff will want to be there too.

4.     We are making a collection in the office for the wider
appeal and will decide later where best to send those funds.
Again members of the  Task Force will be present at the Memorial
Service which is planned to take place at the Anglican Cathedral.
No doubt some of our Ministers will also wish to attend.

5.         In the meantime we are sending a card from the staff to
J a c k ' s f a m ily;   and I am writing on everybody's behalf to
                  at Liverpool Football Club.

6.     I have told Mr Kinghan's office that we stand ready to
help in any way needed - with local contacts, information etc.

                     THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER                           __

              STATEMENT BY HOME SECRETARY: 17 APRIL 1989


With    permission,           Mr     Speaker.       I    should   like   to mgKe Q
statement       about        the     disaster      at    the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club ground at Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday.
Everyone has been horrified by this incredible tragedy in
which 94 lost their lives and 174 were injured.


Shortly after the start of the match there was a surge of
spectators on the Leooings Lane terrace which crushed many at
the front against the perimeter fence. This accounted for
most of the deaths and injuries.


The dlOtCh WOS dU6 to Stort Ot 3 D » .                     To hfclp ensure orderly
access* the gates of the ground were opened at 12 noon.    At
2.30 p.m. most of the Nottingham fans were in the ground, but
many of the Liverpool supporters were still arriving.                         It was
clear to the police officers in charge that there was ample
capacity still to be filled in some parts of the enclosure
allocated to Liverpool.

At about 2.45 p.m.                 there was a large crowd of Liverpool
supporters at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane behind the West
Stand. There was difficulty in coping with the pressure on
the turnstiles and the police, used loudhailers to urge the
crowd to be patient.

                                             2.




At about 2.50 p.m. more Liverpool supporters arrived and the
numbers       in front      of the     turnstiles            increased.     Some
supporters started toclimb the walls and turnstiles and
those at the front of the crowd outside the stadium were
under considerable pressure from those behind.


The senior police officer present considered that there was o
possible danger to the lives of the spectators at the front
of the crowd outside the stadium.                     In order to relieve the
pressure he arranged for an exit gate near the turnstiles to
be opened to let asection        of the crowd through.   The
relationship of that action to the disaster on the terrace
shortly afterwards          is       clearly      a central      question    to     be
investigated.


My Rt Hon friend the Prime Minister and I yesterday visited
the football ground and the two Sheffield hospitals which
received casualties.    I would like to pay tribute to all
those involved in the rescue operations at the ground,
including the many spectators who gave their help; and to
those others* including the hospital staffs and voluntary
agencies who have since been working so hard treating the
injured and consol ins the bereaved.                   W6 heard many accounts
of courage exerted on behalf of others.

                                                 3,



 I have asked for further factual reports from the police and
 other services,    the local authority and the Football
 Association, Inquests will be held In due course. But over
 and above this, there is clearly need for a full and
 independent inquiry to identify the causes of the disaster
 and to examine what needs to be done tg prevent such an
accident happening again,    I have therefore asked Lord
Justice Taylor to carry out an inquiry, with the following
terms of reference:


            "To inquire into               the events at Sheffield
            Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989
            and to make recommendations about the needs
            of crowd control                and safety tt                  sports
            events",


Hr    Brian Johnson, the                 Chief    Constable           of    Lan c a s h i r e ,   has
agreed          to      assist     the      inquiry        as      an        a sse s s o r ;      and
a r r a n g e m e n t s will    be made as necessary for other qualified
assessors to be appointed and for the inauiry to be provided
with technical advice and support. I qm asking that the
Lnauiry should proCee(j with all possible soeed.                                   Lord Justice
Taylor          will      visit     Sheffield         tomorrow              to      begin         his
investigation.    I am                   grateful     to        him        for    agreeing         to
undertake this task.

However, we need also to take a wider view.                   The Government
believes that the future of football in this country lies in
a national membership scheme in designated grounds and now it
seems also in providing all seated accommodation at major
football clubs.  This would involve the disappearance of
terraces at those grounds. It might also involve amendments
to strengthen the Football Spectators Bill so that its
provisions      for the licensing of grounds matched this
concept.      We shall be considering these matters urgently,-and
kr-iM^ng frfewg^s, fowgrd                        po-frHb1e-

An appeal fund is being set uo by the civic authorities of
Liveroool, Nottingham and Sheffield, The Government will be
contributing £500,000 immediately towards this fund.


This was a devastating tragedy.                Our deep sympathy goes to
the families of those who died, to those recovering, and to
those still fighting for life and health. We owe a duty to
these passionate suooorters of football to examine urgently
and thoroughly the causes and background, and to do all in
our power to prevent such a thing happening again. We have
t8 set our sights high and find a better way for British
footbal1,

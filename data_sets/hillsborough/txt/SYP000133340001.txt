Dear Graham
Further to our discussion on the gathering of evidence for the
Coroners Inquests/ I enclose the photocopies of the newspaper
photographs and would ask you to pass them through to the correct
ofice.
You will observe I have marked up where I think Sarah and Victoria
are shown and you can see the relevant newspaper/page from the
photocopies.

Should you have the proper photographs and wish me to confirm these
thoughts please advise.

Once again thanks for your continued help in these matters - best
regards to yourself and Julie Appleton.

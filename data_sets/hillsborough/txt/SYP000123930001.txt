AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE HANDLED IT QUITE WELL GETTING INJURED OUT OF PENS 3 AND 4.

 Q54

 ^ T H E R E ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE STEWARDS AS IN OTHER MATCHES.     THERE SHOULD

 DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN STEWARDS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL.

 ABOUT THIS TIME A POLICE CORDON CAME ONTO THE PITCH, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN

BEjTER DEPLOYED.                                            /

 THE POLICEMEN AT THE FRONT, MUST HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT PJWS WERE FULL BEHIND

 THj~ GOAL, IF BETTER COMMUNICATION HAD BEEN RECEIVED BpjTWEEN THEM, THE TUNNEL

 COULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED OFF, THIS IS MY OPINION SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE AT

 14.15 HRS.   AS ONCE INSIDE THE TUNNEL, IT WAS THE POINT OF NO RETURN.

 THERE SHOULD BE SOME MONITORING OF   FANS, ENTERING THE GROUND,   AND THE

 ALLOCATION NUMBER OF FANS PUT INTO   THE STANDS, AND THEN CORDONED

 OFF STOPPING THE OVERCROWDING.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.   THE WAY THAT THE GROUND IS LAID OUT THE   TUNNEL IS THE NATURAL ENTRANCE,

NO DIRECTION WAS GIVEN AT THE TURNSTILES SO OBVIOUSLY THOSE PENS WOULD HAVE

 FILLED UP FIRSTLY - THESE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHECKED AND CLOSED OFF WHEN FULL.

2.    I BELIEVE IT WAS THE SIDE   RAILINGS WERE TO BLAME AND NOT THE FRONT

FENCING PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HAD     MORE ROOM, IF NO SIDE RAILINGS WERE EVIDENT.

Q18

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 A 0 THE FANS DID THEIR UTMOST TO HELP EACH OTHER THE POLICE SEEMED TO

ARRIVE IN NUMBER AFTER THE INCIDENT H 6 D J W P E N D AND WERE TOO LATE TO HELP.
                       CAy C
 I THINK THE POLICE WERE \SLQW TO Rjg^trT AT FIRST BUT EVENTUALLY THEY TRIED

 TO PULL THE FENCE DOWN ANb~R€l^ioVE THE NETTING FROM THE GOAL POSTS.     THE

 POLICE WERE GETTING ALOT OF ABUSE FROM FRUSTRATED FANS.

THERE WAS A LACK OF INSTRUCTION FROM THE TANNOY SYSTEM, TO THE CROWD, THE

 PA SYSTEM WAS INAUDIBLE.      THE ONLY PERSON ANYONE COULD HEAR WAS WHEN KENNY

DALGLISH SPOKE TO THE SUPPORTERS I ALSO THINK THERE WAS A LACK OF

 COMMUNICTION BETWEEN POLICE OFFICERS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND.


G1#

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS WAS WRONG LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE HAD THE
 SPION KOP END LIVERPOOLS AVERAGE GATE 39,000 FOREST IS 20,000.      PEOPLE

 WERE CHECKED BEFORE   THEY GOT TO THE GROUND LAST YEAR TO SEE IF THEY    GOT

 TICKETS THIS YEAR THEY DIDN’T.     THE   FANS WERE GIVEN NO DIRECTION SO THEY

 FORMED A BOTTLENECK   AT THE LEPPINGS LN.

 I WOULD LIKE TO SAY   THAT THE PEOPLE OF SHEFFIELD WERE GREAT IN HELPING

 S) WHEN THE GATES WERE OPENED PEOPLE COULD STILL NOT GET OUT. THE EXIT WAS

 JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1)    THE FACT THAT IT WAS A SUNKEN TERRACE HAD A LOT TO DOWITH                          THE    SEVERITY.

 IT    WAS SO DIFFICULT TO GET UP.

 2 ® T H E PENS SHOULD IF USED HAVE ACCESS ONE TO ANOTHER. I THINK THEY SHOULD BE

 RIPPED UP.

 3)    FRONT FENCES SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN/COLLAPSE.

4)     ENTRANCES SHOULD BE SPACED AND IN MORE NUMBERS TO AVOIDBUILD UP.

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT WOULD APPEAR THAT POOR COMMUNiTCATION BETWEEN POLICE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE

GROUND AND TOO SLOW TO R         ISE WHAT WAS ACTUALY HAPPENING.   POLICE WERE

 STOPPING PEOPLE |CLIM       G OVER THE FRONT FENCES EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD SEE

 IT WAS A BAD CRUSH.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE SHOULD HAVE HAD BETTER ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND, MORE STEWARDS

 WERE NEEDED INSIDE THE GROUND TO SHOW PEOPLE WHICH WAY TO GO.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 OVERCROWDED AND STEPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

 WHILST SOME PEOPLE HAD BEEN DRINKING,I FEEL THAT THIS WAS NOT THE MAIN FACTOR

 IN THE CAUSE OF THE DISASTER AS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BY THE MEDIA. I WOULD NOT

 STOOD WITH MY BROTHER.

 G42

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY FIGHTS OR DISTURBANCE OR UNUSUAL INCIDENT

 AT THE TIME OF TAKING UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 NO, THE ONLY UNUSUAL THING WAS THE LACK OF STEWARDS AND POLICE

 THE SIDE PENS FIRST, LEAVING THE CENTRE FOR LATER.


G16



 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 YES.

 G44

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH, IF SO, CAN YOU SAY

 WHAT TIME THIS HAPPENED?

 YES.   BY ABOUT 2.55PM <1455), THE CROWD CRUSH WAS GETTING VERY     &

 BAD.   I'M USED TO STANDING ON TERRACING BUT AT THAT TIME I WAS

 GETTING VERY CONCERNED BY 3 O ’CLOCK <1500), WE COULDN’T MOVE.

 <^p

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,   IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT

 RELEASE.

 I*DIDN'T NEED ANY MEDICAL ATTENTION.

 Q47 *

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 I SAW PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY DEAD ON THE PITCH, BUT I DIDN'T SEE

 ANYBODY DEAD OR DYING ON THE TERRACING.

 G43

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED, IF SO

 BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 WE HELPED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OVER THE SIDE FENCING WHERE WE

 HAD CLIMBED, BUT I CAN'T RECALL ANY OF THEM BEING INJURED.




 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE

 DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 I FEEL THE MAIN FACTOR WAS THE FACT THAT   SO MANY PEOPLEHADBEEN

 CRAMMED INTO THE CENTRE PENS WITH NO CHANCE TO SPREAD OUT SIDEWARDS,

 DUE TO THE SIDE FENCING, THIS RESULTED IN THE CRUSH.

 ALSO THE LACK OF DIRECTION AND STEWARDING IN THE GROUND.

 G50

 1-^pT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 TWENTY FIVE PAST - HALF PAST FOUR (1625 ~ 1630).

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER   APOLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 I HEARD THE ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE TANNOY THAT THE MATCH WAS

 ABANDONED.


Q 19

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               QSL644

YES.     I SAW A MAN ABOUT 40 YEARS, ABOUT 5*6 TALL, WITH BLACK STRAGGLY

HAIR* UNSHAVEN, WEARING A LIGHT JACKET AND TROUSERS, HE WAS VERY SCRUFFY.

THE MAN WAS LOOKING THROUGH BAGS AND THINGS WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE

  ERRAC ING, A FEW PEOPLE LEFT ON THE TERRACING SAW THIS Ah            ABOUT

HIM, THE POLICE THEN LEAD HIM AWAY


G20

<353

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY           INCIDENT

WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?               ?
                                                    /

 I FEEL THAT THE INITIAL REACTION FROM THE POLI^i,             STAFF , ETC

       VERY SLOW.   IT APPEARED THAT THE POLICE OFF KTERS/WERE ACTING ON

 THEIR OWN INITIATIVE WITHOUT ANY LEADERSHIP.     I SUPPOSE THERE MUST HAVE

BEEN A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM, AS OFFICERS SOME WAY OFF, DIDN’T APPEAR

 TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.     THERE SEEMED A SAD LACK OF MEDICAL

EXPERTISE UNTIL THE AMBULANCES ARRIVED, WHICH SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO

 GET THERE, ABOUT 3.40 ~ 3.45 (1540 - 1545).

A LOT OF SUPPORTERS WERE MORE ORGANISED THAN ANYBODY ELSE, THE POLICE

APPEARED MORE CONCERNED OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF CROWD DISORDER, IT

SEEMED TO TAKE ABOUT 10 - 15 MINUTES BEFORE THE POLICE REALISED WHAT WAS

F^pPENING.

 THERE WAS NO INFORMATION COMING OVER THE TANNOY TO ASSIST, OBVIOUSLY,

DUE TO LACK OF COMMUNICATION SOMEWHERE.

G54
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1)    THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS SHOULD BE REVIEWED, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

OBVIOUS THAT AT BIG MATCHES, WITH VERY WELL SUPPORTED CLUBS, THAT

 MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE TICKETS WILL TRY TO GET IN, THEREFORE

CREATING A PROBLEM.

 2)    THE SIDE FENCES IN THE CENTRE PENS WERE THE KILLERS, IF THERE
                                                                             PAGE 10
                                                                             GSL644

HAD BEEN A WAY FOR THE FANS TO MOVE SIDEWAYS, THERE WOULD NOT

 HAVE*BEEN THE PROBLEM.

 3)    STEWARDING AT THE GROUNDS SHOULD BE BETTER ORGANISED WITH PROPER

TRAINING GIVEN, THE STEWARDS AT HILLSBOROUGH DID NOTHING.

 4)    THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM BETWEEN THE POLICE SEEMED POOR, MANY OFFICERS

DIDN’T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

5)     I AH A WELL TRAVELLED FOOTBALL SUPPORTER AND ON ENTERING THE GROUND

 I WAS SURE THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO GET ON THE TERRACES, X GOT

THERE EARLY AND HAD TIME TO LOOK ROUND, BUT THERE WAS NO SUGGESTION

OF ANY OTHER ENTRY POINTS, SO I DIDN’T THINK IT WAS WORTH LOOKING.

 COPIOUSLY,   IF THERE HAD BEEN BETTER SIGNPOSTING INSIDE THE GROUND, THE

WHOLE OF THE TERRACING WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE EVENLY FILLED AND THE

PROBLEM WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED.

6)     I FEEL THAT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO ENTERTAINMENT AND NO

DRINKING ALLOWED INSIDE THE GROUND, THIS ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO STOP

OUTSIDE THE GROUND.      IF FACILITIES INSIDE WERE IMPROVED, I FEEL THAT

MORE PEOPLE WOULD TURN UP IN GOOD TIME, THEREBY LESSENING THE LATE

RUSH.

     G1S

      Q53

      AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

      ALTHOUGH THE POLICE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THESE PENS WERE HELPING

      AS BEST THEY COULD I SAW OTHER POLICE OFFICERS STANDING AROUND IN GROUPS

      DOING NOTHING   AND EVEN FORMING A LINE ACROSS THE PITCH    WITH THE

      OBVIOUS INTENTION OF SEPARATING THE FANS, BUT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY.     I

      THOUGHT A LOT OF POLICE EITHER LACKED INITIATIVE OR WERE NOT UTILIZED




     Q19

f
. 054

      IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

i JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

      AN ACUTE LACK OF DIRECTIONAL SIGNS WITHIN THE GROUND AND SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE

      BEEN CONTROLLING THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL.   BECAUSE WHEN YOU ENTERED THE

! GROUND THROUGH THE TURNSTILES THE FIRST THING YOU SEE IS THE PITCH THROUGH

      THE TUNNEL AND YOU NATURALLY   MAKE FOR IT.

               years.

               I am very           inte r e s t e d   in all     sports and a l w a y ^ have been,          one    of these

               p articular          club     in any     capacity,         but    I do make a point        of watching       it

               on t e l e v i s i o n whe n       its on.      I also when          I've   got time,    like     to attend

               big matches and this was the                         case for F A Cup S emi-Final            at

              Hillsborough             on S a t u r d a y    15 April       1989    (150489)    between Liverpool          and

              N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

              The        c i r c umstances      leading up to my a t t e n d i n g          the m a t c h are    that at

               this       particular w ee ke nd             I was   not going        to be very busy on the          farm,

              and when this              happens       I us ually try to do something with my brother
                                                                                                               PAGE        2

       , who      is a teacher and                lives    in York.       On the F r i d a y before            the

match                 phoned me and s u ggested going                    down to S h e f f i e l d for the

match.         I ag r e e d to go and                   said that        he would be able              to get

tickets         from a pub by the ground,                     I was also aware            that we would

p robably going           to see                  ’s brother         in law,                     who     used to

play     football        for S h e f fi el d W e d n e s d a y and still              lives     near the ground.

I picked up                   at about          11.00am       (1100)     S a t u r d a y morn i n g and we       got

to             's house       shortly after           12.00 noon         (1200),       after     having a cup of

coffee whilst                       went    out    to the      cashpoint,        we     left    in my    car to go

to the         pubs to     look for tickets,               at that       time there was

                       s wife and myself.               I drove       to one     pub and we each went                 in

d ifferent        doors
                 but there were no tickets to be had,                                          I then drove          to a

pub called the H or s e and J oc k e y / w h i c h is quite close                              to the ground.

The    four      of us got out             of t i W car me and                   went     looking       for

tickets,                 went       for    drinks and                    tayed outside.           This would

have     been about           12.30am        (1230)     and    crre px b was          packed with Liverpool

fans     to the extent              that the       pub/nad       run out of glasses and we had to

  18.00        seat    tickets a va il a b l e         if I w a n t s / them,          but as    I was    talking

to him Tony            came    to me and told me there w a s / s o m e b o d y outside with
                                                                            /
tickets         to sell,       so    I went       outside and         bought     two Leppi n g s Lane

tickets          6.00    standing          for f a ce v a l u e j / a l t h o u g h    I gave    the    bloke

  14.00        for a drink          for himself.

I cannot         remember a n y t hi ng about              this      bloke.     F rom there             went    to the

B ee h i v e    pub and the Rose and Crown trying                          to get t ickets/for                       ana

         , we had a drink                 in each of those            pubs,     we were unable           to get

tickets         so we w a l ke d to the ground from there,                            I think    that

being an old            player at Sheffield,                  was    confident        of getting        in anyway.

We    got to L e p p i n g s        Lane about 2 . 2 0 p m          (1420),     and thats w hen                  an d      I

             split     up from                and            . They    carried on down L e p pings Lane

             towards Pen i s t o n e Rd and me and Tony went                     to join the queue          to get       in.

             At the time we a rr i v e d             in Leppings Lane        the    road   itself was       r e latively

             clear     for such a big match,                 traffic was moving         freely along        the     road

             without         problems.    However          the area    immediately outside           the turnstile

$   Q        area where we were to get                     in was    packed and when w e / j o i n e d the         queue

        j^   at about 2 . 3 0 p m we were             immediately       caught     in a e/ush,       there were

             hundreds         of L i verpool        fans    behind us     pushing    t y get   in.    I was       standing

             in the      crush for what             seemed ages and there           d i d n ’t seem to be any

             m o v e me nt    in front    of me as though no fans were                  getting      in through the

             turnstile.

             I am 6*1         tall and     15 and half stone             in weight and       I h o n estly believe

             that     this     is one of the main             reasons why       I d i d n ’t get    injured at that

             time     because        I did feel       very uncomfortable.           In front       of me was a b^y

             of about         12 years     of age      standing w ith his          father who was a small               fat

             man,     I looked at         the      boy and    I could see he was havi ng dif f i                    y

             b r e a t h i p g , he was    turning         blue,    his m outh was open,       he was       gasping      for

             breath,         I feared that          this    boy was dying       because     of this    crush ws were

             experiencing.            I said to his          father, "You better        get that      lad

             out," an d he said,              "I    can't    get    him out."   I realised that        he was

             having      problems       too,       he was    crushed and gasping        for breath.         I made       the

             d e c i s i o n to     pick up the       lad    and try to get him to safety.             I made for

             the one side           of the area w hich wasn't              blocked    off that was to my

             right,      I only m an a g e d to get the              boy out of the        crush,    by digging

             other     people        in the     ribs and back         so that they had to move              out    of our

             way.     I e v e nt ua ll y m an ag ed to get           under a barrier and out of the                 crush.

             I stood the            lad up against a fence             or wall,     his father       had joined us,

             the    lad seemed to be alri g h t               so    I wa l k e d back to the barrier          to

             w here    there was a Police S e r geant                 on a horse.     I realised at that

             time     that     if    1 had gone       back to the back of the queue                 it w ould be an

             boy to      let fans             out    of the ground one at a time. I thought at the time

             that     these fans              had been ejected from the ground for trying                            to

             get    in w ithout           tickets an d that was                the    reason that there was               no

             m o v e me nt     of people            thro u g h the turnstiles,              hence the       crushing.

             The Sergeant a n s we re d me and said,                          "I have a l r e a d y a s k e d for

             permi s s i o n to get             them open,"         because       he said that         I decided to hang

             a bout    that area and await                  the gates          opening,       a l t h o u g h for a period of

             about     forty seconds                 I did.go      back under         the    barrier    but soon       realised

             it was hopeless and dangerous                          to be      in that       crush,    so    I got back under

             the    barrier.          From m e mo ry        I would say that            it was     now about

             2.45pm      (1445 5 and that                the mood of the fans had changed to one of

             anger     because          they        could see that        nothing was moving                in front      of them,

             that     they were           being        crushed and that the Police                 d i d n ’t seem

             to be doing a n yt hi ng about                   it,    so tempers were flaring agai n s t                    the

             Police,         because          the    fans   could see they were               not going       to get      in for

             start     of match.              Fans were      now    climbing         over    the turnstile        buildings

             and jumping            down       into     the groundy^I          think    I saw about          twenty five fans

         Gate C were aware              of the       problems outside,              but did not have             the

         a u t h o r i t y to open the gate and                possibly thought              this was a way of

         reducing        the    problems        outside.       1 would     like to say if I had have been

         couple of minutes             or so    looking         for          and    it was at this          time    that

         I saw a group of about                twenty Liverpool              fans make       their wa y up some

         steps of the West Stand,                   I also      saw that      the tunnel was        now completely

         full    of fans       because as       I looked towards              it I could see        p e o p l e ’s backs

         who were       pushing      to get     into the te/races.              At the top of the two               steps
C a ?i
         were    two Stewards,          but t hey were g r a b b e d          by the    collar and         pushed out
5rT
         of the wa y by these               twenty fans/who           then went       into the     s t a n d , I know        I

         w a s n ’t going      to be able to g &/C down the tunnel                     so    I deci d e d to go up

         the steps and          into the starra.            I did so and w ould have             been about         the

         3 0 t h person up the steps,                but    I   know that      loads of others f o l l o w e d me,

         until    I got     into      the stand       I was      not aware      that    it was a seated area,

         but    once    in there       I saw there were a few seats                    empty or not sat            on

         at    that    time,    so    I made my way down the aisle about 8 or                            10 rows

         from the front,             just    right    side      of the goal         posts,    looking      down onto

         pitch.       Almost as soon as             I got there        the    players       came out onto       the

         pitch.       From where       I was    I could see about 5 yards                    of the terraces            from

         the fence       back and       I remember          looking at        the    crowd    packed      in behind

         the    goal and feeling             glad    I h a d n ’t gone       down there.

         The m atch kicked off on time and just after                               I saw fans     climbing        over

         the    fence onto       the    pitch and fans being                 pulled up f/om the terraces

         into    the seats.          At that time          I d i d n ’t realise w h a a must         have    been
                                               CW'T                           C*/£-£/fell
         happening       down below.          This    climbing        over    the f/nce       continued and the

         people       climbing       over were       not    prevented        frorr/doing      so by the Police

         and they just sat             on the side-line.              To be fionest         1 wasn't      taking    that

         m uch notice at this               time because         the match was         still    being      played,       I

         think also that about this time one or both of the .jates in the
         c/rr
         perimeter fence was opened and people were getting out onto pitch t/fiat

         way.    I saw one       lad go out          this way,        he had his shirt          off a n d h e

         v io le n t l y sick    on the       pitch.       By this time        I saw P o l i c e m e n    climbing

         onto    the fence       in order       to    pull      people   out of the          crowd and so now

there w ould have            been over a hundred                people       on the track and the               pitch.

For     some    reason      I looked over            to the Police           control     box to my         right

and saw a P o l i c e m a n         come     down out of the           box and    run onto        the      pitch

and     to the Referee.

My first        reaction was           one    of d is ap p o i n t m e n t   that the m atch had been

stopped,        but then          in the next thirty or so minutes                      I was h o r r i f i e d at

what     I saw down below me,                 because      I could now see that              people were

being     crushed and             injured     in the terraces            ]        I first       saw     people

being     carried acr o s s          the     track    onto the       pitch and giv             heart ma ss a g e

and mout h to mouth,                before     being     taken away on stretchers,                  but     the

thing that        brought          home    to me the fact that               this was a disaster was

whe n    I saw a young             boy being       pulled out        of the     crowd by a P o l i c e m a n

and over the          fence,        this was       just to the         right of the goal.             As    I

looked at        it I know from the way his                     body was       limp and       loose     that      he

was     dead,    prior to that             I had been quiet,             but   I recall       saying       to

people around me,                 "That    lad's     fucking       d e a d . ” I just    could not         believe

it and     I felt       so helpless watching                 it,    I then saw a lot of             people

being     dragged out and taken a way on stretchers.                             The     next thing         I

recall was a young man                    receiving       treatment,         heart mass a g e and m outh to

m o u t h from a P o l i c e m a n and a few others                  on the     pitch about 20 yards                   in

from touchline            on my       right,     they were working             on him for some             time and

he seemed to          come        round and eve r y b o d y        cheered and      clapped       but      sadly

an d t ra g i c a l l y he        curled over and died.              By now there were m a n y              people

being     dragged over             the fence and out            through the gates and Police were

trying     to    pull     fences       down.

It w o u l d now be a bout 3 . 2 0 p m             (1520)     and     I had w i t n e s s e d two     dead

people,        one being a boy of about                  twelve years          of age.      I had seen

people     un c o n s c i o u s    on the     pitch     receiving m outh to m o u t h            from

Policemen,        yet     down below there was                still      people being         crushed against

fences     because        no-one       seemed to realise             the e n o rmity of this            problem.

There were not enough Police                   there and       it took too       long    for the fences

to be broken through and when                     the fences were        broken down       it was       in

the wrong        place,     not where          it was needed in the         terraces in front           of

me.    Also    the terraces were             still    full,    people must       have still       been

pushing       from the back          so continuing       to    crush    people down the front                by

the    fence.     10-15 minu t e s after          the m atch had been stopped              I could see

people     being      crushed against          the fences       behind the goal,          and    it seemed

to be an e t e rnity          before anything was             done.    I remember       shouting       down

to the Police,            "Pull     down the fences,          people are dying,"          I felt       so

frust r a t e d that        I couldn't       do anything,       then an amb u l a n c e    came and

parked      right     in front       of the fence,       where    the main       crushed were so

people      c o u l d n ’t get     in to help.       I remember       thinking    that    everything

was    going wrong at the same                time,    it needed someone at that                time    to go

to that       terrace w i t h a loud hailer and tell                   people    to stop    pushing,

that    people had been killed                in there and that others might                if they

didn't      stop the        crush.    I am    convinced       if that    had h a p pened at that

time,     more    people w o u l d have been saved.              I saw    people       climbing    over

the heads of others                to get onto       the fence     to get out,         people were          so

helpless       that       it was    upsetting     to w a t c h and     lots of us watch i n g          this

happen were         in tears.

It was at this            time     that   Ilooked      behind me and        saw that there were                  a

lot more       people       in the stand that should have                been and       I was wary of a

possible       surge my way,          also    scuffles were       breaking       out    in the    seats

between Liverpool             fans w hich      caused    people       to move away,       which    in turn

caused a surge w hi ch              luckily didn't       result       in people    falling

over    into the terraces as              they might      have done.       I c o n tinued       looking

down and saw more and more                   people    being dragged out onto             the    pitch

and    treated.       Time at this        stage      became a blur.       I just       couldn't

c omprehend what            I was    seeing.

E v e n t u a l l y the   crush     ceased and       I made    contact with               in the West

              We    left the ground             by gate B into Leppi n g s Lane and over the                         bridge,       1

               looked back and saw a line of bodies                          laid outside           "C*    gate a t t e n d e d by

               I went         home e v e n t ua ll y and thought about              nothing        else for three days,

               it a f f e c t ed me      badly what         I witnessed,       and    in the        period since        I have

              thought          that    if the following             had been done         that day,         the disaster

              may    not have happened:

               them of doing            it.

              Finally,          I am aware        that     fans will       get a large       part      of the blame          for

              this    tragedy,          but after         tr avelling      one hund r e d miles           to a m a t c h and

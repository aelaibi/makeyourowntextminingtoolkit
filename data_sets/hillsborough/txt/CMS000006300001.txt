TAYLOR REPORT: RECENT INDICATIONS IN THE PRESS THAT LJ TAYLOR MAY
HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS ON ALL-SEATER FOOTBALL GROUNDS

1.   Ministers will be aware of recent indications in the press
that Lord Justice Taylor may have changed his mind about the
benefits to spectator safety arising from the convertion of
football   grounds   to  all-seated  by  eliminating   standing
accommodation (an extract from 'The Independent on Sunday' is
enclosed at Annex A ) .

2.   LJ Taylor's report on the Inquiry into the Hillsborough
Disaster recommended that spectators should be admitted only to
seated accommodation from the start of the 1994/95 season (1st
and 2nd Division grounds) or the 1999/2000 season (3rd and 4th
Division grounds).   This was accepted by Government and this
policy has been confirmed publicly on numerous occasions by
Ministers, including the Minister for Sport last week.

3.   Ministers will wish to know that LJ Taylor has not changed
his mind about all-seater stadia and has written to the editor
of the Independent on Sunday asking him to correct the impression
giving by the article on 26 January.      A copy of LJ Taylor's
letter to 'The Independent on Sunday' is at Annex B.

              The Editor,

              Dear Sir,
                   In your 26th January edition (page 2) Jonathan Foster asserts that I am
              "understood" to have changed ray mind about all-seater football grounds. Not
              so. I made recommendations in my report following Hillsborough and see no
              reason to change them.  In the euphoria of escape,from the identity card
              scheme, the report was generally accepted,   It was predictable that when the
              cost of implementation loomed there would be some back-sliding.   But whatever
              the merits of the present arguments from the smaller clubs based on financial
              hardship, it does not help to suggest incorrectly that I have changed my mind,
              that I was concerned with "social engineering" rather than safety, or that
              seating is more dangerous than standing. Of course, simply to stick seats onto
              existing terraces regardless of sightlines is a recipe for trouble.    That is
              why, on my recommendation, the Football Stadia Advisory Design Council was set
              up to assist clubs to adapt their accommodation as effectively and economically
              as possible.

                   I have, until now, declined invitations to comment on these matters since
              all I had to say was in my Report.  I write simply to say I would be grateful
              if you would correct the impression given by your article.

                                                                  Yours faithfully,




              Copies to:-
              Mr Robert Atkins M.P
               Minister for Sport.

              Chairman, The Football Stadia Advisory Design Council.

              Chairman, The Football Licensing Authority

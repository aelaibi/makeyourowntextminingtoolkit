              usually such a short time before kick off most of the supporters
              have entered the stadium and the roads are usually clear,
              I sat in the front passenger seat of our motor car and my husband
              drove.      We travelled                                                         into L._e p p i n g <

          and    reac h e d as far         back as        the     road,      I cannot, estimate             how many

          people were          there all          1 can say        is the area was            tightly       packed wit h

          people.         It a p p e a r d to me         that     people     in the       crowd were unable               to

          move.         People    were      coming       from all       direc t i o n s    and    joining      the       crowd,

          I knew that          the    people       in the       crowd were Liv e r p o o l         supporters,                 I

          could hear M e r s e y s i d e          a c c e n t s and many of the            s u pporters were wearing

          L i v er po o 1 shirts.

          In my o p i n i o n a N j a n g e r o u s      s i t u a t i o n was   developing        outside       the      ground

          As we        drove away       from      the    ground     I saw        large    numbers     of Liverpool,

          supporters         heading        towards       the     stadium.         My''^is band had to drive                   very

          sl o w l y    because      of s u p p o r t e r s   standing       in the       road,      A lot of        the

          supporters         heading        towards       the      ground we r sK^dr 1 nk i ng from beer             cans,,

          They were         singing and           s h o uting      as they w a l k e d along the           road.

          As we drove          further and          further away from the                  ground     the    numbers           of

          suppo rters we          passed grew            1 ess and      .1ess,

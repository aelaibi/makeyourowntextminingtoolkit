              During          my    service          with          South         Yorkshire              Police        and     Sheffield          and

              Rotherham,                I have       been          to    many         large       football            matches       at     S.W.F,C.,

              and       during          my    time       at       West       Bar     did     many        duties          at   the   Leppings           Lane

              end       of    the       ground.

              In S e p t e m b e r           1987,       I    started serving                 with         the        Community           Constable          at

              F .1      and    have          been    on       duty       at the        majority            of      matches.          At    all    these

              games          I have          been    on       Serial             1   ( the   track) an d              I have        placed       myself

              behind          the       goal     near         to    gate number              5,     and       PC      1H85     Smith       has    been

              near       gates          either       3       or    4.        ^

              I orginally                took       up       this       pdiiition            as    there           was    less      manpower       at
                                                                          1/
              that       end       of    the     ground.                I have         never       been         detailed         any      particular

              position             on    the     track.

              On     S a t u r d a y , 15th April                   1989,            I arrived           at     the      ground      at    9.45    am    and
                                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                                      S873

went    into          the      North          Stand              for    the       briefing            at        10 a m .         Insp.              Darling

was    in    c o n t rol         of       our       sector             and    PS       Chapman             was     in      charge          of       Serial

1.     After          the       briefing                from       Chief          Superintendent                      Duckenfield                   and     Supt

Murray       I had a             packed             meal          in    the       North          Stand          but       received             no    other

instruction                regarding                my       duties          for       the       day.

I    collected             a    stool          and          placed       it       near       to       gate       5.        At    most          games        I

sit    at    this          position                as       it    is    directly             between             two       sets       of       railings

on    the    terrace             and          often          fans       climb          up    to       and       over       the    railings                and

gives       easy       access             for       climbing             the       perimeter                fence.              (Two       Liverpool

fans    scaled             the       perimeter                   fence       at    the, s t a r t           of     the      1988       semi          final

and    ran       onto          the       pitch.              I detained                one       as    he       attempted             to       get    back

in    the    crowd.              The          other          one       got    back          in    but       was       later       taken             out     by

St.     Johns          with          a    leg       injury,             caused          when          he    fell          from    the          fence).

The    fans       began          arriving                   at    the    Leppings                Lane       end       before          IS.00          and        I

stood       on    the          track          behind             the    goal       with          PC    Smith.              The    next          officer

on    the    track             was       PC    442          Cookson          who       was       near       the       s m a l 1 gate            in    the

North       Stand.              I don't             know          where       the       next          officer             was    in    the          opposite

direction             (South             Stand)

There       were          very       few       Liverpool                fans       in       the       ground          but       the    ones          near           PC

Smith       and       me       were       sober             and    well       behaved.                 I'm       not       sure       of       the    time

but    about          1 pm       I heard                a    radio       message             from          PS    Chapman          (The          radio           was

on    talk       through)                to    the          effect       " I ’m        taking          half        my      serial          for       meal

on    the    track,             near          the       players          tunnel             leave          the     track         via       the       North

Stand       obviously                going          for          their       meal.

About       half          an    hour          later          I saw       PS       Chapman             back       near       the       players

tunnel       and          assumed             he    had          his    meal       and       I was          anticipating                   a    radio

message          to       go    for       mine.              At    2    pm    I had          received              no      instruction

regarding             a meal             and       walked          over       to       PS    CHapman             and       asked       him          if P C

20    minutes"                 On    our      arrival              at       the       canteen         we        found       it       was       closed          and

one       of    the       ladies           said         " W e ’ re      closed             for       the    next          twenty minutes"                        PC

Smith          and       I then          stood          in       the    queue          until          they        r e - o p e n e d at           approx          2.

20.        We       were       served         and           returned             to    the       track          about       2.45-2.50                 pm.        PC

Smith          went       to     the       toilet            I walked              onto      the      Leppings              Lane          End        where       I

found          PC    700       H e 1 1 i we 11         was        standing             behind          the       goal.           I saw           the

centre          pen       (CN       & CS>         was        very       full          but    the          two    outer          pens       were           only

about          half       full.            This         suprised             me       as    I ’d      never          seen        the fans             so

badly          distributed.                   At        first          there          didn't          appear          to     be      a serious

problem             the       fans       were          swaying          back          and    forth          and       some       were           climbing

from       the       pen m a r k e d          N        on    the       map       into       the       stand          above.              This        is    a

common          occurence                at    large             matches.              The       swaying          and       pushing              became

much       worse          at     the       extent            that       females             were          screaming             and       fans        were

beginning                to    panic.              I    p ut      over       a     radio         message             to   the        effect:              "There

is    a    serious             crush          down          here       it     is      serious".                 I d o n ’t k n o w              if    it       was

received             or       not    as       I was          unable          to       hear       my       radio       due       to       the     noise.

At    this          time       I was          near          gate       four        and      it w a s        obvious             that        people

against             the       fence        were             in    serious             trouble.             There was             only           PC    smith

and       me    at       this       section                 and    I think             he    was      near        to G a t e         3.         I opened

gate       4    and       assisted             the          first       injured             rrian w h o         I saw       onto          the        track.

The       fans       began          to     spill            out.         I assisted                  this       man       with       a     leg       injury

to    the       St       Johns        at      the           corner       of       the       NorthStand.                   All     the           fans       who

were       spilling              onto         the           track       and       the       grassa ttempting                    to        get    them

back       on       the       terrace          through              gates          5 and         6    which          1 opened.                  At    this

stage           I was         joined          by       another           serial            which          arrived          from          the     direction

of    the       North          Stand.              The       first          body        I saw         was       on    the       terrace              behind

the       fence.              I cannot             describe              this         person          as     I could            see        little          of

him       due       to    the       crowd          but       he    was       male,          white          and       laid       flat        out       with

fans           standing          on      him.           It       was     impossible                  at    that       stage          to     get       to

him.        We    were          dragging              fans       out     of    gate          4    as    quickly             as       poss ib l e .

They       were       climbing          over           the       fence        onto       the          track       and       over        the      railings

into       the    North          Pen.            The    fans          began        pushing             the       dead       and       injured

through          the       gate.        Officers                 began        resuscitation                      on       the     grass.           I

assisted          in       pulling           a    large          f at    man       from          gate       4.        He    was       about        50

years       of    age,           I think              bald/greying,                 wearing             a    green          jumper.              He     was

with       his    son       about       30        years          he     had    black             hair       and       a    black        moustache.

He    seemed          uninjured              but       very       distressed.                     I    carried             hi s      father        onto

the    grass          but       I thought              he    was        dead       as    he       wasn't          breathing                and     wasn't

conscious.                 I began           to       give       him     heart          massage             but       it    didn't          appear            to

have       any    effect          but        I    continued              and       he    began          to       breath           for      himself.

A    Police       Officer             who        I don't          now        but    I think             he       was       either          from

Barnsley          or       Woodseats              was       near        by    said       "make          sure          he    d o e s n ’t      swallow

his    tongue"              I turned              him       onto        his    side          an       after       a       few     minutes          he

regained          consciousness.                        By       this        time       an       ambulance                had     arrived          and

was    parked          near       to     the          goal.           I carried              this       man       by       his       arms     and       a

civilian          had       his       le g       to    the       ambulance.                  Inside          the          ambulance           there

was    a    body       on       the    bench           and       one     or    two       on       the       floor.              We    had     to       p ut

the    casualty             down       and        take       the        bodies          out       of    the       ambulance                then        put

him    inside.              He    was        still          breathing              and       conscious                and       his     son      was

with       him.        I obtained                 no    details              and    d o n ’t k n o w             what       happened             to     him .

I d o n ’t       know       how       long        I stayed              with       this          particular                casualty           but

whilst       I was          reviving              him       on    the        grass       many          more       bodies             had    been

brought          from       Gate       4 and           were        covering             the       grass.              At    some        stage          I saw

the    first          officer,           he       was       Inspector              Harper.              I said             to     him      " C a n 't w e

get    rid       of    these          bodies".               He       replied           "Bodies?"                with       disbelief.                  It

appeared          to       me    that        officers             were        being          directed             to       that       end     of       the

g round      who       had       no     idea          what       was     t a k i ng      place.              At       some        stage       I ended

up    at    Gate       3    where        the          crush       to     get       out       was       enormous,                several          fans

had    fallen          over       the        small          wall        and    were          trapped             by       their        legs      and        the

            crush       behind          them       as    a    consequence               they     began            to    pile       up.        I think          it

           was     at     this      stage          the       fans    began         to     pull      at       the       fencing          which       started

            to    rip     away      I together                with       other       officers,               fans,          ambulance          staff

            began       to    kick       at    the       bottom          of    it,      sufficient                gave       way    so    we       could

            get     the      fans       under       it.

            I did       several          journeys             carrying             bodies      and       injured             on    advertising

            boards,          at    first       to       the    ambulance             station.                I first          remember             seeing

            about       6-10       bodies          or    injured          on       boards      on     the         floor       outside          the       gym.

            I made        another            journey          and    on       my    return       with         a    body       the       whole       floor

            outside          the    gym       was       covered.              I made       another            journey             and    on    returning

            this     time         I saw       the       bodies       were          being      taken          into       the       gym    itself.           I

            followed          suit.           I don't          know       how       many      trips          I made,          the       descriptions

            of    the     bodies         or    who       I was       during          this      time.              The       only    recollectionm

            of    staff       in    the       gym       I have       is       an    officer         shoutings                “S o m e o n e    must       stay

            with     the      bodies".

            After       all       the    dead       were       in    the       gym      and    the       injured             had    gone       I was

            informed          we    should          all       go    to    the      North       Stand          where          we    were       de-~briefed

            by    Chief       Inspector             Beal.           After          that    I was         asked          by    Inspector             Calvert

            to    sit     with      fans       on       a S.Y.T.          bus       in P e n i s t o n e          Road.           I went       with       PC

            700     H e l 1 i w e 11     and       2954       Mor 1e d g e .         The      fans       were          in    fact       missing

            friend        and      relatives.                 We    obtained            their       details             and       descriptions             of

            persons          missing.              After       this       was       completed            a    coach          arrived          in

            Penistone             Road       and    we       put    the       relatives          on      the       coach          which       I was

            informed          was       to    take       them       to    Hammerton            Road          Police          Station.              My

                                                                                                               PAGE

order    situation.               I could see           people a t t e m p t i n g    to    climb over         the

fence    onto       the    perimeter,        who       I initially        thought were          invading        the

pitch.         As    I became       closer       to the        perimeter          fencing    I saw several

people    being       crushed agai n s t           it,     some    of w h i c h were        blue    in the      face.

I immedi a t e l y realised that the s i t u a t i o n was far more serious than 3;

first    i magined and that               people were           trying       to    climb over the         fence       to

save    t h emselves        from being         crushed.



From    this     point,       a long w ith other              officers,         I began ass i s t i n g    people

climbing       over       the fence,       by standing            half way up it and helping                    them

down,    onto       the    perimeter.            Some,        however,       were a l r e a d y dead and after

laying    them on the             pitch and        checking        for    obvious       signs      of   life    I

r e t urned    to help others.                 They were          clearly s u f fering          from severe

shock and after making                 sure      that      they were         breathing       properly      I

placed th e m in the              recove ry      position .



The    process of          recovering        fans       from behind the fencing was                     slow

because       they were        pushed so tigh t l y a g a i n s t               it by people        behind that

it made       it v ir tu a l l y    impossible           to    pull    them out.            I carried on wit h

this    and similar           duties      for what         seemed to be about               thirty minutes.



I cannot       recall       any    individual           persons       that      I helped     remove      from the

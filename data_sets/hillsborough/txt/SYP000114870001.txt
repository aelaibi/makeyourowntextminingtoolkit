               At 9,00 a.m.     <0900), Saturday,         15th April,          1989 <150489),       I commenced

               duty at Hammerton Road Police Station.

               At 9.30 a.m.     <0930)       the same day,     I arrived at Hillsborough football

               stadium with other officers from Hammerton Road.                          The serial    I was on

               had duties supervising the upper               level of the South Stand and

               turnstile^ s^per v i s ion.       The Inspector on the serial M s ^ I n s p e c t o r

               Darling from Hammerton Road and two Sergeants were Js77 Gardener and
A
               Tur^nt^r*/^ Af^er briefing and a cursory search of J^e South Stand,                         I

               was allocated                                                                        with other

               officers.     The Nottingham Forest supporters who had been allocated

               tickets for this stand began to arrive early and there was a steady

               flow through the turnstiles from a^out                   11.00 a.m.        This increased

               steadily up until 3.00 p.m. withrthe majority of Notts Forest fans

               coming through these particular turnstiles being orderly and well

               behaved.     I saw nothing ofyChe          inside of the ground until after

               3.00 p.m. as I was beh i no these turnstiles all of this time.

               At just after 3.00 ft.jlu I went through the rear of the South Stand

               with Sergeant Turner.           We were to go to the gymnasium to meal at this

               time.   We walked down the players tunnel and turned right along the

               South Stand.        At this time I saw the game was in progress and the
                                                                                PAGE

       this point I realised some of them had been injured and immediately

       went to assist.  I went to a young man of about 15 year old, who was

       lying on his back     clutching his lower abdomen and complaining of

. *x
  A    pain.   I loosened his clothes and saw a young girl in a St. John's

       Ambulance uniform.      I asked her to get a stretcher to move the boy.
r      She never returned but a man also in a St. John's uniform approached

       with a stretcher.     Sergeant Turner and myself with two other o f f i p r s

       who I don't know,     carried the boy across the pitch to the side of* the

       gymnasium where other injured people were being treated by medics.

       We went directly back with the stretcher and saw that there were more

       injured in the same area.      We found another man who was semi­

       conscious.   He was    laid on the stretcher and carried by us to the

       gymnasium, where there were at least twenty people laid on the

       gymnasium floor.      As a medic attended to him we left the gym with the

       stretcher to go back to the pitch.        I overheard conversations at this

       time claiming people had died in the crowd.

       It was only at this time     I realised the severity of the incident.             As

       I returned to the     pitch for a third time,   I saw that it was covered

       with supporters and Police,     hoardings around the pitch were being

       ripped up by supporters who were carrying them to stretcher the

       injured from the pitch.      I returned to the same area with the

       stretcher where    I saw a man on the floor being given heart massage

       and mouth to mouth.      He was about 35 years of age wearing and red and

       white shirt and of heavy build.        His face was blue and his eyes

       open.                                                        He

       appeared dead and did not     respond to reviving.      We placed him on the

       stretcher and covered his face.        As we crossed the pitch I saw bodies

       at the other end and near to the Spion Kop.         Some were covered,

       others were being     resuscitated,   but several   looked dead.   We carried

       the dead man to     the gymnasium.     There were at least a dozen dead
  tside the gym and as we entered with the deceased on the stretcher

there were at least another dozen bodies            inside.   A C.I.D.   officer

called Detective Constable Locking from Hammerton Road told one of us

to stay with the body.         This was done by an officer who had assisted

us, myself and Sergeant Turner then went back to the pitch.

This time at the West Stand side there were no more injured or dead

on the pitch.      I heard a Liverpool      fan shouting "You bastards, you

fucking killed them."         He was   ignored and ran across the pitch

towards the South Stand,         I saw an officer      I know from West Bar

Police Station.      He stated how he had been pulling supporters from

the terraces.     He said that one man he had pulled out was dead and

that as he tried to revive him, Liverpool            fans shouted,    "Murderer,

you killed him."      He was extremely upset and I stayed with him for a

time until he was assisted by members of his serial.

I was directed to form part of a cordon across the centre                line, which

1' did with other    officers,    two of whom were on my original serial,

and we thought     it best to stay together at this time.            While   in this

cordon and facing the Liverpool          fans,   several   came up to us obviously

in shock and very upset,        looking for family and friends who they had

lost in the confusion.         Then there were other fans who seemed

completely unconcerned for the dead and injured.              Some asking why the

game   couldn't   continue,    others asking when the replay would be,

I was told all the gates had been opened and people asked to leave

the stadium but for about fifteen minutes the crowds didn't seem to

dissipate.    After about thirty minutes when the ground had almost

cleared,   myself and two colleagues went to Leppings Lane where we

joined with members of our original          serial.

On reflection,    there was a distinct       contrast between Liverpool and

Notts Forest supporters.         The Notts Forest fans seemed to be more

orderly and better behaved,        causing no problems at all.        From the
                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                       R414

         stand I was originally in on turnstile duty there were no problems at

         all and all the fans seemed well     behaved and arrived early.              I did

         not have a radio but from what I was told by the Sergeants,              a lot of

         Liverpool    fans were arriving   late and were not in the ground for the

         start of the game.     As I walked from the players tunnel at the start

         of, the game,    I saw that the majority of Liverpool          fans on the

         terraces had converged on the centre terraces behind the goal mouth

         with spaces apparent on the wings of these terraces.               This was

         noticeable as the rest of the ground was full to capacity.

         One further observations     I would like to make is that concerning the

         general   public order after the event.     Although it may be irrelevant

         to subsequent enquiries which are to follow,           since that day I have on

         two occasions worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on a

         security basis and although people will         be sickened by the behaviour

         of some supporters at the ground,      I personally find nothing more

         sickening than people taking      ’snapshots"    of their children in front

         of wreaths and flowers for their family album and others who come

         from as far away as London or Scotland,         to ask questions      like,    "Which

         is the gate that they opened then?"

         If people of this     ilk are' on enquiry committees,      I sincerely believe

         that the credibility of their findings      could be ’qu es tio nab le ’ to

         say the 1 e a s t .

         that the credibility of their findings      could be 'questionable'            to say

         the least.

ground appeared to be full to capacity.         As   I iUnsked towards the West

Stand I saw that the people on the terraces below w e re surging

forward to the fences        in the middle section   'CN' and    'CS'    in

particulary behind the goal mouth people were pressed to the fences

and cl irrtbi ng ove r the top.     I could also see supporters         climbing         7

from the terraces into the stand above.         I could see Officers trying

to contain supporters who were on the perimeter track and side lines

and more officers moving        into this area to try and contain supporters

from over-spilling, onto the pitch.        I carried on walking around the

perimeter track and across the front of the Spion Hop which appeared

full to capacity with Notts Forest        supporters.

Upon arrival at the gymnasium we were immediately directed back to

the pitch.       As I went back onto the perimter track I saw that the
                    (
game had been stopped and that Liverpool        supporters had converged

around the goal mouth at the West Stand side.            I was directed to form

part of a cordon in front of the Spion Hop as Notts Forsts supporters

were beginning to get aggravated about the game being suspended and

were surging towards the fences.         At this time I saw a Liverpool

supporter    run from the Liverpool     crowd on the pitch across the half

way line and into the Notts Forest end.         He was shouting and goading

the Notts Forest        fans and gesturing two fingered signs at them.              I

was instructed by a senior officer to get him off the pitch.                    I

approached him as Police Constble 60 Godley came up behind him and

detained him.       The man was about 30 years of age and wearing a red

and white shirt.        He carried on shouting and swearing and was

obviously drunk as he smelled very strongly of drink.              Police

Constable Godley took him from the pitch and I was joined by Sergeant

Turner.     As   I looked across the pitch I saw that more Liverpool

supporters were on the pitch and that a number of them were                   lying on

the ground,      several of them looked in obvious      pain,   it was only at

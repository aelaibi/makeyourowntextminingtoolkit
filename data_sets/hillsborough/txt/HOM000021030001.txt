 Dear    Home Secretary,                                             —

 L B ",5ltJSB 3 c °Py af 3 letter I have r ec eived from an agg ri ev ed
 IS    m       s up p or te r who makes      it   clear that the Police   in
 the N ew c as t le area are not l ea rning lessons from the Hi ll sb ro ug h
 Di sa st er that h a pp en ed a feu m on t h s ago.

Mr.                  e x plains       in  detail     what       took      place      in   N ew castle
re ce nt ly       when     Leeds       United   v i s it ed      N e w c as tl e    in    a    league
match.

I   would        ask   that        some   investigation         be    carried       out   into    the
m o ^ E r S - ^ aiSnEd, -by my c o n s t i t u e n t to prevent any further i n v o l v e ­
ment     with      Police    and    F oo tball       Supporters  that  could  end       up
in t r ad g ed y in the N e w c a s t l e area.

Your c o - o p e r a t i o n   on the above requ es t         would      be a pp re ciated.

Yours sincerely,




Bill O'Brien.          J.P,

    I attach briefing in the form of lines to take on football
hooliganism for the Prime Minister's interview later this
afternoon with Mr Lloyd of the Daily Express.

    I understand that DoE are providing briefing separately on
Part I of the Football Spectators Bill (ie the national
football membership scheme).

    The latest information from Essex Police is that they now
do not suspect foul play in relation to the death of Robert
Ayling, passenger on the Tor Britannia.  It appears that
Mr Ayling jumped or fell from the boat while under the
influence of alcohol and LSD. Press releases from Essex
Police and Scandinavian Seaways are attached as background.

FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM: BRIEFING FOR THE PRIME MINISTER

I attach briefing for the Prime Minister's use later this
afternoon, on the North Sea ferry incident and related matters.                   A
covering letter to Number 10 is also attached, which reports latest
developments.

Draft letter to No 10 from PS/Home Secretary


I attach briefing in the form of lines to take on football
hooliganism for the Prime Minister's interview later this
afternoon by the Daily Express.


I understand that DoE are providing briefing separately on Part I
of the Football Spectators Bill (ie the national football
membership scheme).


The latest information from Essex Police is that they now do not
suspect foul play in relation to the death of Robert Ayling,
passenger on the Tor Britannia.   It appears that Mr Ayling jumped
or fell from the boat while under the influence of alcohol and
LSD.   Press releases from Essex Police and Scandinavian Seaways
are attached as background.
North Sea Ferrv Incident


This further hooliganism by English football supporters is one
more disgraceful incident among, I regret, far too many.      The
Government is determined to take very positive action to respond
to this continuing problem.     Events on the ferry taking
supporters to a World Cup match with Sweden reinforce our
conviction that the Football Spectators Bill is the right way
forward.


I understand that Essex Police, who are investigating the
incident, are satisfied that no foul play was involved in the
death of Robert Ayling who was seen to go overboard and is
presumed drowned.     43 persons were arrested when the Tor
Britannia docked; all have been released without charge except
for 8 who were released on police bail in connection with drugs
and criminal damage offences.

releases, attached)


Why not withdraw or endorse hooligans1 passports?


Part II of the Bill is targeted directly against convicted
football hooligans, stopping them from travelling to certain
football matches abroad if the courts think it right to impose a
restriction order.    Withdrawing or endorsing passports could have
a much broader effect on all travel abroad by the people
concerned.   That would run contrary to the principle of a
passport facilitating travel.     In addition such a scheme would be
impractical given the availability of British Visitor Passports
and No-passport excursions.
Football Spectators Bill - Part II


Part II of the Bill will enable the courts to impose a restriction
order on someone convicted of a football related offence, where the
court considers that will help to prevent violence or disorder at
designated football matches.


The effect of an order will be to make the person report to the
police when a relevant football match is taking place outside
England and Wales.   It will be an offence to fail to report when
instructed.


The Bill also makes provision to impose a restriction order in
England and Wales on someone convicted elsewhere of an offence
corresponding to a football related offence here.


Hillsborough and Tavlor


Lord Justice Taylor's interim report was published last month and
identified what had gone wrong at Hillsborough on 15 April, when 95
supporters lost their lives.   His recommendations for urgent action
have been drawn to the attention of the police and the licensing
and football authorities who have been asked to do all they can to
implement them quickly.   His final report is expected around the
end of the year.
Police response to football problems


The police invest considerable effort in maintaining public order
at football matches.   There is well established liaison between
forces and clubs; some 5,000 officers are typically deployed to
police football matches each Saturday during the season; and a
new central police unit, the 'National Football Intelligence
Unit', is being established to co-ordinate information on 'hard­
core' football hooligans.


Recent developments in the Criminal Law


We do not hesitate to take new legal measures to control all
types of hooliganism, where those are necessary     and can be made
effective.


In 1985, following Heysel, Parliament made it a criminal offence
to be drunk at, or on entry to, a designated football match.     It
was also made illegal to bring alcohol into such matches.     That
legislation is effective and now covers journeys on coaches,
trains or minibuses going to or from football matches.     [Sporting
Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985]


The Public Order Act 1986 clarified and strengthened the law on
public order.   It created a new offence of disorderly conduct to
help the police to deal with hooligan behaviour and strengthened
the provisions against incitement to racial hatred.     Guidance was
given by the Home Office last year on arrangements for bringing
persons accused of hooligan offences before the courts swiftly.
Guidance was also issued to the police and the courts drawing
attention to the wide powers available to the courts, licensing
justices and police to prevent and curb disorder.

          Subject:-

              Essex Police are satisfied that there was no foul play involved in the
              disappearance of Robert AYLING who was seen to go. overboard from the DFDS ferry
              Tor Britannia in the North Sea yesterday.      After an air and sea search his body
              has not been found and he is presumed drowned.         Mr AYLING was travelling to
              Sweden with other football supporters from Devon,


              Enquiries reveal that Mr AYLING had been drinking and was under the influence of
              the drug LSD.     During the trip fighting broke out amongst the England supporters
              and Mr AYLING received minor facial cuts and was treated by the Ship’s medical
              people.


              The police have been told by witnesses that around mid-night a number of the ship’s
               fire extinguishers were set off. Some of these were of the powder type which
              created a eloud when hitting the floor. At that moment someone was heard to shout




              Mr AYLING was then seen to run out onto the deck and to go overboard, but it is
               not known whether he jumped, dived or fell overboard.


               DFDS refused to allow some 200 or so football fans to continue to Sweden. These
               were removed and with the assistance of the British Transport Police were put on

               a special train to London.


               As a result of this incident a total of 43 persons were arrested and were taken
               to Colchester and Harwich Police Stations.         All have now been released without
               charge with the exception of eight, who were released on police bail in connection
               with drugs and criminal damage offences.

    kTor Britannia departed Harwich, Sunday 3rd September at 1630 hours for
     Gothenburg in Sweden.         On bo a rd were 85& passengers* the majority of whom
     were Swedish nationals but amongst whom were approximately *50 Briton^
     who are believed to be football supporters travelling to Sweden to attend
      the England vs Sweden match on Wednesday 6th September.


      Following a disturbance on board, at approximately 2200 hours
      last evening a British male passenger was seen to Tall overboard.


      A search of the area was carried out in conjunction with the Dutch
      Coast Guard helicopter but unfortunately no-one was found-


       It was decided that the ship would not continue its journey to Gothenburg
      but return to Harwich whsre it is expected to arrive at 11 US hours today,
       Monday         September.

       The British Police are awaiting the arrival of the vo$g$l and will conduct
       interviews with those concerned on board later today.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL: PART II


It has now been agreed with the Association of Chief Police
Officers that the police service      should take on the role of
reporting agency, required under Part II of the Football
Spectators Bill.   This was announced by Mr Hogg during the
Committee stage of the Bill in the Commons.      In order to avoid
operational police officers being needlessly encumbered with
administrative work, it has been agreed that while reporting
should take place at local police stations the bulk of the
reporting agency tasks will be carried out by a central
"enforcing authority", which we expect will be attached to the
new National Football Intelligence Unit, now in process of being
set up.


2.     Substantial amendment of Part II of the Bill was required in
order to accommodate this arrangement.     The Government
amendments for this purpose were agreed by the Commons Standing
Committee on 25 July.    As the reporting agency provisions in Part
II of the Bill have significantly changed since its passage
through the Lords, Lord Ferrers may wish to offer an explanation
to Lord Graham and others of the purpose and effect of these
amendments.


3.     I attach a draft letter which Lord Ferrers may wish to send
to Lord Graham some short time in advance of the resumed
Parliamentary Session.      I suggest that the letter be copied to
Lord Harris and Lord Knights, who have previously taken a close
interest in these matters, and to Lord Bethell who has recently
taken up a representative role on behalf of the Police
Federation;   but Lord Ferrers may well wish to consider widening
the circulation - in the Commons Mr Hogg wrote in similar vein to
all members of the Standing Committee on both sides of the House.

DRAFT LETTER FOR LORD FERRERS* SIGNATURE TO LORD GRAHAM OF
EDMONTON




FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL: PART II


I am writing to explain the background to the Government
amendments relating to the reporting agency provisions to Part II
of the Football Spectators Bill which were agreed by the Commons
Standing Committee on 25 July.


As initially drafted Part II provided for a series of local
reporting agencies, each of which was capable of carrying out all
of the agency functions.     Since then, after further discussions
with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) it has been
agreed that the police service should take on these functions but
that there should be a division of responsibilities under which
the minimum practical amount of work will fall to local police
stations and the bulk to a central unit, termed the "enforcing
authority" in the Bill.    The Government amendments agreed by the
Standing Committee provide for this split in functions in keeping
with the practical arrangements agreed in detail with ACPO.


In this way we shall have the benefit of the police network of
local stations as the places where those subject to restriction
orders should report.     The local police will be tasked with the
initial registration of the reportee, establishing his identity
and forwarding his details to the "enforcing authority".
Whenever an offender is required to report on the occasion of a
designated match being played abroad, he may attend whichever
police station is most convenient to him.     The local police need
do no more than establish his identity, stamp a document to
provide the offender with evidence that he has duly reported, and
forward a record of his attendance to the enforcing authority.


We do not expect the numbers reporting to be high.     Our best
guide is the exclusion order provisions under Part IV of the
Public Order Act 1986.     These orders are being made at a rate of
about 1,000 per year so we might expect an accumulation of some
2,000 restriction orders in force after a build-up over 2 years.
Most First Division clubs are now in the London area and there is
likely to be a higher concentration of football offenders there.
If we estimate that one-fifth of the total number of reportees
are in the Metropolitan Police District, an even spread would
result in no more than one person reporting to each police
station.    With around 30 occasions a year when those subject to
restriction orders may have to report - and not all reportees
will have to report on all of those occasions - the provisions
should not be too burdensome to the police.


It is envisaged that the staff required for the "enforcing
authority" will be civilians working under police direction in a
common police services organisation.     It will maintain records of
those subject to restriction orders and receive details of
fixtures abroad from the football authorities.     It will select
those required to report for "discretionary" fixtures and issue
notices of the requirement to report in all cases.     It will also
give consideration to applications for exemption from the duty
report, and provide courts with evidence in the case of an
appeal.     It will also provide a report for the court as necessary
in applications for termination of the order.     The bulk of the
work of operating the restriction order arrangements will
therefore be met by the "enforcing authority".


I hope you will agree that these arrangements should provide an
efficient and convenient means of providing the reporting agency
facility.


I am writing in similar terms to Nicholas Bethell, John Harris
and Philip Knights.

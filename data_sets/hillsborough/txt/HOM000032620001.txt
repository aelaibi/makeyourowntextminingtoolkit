 HILLSBOROUGH STATEMENT: MEETING WITH THE FAMILIES

 You agreed with Paul Pugh that you would write to those families who had been
 involved in the Hillsborough scrutiny, notifying them of the statement next
 Wednesday and inviting them to attend the meeting with the Home Secretary. I
 enclose a draft letter for this purpose, together with one for the Liverpool MPs who
 have made representations on Hillsborough,

 attached behind.

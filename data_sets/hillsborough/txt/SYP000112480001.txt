superior was Detective Sergeant 5^7 Smith, we were allocated duties at the Leppings
Lane End of the ground with particular attention to be paid to pickpocket thieves,
At11.30pm was on duty in company vrith other officers and aware that DC Hallam had
wallet alarm in rear right hand trouser pocket, he was kept under observation by
officers ready to respond. This was due to large scale thefts last year.
On taking up position the situation was quiet and only a small number of supporters
evident, uniformed officers manning turnstiles, as well as others patrolling right of
way running parallel to river at side of ground which gave access to South Stand and
Penistone Road. Metal barrier i- position.
Further two serials controlling main road and accepting the coaches on arrival. Crowd

Afternoon wheres on and crowd develops in size, mood changing due to arrival of
supporters without tiokotn v:Lo were congregating at Leppings Lane asking others for

stage no problem.

1*30pn DC Hallam went down Leppings lane towards roundabout followed by team. Outside
chip shop crowd dense, large quantity of beer cans etc strewn about the street

2 x Sergeants (1 3.Yorks). Our area mainly policied by Merseyside mounted officers
and S.Yorks female mounted officer . Merseyside Officer constantly moving on those in
crowd with no tickets hanging around front of 'turnstiles and corner shop.
So much so this interfered with operation to arrest pickpockets,
At 2.20pm   the crowd had become so dense that obs teaia forced into area of relative calm
in front of metal gates beneath sign.
DS McSloy reports seeing Asian youth wearing glasses and sheepskin jacket plus one
other constantly going into crowd towards turnstiles and reemerging
short time later to join crowd again. Obviously pickpockets.
Men dissappeared from view and team engaged in finding                                     &

from mounted officers which totalled about four in middle of crowd at turnstiles.
2.40pm Crowd becoming desperate as kick off approaches       and no chance of getting in  o
Anger directed at PC Buxton and Inspector, situation aggravated by thousands still in
area with no tickets.
PC Buxton shouted to form a line of mounted officers across the front of turnstiles
to stem flow of supporters still coming up Leppings lane. Attempted to form line but
not successful in stemming flow.
Insp Bennett seen on top of wall pulling supporters upwards free of crush.
PC Buxtom assures crowd that situation will be resolved and that kick off will be delayed

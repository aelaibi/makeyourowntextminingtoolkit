            I am employed as Senior Sub Divisionajf8'
                                                    ’’Clerk at Hammerton Rd Police

            Stn and have he 1d this post since/January 1986.



            Over the last eight years / 1     have worked on numerous major football
I
            matches and carried oiijr my duties ei the r at Hammer ton Rd Pol Stn or

            the Sheffield Wednesday F o o t b a l 1 Ground.



            At the 1988 Sami F i n a l between Liver pool and Nott i ngham Forest,        I

            worked in ttrfe po1i ce caravan deali ng with property conf i s cated f rom

            Liverpool   supporters.     This year I was asked if I had any preference
                                                               /
            to which side I would like to work on, jBfnd I chose to do the

            Nottingham Forest    pr ope rty , due to iZ being very quiet      last y e a r .   At

            9.30am   (0930) on Saturday 15 Aprijr 1989 (150489)         I commenced duty at
                                                                              PAGE      2
                                                                              S2851

    the Sheffield Wednesday FooJ^Sal 1 Ground and took up position in the

     Owls Shop'    dealing wi^n confiscated property,       together with Police

    Constable 3063 Marsfr&lI.         It w a s n ’t particularly busy property wise,

    so we kept ourselvas       busy talking to the Nottingham Forest fans, who

    in my opinion,     didn't appear to have had too much to drink.         They

    were   in a jovial and carnival mood.



    At approximately 2 . 5 0 pm <1450)    the majority of fans had taken up thei r

    places in the ground.




t   Police Constable Marshall and I we re in possession of a personal

    and we we re listening for any instructions that we might recede.
                                                                                radio




    At 3 . 0 2 pm (1502)   it seemed as though all hell had let loose.        Police

    Constable Marshall and 1 couldn’t quite understand what was happening.

    We could hear Police Sergeant 616 Goddard shouting and asking for the

    match to be stopped.        We   could not make out what was happening at

    all.     Then we heard over the personal       radio that there were dead

    people which came as a shock to us both.            We stood and listened to

    everything that was going off but I cannot          remember details of what

t   was actually said over the personal        radio.



    The Nottingham Forest fans started milling around again and kept

    asking us if the match would be called off and we said we thought              it

    would be.      At approximately 4.30pm      (1630) Police Constable Ryan made

    an announcement over the tannoy that the match had been called off and

    would all spectators       please remain in their seats to enable the

    emergency services to gain access to and egress from the ground.



    In my view the supporters did not take any notice of Police Constable
Ryan's    instructions.        Everybody started moving away from inside the

ground.           By approximately 5.00pm (1700>     the Nottingham Forest fans

had evacuated the ground.



Police Constable Marshall           stayed in the caravan until 5.15pm (1715)       in

case any latecomers wanted their property.



At approximately 5.SOpm         (1720) we made our way to the gymnasium to

seek   permission from either Chief Inspector Beal or Inspector Sewell               to

return to Hammerton Rd Pol Stn.



As we were stood near to the gymnasium I turned just as bodies were

being brought out of one of the emergency services vehicles              into the

g y mn as iu m.     I stood for a minute in deep shock and realised I must

get back to Hammerton Rd            P o 1 Stn to deal with whatever Icould   as I

knew an incident room would have to be set up.



I approached Inspector Sewell and he instructed Police Constable

Marshall and myself to return to Hammerton Rd Pol Stn to deal with

relatives and friends of supporters who might be m i s s i n g .



I arrived back at Hammerton Rd Pol Stn at approximately 5. 50pm (1750).

My first dut ies were to gathe r as much stationery and equi pment for

use in the incident         room.     I then cheeked whether other civilians

would be available to work 1onger hours and make arrangements for

reliefs for the switchboard and on the enqui ry desk.



I took it upon m y s e 1f to        open the canteen in order tomake     tea for

friends and relatives of            the missing supporters.
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 52851

            From approximately 7.30pm     (1930) onwards,   I carried out duties on the

            enquiry desk dealing with people trying to contact relatives and

            friends and advising them which hospita1 to contact.



            1 remained at Hammerton Rd P o 1 Stn un ti 1 11.00pm (2300)   carrying out

            dut i es that were requi red of m e .

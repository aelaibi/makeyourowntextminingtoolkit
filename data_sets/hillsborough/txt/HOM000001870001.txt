As I walked towards the ground,                          there^wasvno'‘-trouble'1'br:*disb>der.

The only thing          I saw was a few people urinating in the street,

At about 2.30 pm (1430), we got                           to the Pennistone Rd side of the                            '         s'-;

ground.          We were then told that                   we would have to walk right ‘round the.-*

ground to gain entrance at the Leppings Ln end,                                         Ue had to walk to                      -'

the traffic island at Harries Rd and then into Leppings Ln. . . . .                                                            •

I would estimate we arrived outside the Leppings Ln entrance at about                                                               -

2.4-0 pm <1440),           U s « o u k have been there earlier had we not had to

stake such a long detour.

Wfssn we        got t h e r e , there were many people in a great mass outsiie                                        the

gates.          Thera seemed to be no queues for the entra nces.

We had arranged to meet a friend near to the gats                                          ’A ’ at Leppines

Ln.     We      were unable to see our friend in the crowd.

Because         we were already in the               crush, moving towards the tunstiles

marked         ’A ' , we were       unable to stop             and wait for our friend but we

were pushed forward towards thetunstiles                                    ’A*,                                  ’   *

So far. as I can recall,                  there were a number of policemen outside the

big-blue perimeter gates near to Lappings Ln, some of whom were or,

horseback.          They seemed to be doing nothing at all to control the

c r o w d s,               ■ ' .                 ■            .             ; 1 •.                            ■

There was no real anger or disorder ^displayed by anyone,                                              until- 1 was

pushed right up against the brick cabin holding the turnstiles.

Because we were all being crushed from behind, we were getting

frightened and 'angry."                  It was, at this stage, that people near'to the

turnstiles we re shouting back -over their shoulders to those behind

not to push,           '                                                       ...'/   - '             ''v-'’' •'./

I saw two police officers near to .these.,.turnstiles. '';.A.0ne^was/s^young

m s t at one time, was a woman in a white anorak, aged about 25 to 40

yrs.      She was being crushed against, the .wal1 and she .Was 'crying and

shouting.       She could not move towards the turnstile because of the

weight of n u m b e r s . . S o m e h o w or o t h e r , those of us around her managed

to push back from the wall sufficient for her to get through the

turnstile.

At this time the young          police woman and police officer were

 immediately in f ront of m e .        I had been pushed ever towards the

 riqht,    awav f r o m   the 'turnstiles marked *A ’ .         As 1 cot near to trie

 00 i iceman the crowa around ms demanded thax, the male pol ice off icer

 do something and he tried to climb the brick wall of the cabin

 housing the turnstiles.           He was not .able to do this iul 1 believe,
                                              .                                 -       4-

 eventually,       he got through the turnstiles to the inside of the

 ground,     The woman police offi cer remained in front of m e .                                 She

 became more and more alarmed as she was being crusnsd against the

 brick w a l l .   She did not seem to say'anything at all,' but looked

 completely terrified.          T think she got into the ground just before me.

~I would estimate that 1 was in 'the/crush outside the turnstiles

 between 2.40 (1440) and 2.55 pm" C1455) . .

 When 1 eventually got to the right-hand, of 'the turnstiles marked ’A ’,

Among the failures that occurred after the gams was stopped,                                    I would

list the following

(1)   For a very long time no medi cal help was g iy 5 n to pe o p l e who

were obviously injured and lying on the pitch.

CE)   For a vs-y long time, most of the police cn the pitch stood

about doing nothing,             even when spe ctators were carryinq the injured

and dead friends on advertising hoardings towards the f a r .end c+ the

ground.     Softie times the police and the spectators helped to ca rr y

those that were         injured or died.              ■ '.              .                   •

(3)   It seemed a very very long time before any ambulances arrived

anywhere near the Lappings Ln end of the ground.                                  '

<4>   The tannoy loudspeaker system was hardly used at a l l , either to

direct the crowd or to-inform the crowd.                          I heard no demand for a

doctor or other medical services up until the time I left at about

3,55 pm (1555),          I heard only one request early on for"the spectators

to clear the pitch.              I heard one request that the spectators clear

the Lappings Ln enclosure which also was a long time .after’ the

      Dear Sir

      Hillsborough Documentation

      Further to the numerous reminders I have sent in this matter, I have noticed that former PS
      Trevor Higgins (R 516) made 3 statements in all. HFSG have only been provided with one
      dated 2 June 1989. I should be grateful if you would supply me with a copy o f his further
      statements, R516A and R516B.

      Can you please acknowledge this request by return.


      Yours faithfully




      Ann Adlington
      Solicitor

On 15 April 1989, ninety-five people were killed and hundreds injured
at the F A Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough, Sheffield.

As a result of this, the Hillsborough Family Support Group was formed
in an effort to provide unity for the bereaved families.

The aims and objectives of the Group are:

1 To support and assist each other.

2 To seek justice.

3 To press for a National Body to standardise and supervise the Safety
  Certification process.

4   To improve safety at all sports stadia by revision of 'The Green Guide'
    and the introduction of such other recommendations from
    Lord Justice Taylor's Reports as are necessary.

5 To press Parliament for the introduction of the necessary legislation
  to ensure that (4 ) above becomes mandatory.

6 Press for immediate improvement in the Administration of Justice Act 1982
  (incorporating the Fatal Accident Act 1976) and for the introduction
  of 'non-liability' compensation legislation.

The victims of the Hillsborough disaster came from a wide area of the
United Kingdom.

We are now liaising with Mr Frank Fields, MP for Birkenhead, who has arranged
for the Committee of this Group toattend a meeting inParliament   on
Monday 4 December at 4 pm, in Room 11.

We are asking for your help and supportin achieving our aims. Your
attendance at the meeting would bemost welcome.

            Yours sincerely

Consideration


5.      Other Government Departments

       The Crown Prosecution Service, Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers and
       DNH have been informed that the announcement will be on Monday, and CD
       have spoken to their opposite numbers there.

       Interested parties outside Government


        Wednesday 24 June

       Operational Policing Policy Unit will speak, in confidence, to

                Mr Richard Wells, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police

                Mr Peter Moorhouse, Chairman o f the Police Complaints Authority

       Both will be given the terms of reference of the independent review, but not
       the text of the announcement itself.

       The Hillsborough Family Support Group will be told that you intend
       making a statement on Monday and that you wish to see them beforehand.
       They will not be given any details of the announcement, but will be told that
       your office will be in touch with the details of the meeting, eg where, when
       etc. We will ask HFSG to confirm who they wish to bring to the meeting. We
       will also check that all the families who have been in touch with the Home
       Office are represented by HFSG, otherwise we will need to approach those
       other families individually [Mr Redhouse/Ms Robinson - can you arrange
       passes to the House for the families to hear the announcement when we have a
       list o f names?]

       Private Office to contact:

               Mr Michael Howard

               Dr Brian Mawhinney .—

                M r Alan Beith

               Liverpool MPs

                Sheffield MPs

       (Attached is a list o f those MPs (not all of whom are from Merseyside or
       Sheffield) who have previously been in contact on the subject.)


F:\OPPU\COMPLNTS\SHORTSUB\PEOO 18MA.DOC
        We know that the families attach importance to being told about the
        announcement before MPs are told. They have made it clear that the matter is
        still a series of personal tragedies, and to use the words o f their legal adviser
        “they do not want the event to be highjacked by politicians”.

        We assume that you (Home Secretary) will wish to speak personally and in
        confidence to Mr McBride.                                               1      /
       CD advise that it would be preferable to delay going public on the fact there
       will be an announcement, so as not to detract from your (Home Secretary) visit
       to Leicester. We think the families should have as much notice as possible
       and that they could be contacted on Wednesday afternoon.



        Thursday 26 June

       News that the announcement is to be made will spread quickly and OPPU will
       contact by telephone:

               Liverpool Football Club

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

               The Football Association

       to confirm when the announcement will be made.


       Monday 30 July

       We propose that you (Home Secretary) should write enclosing a copy of the
       announcement to those families and relatives and certain others who have
       previously written about Hillsborough. These letters could be issued
       immediately after you have made the announcement on Monday. We will let
       you have a draft letter shortly.

       Copies of the announcement should be made available by your office to Mr
       Howard and the shadow and Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokespersons.


Media handling

6.     CD will be putting forward advice separately on media handling.

Thursday, so that you have the opportunity to raise any queries or request more
material on Friday.

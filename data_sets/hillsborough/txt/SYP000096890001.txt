        SUBJECT:    WEST MIDLANDS POLICE ENQUIRY - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



        In connection with the above enquiry and particularly as regards the
        forthcoming inquests it will be necessary for officers from the West
        Midlands Police to interview a number of officers from your division.
        These officers were involved in some way with the movement and care of
        deceased persons. It is intended that the interviews will commence on
        Tuesday 4 July.
        The enclosed letters from the Assistant Chief Constable Staff Services
        explain in detail what is required of the officers and ask for a
        personal response from them on Monday 3 July.
        It is therefore extremely urgent that they be delivered personally or
        left at the officers home address as soon as possible.
        Would you please ensure that the above action is taken.

    HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - WEST MIDLANDS POLICE ENQUIRIES FOR H.M. CORONER
    You will be aware that a team of West Midlands Police Officers under the
    command of Assistant Chief Constable J M Jones are conducting enquiries into
    aspects of the Hillsborough Disaster, not only to gather evidence for
    presentation to the current Public Inquiry but also to assist HM Coroner with
    the subsequent Inquest into the tragic deaths. This West Midlands enquiry is
    being performed at the request and with the full co-operation of our Chief
    Constable.
    In pursuing enquiries on behalf of HM Coroner it is imperative that every
    effort is made to establish not only identification of the deceased but,
•   insofar as is possible, the continuity of identification of each deceased
    from the point of removal from the terraces, through the resuscitation
    efforts to the point of certification of death and formal identification of
    the body. This is obviously not an easy task and much reliance has to be
    placed upon video film and other visual records made at the time of the
    tragedy, particularly with regard to initial resuscitation efforts on and
    transportation of persons from the playing area. Police officers were very
    much at the forefront of this activity and it is principally those officers
    who can best assist in establishing those identification links which remain
    undetermined.
    The West Midlands Team have identified 38 South Yorkshire officers, from
    statements and videos, who might be able to assist and you are one of these
    officers.    It will be necessary for you to be interviewed by West Midlands
    officers and to view clips of video film and still photographs with the
    object of establishing identification of injured persons and police officers
    portrayed.     Arrangements will be made for the South Yorkshire officers
                                              - 2 -



concerned to attend either at Furnival House, Sheffield, the Headquarters of
the West Midlands team or, in the case of outer Divisions, at an appropriate
station in the Division, and it is hoped that this will commence on Tuesday
4 July 1989. It is anticipated that officers will attend in groups of three
and that each group interview could last for two hours at the most. You will
shortly be informed of the attendance arrangements made for yourself.
M e a n w h i l e , e v e r y o n e concerned, the West Midlands officers included,
recognise that further discussion of the events at the Hillsborough ground
together with sight of film depicting some of the events of the day could
cause distress to those officers closely involved in dealing with dead and
injured. Should you feel that you may experience further trauma arrangements
can be made for the attendance, at the interviews, of the Principal Welfare
Officer,                                         or her deputy Mr                    who can offer
immediate c o u n s e l l i n g . A l t e r n a t i v e l y , individual interviews in the presence
of the Welfare Officer can be arranged to preserve confidentiality of the
counselling service. It may be that you do not wish the attendance of the
Welfare Officer at the time but subsequently, after interview, feel the need
for counselling and to that end I am enclosing an information sheet relating
to the Counselling Scheme together with                                          contact card.   In
order to maintain confidentiality prior to interviews your request for
counselling attention at the interview can be made direct to the Welfare
Office who will make the interview arrangements. Should this be the case you
should contact the Welfare Office as soon as possible and in any case by 10am
on Monday 3 July.
It is the hope of myself and the aim of everyone concerned with these
interviews that the investigation will progress without further distress
being caused.
Yours sincerely

        SUBJECT:       WEST MIDLANDS POLICE ENQUIRY - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



        In connection with the above enquiry and particularly as regards the
        forthcoming inquests it will be necessary for officers from the West
        Midlands Police to interview a number of officers from your division.
        These officers were involved in some way with the movement and care of
        deceased persons. It is intended that the interviews will commence on
        Tuesday 4 July.
        The enclosed letters from the Assistant Chief Constable Staff Services
        explain in detail what is required of the officers and ask for a
        personal response from them on Monday 3 July.
        It is therefore extremely urgent that they be delivered personally or
        left at the officers home address as soon as possible.
        Would you please ensure that the above action is taken.

visited a            confectioner's                      shop     in L e p p i n g s     Ln       to     purchase             a    packet        of

At 2 . 1 5 p m       1415        I walked               towards        the    turnstiles               at     Leppings             Ln     to    enter

At     this     time     I left m y            s ea t      and     \tfsited the            toilet         at    the    rear       of W e s t

Whilst        in the        toilets           I looked           through an           open window               down       onto    the

Leppings         Ln t urnstiles                and      could        see    that      it wa s       chaos,           people were

crushing         to g a i n        entry       into        the     ground.         I can         remember            commenting

into      the    ground        in t i m e        for       kick      off.     My      concern          for m y        friends         wa s

increasing            but    t h is      time        not    j us t    for    the      f ac t     t h at    they might             miss

the      game    but     for       their       safety          in the       crowds         outside         the       turnstiles.              I

could      see       people        climbing           o v er     the w a ll     to     get       into      the       ground.          They

had what         appeard           to    be m a t c h       tickets         in t h e i r       hands       which       they were

showing         to    the P o l i c e         Officers           inside      the      turnstiles,               t he P o l i c e

Officers         were       then        letting         them       enter     into      the       ground.

I returned            to m y       seat,       the      t e a ms     came    out      onto       the      pitch and           the m a t c h

kicked        off,      just       as    it d i d                            a r r i v e d at       her        seat.        She    wa s

The      game    had     not       been       underway           long w h e n      I saw         people         climbing          o v er

The    cent re            pens w e r e         d r e a d f u l 1 oy ovei— c r o w d e d w h e r e a s           the       outer      pens

appeared             to    be s p a r s e l y         populated          in    comparison.               More       people       began

spilling             over       o n to     the    pitch and a Police Officer                             ran o n t o       the    pitch

and    signalled                to    the R e f e r e e         to    stop     the    game.

During       the          next       hour      I witnessed             people administering                     artifical

respiration                to    others          on     the     pitch,        what    appeared           to    be    dead      bodies

and    injured             persons            being         carried      out     on a d v e r t i s i n g      hoardings.              The

Police       appeared                to    be at        /    loss as        to w h a t      they    should          be    doing, some

of    them       stood around                  d o iyng n o t h i n g       whilst       the      fans    were       giving       first

aid and          helping             others:

Other      Police           Officers^             however,            were     removing           sections          of    fencing

aministering                first          aid and           generally         helping         wherever         they       could.

For    the       greatest             part,       however,            it a p p e a r e d     disorganised                chaos.

Although             I wa s      aware         t ha t       there     were many          people         injured with             possible

fatalities                there       were       very        few announcements                 over      the P A S y s t e m         and a

period       of       confusion               reigned         throughout           most      of    the a f t e r n o o n .

I,    together             with                                 only     left      the      ground when             the

announcement                wa s      made       that        the     game    was     off a n d      for       people       not    to

leave      immediately.                       I gave         it a p p r o x i m a t e l y    ten minutes             before

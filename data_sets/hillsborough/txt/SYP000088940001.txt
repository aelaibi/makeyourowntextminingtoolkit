            I am a Policewoman in the South Yorkshire Po li ce stationed at

            Doncaster.

            At 3pm on Saturday,    15 April     1989,   I was on duty in Doncaster Town

            Centre carrying out operational duties when I received information

            that Operation Support had been implemented.             I returned forthwith

            to Doncaster Police Office where at 3.14pm that day, along with other

            off i c ers , I was deployed to Sheffield arriving at Hammerton Road

            Police Station, Shef f       ^ — "3-4n nm t.ha t.
                                                            —

            At. 4 .1^pm, along with

                    m d 1760 Snowden,   I reported to Inspector Bennett         (South

            Yorkshire Police) at the Northern General H o s p i t a l .

            At about 4.30pm we were asked to assist with the stripping of bodies

            which were being   ’h o u s e d ’ in the plaster     room there and this duty I
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            S332G

undertook with                                        and PC Snowdon,

was delegated to stand outside that room to prevent the unauthorised

entry of persons to it.        In there there were the bodies of 10

deceased,   3 of whi ch were on trollies and the remainder of which were

laid on the floor         All but one were males.

We systematically stripped the bodies while                     compieted

Casualty Enquiry Record forms containing as detailed descriptions as

was   possible,    lists of clothing and lists of that individual's

property.    We placed each deceased* s clothing       in an individual     plastic

sack w h i 1st personal    property was   placed in hospital envelopes.

The clothing remained with the body it was taken from and the

personal    property was    returned for the time be i ng by                 After

each body had been dealt with,       it was removed from the plaster room by

hospital staff.After       completion of this task we generally acted as

liaison between hospital staff and Casualty Enquiry Bureau t h e r e .

Later that evening with                   I attended at the hospital mortuary

to assist    in further documentation of the bodies and their

transfer to the Hillsborough Football G r o u nd by waiting a m b u l a n c e s .

After dealing with two or three that operation was stopped.

At about S.45pm that date,       I left the Northern General H o s p i t a l , I was

’stood down'      from the operation at 9.30pm and returned to Doncaster

Police Station.

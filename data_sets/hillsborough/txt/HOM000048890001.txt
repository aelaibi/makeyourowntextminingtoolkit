 1                                                                   2.00 pm
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Good afternoon.   In what capacity
 3        are you here, Ms Adlingtbn?         Are you here as Mr
 4        Houldsworth's solicitor?
 5   MS ADLINGTON:     I am solicitor for the Group, but
 6        Mr Houldsworth requested that I attend with him.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You are acting as his solicitor
 8        for the day?
 9   MS ADLINGTON:     Yes, but not in an official capacity,        I must
10        say.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I hope that he will not need
12        any legal advice.       I do not think that it is likely that
13        any of the questions that I will ask him will put him at
14        risk or anything of that sort.
15               Anyhow,    it is very nice to see you.       I wanted to
16        have a word with you about one or two matters
17        afterwards,      if we may.
18   MS ADLINGTON:     I have seen the checklist of outstanding
19        documents.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         That is really more of an aide-
21        memoire than anything else.
22               Mr Houldsworth,    it is very good of you to come and
23        see me.    I have read the various statements that you
24        have made.       It might help if you have a copy in front of
25        you.    I do not want to go through them all word for
26        word, because I have read them and I see what you say.
27        What I am going to do is to simply ask you questions
28        about various things that arise on them.
29               Could you look at your statement, which starts at
30        page 72?     That is the original statement that you made
31        and it is dated on the last page 16th May 1989.            I
32        imagine that this was made to the West Midlands Police.
33   MR HOULDSWORTH:       No.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         To who was it made?
35   MR HOULDSWORTH:       It was made to Sheffield Wednesday's own
36        solicitors.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Can I just clarify one or two
38        matters?     If you look at page 12, which is the last
39        page, you are dealing with the two tapes that were


                                          2
 1         stolen or which disappeared.     You say that one of those
 2         was the tape relating to the camera which looks over
 3         gates 9 and 16.      I think that that must be turnstiles 9
 4         to 16.
 5    MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is correct.
 6    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The other was from the VCR which
 7         had not been activated at the time.
 8    MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is also correct.
 9    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     If you turn on in the bundle,
10         you will find a statement which is made to the West
11         Midlands Police, dated 28th April.
12    MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.
13    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     On page 3 of that, again you say
14         (halfway down the page),     "The tapes concerned are (1) a
15         blank tape from a camera that was not operating;     (2) the
16         tape concerning turnstiles 9 to 12."      I just want to
lr,        check that that was correct, because there appeared to
18         me to be a slight inconsistency with what you say on
19         page 3 (page 74) of the first statement.      You had been
20         dealing with the Club system and at the top of page 3
21         you say,   "Of the 19 static cameras, however, one was not
22         in commission at the time because a wall had been
23         constructed after the camera had been installed, which
24         obstructed that camera's view of the relevant
25         turnstiles. The turnstiles in question were those
26         numbered 9 to 16, which were referred to later in this
27         statement".
28                Those two statements cannot be correct, can they?
29    MR HOULDSWORTH:    How the system was operating from those
30         turnstiles 9 to 16, there were two cameras in that area.
31         They overlapped.     You have the drawing of the ground, do
32         you?
33    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Yes.
34    MR HOULDSWORTH (Indicating on the drawing) :     You are looking
35         at this end of the ground.
36    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You are pointing to the west
37         end of the ground?
38    MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.
39    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The Leppings Lane entrance?


                                        3
 1   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.   These were the turnstiles that --
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Here are 9 to 16.
 3   MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is correct.    There were two
 4        cameras that were looking at that area and they did an
 5        overlap because of the angles of the camera. Then a wall
 6        was put across here, so it could not see that part ---
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     There is really then no
 8        inconsistency?
 9   MR HOULDSWORTH:    No, there is no inconsistency as such.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Thank you.   Could you turn on
11        to the next page, page 4 of the first statement?        You
12        are dealing here with the police system.      "Within the
13        police control box, there are seven T V monitors,       five of
14        them are dedicated, one to each of the CCTV cameras.
15        The other two are connected to special time-lapse video
16        recorders and you can switch from camera to camera by
17        means of a passive switch within the control room, so
18        the officers in charge can record the scene being
19        displayed on any one of the five cameras".         That I
20        follow.
21             "The remaining two monitors are used so that the
22        officer can check which of the five cameras are being
23        recorded at any given time".      I am not quite sure to
24        what you are referring when you say "the remaining two
25        monitors".
26   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Perhaps,   I could show you.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Are the two remaining monitors
28        the same as the two to which you are referring a little
29        earlier:    "The other two are connected to special time-
30        lapse video recorders"?
31   MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is correct.
32   LORD JUSTICE.STUART-SMITH;      Then it is purely a grammatical
33        misunderstanding.     I thought that you were talking,
34        possibly,    about two further monitors.
35   MR HOULDSWORTH:    No.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think that we have a picture.
37        I am looking at photograph 48 of the photographs.           As I
38        understand it, these are linked to the number of camera
39        that is referred to.


                                       4
 1   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    And then that one is one of the
 3        monitor ones, is it?
 4   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes, these eyes, obviously, are dedicated to
 5        cameras 1 to 5.     This monitor at the end and this one
 6        here, obviously, were put there, because there is no
 7        space left in there, and are attached to the VCRs
 8        (video-cassette recorders).     These switches here, they
 9        operate whichever one of these five pictures will show
10        which one is being taped on these two monitors.          These
LI        are the; passive switches.
12   LORD JUSTICE   STUART-SMITH: If you see something on     camera
13        1 which you want to record ---
14   MR HOULDSWORTH:   You just press one of these.
15   LORD JUSTICE   STUART-SMITH: You press one of these and
16        you will have the same here as you will get on      camera 1,
1/
X         but it is being recorded.
18   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Do both of these have exactly
20        the same facility?
21   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Exactly the same facility.     You could be
22        recording something from camera 1 on that one and
23        something from camera 3 on that one, so you would get
24        duplicate pictures of whichever camera you were
25        recording from.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Also I understand that there
27        is a system whereby one of these will flick from one
28        screen to another.
29   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Correct.    By pressing one of these buttons
30        here on the end - it is what is called an auto sequencer
31        - from those auto sequencers the switcher itself will
32        take every one of the five inputs and sequence it around
33        at a preset interval.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can you,   for example, just
35        sequence cameras 1, 2 and 3 and not 4 and 5?
36   MR HOULDSWORTH:   No.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     So it would be all five of
38        them?
39   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.


                                      5
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think that I have seen that
 2        happen on some of the videos.       Can you determine how
 3        long any particular camera will be recorded under that
 4        means?
 5   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, you can set it on those switches.
 6        You can set a preset timing.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can you help me about another
 8        matter?     If you go back to page 2 of that statement, you
 9        are dealing here with the Club CCTV room.        About five
10        lines up from the bottom, you say,     "Within the CCTV room
11        situated in the south stand and the players' entrance,
12        there is a bank of 20 monitors, plus a monitor for the
13        computer system. This computer system records the number
14        of spectators that come through the turnstiles for each
15        separate area of the ground.     Of the 20 monitors within
16        the control room, 19 display the scenes as depicted in
17        the Club static system".     That I understand.      That is
18        what we talked about earlier.      "The remaining monitors
19        are connected to the police CCTV system".
20               Am I right in thinking that what you can see on
21        that monitor (the one connected to the police CCTV
22        system)   is what would be being recorded on these two
23        monitors about which we have just spoken?
24   MR HOULDSWORTH:     NO, sir.   I could pick any of them
25        up irrespective of whether they are being recorded or
26        not.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Were you doing that?
28   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The next thing is that I want
30        to understand that we are talking about the same numbers
31        of cameras.      I have been provided with these numbers by
32        Mr H i ck s.   They are not actually in sequence, but number
33        1 was the one on the west stand, which by and large was
34        looking towards the Leppings Lane and the turnstiles at
35        that end.      Number 2 is situated on top of the south
36        stand, which has views all around the ground.         That is
37        the colour one.
38   MR HOULDSWORTH:      Yes, that is the colour one.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Then there is another one here


                                       6
 1        which is above the tunnel, which is number 3.      That is
 2        black and white.    That is used primarily, as I
 3        understand it, for the Spion Kop end.
 4   MR HOULDSWORTH:   That is what the police primarily did use
 5        it for, but all the cameras,      in fact, had the facility
 6        of a 3 20 degree sweep, so they could use it wherever
 7        they desired.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    If they wanted to go around
 9        the ground, and particularly if they wanted to go to
10        this end (that is the west end), they would presumably
11        use camera 2 in preference to camera 3.
12   MR HOULDSWORTH:    I would have thought so, but, again,    I had
13        no control over exactly what they were looking at.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Camera 4 is the one that is
15        overlooking Penistone Road and that can go either north
16        or south to see the whole range of Penistone Road.
17   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Finally,    there is number 5, which
19        is the one nearest to the police control box, which is
20        mounted at the south-east corner of the west stand by
21        the scoreboard.
22   MR HOULDSWORTH:    It is on the score board.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    That is camera 5.
24   MR HOULDSWORTH:   These are Mr Hicks 's numberings.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    But they are also, I think,
26         yours, are they not?
27   MR HOULDSWORTH:   They are related to what I have come
28        into now.    When I first developed the system, the
29        numberings were not exactly the same.       There is one part
30        of the submissions where he refers to camera 1 as being
31        camera 5.    That is wrong,   it is camera 1 that they are
32        looking at: the one at the top of the west stand.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    That is what I thought.
34   MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is correct. . That is incorrect and
35        I pointed that out to Ann last night.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I am grateful to you for
37        clearing that up.    That is to what I thought you were
38        referring.
39             Can we just go on a little bit more?       On page 7 of


                                        7
 1          the first statement you say,       "By 2.45 the Kop and the
 2          south stand areas were full of Nottingham Forest
 3          Supporters, but the north stand and the west stand areas
 4          were only about two thirds full at that time and it was
 5          noticeable from the static camera covering the Leppings
 6          Lane turnstiles that there was a build up of fans
 7          outside the turnstiles in that area."        Are you referring
 8          there to the Club camera?
 9     MR HOULDSWORTH:     Correct.
10     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think that that is made clear
11          in the next paragraph.      "It was through the monitor
12          showing the scene depicted by that camera that it was
13          possible to see the build up of supporters outside the
14          turnstiles".
15     MR HOULDSWORTH:     That is correct, yes.
16     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Then on the next page you, first
17          of all, talk about the delay in the kick off.         Then
18          about half way down the page, you say,       "The police, of
19          course, were monitoring the situation themselves from
20          their own CCTV system and, in particular, using the
21          camera on the south west corner of the west stand.           We
22          could, of course, see that that camera was trained on
23          the Leppings Lane turnstiles, because we were able to
24          monitor the police pictures on one of the monitors
25          within our control room".        That is camera 1?
26     MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, that is camera 1.
  ]/
IT     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     At the bottom of page 9 you
28          are referring to the request to open the gates.         This is
29 1        the request by the police,       "Open the gates".   The police
30          control replied,    "Yes, someone is going to die, open the
31          gate, open the gate.      And, as appears from the video­
32          tape recording, the gate was then opened, apparently by
33          a uniformed PC, and a huge number of fans flooded into
34          the area".      You are referring there both to the
            C l u b ---
35
36 |   MR HOULDSWORTH:     No, I am referring there to the static
37          camera and the static camera only.        I believe that that
38          is shown quite clearly in the compilation tape, the way
39          that that camera was situated - looking at turnstiles A


                                         8
 1          to G - is that it overlooked gate C and, again, because
 2          of the angle of the lens, it gave you a good view within
 3          the collecting area behind the turnstiles, the
 4          turnstiles themselves and gate C and part of the outside
 5          walkway.
 6     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You can see both from the Club
 7          tape and from the police tape, camera 1, people coming
 8          in through gate C .
 9     MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.     Here I was primarily referring to the
10          static camera.       At that point when the gate was. opened,
.11         I did switch the video monitor from the police system to
12          have a look at what was happening inside the ground,
13          because the central pens were very, very full.        It was
14          through experience and knowing the ground and what
15          usually did occur on this type of scenario - not when
16          the gate was opened, obviously, because that was the
17          first time that that ever happened - but when the two
18          central pens, which were the main attraction point for
19          fans, were full, normally what would happen was that
20          they had a removable barrier that went across the
21          tunnel, where they used to put stewards or possibly one
22          or two policemen.       It was when gate C was opened and
23          observing, primarily,      from cameras 3 and 5 that those
24:         central pens were full. Then, because I had no video
25          tape to record those,      I had no facility to record those,
26          primarily what I am referring to here is the static
27          camera.     When that gate was opened and from the way that
28          the crowd flooded in - from the angle of the camera I
29          knew where they were going, towards the tunnel - we
30          began to get a bit alarmed, because we could see from
31          the top angle of the Leppings Lane camera that no
3 2.        barrier had been put across.
33     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Are you saying then that at
34          this time at 2.52 you switched the monitor in the
35          control room to pick up what was being shown on the
36          police cameras 3 and 5?
37     MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, we were looking at those all the time.
38     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You have not said that before,
39          have you?


                                           9
 1   MR HOULDSWORTH:   No.     I have not said it in a statement,
 2        but this statement, as I say, was given to Sheffield
 3        Wednesday's solicitor.      I never gave a statement or was
 4        asked to by the police concerning that part of the
 5        event.   It was only through my observations.        It was
 6        what alarmed both myself and Harold Guest, the policeman
 7        who was in the control room.      That is what alerted us to
 8        the situation.      Obviously, we did not think that people
 9        were going to die, but it was going to be a very large
10        influx of people that were going to go down that tunnel
11        to pens which you could obviously see from the monitors
12        were overcrowded.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      When you talk about the
14        monitors, what are you talking about?
15   MR HOULDSWORTH:   The police monitor.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Let us just go on a little.
17        "At that point in time I realised from the numbers
18        already displayed on the monitor as having entered from
19        Leppings Lane turnstiles that a dangerous situation was
20        being created".      What you are talking about there, as I
21        understand it, is the facility that you have for
22        checking the numbers that ,are coining into the ground.
23   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That seems to be the reason
25        that you thought that there was a danger.
25   MR HOULDSWORTH:   No, it was taking the collective view of
27        everything that was happening.      If I had looked just
28        purely at the computer system, the computer system
29        counted each individual turnstile to give you a figure
30        of how many people had come through each individual
31        turnstile, and then at the bottom of that page, if you
32        like, on the VDU (video-display unit), it gave you a
33        collective figure for people that had come into that
34        area.    But that area was the whole of this.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I understand that.
36   MR HOULDSWORTH:    It did not designate how many people are
37        going to pens three,     four, one or two.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      But you knew, as I understand
39        it, from your experience,     that they tended to go into


                                       10
 1        the central p e n s .
 2   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Correct. That is what was alarming, because,
 3        looking at the computer,   if my memory serves me
 4        correctly, there were still at least another 4,000
 5        spaces in the collective area of Leppings Lane.       If
 6        people had moved around to the wing areas of the
 7        terraces, instead of going down the tunnel ---
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    That I follow, but what I am
 9        a little troubled about at the moment is that that does
10        not seem to be what you are saying in this statement.
11        It may be that there is no inconsistency, but you appear
12        to be saying, as I see it, on page 10, "It appears from
13        the video tape recording of the scene, the gate was then
14        opened, apparently by a uniformed PC, and a huge number
15        of fans flooded into the area".    You say that that is
16        what you were seeing on the Club static video.
17   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Correct.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    "At that point in time I realised
19        from the numbers already displayed on the monitor as
20        having entered from Leppings Lane turnstiles that a
21        dangerous situation was being created."       Those appear to
22        be the two things that in your mind created the danger,
23        what you had seen on the Club video and the numbers that
24        you knew had come into the ground.
25   MR HjOULDSWORTH:   Yes, knowing the numbers that
26        had come into the ground, but also, from looking at the
27        police monitors at pens three and four, which they were
28        primarily concentrating on, knowing that the numbers
29        that had come in had accumulated in the central two
30        pens.   It was an overview of the whole situation.         With
31        all due respect, sir, I was led by Sheffield Wednesday's
                                       —    — -         —    -
32        Solicitor in making this statement, not by a policeman
33        or somebody who was totally impartial.    It was an
34        overall situation and the cognisance that I took into
35        effect knowing the layout of the ground, being able to
36        see how many people had gone into the central pens and
37        knowing that from the numbers displayed on the VDU that
38        the majority of those people were in the central pens,
39        and that the wing areas were free.    When the gate was


                                     11
 1        opened, not by putting a barrier across, those people
 2        were going to aim directly for that tunnel.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes,    I follow that.
 4                Then you say,   "I left the room and went down the
 5        players' tunnel to the pitch and, just as I did so, the
 6        referee stopped the match, as I recall.         I looked over
 7        the west stand area and I saw fans climbing over the
 8        fence and my first thought was that there was a pitch
 9        invasion and the match had been stopped for that
10        reason".      Is that correct?
11   MR HOULDSWORTH:     It is correct, but this does not take any
12        cognisance of time.       It was not when the gate Was opened
13        that I immediately ran o u t .
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I follow that.
15   MR HpULDSWORTH:     We both waited to see what was happening
16        and where things were going to go. We realised that the
17        barrier had not been put across.         Harold tried to get
18        through to the police control, both by land line and by
19        his police radio. The land line was engaged, the police
20        radios were falling over, they were not working
21        properly, and Sheffield Wednesday's own radio system was
22        blocked up as well, because I tried to get through to
23        the police, who had a receiver in their police control
24        box, to tell them to get the barrier up, to try to get
25        them to do something. Then that is when Harold and I
26        decided that I would go down the tunnel to see what was
27        occurring in the area itself .
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Is the position then that you
29        had not appreciated from what you had seen and on the
30        screens that there was overcrowding?
31   MR HOULDSWORTH:     I had appreciated that there was
32        overcrowding.       That is what concerned us both.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Why did you not go out at that
34        stage?
35   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Looking back - and it is now a long time
36        ago - Harold was trying to get through and I waited to
37        see who was getting through.         He could not leave his
38        position arid that is when it was decided that I would go
39        down.     I said,   "I will go down and see what is


                                        12
 1        happening, see if we can get something to make a barrier
 2        to block that off".     By the time that I got down there,
 3        things had already started to occur.      I will freely
 4        admit that at first I thought that it was pitch
 5        ihvasion.     The referee was just in the process of
 6        stopping the game.     I just sat down at the bottom of the
 7        tunnel and just looked over to see what was happening.
 8        Then two minutes after that, and certainly no longer,
 9        one of the lads ran back and the ground staff got us a
10        couple of stretchers.     He said,   "They are hurt" and we
11        ran over.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not want to get on to that
13        for a moment.    Mr Guest saw everything that you saw in
14        the control room, did he?
15   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can you tell me - I do not know
17        whether you can remember - when you saw the gate open,
18        was it before or after that that you switched over to
19        look at what cameras 5 and 3 were doing?
20   MR HOULDSWORTH:    We were flicking between them all the time.
21        The way in which the system worked and how it was
22        devised to work, with the police officer down there, was
23        that he was the liaison between the Club control and the
24        police.     Although the Club control room was purely
25        independent and was not meant there as a function for
26        crowd safety, it was primarily devised for anti-fraud.
27        The policeman was put in there as a sort of liaison.
28        That was all.    How it used to work was that the police
29        had no VDU input, no computer input in their control
30        room, so, in an ordinary game, we would say when the Kop
31        was getting full, because, as it came up to two thirds
32        full,   it gave an indication on the computer.    What used
33        to happen was that Harold used to inform the police
34        control box and ask them to turn the camera down
35        Penistone Road one way or the other, so that we could
36        see the build up of the crowd, see if there was still a
37        lot coming down who would need entry or to see if it was
38        relatively free.      Say, we had about two and a half
39        thousand spaces, looking through the Penistone Road


                                      13
 1        camera, it was obvious that there were quite a number of
 2        people coming down still requiring entry into the Spion
 3        Kop area, we would then advise that they start closing
 4        turnstiles and the police and stewards, who were
 5        primarily outside    (primarily the police) would start
 6        moving people around to other areas of the ground which
 7        still had plenty of capacity to take them.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    That I follow.   When you are
 9        coming up to the maximum number on your "numbers
10        monitors",    if I can refer to them as that, you then want
11        to see how many people are coming in at Penistone Road,
12        if you are dealing with the Kop end.      That is right, is
13        it not?
14   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Similarly, you would want to see
16        what the position was at the Leppings Lane end if they
17        were coming up there.
18   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes, if you were concerned about the other
19        side.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    What I do not quite follow at
21        the moment is why you need to look inside the ground.
22   MR HOULDSWORTH:    To look inside the ground gives you
23        the indication, as I say, because you take the
24        accumulative effect of the arda. The computer does not
25        recognise if they go into one section or the other.       It
26        just counts the people coming through the turnstiles
27        which had access to the whole of the Leppings Lane
28        terraces.     At a football game, the primary objective of
29        most fans is to try to get behind the goal, so we knew
30        that the central pens were the ones that always got full
31        first.     On matches before, when those pens have been
32        full, we have looked in, and the police themselves have
33        done it, we did not advise them to barrier the tunnel
34        off, the police usually did it themselves.      They
35        barriered the tunnel off and started moving people to
36        the win gs.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not want you to run on too
38        much.     Would this be right?   If one were to have a
39        record of what camera 3 was doing in the ten minutes


                                      14
 1         before 3 o'clock,      say, it would be focusing on the
 2         Leippings Lane terraces, would it?
 3   MR HOULDSWORTH:        Whether it was focusing there all the
 4         time or not, I do not know.          It was just that, when we
 5         looked at it, they had swung the camera away and had
 6         swung it around to Leppings Lane and one of the shots
 7         was at a fairly wide angle - I would say about half zoom
 8         - which showed the central pens quite full. Number 5
             ^ " —             “   '              ~
 9         camera was parked in an area that you could see the
10         central pens at a fairly wide angle.          It was taking the
11         two.     They were not concentrating on one camera,
12         because, as I say,      I had no control over the camera,    it
13         was a case of switching between the cameras.
14   LO$D JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        So far as camera 5 was concerned,
15         the views that you saw from camera 5, where was that
16      jj concentrated on?
17   MRiHOULDSWORTH:        That was concentrated along the Leppings
18      S Lane area, at right angles to it.
19   LOK[D JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:  Do you mean the terraces?
        I
20   MS. HOULDSWORTH:  Yes, the terraces.
21   LQljD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What was it showing?
22   M r IiIh QULDSWORTH:   It was showing the build up of the crowd.
23         You could see that the central pens were full, but there
24         were spaces both this side of the pens and the far side.
25   LCM6 JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I see.
26                  Can we go to the record of the interview which you
27         had with Yorkshire TV,      "First Tuesday"?
28   MR HOULDSWORTH:        Can I just have a short break?
29                          (Break from 2.37 to 2.41 p m )
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        If we could pick up the
31          interview with the television company at page 3, where
32         you say,     "I've linked the video inputs down to here so
33          that the policeman, Harold Guest and Wednesday's own
34          security man can see what the police are actually
35          looking a t .    We put it on to camera one which is the
36          west stand camera which overlooks the Leppings Lane
37          end."     That you confirm is camera 1 and not camera 5.
38   MR HOULDSWORTH:        That is correct.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You are dealing here with the


                                         15
 1           period,    I think,   just before the trouble starts.     You
    2        could see that the crowd was building up.       "This kept
 3           continuing up to approximately two thirty, two thirty
 4           five, where we could see that from that camera and also
    5        from the camera that is part of the Wednesday's own
    6        system,    it overlooks turnstiles A to G and gate C, that
 7           it was a very, sort of abnormal build up."
    8             You are talking there about the Sheffield Wednesday
    9        camera which looks over gates A to G and also camera 1.
10                    Then you go on at the bottom to say,   "So it was
U            just a case that we watched it happening.       At
12           approximately twenty to three, somewhere around about
13           that region, we did notice that gate C was open and an
14           influx of people came through the gate ". Again, you are
15           talking about police camera 1 and your own camera at
16           that stage.     Is that right?
17      MR HOULDSWORTH:     Primarily,   I am talking about Wednesday's
18           own camera.
19      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       "Eventually the police got that
20           under control by putting a police horse across
21           gate C ..."     Then you are asked,   "Can I just interrupt
22           you at that point and ask you, you say it was an
23           abnormal build up, can you tell me what made you think
24           it was abnormal. What you saw on the monitors?"         Then
25           you reply,    "Well what we saw on the monitors was the
26           mass of humanity that was outside the gates and looking
27           from the monitors themselv e s j m d from the inputs that
28           were going through on the computer system that there was
29         \ no relationship between the two".       The monitors there,
30           as IunderstaSdTTtT are the police camera 1 and the Club
3L           camera, but then you are referring to the inputs, the
32         | numbers, and that is the numbers monitor.       Is that
33           right?
34      MR HOULDSWORTH:     Correct.
35      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        "There was, there seemed to
35           be less people as though they'd got only a small crowd
37           outside coming through the turnstiles.       So that led us
38           to believe, or led me to believe, that the crowds
39           outside were forcing so much pressure against the


                                           16
 1        entrances to the turnstiles,        instead of being like an
 2        orderly queue.        You don't look for the type of problem
 3        that obviously did occur, but you could see that there
 4        was a problem".        Again, I think this must be a reference
 5        to what you are seeing outside the turnstiles or around
 6        the turnstiles.
 7   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Correct.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        "Now what the cause of that
 9        problem was I honestly didn't know but I had my own
10        thoughts that too many people had come too late as
11        opposed to last season's game, which I was also in
12        attendance in the same position here, it was a more
13        steady flow from an earlier hour".         Is that correct?
14   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is what you thought.       Then
16        you are asked,    "Did you talk with the policeman who was
17        in here with you and what was the conversation that you
18        had with him?     Was he aware of the problem?"        You said,
19        "The policeman was aware of the problem, but again I
20        don't think really either myself, the policeman or Mr
21        Lock sort of took any cognisance of what was happening
22        outside.     You could hear the police radios and they were
23        breaking down.        For what reason that was I do not know.
24        Because it seemed to be as if there was an awful amount
25        of static on the police radio".        So there was a problem
26        with the radio, was there not?
27   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Correct.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Then you are asked,   "OK.     So let
29        me ask you then, Roger.        Not talking about the very
30        early part of the day but from when the crowds really
31        started to build up.        If you can tell us what you saw on
32        your screen when you saw the crowds building."             Then you
33        say,   "Well what I saw on the screens from both the
34        camera on A to G and from the police monitor that the
35        others.    A large build up of people outside the Leppings
36        Lane turnstiles which sent very abnormal        ..."      Again,
37        you are looking at those two cameras, the police camera
38        1 and the Club one, is that right?
39   MR HOULDSWORTH:     That is right, yes.


                                         17
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        "We came to the realisation that
 2        a lot Of people had arrived late and they were all
 3        trying to get into the ground obviously before the kick
 4        off at three o'clock.        The crowd outside bore no sort of
 5        relationship to the people who were actually going
 6        through the turnstiles as I saw which led me to believe
 7        that there was a build up which would not allow the
 8        normal flow through".
 9             Then you say,     "At about twenty to three, somewhere
10        in that region, gate C was opened, at the time we didn't
11        k n o w why it was opened, just that it was opened. A large
12        amount of people came into the ground."         This is the
13        first occasion when gate C was opened, when it was to
14        eject a fan, I think.
15   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Correct.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        A little further down,   "At about
17        ten to, five to three when we heard that gate C was
18        asked to be opened by the police, the command was given
19        for gate C to be opened.         It was opened and the flow of
20        people came through.         It came through fairly steadily.
21        It built up to a surge, died off for a short while and
22        then it built up again and it built up then and it was
23        at that point then that I left the room to go down to
24        the entrance, to the players' entrance, just to see
25        exactly what was happening in the central pens".
26             You appear throughout that passage to be referring
27        to what you are seeing both on the Club camera
23        controlling Leppings Lane end and also camera 1.
29   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Camera 1 and also flicking through the other
30        cameras.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You do not make any mention of
32        that.
33   MR HOULDSWORTH:    I do n o t .
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Why was that?
35   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Because all the time this interview, again,
35        was led.     Certain questions were put to me which I was
37        not allowed to answer.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You are not being stopped
39        answering here, are you?


                                          18
 1   MR HOULDSWORTH:    This is a transcript of it, sir.
 2        I was not on the "First Tuesday" programme, because they
 3        did not use any of this, but I had DCI Tope      (I think his
 4        name was) from the West Midlands Police with me all the
 5        way through the interview.       When they asked me certain
 6        questions, there were certain questions that he would
 7        not let me answer.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I follow that, because I think
 9        that there is an interruption at the end.       Just so that
10        I understand what you are saying, this is an accurate
11        transcription, as far as you are aware, of what you
12        said.
13   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes, but there are certain things that were
14        asked me - I cannot remember specific questions, but you
15        asked me if this is accurate as to what was asked and
16        what I said, and there were certain things that were
17        asked me that I was not allowed to answer.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I follow that.    I do not want to
19        get on to that at the moment.This has been put        before
20        me, as I understand    it, as an accurate record of what
21        you said at this interview.       You confirm, as I
22        understand it, that that is so.
23   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.   I have no doubt that I did say this.
24        What I am saying is    that this seems to follow on in a
25        complete order, but there were certain interjections
26        within the interview where I was not allowed to answer.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Where do we find that?
28   MR HOULDSWORTH:    It is not in here.     They have probably
29        edited those parts out and then come down to a complete
30        interview and then did not use it at all.       I really
31        cannot say.    All I am saying is that all the way through
32        this interview, certain questions were asked - I cannot
33        remember now the questions; I remember doing this, but I
34        cannot remember what was asked me in total - and there
35        were certain interjections that were made by the
36        policeman to say,    "No, you can't answer that".     Then it
37        followed on from there.     Whether this is a full
38        transcript - it obviously has not got the interruptions
39        in it, so I cannot honestly say that it is a full


                                      19
 1        transcript, because certain questions were asked me that
 2        I just presume the police thought were contentious and
 3        would not allow me to answer in my own way, and it went
 4        on from there.        Then, eventually, as you say, it got to
 5        the end where he stopped the interview altogether.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       At the moment I am dealing with
 7        what appears to be a fairly unrestrained account given
 8        by you of the few minutes or half an hour or so before
 9        you went out on to the pitch.
10   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Were you stopped saying anything
12        important in relation to that period?
13   MR HOULDSWORTH:     I cannot remember specifics now, sir, it is
14        an awful long time ago.       All I can remember is that
15        certain questions were asked that I was not allowed to
16        answer.    He just said,     "You can't ask him that" and then
17        they moved on to something else.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       .We have a record of a question
19        of that sort towards the end to which we will come in a
20        moment.    At the moment I am finding difficulty in
21        understanding why, when you appear to be giving a
22        coherent account of what you did and at what you were
23        looking, there is no reference whatever to you looking
24        at these other screens.
25   MR HOULDSWORTH:     No, sir.     I answered the questions that --
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Can you account for it?
27   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Not really, no.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Did you think what you had seen
29        on these other screens was important?
30   MR HOULDSWORTH:     At that particular point in time, no.       It
31        did not occur to me that it was important then.        It does
32        now, y e s .
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Why does it occur to you to be
34        important now?
35   MR HOULDSWORTH:     I think it is now, especially with the
36        evidence that was given by the police, Bichard and Ryan,
37        at the inquest that the cameras were faulty and then not
38        only the cameras being faulty, but, since I have been
39        able to prove that the cameras were not faulty, we have


                                         20
 1        had that the videos were switched off, the videos were
 2        lost, then the monitors were not working, then it was
 3        BBC interference on the monitors that was causing the
 4       problem that they could not use camera 5.            Yes, I do
 5        think that it is important now. Because of things that
 6        have come to light which I knew absolutely nothing about
 7        until the beginning of last year,         I do feel that it is
 8        important now.     When I gave this interview,          I was asked
 9        if I would do a TV interview as they were doing a
10        documentary on the "First Tuesday".           I was not looking
11        to lay blame or anything on anybody,          I was just giving
12        what I thought was a general interview.          As I say,
13        through the interview there are certain questions - as I
14        say,   I cannot remember specifics - but there were
15        questions that were asked me to which the police were
16        saying,   "You can't answer that".
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think that we can see that
18        on the last page of this interview, page 11, halfway
19        down the page,     "Can I ask you finally what you saw when
20        you went outside and looked at the pens for yourself"
21        and then "MAN", who is obviously the policeman,             "Hang on
22        is this in your statement?         (A)   No, this is not in my
23        statement.    (Policeman)    He can only talk about what is
24        in his statement1’.
25               Is this a reference to some statement that you had
26        given to the television company?
27   MR HOULDSWORTH:   No.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What was it?
29   MR HOULDSWORTH:    I do not know what statement it was.            He
30        just said that.      I presume that that is what was said.
31        I cannot remember.     As I say, it was a long time ago.
32        All I know is that the interview was stopped at a
33        certain point.     He had not lost his temper, but it was
34        as if he had lost his patience,          and he said,    "That's it,
35        he can't say any more".       He referred to a statement, he
36        asked if this was in my statement.           The only statement
37        that I made at any time was to Sheffield Wednesday's own
38        solicitor.    I never made a statement to the South
39        Yorkshire or the West Midlands police concerning the


                                        21
 1        actual disaster itself or what occurred in any detail to
 2        anyone, other than Sheffield Wednesday's solicitor.
 3        What statement he is referring to there,         I really cannot
 4        say.   ____________ _______________ — ---~______ _____
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Just help me about this,
 6        Mr Houldsworth.      Have you discussed your evidence at all
 7        with anyone in the last few days?
 8   MR HOULDSWORTH:     No, not at a l l .
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Not in the last fortnight or so?
10   MR HOULDSWORTH:     No.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        But you have looked at the
12        transcript of what transpired between me and counsel on
13        30th September.
14   MR HOULDSWORTH:    No,    I have not.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I thought that you said that
16        you had.
17   MR HOULDSWORTH:     I am sorry,    I do not understand.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Because you corrected something.
19        You said that it was not correct that you were referring
20        t o ---
21   MR HOULDSWORTH:     No, you asked me hoy the cameras were
22        numbered and if it was camera 1 or camera 5, as Trevor
23        Hicks was referring to, the one on the top of the west
24        stand, and I said,      "No, that is camera 1. Camera 5 is on
25        the score board".
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is all that you have been
27        asked,    is it?
28   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, that is all that I have been asked.
29   MS ADLINGTON:     I did mean to start off the meeting with
30        that point, to make that concession.        I discussed that
31        with Mr Bone outside.
32   MR BONE :   She did, sir.                                               '
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        When you got outside, as I
34        think you said in your earlier statement, you did not
35        realise what was going on for a moment and you thought
36        it was a pitch invasion.        Is that right?
37   MR BONE:    That is correct, yes.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Why did you think that?
39   MR HOULDSWORTH:     People coming over the pitch, over the


                                         22
 1        turnstiles, the police mulling up at that end,     I just
 2        did not think at all that people were dying,     that there
 3        was such a crush that people were literally getting
 4        hurt.   It is just not something that ---      I mean,    I
 5        have been to hundreds and hundreds of football matches,
 6        I have never ever seen anything like that before in my
 7        life.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      So when you saw all these people
 9        coming in through gate C, you saw that on the screens,
10        and you realised that they were likely to go to pens
11        three and four, which you already appreciated were full,
12        you did not think that that was going to be a dangerous
13        situation.
14   MR HOULDSWORTH:    I thought that it would be uncomfortable
15        but not to the extent that it was.       I certainly did not
16        think, even with people coming over on to the ground at
17        that initial time,    that people were getting seriously
18        injured.     I just thought, unfortunately, with all due
19        respect, Ann, Liverpool did have a reputation,     same as
20        virtually all teams.    Quite a few teams in the UK had a
21        reputation for, let us say, bad behaviour and Liverpool
22        was one of those teams.      It was in the height of the
23        hooligan period in football and it was just something
24        that you thought was happening: yes, it is a pitch
25        invasion.     With the police going in there, I was in the
26        same mind then, as I suppose all the policemen that went
27        on the ground.     I think that we all thought exactly the
28        same.   All our thoughts were not trained on crowd safety
29        at that time.    Although I was a consultant down at
30        Sheffield Wednesday,    I was only an electronics engineer
31        and nothing else.     I used to help out, but you just
32        never ever really thought about crowd safety.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can I just ask you something
34        else?   You are fairly familiar with the police control
35        box.
36   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Quite/yes.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have some pictures of it.
38        It seems to me that the police have a very good view
39        from that control box through the windows.


                                       23
 1   MR HOULDSWORTH:     I would say so, yes.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     If they wanted to see what the
 3        position was in pens three and four, they can see it out
 4        of the windows, can they not?
 5   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     In what way do the CCTV cameras
 7        assist them?
 8   MR HOULDSWORTH:     CCTV cameras were primarily put in again
 9        for crowd trouble,    crowd control, not for safety.      The
10        CCTV system was designed purely for the identification
11        of culprits, so that they could see if any trouble was
12        occurring and, if it occurred,      they could zoom in on to
13        that person and, if necessary, persons, and pull them
14        out of the crowd.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Is it right that, if the police
16        watching through the windows of the control box thought
17        that they saw trouble,    they could zoom in the camera on
18        them?
19   MR HOULDSWORTH:     How the police worked in the Wednesday
20        control room was that Ryan and Goddard were sat at the
21        front.   When you opened the door, there was a desk on
22        your left-hand side where the windows were.       Ryan and
23        Goddard were sat there doing the radio control.        There
24        was a walkway and on the right-hand side was the desk
25        and a built-up step with the controller for the CCTV sat
26        behind that desk.     His primary job was to look at the
27        monitors which were placed ---
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     This is Mr Bichard?
29   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, or whoever the controller was.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It was Mr Bichard on this day.
31   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, he was on that day.    The monitors
32        were placed above the desk that overlooked the windows.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     So that the police in the front
34        row would not really be looking at the monitors at all.
35   MR HOULDSWORTH:  No, the people in the front row could not
                           — . '                  ------
36        see the monitors, because, if they were sat there, they
37        were directly above them.        Unless, they leant back, they
38        would not be able to see them.        As you can see, this is
39        the desk part here, and that police box used to get


                                      24
 1        quite full.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Mr Murray, as I understand it,
 3        was also in the front row, perhaps you do not know that.
 4   MR HOULDSWORTH:    I do not know.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     At any rate, anybody sitting in
 6        the front row is dependent upon looking out of the
 7        window to see what was going on?
 8   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes, unless they actually leant quite far
 9        back or stepped back.     It was not a very big control box
10        at all.   More than about four people in there meant that
11        they were sort of crawling all over each other.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think that you have confirmed
13        what seems to me to be apparent from looking at these
14        pictures that you would be able to see, primarily, by
15        looking out of the window, what the state of those west
16        terraces were.
17   MR HOULDSWORTH:    I would say so, yes.   That is the best view
18        that they had of the ground.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Much better than anything that
20        you get from a camera?
21   MR HOULDSWORTH:       Yes. For an overall perspective, yes.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: So far as camera 5 is concerned,
23        that is, so far as the terraces are concerned, at any
24        rate, further down,    it is looking slightly from behind,
25        is it not?
26   MR HOULDSWORTH:       Yes. The terraces are there, you are
27        looking at    about a 30 degree angle on to it.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You would not see anybody's
29        face who was looking towards the pitch.
30   MR HOULDSWORTH:    No, you would get a profile view.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I can see that, if you are
32        looking into a very sparsely-populated pen and there are
33        only a few people around that, you might get a good
34        profile or something of that sort -----
35   MR HOULDSWORTH:     If they are looking out towards
36        the pitch, yes.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     If you have a pretty packed
38        pen, certainly anything like the situation that
39        pertained from about quarter-to-three on the day in


                                      25
 1        question in pens three and four, you would not be able
2         to identify anybody in that pen from camera 5, would
3         you?
 4   MR HOULDSWORTH:    If you zoomed in, yes, you could get a
 5        very tight shot.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       With a massive crowd like that?
 7   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.     You would pick out the ones that were
 8        nearest to you, obviously, but you would not be able to
 9        get a head and shoulder shot unless they actually turned
10        round and physically faced the camera, if everyone
11        turned round and physically faced the camera, but what
12        you could get is a profile shot, if you zoomed in, and
13        it was a really tight zoom on the camera.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMI T H :    But you certainly would not need
15        that to see that the pens were overfull.        That would not
16        help at a l l .
17   MR HOULDSWORTH:    No.     The way in which camera 5 was set was
18        that it was parked and it was only from my recollection
19        about two-thirds zoom on the wide angle.         What it did
20        give you was a very great depth of field.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMI T H :    It was parked, was it, at that
22        time?
23   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes, it was at that time.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Where was it looking?
25   MR HOULDSWORTH:    It was looking down over the terraces.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       We ought to have some shots of
27        that recorded.
28   MR HOULDSWORTH:    That I cannot say, sir, because, as I say,
29        I had no control over what they were taping and what
30        they were not taping.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        If it is flicking in and out,
32        you would expect that, would you not?
33   MR HOULDSWORTH:        If it is on sequence, but whether it was
34        on sequence at that time,       I really do not know.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Normally, as I understand it,
36        they would override the sequencer, as you call it, if
37        there was something interesting at which they wanted to
38        look.    Perhaps that is not a question for you.
39   MR HOULDSWORTH:        It is not really, sir, because I was not


                                         26
 1        privy to how the police operated the system.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is certainly what I would
 3        have expected.      If you are just flicking around the
 4        ground generally, then you would go on to sequence,            but,
 5        if you are interested in a particular part of the
 6        ground, then you override the sequence and fix the
 7        camera on that particular thing and that is to what you
 8        are paying attention.
 9   MR HOULDSWORTH:   If you want to record it, yes, sir.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Just help me about this.       As
11        I understand it, the Club control room is very near the
12        players' tunnel and it takes you, what half a minute to
13        get on to the pitch.
14   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes, 15-20 seconds.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You were out there very
16        quickly.
17   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It appears to me that the
19        zoom facility was demonstrated to the jury at some
20        stage.
21   MR HOULDSWORTH:   That is correct.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Who did that?
23   MR HOULDSWORTH:   I did it.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Some time during the inquest
25        they all went to the ground.        Is that right?
26   MR HOULDSWORTH:   That is right.       I was requested to be
27        in attendance to demonstrate how the system worked.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      They went up into the control
29        box.
30   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      They would be able to see the
32        view from the control box.
33   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      While they were up there,
35        did you demonstrate how the various cameras worked?
36   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes, I did.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      And the shots were coming up
38        on the screens.
39   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.


                                       27
1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Did you demonstrate camera
2         1?
3    MR HOULDSWORTH:   I demonstrated all the cameras.
4    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      So they would see quite clearly
5         from that what cameras 1, 2 and 5, which are the ones in
6         which we are primarily interested, could show.
7    MR HOULDSWORTH: Y e s .
8    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can I just ask you about some
9         of the comments that you made?       This is in the bundle
10        of documents.    At page 2 (page 86), you say under (1),
11        "I was able to see what the police could see on their
12        monitors and he specifically remembers ..."       I think
13        that that must be "I specifically remember", must it
14        not?
15   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Anyway, you "specially remember
17        checking to see the state of pens three and four when
18        the order was given to open the gates.       I could see very
19        clearly that the pens were full to the point of
20        overcrowding".       I think that that is the first time that
21        you have actually said that in writing.
22   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.     I was never asked before about it.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You were never asked to give your
24        account about i t .
25   MR HOULDSWORTH:    I was never asked to give my account about
26        it, no.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       There is this question of the
28        blind spot, and perhaps you can help me about this.         I
29        have only got the photograph, but the jury would have
30        seen it on the ground.       The best view is photograph 51.
31        What I think is being referred to is that, because of
32        the angle of the fence and the fact that you have these
33        wires going back, if you have someone right at the
34        front, you would not actually see them.
35   MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is the only thing that I can think
36        that that means.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think that that is to what
38         the reference is.      You would not disagree with that,
39        would you?


                                        28
 1   MR HOULDSWORTH:      I would not disagree.     I would not refer
 2        to it as a "blind spot".
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Obviously, you can see what is
 4        going on.
 5   MR HOULDSWORTH:      Yes, you can see what is going on.
 6        The blind spot that I thought that it was referring to
 7        when I read that part was the spot directly below the
 8        police box itself.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I do not think so, but, anyhow,
10        I can check that.
11               You say at page 89, "Bichard admits that there was
12        a video going of the situation on the west terrace from
13        about 2.30".       It would be going all the time, would it
14        not?       That camera was recording or, rather, was taking
15        pictures all the time from 12 o'clock in the morning, as
16        I understand i t .
17   MR HOULDSWORTH:       It should have been, sir, yes.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Well,   it was.   I do not think
19        that anyone has ever suggested that it was n o t .
20   MR HOULDSWORTH:        I do not understand your
21        question.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Perhaps,   it is not a question
23        so far.       Do you see under paragraph 7, "Bichard admits
24        that there was a video going of the situation on the
25        west terrace from about 2 .30, yet no pictures from this
26        camera were ever made available to the inquiry or the
27        inquest".       That depends whether or not they were
28        recorded, does it not?
29   MR HOULDSWORTH:       That would depend on whether he had put
30        that particular camera on to be recorded, yes, and he
31        would know, if he had put it on, because it would show a
32        duplicate picture.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        If we have the tapes which show
34        that there is not anything,         then we know that he did not
35        put it on.
36   MR HOULDSWORTH:       Correct.   As I say, sir, I cannot say what
37        was recorded or what was not recorded,         I just do not
38        kn o w .
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        We know what was recorded and


                                         29
1          what was not recorded, because we have got the t a p e s .
2          Maybe you have not seen them.
3     MR HOULDSWORTH:    I have seen certain tapes.     I have seen the
4          compilation tapes and I have seen the tapes that were
5          found down at Yorkshire Television.       I have not said
6          that I have seen all the tapes, no.       As you must
7          appreciate, sir, my primary concern when I was looking
8          at the tapes after the beginning of last year was camera
 9         5, which they were saying was not working.
10    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     They did not quite say that.       If
11         you think that that is what they said, they certainly
12         did not say that it was not working.
13    MR HOULDSWORTH:    It was faulty.
14    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     They said that it had been
15         faulty and it was not as good as it should have been.
16    MR HOULDSWORTH:    This is where I disagree.
17    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You disagree with that?

18'   MR HOULDSWORTH:    I totally disagree with     that.
19    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I was not sure whether you were
20         right, maybe this is perhaps not a matter to deal with
21         now.    Under paragraph 9 at the top of page 91, you make
22         a reference to what was said at page 77 of the
23         transcript.    You say that that is a     reference tocamera
24         3.     I am not quite sure why you say    that, because I
25         thought it was camera 2, but I do not know that it is of
26         any great significance.      I think that I perhaps need not
27         trouble you with that, because I think that, if one
28         reads the transcript,    I think that it is fairly clear
29         that it is camera 2.
30    MR HOULDSWORTH:     I think that he does mean camera 3 there
31         and not camera 2.     Camera 2 was the colour camera.
32         Camera 3 is the black-and-white camera which is on the
33         south stand nearer towards the Kop.       That had a very,
34         very powerful lens on it..
35    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Which one?
36    MR HOULDSWORTH:     Camera 3, which I have noted there or
37         someone has put down there.       The reason that it was
38         black and white was that, because of the stand cover
39         over the Kop, colour would not get into there and give a


                                        30
 1         good quality reproduction.        It was turned into black and
 2         white in order to cover that area.            The area that that
 3         was primarily sited to cover is the largest area of what
 4         was standing room at that time.          It had a very powerful
 5         lens on.        Most of the problems that did occur in the Kop
 6         occurred at the very back of the Kop, which was a very,
 7         very dark area.        It had to be a really powerful lens to
 8         get into the back of there.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          At any rate, you are referring to
10         camera 3 as haying the very powerful lens.
11   MR HOULDSWORTH:        Correct.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           I do not think that we need,
13         perhaps, waste time about what Mr Bichard is talking
14         about.     I can check that myself.
15                 I am not quite sure what point you are making when
16         you are talking about Chief Inspector McRobbie.
17   MR HOULDSWORTH:         I did not write that, sir.      This is the
18         evidence that Mr McRobbie gave the Taylor inquiry.              It
19         is nothing to do with me.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          So you are not making any
21         comment on that?
22   MR HOULDSWORTH:         I am agreeing with him more than anything.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          The only comments are the
24         ones which are under "RH".
25   MS ADLINGTON:         The ones in italics,   sir.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          So far as the condition or
27         the reproduction from these cameras, I would like to
28         show you some of the video stuff that we have and ask
29         for your comments on the quality of it.
30                 Can we show that bit from about 14.30 onwards?
31   MR BONE:      It is 14.28 onwards.
32          (First Video shown)
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          These are the scenes at the
34         Leppings Lane end.          When I say the Leppings Lane end, I
35         mean Leppings Lane itself.           (14.28.14)   That is the Kop,
36         is it not?
37   MR BO N E :   Yes .
38   MR HOULDSWORTH:         This is the colour camera.      How many
39         generation copy is this one?


                                           31
 1   MR BONE:    We got this via Trevor Hicks from Yorkshire TV.
 2   MR HOULDSWORTH:    The originals are far better than that.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You say that this is the colour
 4        one?
 5   MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is the colour camera.        On the original
 6        ones that I saw from Yorkshire Television, you can quite
 7        clearly see that that is in colour, but the colour has
 8        been lost in reproduction.         This is the trouble when you
 9        are taping VHS to VHS on domestic systems, you do lose
10        quality in reproduction.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can you move it on a bit then?
12               What camera is that?        I thought that this was all
13        camera 3, I must s a y .
14   MR HOULDSWORTH:    I think that it is all camera 3.
15   MR BONE:    Can I just try the other tapes, where we have
16        this material from about 14.20 of pen three or what
17        appears to be pen three?
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes.
19        (Second video shown - start of tape timed at 14.18.25)
20   MR BONE:    This is the same source via Trevor Hicks and
21        Yorkshire TV.
22   MR HOULDSWORTH:    This is camera 5.
23   MR BONE:    This is pen two looking into pen three,       is it
24        not?
25   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes, it is pen two.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      (14.20.00)      Would you be able
27        to identify those people?
28   MR HOULDSWORTH:    On the original tape, yes, you can.
29        You have a smearing here which is a thing that occurs
30        when you tape from tape to tape.          I think that you are
31        somewhere around the fourth or fifth copy here,            On the
32        original tapes that I saw at Yorkshire Television, they
33        are quite identifiable.
34   MR BONE:    I think that they are pretty identifiable here.
35   MR HOULDSWORTH:    You see this smearing.        That is what
36        occurs when you tape from tape to tape.          It really
37        should be done by a broadcast-level recorder, then you
38        will get far better quality.          No doubt, one of the
39        television companies could do it for you quite easily.


                                        32
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          (L4.20.50)   You would expect
 2         the original police tape to be of rather better quality?
 3   MR HOULDSWORTH:        Yes.   It is definitely better.    I have seen
 4         the ones at Yorkshire Television, which were given by
 5         South Yorkshire.        I think that they are about second
 6         generation.       They are very, very clear.     If you play it
 7         on what is called a pneumatic recorder, which is a
 8         broadcast-level recorder, they will come out far, far
 9         better.     That is the same format as they are recorded
LO         on.
LL   MR BONE:      There is not very much left on this particular
L2         tape.
L3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         This goes on to the end of the
L4         tape. We will stop it there.
L5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          It was some of the shots of
16         Leppings Lane that I wanted Mr Houldsworth's view on.               I
17         think that it was the other tape at the beginning.
18          (First video shown again)
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            (14.33.19) That is theKop
20         again.
2L   MR HOULDSWORTH:        Yes.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            (14.35.30) That is the
23         colour camera.
24   MR HOULDSWORTH:        Yes.
25   MR BONE:      This is outside Leppings La n e .
26   MR HOULDSWORTH:        That is right. That is off camera 1.
27   MR BO N E :   (14.35.36)      It has gone on to time lapse.
28          (14.3 6.47)     Is that camera 1 again?
29   MR HOULDSWORTH:        That is camera 1 again, yes.
30   MR BONE:      It is one shot per second. This is time-
3L         lapse mo d e .
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          (14.37.42) How does this
33         compare in your opinion with the original?
34   MR HOULDSWORTH:        Can I just explain how it works without
35         getting too technical?         How time lapse works is that it
36         takes a shot every part of a second like a still
37         photograph.       When itis played back,    if you play     it back
38         on the same type of recorder - in other words,            a time-
39          lapse recorder - you can actually get that working in


                                           33
1         the time mode so that you can see those shots as
2         individuals.     What has happened there is that it has
 3        been shot and recorded in three-hour mode from 24-hour
4         time mode.     What you are getting is that jerky movement,
 5       which, obviously, denigrates the picture somewhat.             If
 6        you could play the original tape back on a time-lapse
 7        video recorder, you would see it reproduced exactly as
 8        it has been shot.     That would give you a far clearer
 9        picture.     The idea of time lapse is to extend a three-
10        hour tape, but, when you get to the section in which you
11        are particularly interested, you can put it back into
12        its time-lapse mode and replay it in exactly the same
13        format as it was recorded.         If it is taking a shot every
14        point 25 of a second, you would        play it back in every
15        point 25 of a second.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It is really not a very good
17        reproduction of the time lapse.
18   MR HOULDSWORTH:     No, because you are     doing it on a
19        three-hour tape on a three-hour        video recorder.     To be
20        able to get it properly, you need to get hold of the
21        original tape arid play that back in time-lapse mode.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank y o u . We have no more
23        questions.
24   MS ADLINGTON:     There is something that I felt that I should
25        bring to your attention at this stage, whilst Mr
26        Houldsworth is here.       It is something that we will be
27        submitting a further submission on.            It is
28        Superintendent Murray's evidence to Taylor on 31st May
29        1989.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Is this in connection with
31        Mr Houldsworth's evidence?
32   MS ADLINGTON:     Yes, it is.    It is Day 11, page 123.
33        This is Mr Glasgow's cross-examination of Mr Murray.
34        You can read it for yourself.         Mr Glasgow is asking Mr
35        Murray,’ "Likewise there is not any way in which the Club
36        screens in their room can see what you are looking at,
37        is there?      (A) Well, my information is that one of the
38        monitors in the Club's control room is continuously
39        monitoring our recording camera.         (Q)     Yes, absolutely


                                        34
 1        right, Mr Murray.        In other words, they can look at
 2        whatever it is that you happen to be recording at that
 3        time?     (A)    That is correct, sir, yes.     (Q)   So, if the
 4        police recording equipment happens to be switched on to
 5        one of the gate cameras,         for example, that is the
 6        picture that will show also in the Club room?"           (A)
 7        Y e s , sir".
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Mr Houldsworth says that that
 9        is not correct.
1G   MS ADLINGTON:        That is the point that we wanted to bring
11        to your attention, because, clearly, Lord Justice Taylor
12        to some extent has been misled by counsel for the Club.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is wrong, is it?
14   MR HOULDSWORTH:        That is wrong, yes.
15   MS ADLINGTON:        It may well be, sir, that one of the reasons
16        why Mr Houldsworth was not called as a witness was
17        because, in effect, what is being said there is that
18        what Mr Houldsworth or anybody in the Club control room
19        could see was only that which was being recorded in the
20        police control room. Therefore,         they are only extra
21        pairs of eyes.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Yes, thank you.
23                I do not think we need keep Mr Houldsworth any
24        longer.
25             (Mr Houldsworth left the meeting at 3.35 p m )
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        There is just one other matter
27        that I wanted to ask you about, Ms Adlington.           That is
28        in relation to your submissions.          What I am not quite
29        clear about - and I should have asked Mr Jones about
30        this - is at paragraph 3 9 to 42 you deal with Chief
31        Inspector McRobbie.        I am not really clear what the
32        point is that is being made here.          It is not suggested,
33        is it, that this incident that Chief Inspector McRobbie
34        speaks about occurred shortly before 3 o'clock?
35   MS ADLINGTON:        No, it is not.    Simply the point being made
36        is that McRobbie praised the system or said that the
37        system worked very well.          He was not called as a witness
          to the inquest, so the only evidence that, basically,
          the inquest heard was about the camera not working or


                                           35
 1        not being up to scratch, whereas McRobbie's evidence was
 2        quite to the contrary at the Taylor Inquiry.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       McRobbie is referring, as I
 4        understand it, to what we have seen today on --
 5   MS ADLINGTON:    On the black-and-white camera 5, sir.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes.   That is the incident at
 7        14.18.
 8   MS ADLINGTON:    This is the group of youngsters on the
 9        terrace with the newspaper.
10   MR BONE:   Yes, that is timed at 14.18.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Is it your understanding that
12        that is to what he is referring?
13   MS ADLINGTON:    I thought that he was actually referring to
14        someone who dropped his pants or something underneath
15        the police control box.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I do not know where you
17        get that from.
18   MS ADLINGTON:    That is an extract from his evidence to
19        Taylor, but he has also made a statement, so it may
20        actually be in his statement.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You have seen the statement,
22        have you?
23   MS ADLINGTON:    Yes, I have.     It should be included in the
24        original bundles submitted to the Home Office and the
25        DPP's office back in March.        It was in the blue binders.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I will check it.   That is
27        where the dropping of the pants comes from?
28   MS ADLINGTON:    I think so, sir, yes.      I think that it was
29        at an earlier stage.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think that it is the incident
31        that one sees on the television.
32   MS ADLINGTON:    I think that it is a different incident, sir.
33        If you look at his statement,       I am sure that, he refers
34        in his statement to someone dropping their trousers
35        right underneath the control box.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It may be that they did not
37        manage to record th a t .
38   MS ADLINGTON:    Also I think that it has been pointed out
39        in correspondence to CPS, the fact that McRobbie is


                                        36
 1        looking at the monitors.     He is witnessing an incident
 2        and he passes no comment at all about the monitor being
 3        faulty, which is one of the excuses which South
 4        Yorkshire police came up with on 1st April this year,
 5        that there was a fault on the monitor, as opposed to the
 6        camera.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You are going to let me have the
 8        details of what the police said at one stage?
 9   MS ADLINGTON:     Yes.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     How are we getting on with the
11        material with which you are going to provide us?
12   MS ADLINGTON:     I spoke to Alun Jones yesterday.     He has a
13        day in chambers on Friday and he hopes then to finalise
14        the further submissions for submission on Monday of next
15        week.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     All I want is the material that
17        I have asked for in the letter.     I do not, actually,
18        need further submissions about it, other than those that
19        have been called for.     You think that we will get them
20        on Monday?
21   MS ADLINGTON: Yes, sir.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Thank you very much.

               The Prime Minister has asked me to thank you for your
          letter of 17 April about the Hillsborough football disaster.

               The whole nation was deeply shocked by what happened at
          Hillsborough.  Mrs. Thatcher can well imagine therefore how
          much more devastating it must have been for you to have been
    %     there with friends who died.  As you will know, the Home
          Secretary has set up an Inquiry under Lord Justice Taylor to
          look into the events at Hillsborough.  We must wait for the
          Inquiry's findings to see what must be done to prevent such
          a terrible tragedy from happening again.

               However, Mrs. Thatcher is also very much aware of the
          concern which has been expressed in a number of quarters
          about the press coverage at Hillsborough.  The photographs
          published in the press were indeed harrowing; she can well
          understand your reaction to them.

               But the Government has no statutory control over the
          press, and therefore has no power to intervene directly in
          this matter.  It is the responsibility of the press to
          decide whether the publication of distressing material is
          justified by the need to inform the public about an issue;
          and complaints about such matters are the responsibility of
          the Press Council.

              You will probably know by now that, in view of the
         complaints about the Hillsborough photographs, the Press
         Council has decided to examine the photographic coverage of
         the disaster, and to consider 1;he difficult issues which the
         publication of such photographs raise.   You may therefore
         wish to write to the Council with your views on the matter,
         whose address is No.l Salisbury Square, London, EC4Y 8AE.

                At one point I intervened in an argument between an inspector and

                several Liverpool Supporters, one of whom I recognised/as Derek

                HATTON.   One of the supporters was accusing the Police of causing the

                deaths.   The Inspector ordered that the supporter be escorted away

                fr,om the scene.       Mr HATTON was remonstrating with the Inspector to

                keep his cool.     I spoke to Mr HATTON, saying that we should all try
                            t
                and help those fans that were in need of assistance, at which Mr HATTOS

                walked away.

                There then followed a period when officers and supporters were just

                walking around the playing area.          I became aware that a cordon of

                   removed from the scene and those slightly injured were receiving

                   treatment from St. J o h n ’s Ambulance and Police O fficers.
                                                                    /
                   Eventually 4/5 of us managed to re-group and made our way outside the

                   Leppings Lane Stand where Liverpool supporters were making, their way

                   out of the ground.      X remember one supporter shouting at us,      "WHY

                   D I D N ’T YOU GIVE US THE KOP?"    Which with hindsight, was a question I

                   was also Asking. ' '

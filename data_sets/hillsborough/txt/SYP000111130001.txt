                        At 8.30 am on Saturday,               15 April         1989,    I came on duty at Hackenthorpe

                        Police Station in relation to duties to be worked at the F.A. Cup

                        Semi-Final at Hillsborough later that day.

                         I was under the direct supervision of Police Sergeant S001 Burman of

                        Hackenthorpe Police.

                        Together with other officers I was conveyed to Hillsborough via a

                        Police Transit van and upon arrival                       there I attended a briefing        in

                         the North Stand.              The briefing was taken by Chief Supt. Duckenfield

                        and on conclusion of this briefing I had a packed lunch meal.

                        My duty was to patrol               in the West Stand paying particular attention

                         to the front row in order to prevent persons standing on the terraces

                         of the Leppings Lane end from climbing up into the seated area.

                         I commenced these duties at 11.15 am that day after having consumed
            ft*
50,r"                   my m e a l .

                        Once in the West Stand I was assigned to work at the front                             right hand/

                         centre of the stand,              looking directly over Pens S and 3.

                         Initially there was only a few farvsK'Tntering into the ground,                          these

                         filtering through from about                      11.30 am.     All were & & t fd humoured and

                         appeared to be either midgl^-'cfged or parents with young children.

                                                                                         R 39

               From talking to the fans as they started filling the stand all were i

               good spirits and general l^^f>i^arsed to be there.        Quite a few said how

               pleased they were to be at Hillsborough again and commented on how

               good a ground it was.

     —N        From mid-day onwards the ground generally started(_jL&—"f-i-i 1 and it was

filyapparent               that the Kop end of the ground was filling quite quickly.

           J   B y 2 pm the West Stand was      still only about    1/4 full but I saw that
     iy
               the standing areas of the Leppings Lane end had filled nicely.             The

               Pen marked 3 g^gu&^Completely full by this time witJ3~-^rrr"4"'still having

               spaces.     Pens   1 & 2, 6 & 7 were thinly covered with people.

               The behaviour of the fans in Pen^3^jsMr5 generally good.         They were

               singing songs and la^kiivf about among st
                                                      si j^jiefflse 1ves

                  about this time I saw a youth who          I would describe as being    white

Tr*            male, 20 yrs heavy/fat build, 6* tall with short dark curly hair
-Y
               wearing a green open necked shirt.           This youth was stood on a barrier

                  Pen 3 and was gesticulating to the rest of the crowd in order to

               get them singing etc.       |jn^Tndsight I believe this barrier was the

               one that collapsed.

          ^^Also     around this time another youth with a red shirt and blond hair

               was climbing on a barrier in this pen and was diving forward into the

     ^         crowd.     He did this several times until       it appeared that the crowd

               had had enough and a fje rfT ^ tfo rd s exchanged.

               Throughout this^period there was a lot of pushing and shoving within

               the Pen,    this being the JljrrtJfmal11 sway as is found on most Kops and

               standing areas at football matches.           Another youth who stuck out was

               white male,    18 yrs,   slim build with blond/peroxide/straw shoulder

               length hai r wearing a chain mail tyj5j6K''shi r t coloured s i 1 ve r/char coal.
X
               This youth was sat on a s m a l L ^ a l l   directly under the front of the

               stand.     This wall was at”~t+(e entrance to Pen 3 directly at the end of

               the tunnel that allows fans to enter the Pens from the turnstile.

                            He was asked several times by Sgt •V't-furman to get down but he replied!

                             "Fuck off" and just blatantly ignored the instruction.                    After about

                            5 minutes the youth eventually got down and then ’got lost in the

                             cr ow d* .

            / * ^ As.it approached 3 pm I saw that both Pen 3 & 4 were totally full and

                            ,>,t i 11 there was ample room in pens 1 & 2, 6 & 7.                 By 2.50 pm the
                      t (
          , c               stand was full with a ldytxiof peopie congregating at the front of the

                            stand.        Throughout this time I had to tell several youths to get down

                            from standing on the small wall at the entrance to the tunnel and

                            from standing on the dividing fences between Pens 2/3/4.                     All the

                            youths spoken to complied straight away.

                            By the time the game^^artrtTeTd off all             people in the stand had returned

                            to their seats.           I took up a position at the very front right hand

                             corner of the West S t ^ j a 4 r l v e x t   to the emergency exit.     I was also

A ^*7                       J o i n e d there by PC 1494 Naylor.
  V         if.             A few minutes        into the game I became aware of several youths trying

          [j                to climb up from the standijn^^artfaTof Pens 3/4 and into the seating
  ivr
                  y         area.      As it was my duty to prevent this f irom happening               I went to the

                            area but by this time several youths had                 ’escaped*    into the stand.       I

                             returned to the emergency exit.

                            The next thing that I became aware of was when people were climbing

      Ctyty
      j                     over the pitc h j f r & r i m e ter fence from ip^rffs" 3/4 and ont^Jt+fe     ground.

                            The game was then stopped and the teams left the field.

   I ft'.                   By this time peo pi e were pour i ng o n t otJi£__px! ch and total            confusion

      v                     as to what was happening was apparent

                            At first I thought it was a bit of fighting in the crowd that was

                             causing the disturbance and it was about 5-10 minutes before                    I

                             realised that people were beij>g''lTurt in the pens below.

                            Whilst this was happening on the pitch and in the pens I noticed

                            quite a lot of fans were entering the grfHjSMjr^Zo the right of the
                                                                                        PAGE     4
                                                                                        R39

stand (near to        Pol ice room).         As they passed under where I was

standing several sho^r^cT up towards me:                "IT'S A SHAME WHAT YOU

BASTARDS HAVE DONE OLOTflgRE,           YOU SHOULDN'T y^VE-OPENED THE DOORS. "

Others said that they          had either cl injJ^dkTyverthe fences or               broken a

door doyjcKT Obviously         I was in no position to comment since I had no

idea as to what had occurred at the turnstiles.

As the minutes   passed it became quite obvious that pop-prfeTwere dying

on the pitch.    Several were al ij^rf^y^Tai d out dead vjJiilst lots were

being resuscitated.          The a t t i t u d ^ o ^ t T i e fans became very aggressive

towards us (Police) and we had to take a lot of verbal abuse since

they didn't think we         were doing anything. Retwrfts from the radio                   (BBC)

had reached        ans       that peoplg_jj«M^ dead         and then pai^c^ap^aared to

get into the fans.       A     lot wanted to leave the ground.                  Some wanted to

know if the match was          going to be resumed.         Many were openly crying

and saying no not again (reference to Heysel).

As the,events on     the pitch progressed more and more people wanted                       to

leave the ground     but I had received a j^esj&Ja^e--#^om Police Control

ordering that no fans were to be al 1                                in order to assist

the ambulanc^e/fjje-e— service.        When asked by the fans why they couldn’t

leave I informed them of the reason.              All   comjal t & d —w ir th   the order

agreeing it was for the best.

On the pitch I saw several fans either a^s^trfCing or simply pushing

Police Officers around particularly ^those officers who were

resusc^itaprfTg people.        Personally I think this action was due to

panicked people finding friends etc dying and simply wanting more

done for their friends.

More and more people tried to get to the front of the stand in order

to see what was happening in the pens below.                  It was apparent that

fathers were in the stand whilst their sons were stood in the pens.

Due to this many people in the stand were getting extremely agitated
                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                      R39

            and upset wanting to get down to the pitch level.

            By now I had been joined by PS Burntan and we decided that our best

            course of action was to stick together near to the emergency exit

            from the stand in order to prevent people from leaving.

            As time passed more p^rffpTe from the back of the stand came to our

            position trying         ^rfave.    A lot were^cJj^wHry^lntoxi cated and we had

                                              abuse.

            As fans from the pens below started to leave the ground lots were

                                                  Eventually by about 4 pm the ground was

            the North Stand for debriefing.

            I must point out that throughout this incident I remained at the

            front of the West Stand and had no involvement with the events taking

            place on the pitch.          I felt it necessary to remain at this   point in

            order to prevent people evacuating the ground and panicking.

Chief Constable of West Midlands.

What I require from you is a self-written account of your actions on the 15th
April 1989.  Please note that this is not a CJA statement and it should be
written on plain paper.  It would be helpful if your account could include the
following information.

2.        To whom were you responsible?

3.        Where were you deployed, and did you get deviated to any other
           location?

4.        What   did you see that   is in any way relevant tothe incident?

5.        What   did you do?

Please begin the account with your full name in block letters, your rank and
number and your sub-division/department.  Please conclude the account with
your signature.

           Dear

           Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan which has been
           passed to this Department in view of our responsibilities for
           the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I apologise for the delay
           in replying to you.

           Lord Justice Taylor, in his Final Report on the Hillsborough
           Stadium disaster, recognised that there was no single solution
           to achieve total crowd safety. However, he was satisfied that
           seating does more to achieve these objectives than any other
           single measure.  Furthermore this is in line with the policies
           of both FIFA and UEFA.

           In answer to your second question, when circulating the Report
           local authorities were advised that its recommendations should
           be applied to other sports grounds where similar circumstances
           to those at football league grounds exist.  It is for the
           relevant local authorities to determine to what extent this is
           the case at grounds in their area.

                                                                          Yours sincerely




                                                                          MR S BILBE
                                                                          (Fire and Planning
                                                                          Planning Department)

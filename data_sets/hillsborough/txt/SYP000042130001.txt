  deceased, Richard Jones, has made the following allegations relating to your
  duties at the ground on 15 April 1989;

  (a)          You failed to control and filter fans away from the immediate vicinity
               of the turnstiles even after 1417 hours, when it was obvious you had
               lost control of the turnstile area. In any event you should have
               acted by 1430 hours at the latest.

  (b)          You gave no actual order to restrict the approach of those fans, or
               after 1430 hours, to actually stop the fans entering Leppings Lane.

  You are not as the Regulation explains, obliged to say anything concerning the matter, but you may if you so desire, make

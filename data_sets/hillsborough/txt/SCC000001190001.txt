       LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOUNDARY COMMISSION - REVIEW OF ELECTORAL
       ARRANGEMENTS
             The Chief Executive submitted a report on the draft
       proposals now produced by the Local Government Boundary
       Commission for the provision of 29 electoral wards of the City
       under their review of the electoral arrangements of local
       authorities.
       (NOTE: A copy of the report of the Chief Executive will be sent
       with the printed minutes to each member of the City Council.)
             The Committee noted that the Commission had accepted in the
       main the proposals which the City Council had submitted to them,
       the most significant difference being in the northern wards of
       the City for which the Commission had not accepted the Council*s
       proposal to include part of Ecclesfield Parish in the Southey
       Green Ward and had made one or two consequential amendments to
       the adjoining wards.
       RESOLVED: That the Local Government Boundary Commission be
       informed that the City Council approves of the draft proposals
       now produced for the provision of 29 electoral wards for the City,
       but that it asks that the Commission should give further
       consideration to the proposals for the South Wortley Ward with a
       view to achieving greater uniformity in the number of the
        electors for the Ward in comparison with the other City Wards.

       PROPOSED INTRODUCTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL 16 AMP PLUG AND SOCKET
       SYSTEM
            The Committee considered proposals as outlined in a leaflet
       issued by the British Standards Institution for the gradual
       introduction over a number of years of an international 16 amp
       ping and socket system.
       RESOLVED: That the British Standards Institution, the
       Association of Metropolitan Authorities and H.M. Government be
       informed that the City Council is firmly opposed to the proposals
       far "the introduction of a 16 amp plug and socket system because

       British electrical systems and also because of the heavy
       expenditure which they would involve.

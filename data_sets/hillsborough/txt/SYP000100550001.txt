          On   Saturday,              15th       April,          19S9,       I commenced              duty    at    9    a.m.          at    Barnsley

         Police        Station.             I travelled                to    Hillsborough              football          ground             in

          company          with       Police       Sergeant             1341       Crawford           and    upon       arriving             at

         Hillsborough                 I took       up       duty       in    serial        60    under       the    command             of       Police

         Sergeant           2019       Thompson,                "E"    Division.

         At     11    a.m.       I    commenced             foot       patrol        public       order       duties          on       Penistone

         Road        near    to       the    dog       racing          track,        I was       on    patrol       in       company             with

         Police        Constable             682       Lowe.           At    tjnis    time       we    did    not       have       a    radio,          the

          only       one    being          with    Police             Sergeant        Thompson.              After       some          30    minutes
                                                       âœ“
         on     public       order          patrol          it    soon       became        apparent          that       many       Nottingham

         Forest        fans          were    arriving             early       for     the       match       and    were       inhabiting                the

          local       public          houses.              They       were    drinking           heavily          and    were

          congregating                in    large          groups       although           they       were    at    this       time          very

         well        behaved.

         As    time        went       by    the    crowds             began    to     get       larger       congregating                   outside

         the     public          houses          and       at    approximately              12 m i d d a y        there      was        a    crowd       of

         approximately                 300       fans       outside          the     Royal       Hotel.           The    public             house

         itself        was       full       to    overflowing                and     all    the       crowds       though          boisterous,

         were        well    behaved.              These          crowds       were        drinking          beer       by   the        crateful

         and     sat       drinking          it    on       the       pavement.            The    crowd       outside          ths          Royal
                                                                                                                                                PAGE        2

Hotel       remained          well       behav*ed            bat       as    time          passed          and       the    more       the       crowd

got       drank,       so    the    atmosphere                   got    more          agitated.                 This       culminating                in

a    bottle       being       thrown          at       m y s e 1f a n d          other          officers             on    the    other          side

of    the    road.           Shortly          after          a    member          of       staff          from       the    Royal          Hotel

approached             us    to    say       that       there          was.trouble                in       the       premises.              Police

Sergeant          Thompson          summoned                assistance                and       the       public          house       was

cleared       and       the       crowd       moved          on.        They          were       all       very       drunk       but       due       to

numbers,          it    was       impossible                to    do    anything                about       them          getting          to    the

ground.           As    the       rest       of    the       fans       filed          past       us       on    Penistone             Road,

heading       towards             the    ground,             it       was    obvious             from       their          demeanour             and

behaviour          that       many       of       them       had       been       drinking                and    were       drunk.              I have

not       worked       at    the    Penistone                Road       end       of       the    ground             before       and       cannot

comment       as       to    whether          it       is    usual          that       so       many       fans       should          be

drinking          or    drunk       before             the       match.

At    3    p.m.    we       began       to    make          our       way    back          to    the       ground          in    order          to

commence          Phase       <2)       duties,             those       being          on       standby          outside          the

ground.           However,          whilst             walking          back          towards             the    ground          as    a    serial,

it    became       apparent             via       the       radio       that          there       were          problems          in       the

ground       at    the       Leppings             Lane       end.           We    began          to       make       all    haste          back       to

the       ground       on    the    way. b e i n g           picked          up       by    a    Police          Transit          van       and

dropped       at       the    ground.              We       entered          the       ground             and    were       placed          on

standby       at       the    Kop       end       of    the       ground          underneath                the       North       Stand          along

with       several          other       serials.

After       some       five       minutes          on       standby          at       this       loation,             during          which          time

it w a s     becoming             obvious          to       us    that       there          was       a    major          disaster

occurring          at       the    Leppings             Lane          end,       we    were       all       then          taken       onto       the

field       and    placed          in    a    line          in    a    public          order          capacity             along       the       front

of    the    North          Stand.           Upon       entering             the       field          I saw          hundreds          of

Liverpool          fans       on    the       field          and       many       fans          laying          on    the       field

obviously          injured.              We       were       kept       in       the       line       in    front          of    the       North
                                                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                                                 R 165

Stand        for    some          ten    minutes.                    It w a s        apparent             during       this          time    that

the    Liverpool               fans      in       the       North           Stand         were       very       angry       and       were

venting          their        anger          on    ourselves                   on    the       pitch.           The    abuse          and

physical           signals          from          persons              in      the       stand       was    on    a    very          large       scale

and    I have           no    doubt          that       had          we     not      been       in    that       location             that       anger

would       have        been       vented          on       the       Nottingham                Forest          fans.           Several          fans

were    leaving              the    North          Stand             and       ripping          up    advertising                hoardings             and

taking        them       to       the    Leppings                Lane          end       and    carrying          injured             persons

away.        After           some       ten       minutes             at       the       front       of    the    North          Stand,          myself

and    Police           Constable             682       Lowe          were          instructed             along       with          two    other

officers           to    standby             at    gate          6    (six)          of    the       North       pen       in    an    effort          to

prevent          even        more       persons             from          entering             onto       the    field          than       there       was

at    present.               The    North          and       North             West       pen    of       the    Leppings             Lane       end    at

this    time        were          fairly          empty.              Most          of    the    people          being          on    the    field.

The    fans       who        were       on    the       field             were       mostly          walking          around          in a       daze

but    it    became           very       apparent                that          the       vast    majority             of    them       had       been

drinking           heavily.              They          were          venting             their       anger       upon       the       Police       and

whilst       stood           at    this       gate          to       the       North       pen ,      we    were       approached                by a

member       of     the       press          who       was       being          kicked          and       spit    at       by    drunken

Liverpool           fans.           He       approached                   us    for       protection.                 He    had       been       taking

photographs              of       the    incident                which          had       caused          the    Liverpool             fans       to

attack       him        in a n g e r .            His       camera             equipment             which       he    had       with       him    was

being       kicked        and       spat          at    by       the       fans.           In    an       effort       to       protect          him    we

tried       to     keep       the       Liverpool                fans          away       but    they       were       so       intent       to    get

at    him.        The     abuse          coming             from          persons          still          left    in       the       North       and

North       West        pens       as    well          as    from          on       the    field.           Whilst          there          coins

began       to     rain       down       on       us    from          the       te r r a c e s ' at        the    press          man       and

ourselves.               The       only       way       we       could          protect          him       was    to       get       him    out    and

for    his       own     safety,             he    took          off       his       press       jacket          and       put       all    his

equipment          away.            Three          of       us       who       were       on    the       gate    then          formed       a

                                                                                                  R165



circle of sorts around him and attempted to run through the Liverpool

fans    on    the    field   and     to     safety.         As we made        our way      through      the

crowd    the    photographer's            camera equipment              and bags    were    kicked      all

over the pitch, we were spat on by fans who were obviously drunk and

angry.        We eventually managed to get him to safety at the Nottingham

Forest end.         I then went back to the centre of the field and assisted

with the public order cordon across the field.

The most       striking thing about              being on the field with the Liverpool

fans was       how many      had been drinking and some very heavily.                             It was

often    difficult      to    understand          them when          they asked for        information

regarding relatives,            etc.        By    this      time   as     things began      to quieten

down on the field and the decision was taken to abandon the game, I

was    directed      along    with     the       rest    of    the      public    order    line    to    go

outside       the   ground   and   assist         with   persons          leaving   the game.          This

appeared       to go   smoothly with a very                   subdued      atmosphere amongst           all

the Nottingham Forest fans.                      I had nothing to do with the              supervising

of the Liverpool fans moving from the ground.

Upon    re-entering       the    ground           I   was     directed to the mortuary            by    an

Inspector where I was put                 in charge of one of the bodies.                       The body

was No (2),         later identified to me at 2.10 a.m.                       as that of INGA SHAH

SIDES    of                          London,          34 years       of    age.     I   then    took    the

body    in a SYMAS      vehicle        to    the Medico Legal Centre,                   where   the body

was booked in.         The body was described as female,                          34 years, shoulder

length blonde hair of slim build and was wearing a green wax jacket

and grey jumper and jeans.                  She was wearing black boots.                   I played no

part    in    the removal       of this body from the Leppings Lane end of the

ground and am unable to say which pen she came from.

I finished duty at 4.00 a.m. on Sunday 16 April 1989.

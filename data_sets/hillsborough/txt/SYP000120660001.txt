supporters             away          from       t he      premises.                 Apparently                 a    disturbance                   had

occurred          in    the          pub       between             locals          and    the        Liverpool                lads          who     were

the    worse       for        drink.                No    complaints                from        the    landlord                   or     other

customers.             The       atmosphere                   however          was       'simmering'                    and       t he      landlord

was    asked       to       close          t he      bar.          This       he    did       and     t he         pub       was       closed

without       further                incident.                Resumed          static           points             on    Halifax              Road,

there       seemed          to       be    a    last          minute          rush       of     supporters                   many        running

just    prior          to     3 pm         (1500).

3.05pm       (1505)           still            in    position             Halifax             Road     junction                   Claywheels              Lane

3.20    pm    (1520)             PC       Goss       (A3)          informs          us    that        all          officers              directed            to

ground.           In    company                other          officers             to    Penistone                 Road       entrance              and

entered       ground.                 Radio          communications                      appeared              to       be    scrambled.

Insp.       Townend           directed               us       to    the       ramp       giving        access                to    Kop        end.      Two

male    bodies          were          laid          behind          the       metal       railings                 at    side          of     Kop    and         PS

Cropley       (Al)          and       another             officer             were       dealing           with          them.

We    held    people             back          so    they          could       not       view        the       bodies             which        were       then

placed       into       an       ambulance.

Other       ambulances                were          trying          to    enter          the     ground             but       had        difficulty

because       of       t he      amount             of    people          milling             about        in       the       area.            Insp.

Townend       then          directed                us    onto          the    pitch          where        a cordon                of       officers

stretched          from          one       side          to    the       other.           I     could          see       hundreds              of

Liverpool          supporters                   milling             about          on    t he    pitch.             A    lot       appeared

dazed       and    many          were          in    tears,             anger       and       frustration                    caused           them      to

direct       verbal           abuse            at    us.           We    joined          the     cordon             and       a    fight          started

in    the    Cantilever                   stand          with       3 other             officers           a       group          of     Liverpool

supporters             were          ushered             back       behind          the       cordon.

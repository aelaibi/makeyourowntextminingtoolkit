FA/HILLSBOROUGH

John Dyson^for an update and whether we needed his help
specifically. He said that it would be useful for him to
know how we planned going about preparation.

1.   We were going through all the files and putting them
into chronological and subject matter order which I hoped
would be completed by the end of this week.  It was quite a
task because of the mass of papers we continually got. A
lot of the papers were not strictly relevant to the factual
issues. Some of them were relevant to the policy issues.
Once we had got them altogether we would all have the same
set.

2.   As no directions on discovery were given we were
inclined to not send documents to the Treasury Solicitor for
the moment. “A lot of the documents were not strictly
relevant to the factual issues. Others may only be relevant
to Phase 2. It would certainly be pretty selective.   I
imagine*that Sheffield Wednesday had a lot more relevant
papers than we had.

3.   I had had a meeting with Jack Wiseman yesterday and I
would be drafting Graham Kelly's first factual statement
this week. I agreed with John Dyson that it would ao
be concerned with what he saw at Hillsborough, but the
emphasis would be on how selection was carried out and what
the FA's involvement was in organising thifHrinal. I was
going to put quite a few exhibits to the statements with
regard to various rules and regulations and also give a
clear exposition of what happened in practice.    John Dyson
thought we ought to be quite full and frank about this. He
did not see it as a problem for the FA.

4.   The issue?statement'for Phase 2 dealing with the
various points which needed to be considered was going to be
dealt with by way of meetings with the relevant documents
held with Graham Kelly early next week. John Dyson agreed
that was the best way of doing it. Then he could be pointed
towards the relevant regulations and history.

5.   He thought with regard to the selection of venue it may
be necessary to get a statement from Mackrell of Sheffield
Wednesday with regard to his phone call to the police.
However he would look at the first draft.  He did not think
all the papers relating to the administrative inefficiency
(if that was how they were to be interpreted) of the FA as
relevant to either the factual or policy issues.

6.   I confirmed that on the files I had read so far and I
had probably been through about two thirds of them,there
were no complaints in writing about last year's semi-final
from Liverpool fans.

7.   John Dyson thought the biggest scrap would be between
the police and Sheffield Wednesday. He gave me his home
number should I need him and looked forward to speaking to
me soon.

of this week so that he could consider it over the weekend,
it was important to get it right.

Geoff Thomson a council member of Sheffield Wednesday FC had
spoken to     about being in touch with Sheffield
Wednesday's plans for the hearing.  He fully understood and
would keep us informed.

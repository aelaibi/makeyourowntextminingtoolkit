I THOUGHT THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE P.A. SYSTEM AND THE
POLICE OFFICERS INSIDE THE GROUND.I THOUGHT THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOUD
HAILERS USED BY THE POLICE TO TELL PEOPLE WHERE TO GO BOTH OUTSIDE THE GROUND
AND INSIDE IN ORDER TO SPREAD THE CROWD OUT MORE EVENLY.
THE POLICE DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING OR WHAT THEY SHOULD BE
DOING.THE AMBULANCE SEVICE WAS FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH AND THE
POLICE COULD HAVE HELPED BY DIRECTING THE CROWD IF THEY HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED
TO DO SO.

aJ^THE  2 PENS BEHIND THE GOAL WERE PACKED. YOU COULD TELL THERE WAS NO WAY
YOU COULD ALLOW ANYONE ELSE IN THERE - THIS WAS NOW ABOUT 2.40 PM.

THERE WAS ROOM IN THE WING NEAR THE SOUTH STAND, THAT I COULD SEE, AND
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE FENCE AT THE FRONT BUT THE SIDE FENCES
PREVENTED THE CROWD FROM EXPANDING INTO THE AREAS WHERE THERE WAS SPACE.

I WAS AWARE THAT THERE WAS DISCOMFORT FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE TERRACES, AND
THEN PEOPLE STARTED TRYING TO CLIMB OUT. AT THIS STAGE THE POLICE DIDN'T
REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WERE PUSHING PEOPLE BACK, AND THE TANOY WAS
ADVISING PEOPLE TO PUSH BACK, AND THEY COULDN'T.

ON THE PITCH SOME OF THE POLICE DIVED IN AND HELPED, BUT A LOT OF POLICE
OFFICERS STOOD AROUND, OVERWHELMED, WHILE THE FANS HELPED THE INJURED AND
DEAD.

I DIDN'T SEE ANY HOOLIGANISM EITHER OUTSIDE THE GROUND OR ON THE PITCHES,
ONLY ONE PUNCH-UP AFTER IT ALL HAPPENED AT 4.00 PM.             (~f)

WAS HAPPENING.I DID NOT THINK THERE WERE ENOUGH STEWARDS IN THE

THERE WERE NO STEWARDS ON OR BEHIND THE TERRACES TO GIVE DIRECTION TO CHECK
ON THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE GOING INTO THE CENTRAL PENS.
EVEN I COULD SEE THAT THE CENTRE PENS WERE FULL BEFORE 1430, THATS WHEN SOME
FANS STARTED TO CLIMB OVER THE SIDE RAILING TO GET INTO THE SIDE PENS.
BY 1450 ALOT OF PEOPLE WERE BY THIS TIME CLIMBING OVER THE SIDE FENCES.
BY 1458 BEFORE THE KICK OFF A COUPLE OF YOUNG FANS WERE CLIMBING OVER THE
FRONT ONTO THE PITCH BUT THE POLICE AT THIS STAGE WERE PUSHING THEM BACK INTO
THE PENS.
       4 OR 5 MINUTES LATER THERE WERE MORE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER THE FRONT,
    IE THE POLICE LET OVER, I EVEN SAW A POLICE OFFICER CARRYING SOME ONE AWAY
I THINK THEY MUST HAVE COLLASPED.
DURING ALL THIS TIME THE ONLY STEWARD I SAW WAS A PROGRAMME SELLER.
THE REST I THINK YOU KNOW.
WENT WITH 8 YEAR OLD SON NAMED        . .AND
               APPROX 50 YRS OF                                     I PHONE NOT

            CROWD. THERE WAS NO ORDER , JUST A MAD RUSH TO TRY AND GET IN.
            THERE WERE POLICE HORSES RUNNING THROUGH THE CROWD WHICH WAS
            REALLY FRIGHTENING. AT THAT TIME THE BLUE GATES WERE CLOSED. I
            WAS GETTING VERY OUT OF BREATH AND MOVED TO THE SIDE OF THE CROWD
            TO GET A BREATHER.

WERE NO STEWARDS OR ANYONE ELSE TO DIRECT YOU SO I MADE FOR THE TUNNEL. I WAS

SO I CAME BACK OUT AGAIN AND MADE MY WAY UP TO THE STAND.

STANDS, I COULD SEE THE FENCING A PEOPLE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCES, THE
POLICE JUST STOOD THERE AND DID NOTHING.     I THEN SAW PEOPLE ON THE PITCH
BEING GIVEN MOUTH TO MOUTH, AND HAVING THEIR CHESTS THUMPED, BUT THE POLICE
STILL DID VERY LITTLE, THEN THE POLICE FORMED A CORDON ON THE CENTRE LINE OF
THE PITCH, THEY WERE NOT HELPING, IN FACT THEY WERE GETTING IN THE WAY OF THE
PEOPLE TRYING TO GET THE INJURED PEOPLE OUT OF THE PITCH. THOSE POLICEMEN
STOOD THERE FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR, THEY EVEN BROUGHT DOGS ON, THEY SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HELPING

INFO      »      I WENT TO THE MATCH ON SPECK AND WITHOUT A TICKET. I ARRIVED AT
                 THE GROUND AT ABOUT 1.30PM AND WAITED AROUND TO SEE IF I COULD
                 GET A TICKET. I WAS AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END SITTING ON THE
                 BRIDGE. AT ABOUT 2.30PM A LARGE CROWD WAS BUILDING UPAND THERE
                 WERE VERY FEW POLICE OFFICERS ON DUTY TO CONTROL THE CROWDS. SOME
                 GATES WERE OPENED ALLOWING SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE TO ENTER THE
                 GROUND AND THEN THEY

WERE CLOSED AGAIN. PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO ENTER VIA THE TURNSTILES AND THERE
TICKETS WERE NOT ASKED FOR SO THEY PASSED THEM BACK TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE. I GOT
INTO THE GROUND THROUGH THE TURNSTILES AT ABOUT 3.05PM. I WENT STRAIGHT FOR
THE TUNNEL AND WENT INTO THE REAR OF THE WEST STAND. I DIDNT REALISE HOW
CRUSHED IT WAS BECOMING AT THE FRONT, BUT COULD SEE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE
FRONT AND INTO THE STAND ABOVE. I FEEL THIS WAS AS A RESULT OF POOR CROWD
CONTROL

will say as follows:-


I was a spectator at the Football Association Challenge Cup Semi-Final

game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium

Sheffield on Saturday 15th April 1989.           Through my friend,

         I obtained a ticket for the Leppings Lane stand, which was the

Liverpool supporters defined section of the ground,

obtained the ticket because she is a member at Liverpool F.C.             She

also obtained two seating tickets in the stand where she and her friend

         went.

I travelled down to Ashton-under-Lyne that day with my wife and went

to        parents house.    I left my wife there and travelled to Sheffield

with I           Iand her friendl
                          friend        I in |          |car.   We got to the

ground about 1.45 p.m.       I separated from the girls going into our

separate queues to enter the ground.         The girls saw me go in and I

saw them going through the turnstiles.           The turnstiles were near to

each other.

When I got into the ground there were quite a few fans in but there

was plenty o f room.       I stood at the front just to the right hand side

of the goal.       I was what might be termed as the second row back.

The section of the ground started to fill up.            It was about 2.45 to

2.50 p.m. when I started to feel a surge of people pushing forward.

I got pushed a bit.        When the pushing started as I say there was one

person effectively in front of me.         As it carried on I was pushed

against the railings.        I put my left arm up against the railing to

try and hold myself off it.         The railings I refer to are the crowd

control railings which actually prevent any pitch invasion.             I must

have been there for about half an hour and I could not move.             My arm~

went dead during this time from the elbow downwards.              I can remember a

 child whose head was in my ribs.        I put my feet up against the wall to try

 and push to crowd back and also give that child a little bit of room.               cont'd
                               -   1   -




People then started to climb over the top of the railings and get onto

the pitch.     Those people used me to climb on top of and to get over.

I was actually helping them get over as best I could.              I thought this

would ease the pressure on me.              Eventually the crowd did start to

thin out behind me so I pushed back into the gap and managed to eventually

find my way to the back of the stand.              My head was spinning and all

I could think o f was getting out.

The game had been abandoned meanwhile whilst I was still stuck against

the fencing.

I did not know where to go.            I decided to make my way back to the

car and came out of the Lepping Lane stand through the gates, which

apparently were the gates that had been opened to let the crowft in.

They were big     double gates.            As I came out I saw bodies covered over

with blankets.     They were obviously dead people there.

When I got out of the ground I looked around for                    and

but I could not see them.          There was no help from anyone,         including

Police and Officials.

I decided to make my way back to the car as I thought the girls would

come there.     I did not know if they were going to restart the game

or not,   I just wanted to get away.

I got back to the car.     I           (eventually came.     We found               about

half an hour later walking towards the car.               It was at that point

that I was just getting some feeling back into my arm.                  I decided

not to seek treatment at the ground but it was obvious that the

medical facilities were in full use and I was not that badly injured,

or so I thought.     We decided to return to Ashton.            I was also concerned

about my wife and my parents.               I knew that they would be worried and

I just wanted to see them.


                                                                            cont'd ....

        drove back to Ashton.   I was in a complete state of shock.

We went to my parents to let them know that I was O.K.     My brother

ran me to hospital   where I received treatment.   My wife cam&with

me.   I was xrayed but it was discovered that nothing    had been broken

Apparently my injuries are ripped shoulder muscles and sore ribs.

I have to keep my arm strapped up for a week at least.     I have got

swollen fingers now which I did not have on Saturday.

I was in a complete state of shock,    shaking violently when I got out

of the stadium and again when I got back to Ashton.      It did subside

a little bit when I was in the car travelling away from Sheffield.

       HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER ENQUIRY



     Sir Peter Taylor will take evidence from a
delegation of the All-Party Football Committee on 14
November commencing at 5 p.m. We understand that it
has been put to Mr Pendry, the Committee's Chairman,
that Sir Peter would find it helpful if the
delegation contained members from all political
parties represented on the Committee.

     I thought you should be aware of this so that
you can try to ensure that a well-balanced team from
the Government side of the House goes along.




                 c
Tim Renton, Esq., MP.
Government Chief Whip
No 10 Downing Street
LONDON, S.W.1.

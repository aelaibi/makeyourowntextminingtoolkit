        For the attention of Me. J. Tester.


        Dear Sir,

        B p ; HILLSBOROUGH DISASTERS - INQUESTS.

        I refer to my telephone conversation with you on Monday the
        17th of July when I drew your attention to an article in
        the Daily Telegraph of Saturday the 15th of July, and in
        particular the second paragraph which reads as follows. ''Solicitors
        representing the bereaved and the injured believe the Inquest is
        likely to return verdicts of Unlawful Killing".

        I am somewhat concerned that this may constitute a 8ontempt
        of Court. I understand that if it were deemed desiraM6 to
        institute proceedings, then this would be undertaken by
        yourself.

        As I mentioned to you on the telephone, I am not particularly
        anxious that litigation of any sort should be engaged in, in
        connection with this matter, but I am somewhat concerned that
        if comments of this nature are made and/or continue to be made,
        then it may be difficult to obtain an unbiased Jury, when the
        time comes to hold the Inquest(s).

        My present intention is to resume the Inquests into the 95 deaths
        on the 15th of January 1990 or thereabouts, but that date may
        have to be reviewed if the events contemplated under Section
        16 of the Coroners Act 1988 were to occur or the provisions
        of Rule 26 to 28 of the Coroners Rules 1984 were to be implemented.

        I look forward to hearing from you with regard to your decision
        on this matter in due cours^

 Dear David,


       I am writing to inform you that our Executive Committee,
 meeting on Tuesday, 25th April, confirmed its earlier decision
 that The Football Association would not be seeking to profit from
 any remaining matches in this season's F. A. Cup Final.


       However, the Committee felt that it would be wrong to
 commit other organisations benefitting from the games to a
 compulsory contribution to the Hillsborough Disaster Fund.


       Therefore, the arrangements for the distribution of money
 from this year's semi-finals and final will be as per contract
 and as per Challenge Cup Rule.


       The Football Association leaves it to the recipients of
 proceeds from these events to decide for themselves what should
 be done.



                                                                                               Yours sincerely




                                                                                                    ef       ecutive

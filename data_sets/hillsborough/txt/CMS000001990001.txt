Pay Running Costs


These figures have been worked out with the assistance of Mr
Preston and take account, as far as possible, of the 1989 pay
settlement and of incremental dates.   The first quarter figure
also includes the overtime (approx 20 hours per week per person)
worked by Home Office staff in Sheffield.

           1 commenced duty at D onca ster D ivisional                          H e ad qu ar te rs at 8 . 4 5 a m on

           Saturday        15 April        1989.       I was       i/e serial    30 under      the     command of

           Ins p. Mi'llett.

           The following             officers were tjlA m 11. d to my serial,                 P C ' s '1417 McDonald,

           2967 Frost,          900 Dawson,          243 b an de rs ,       631 Kitson,      174 Welch,          2804

           M c F a r l a n e , 2 90 5 G r e a t o r e x .    All    the officers work         in A2.        We

           travelled through to S h e ff i e l d                   in convoy,     in our own personnel                   carrier

           We arrived at H i l l s b o r o u g h at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 9 . 45am and were                      briefed

           in the North stand by our senior                          officers.

           A bout    11.15am we          took up our          position on the          roundabout at the

           junction of L a p p i n gs Lane,                 junction Peni stone Road and M er ri es Road.

           Our task was to             prevent       opposing        supporters       coping into contact with
                                                                                         :\
                                                                                         ■

           each other.           Notts.       Forest        supporters were          noti ial 1owed to I n t e r __

           Peni stone Roa d N o r th and Leppings Lane.                         Li           I s upporters were

           not allowed to enter P en istone Road and Herr ie s Road.                                   We   carried              out

           this     task wit h no          real    problems,         most    supporters were good humoured.

           However,        I did notice           that      by about 2 . 1 5 pm it a pp ea re d that most                   of

           the Notts.         Forest      supporters were             in the ground,         there were              certainly

           very few on the streets at our                          location.      I have worked at similar

           locations outside              the ground          in previous years wf i            T ho    c. a m   i     i II3 1

                                                                                                                 R301

has    been played at H i l l s b o ro u gh and                     it has been the          case that most

supporters are                in the ground by this                  time.     Thousands       of Liverpool

supporters were w al ki ng down Peni stone R oa d North towards                                    the ground

and hundreds             of     cars and even coaches were                    just arriving.           I    do not

know    if this was              caused by traffic              hold ups or          ’stop offs*       en route.

The    large volume              of    persons     travelling at Leppings Lane                   continued

until 2 . 45--E „30 pm »               Just    prior     to 3.0 0 pm , I gathered my serial

together and             reported        to Ins p. Millett             who was at the entrance                   to

Leppings Lane.                  At this time we              received a       call    for a ss is t an c e at the

L ap pings Lane           end of the ground.                   We    proceeded to that          location with

the    Inspector and other                    serials.         Outside       the ground there were

a p p ro x i m at e ly    three        hundred      people      ’milling*          around.     Wit h the

a ssistance         of other           officers and horses we formed a line outside                                   the

gates w hich were                open and kept           the    crowd under          control.     We       then

started to see                injured persons and others                     obviously       in a state of

shock     leaving the                ground.

I believe a S up er in t en d en t                or    it    could have       been an       Inspector waved

us    into the ground.                  A lt h o u gh   I had a radio          I cannot       recall       any

m es sa g e s    relating            to what had h ap pened or what was happening.                               We

believed the L iv erpool                   supporters          had broken down the gates                   to gain

entry.          A l t ho u gh    I    had heard the           requests       for    the gates    to be opened

because         of the        crush and the subsequent                  order       to open them.

1 entered the stad iu m through the tunnel and went                                     into the Centre

S outh Enclosure,                w hi ch was      only about          half full at this time.                    1 saw

injured and o b vi ou sl y dead persons                         being    passed through the gate and

a whole         in the fence            onto the        pitch.        I a ss is te d the supporters               and

other     police         officers with            this for a few minutes.                    As the terraces

cleared it was                posible      to a d mi ni st er        first aid on the terraces.                       I

gave     heart massage                to two    persons,        whilst another          officer whom             I did

not know gave m o u th to m o u t h .                    They were       both males a bout— twenty

                                                                                                                  k lk t]

                                                                                                         R301

          years     of age,      but    1 could not describe          them further.        They a pp ea r ed

          to have     been dead for sometime and the efforts were unsuccessful.

          They were        e ve nt u al l y    passed through      the gate and taken away          by

          supporters        on a dv e rt i si n g    boards.

          There     has    been talk          of people   urinating and spitting          etc from the

          stand above,         but     I did      not witness      anything    like that.

          By this     time most         of the dead and          casualties    had been taken away and

          I grouped my serial                 together and stood      in the    centre    of the    pitch.

          On ab an d on me nt      of the game we made            our way to our original          point   to

          prevent     outbreaks         of     public   order.    Most     fans were very subdu ed and           I

          did not witness any trouble.

          1 cannot        recall     seeing any stewards,           but    I was not   really   in a

          position to notice             them.

          I would not say there was any bre ak do wn                      in radio   communication,

          although more          information         could have     been transmitted.

          C ou ld the sit ua ti on that arose              have    been aver te d with the a id of an

          helicopter        to monitor          the build up of the         crowd?

          The     late arrival         of the Liverpool          fans for whatever       reason was

          obviously a major             factor      in the disaster,        combined with the man y who

          did not have         tickets.         Alcohol    also    played a part but this          is

          prevalent at all             big sporting       events.

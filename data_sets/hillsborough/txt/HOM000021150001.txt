       FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:   COMMITTEE ISSUES

       Lord Ferrers was grateful to you for your submission of
       21 September which he saw on his return from leave. He has
       commented:

          "I am content with the proposals, but I hope that it will not
          be necessary to relax the 5 day reporting time to 14. It is
          important that this requirement should have an immediate
          impact. There is after all a defence of reasonable excuse.
          I am content to leave it to Mr Lloyd's judgement as to
          whether he can get the Bill through without such an
          amendment."

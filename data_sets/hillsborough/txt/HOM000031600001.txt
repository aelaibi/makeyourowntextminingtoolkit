LETTER FROM HM CORONER FOR WESTMINSTER: CONTEXT OF
HILLSBOROUGH

Issue

Response to Mr Knapman's letter of 27 June (Annex A) enclosing
an article about inquest verdicts.

Timing

2.   Routine.

Summary

3. HM Coroner for Westminster uses the topicality of the
Hillsborough disaster to draw attention to an article
published in Justice of the Peace in January.  It has no
bearing on your current considerations. A draft
acknowledgement for your Private Secretary to send is at Annex
B.

Recommendation

4.   That your Private Secretary write along the lines of Annex
B.

Consideration

5. Paul Knapman is HM Coroner for Westminster and, as such,
enjoys a higher profile than some of his peers. He writes
regularly for journals and is occasionally portrayed in the
media.

6 . His article on inquest verdicts, drawn to your attention
by a letter on 27 June (Annex A ) , reacts to the reconstruction
of events in the Hillsborough television programme. In it, Mr
Knapman defends public officers, such as coroners, who get a
raw deal from relatives, pressure groups and the media: he may
be drawing inter alia on his experiences as coroner in the
Marchioness disaster.  He goes on to denounce the gap between
verdicts of unlawful killing and accidental death (which tend
to polarise relatives' reactions as "winning" and "losing")
and proposes a middle way in which juries offer a view of the
fatal events.

7.   This has no bearing on current considerations about
                                                                «




handling the Hillsborough disaster.  It is not a proposal
since it fails to resolve adequately the well-founded common,
public perception of the coroner's inquest as a "blame
attributing" process.  I assume his motive in writing to you
is as much to draw attention to himself as to the article.

8.  I recommend your Private Secretary acknowledge the letter
and article on your behalf.  A draft reply is at Annex B.

Presentational Issues

9.     No additional points.

            Enclosed is an article I wrote and published in “Justice o f the Peace” earlier this year.

            read it.

 POLICE AT THE FENCING rWERE BRILLIANT,                  BUT I SAW A LOT Q¥/            'OLICEMEN JUST

 STANDING A R O U N D , TREATING IT LIKE A RIOT SITUATION,                    IE ?   THEY FORMED A CORDON

 ACROSS THE PITCH, AND THESE POLICEMEN,                   HAMPERED THE EVACUATION OF CASUALTIES

 ACROSS THE PITCH.           THEY WERE ALSO STOPPING PEOPLE GETTING ONTO THE PITCH, SO

 THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOCTORS PREVENTED FROM GETTING ONTO THE PITCH TO HELP

 Ti^INJURED.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THE AUTHORITIES SHOULD LISTEN TO THE FANS,                         IN THE PLANNING OF FOOTBALLS

 FUTURE,    AND THEY SHOULD HAVE A LOT MORE SAY IN THE ORGANISATION,                                   THAN THEY

 HAVE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT,              WHICH IS NIL.

 YES ONCE I STARTED TO ENTER THROUGH THE MOUTH OF THE ENTRANCE,               THE POLICE

 HORSES FACED EACH OTHER ACROSS THE ENTRANCE IN FRONT OF THE IRON GATES IN

 AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THE CROWD COMING FORWARD.              IT WAS AT THIS POINT I WAS

 SEPARATED FROM MY FRIENDS.              THE PRESSURE WAS BUILDING UP WITH MORE FANS

 COMING FROM BEHIND.         THE CROWD WAS MOVING SLOWLY FORWARD, YOU HAD NO CHANCE

 OF BEING ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND GET BACK OUT.

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IT SEEMED WRONG THAT LIVERPOOL HAD THE LESSER TICKET ALLOCATION AND THE

 SMALLER END -

 I THINK THAT LEPPINGS LANE ITSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOCKED OFF SO THAT POLICE

 COULD CHECK THE INCOMING FANS AND THEN BEEN ABLE TO ENFORCE CROWD CONTROL AT

 THE TURNSTILES.

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED THERE WERE A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS INACTIVE

 ONCE THE TRUE NATURE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED BECAME OBVIOUS THERE S T I L L M ^ S N ’T

 ANY ACTION OR ANY DIRECTIONS GIVEN.         I DID SEE HOWEVER OFFICERS RENDERING AID

 A ® REMOVING PARTS OF FENCING TO ALLOW FANS TO SPILL.         THE MAJORITY HOWEVER

 D I D N ’T.   LIVERPOOL FANS HOWEVER WERE EXCELLENT IN FIRST AID AND REMOVING THOSE

 DEAD AND INJURED.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL      INQUIRY?

 1)       LACK OF ORGANISATION BEFORE,   DURING AND AFTER THE INCIDENT.     THERE SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN MORE CONTROL OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES.

 2)       LACK OF COMMUNICATION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GROUND REGARDING NUMBERS OF FANS

 I I ^ E N S AND AT TURNSTILES.

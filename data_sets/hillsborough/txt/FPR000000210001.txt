                            INTRODUCTION



      On Saturday, 15th April 1989, the Hillsborough football

stadium was the venue for the FA Cup soccer semi final

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs.             To

facilitate crowd control and taking into account the

directions of access for fans, Liverpool, despite its larger

numbers of supporters, was allocated the West (Leppings Lane)

and North stands, where the seating and standing facilities

numbered 24,256, while Nottingham Forest were allocated the
East Stand (Kop) and South stands, with the larger capacity

of 29,800.

     Hillsborough is a capacious ground with excellent access

to most of the stands and terraces, with the single exception

of the Leppings Lane access, which is hampered by some

private housing abutting directly against the perimeter fence

(Fig 1).     This afforded only 23 turnstiles for the Liverpool

supporters compared to 60 for the Nottingham supporters (1).

At 1 4 . 4 5 hours some 5 , 0 0 0 Liverpool supporters were still

crowded outside the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane

entrances.    The Sudden arrival of large numbers of late­

comers into this restricted space, with kick-off imminent,

led to a dangerous situation of overcrowding, with such a

severe crush outside the turnstiles that a police horse was

lifted off the ground.     Fearful of loss of life, the senior
police officer outside the ground requested that a large EXIT
                          Hillsborough                           3



gate (Gate C, Fig 1) be opened so that fans could obtain

immediate access to the west stand without passing through

the turnstiles.       An estimated 2,000 fans passed through gate

C in the space of just five minutes, beginning at 14.52 hrs.

Smaller numbers also gained access to the West Stand through

gates A and B ( 1).

        The segregation arrangements within the West Stand are

illustrated in Fig 2.      The standing area is subdivided by

radial metal barriers into five areas, with further strong
metal barriers, capped by backwards-turned spikes, which are

designed to prevent invasion from the pens onto the pitch.

The pens are also divided longitudinally by crush barriers as

c*   Safety feature to control crowd surges.   The central pens,

3 and 4 r lying immediately behind the Liverpool goal, are

Confined spaces, hemmed in by steel fences to front and sides

and behind by the wall supporting the seated accomodation,

with the only possible free outlet the tunnel along which the

spectators had entered and one small gate for each pen in the

perimeter and side fences (1— 12 as shown in Fig 2).     Even

before the EXIT gates were thrown open, these central pens

were overcrowded (1).

       Gate C is directly opposite the tunnel which leads into

the central pens of the West Stand.      The crowd naturally

rushed into the tunnel rather than to the sides where
uncrowded pens were available.

       The sudden influx of an additional 2,000 fans into the

central pens led to a disastrous crush which was exacerbated

by surges in the crowd when the match started.      It was

appreciated by officials immediately in front of pens 3 and 4

that a serious situation was developing (Fig 3).      However

froiti the observation post* where the senior police officer
                        Hillsborough                             4



was situated, the gravity of the situation was not realised

(1).              Fans eager to join the others in the pens were

still attempting to push in from the back, exacerbating the
desperate crush within the central pens.     One of the

horizontal crush barriers collapsed in pen 3 (fig 2) and

large numbers of fans were thrown forwards under a huge

Weight of falling bodies.     At 13.06 a police officer ran onto

the pitch and the match was stopped.

        As a consequence of the crush a total of 95 people died

and 148 required immediate hospitalisation.     The deaths and

the most serious injuries were caused by asphyxia which

resulted from people being unable to breathe against the

pressure of bodies upon their chests.



At the Ground

        The gates 3 and 4 were opened and the police and

spectators worked very quickly to move large numbers of

critically injured and dead onto the pitch.     Others were
evacuated through the tunnel into the Leppings Lane entrance

area.     First aid was administered by police and St John's

Ambulance personnel together with 7 or 8 doctors and a small

number of nurses who had been spectators.     The resuscitation

equipment available was very limited, with only a single

Oxygen cylinder.     Ah unknown, but very large, number of

victims were either dead or unconsious and the doctors

present had to decide which might benefit from cardio­

pulmonary resuscitation*     The nine available stretchers were

quickly used Up so that spectators were compelled to use

advertising hoardings to carry bodies to the gymnasium, which

acted as makeshift mortuary.

        The public address system was not used to summon help to
                        Hillsborough                               5



the injured until 15.30 hrs.     This resulted in some doctors

leaving the ground thinking the match had been abandoned

because of hooliganism.      At about 15.20 Radio Sheffield made

an urgent appeal for local doctors to go to the ground.

Between 15.30 and 15.45 twenty doctors arrived in the sports

hall.     These were nearly all general practitioners carrying

the equipment they would normally take on a home visit.

These simple supplies were quickly exhausted.

        The most important role for the doctors at the ground

was the separation of the dead from those patients who needed
urgent hopitalisation and two of the doctors present were

allocated the task of confirming death in the large numbers
of bodies.     At approximately 15.40 boxes of major accident

equipment arrived with the SYMAS (South Yorkshire

Metropolitan Service) major incident vehicle.       This enabled

the doctors to set up intravenous infusions and to utilise

airways and seif-inflating bags before dispatching patients

on to hospital.

        By 16.15 most of the injured had been removed to

hospital.

        The greatest difficulty faced by doctors at the stadium

was the overwhelming numbers of casualties requiring

immediate attention ail at the same time.       Unusually for a

major incident, the dead and seriously injured had no wounds

or gross Visible Sign of injury.       The majority were very

young.     This led to a practical dilemma: differentiating

those who should benefit from resuscitation from those who

could be pronounced dead.     The paucity of equipment available

for resuscitation led to emotional distress, with feelings of

frustration and inadequacy.

At the Accident And Emergency Departments

     The accident and emergency departments of both the

Northern General and Royal Hallamshire hospitals received a

message from the police at 15.20 to say they were "on
casualty standby".     This was not the correct expression to

alert hospitals of a major disaster.     The agreed and correct
proceedure would have been to telephone the hospital

switchboard with the message, "Implement the Major Disaster

Plan".    No such message was received at either hospital.

     The first casualties were evacuated to the Northern

General hospital since this hospital was closest to the

ground.



Th« Northern General
     following the police message at 15.20, key hospital
Staff including the consultant in accident and emergency and

two assistant matrons were informed that the hospital should

expect casualties.     At 15*25 a message was received from the

South Yorkshire Ambulance service control to "expect a child

with a cardiac arrest."     There was no reference to

Hillsborough or indication that a major incident was taking
place*

     Shortly after this message, three patients undergoing

cardiopulmonary resuscitation arrived at the accident and

emergency department and it was only then, following a

Conversation between hospital staff and the ambulance crew,

that the Charge nurse in the accident and emergency

department implemented the proper Major Disaster proceedure.

The accident and emergency consultant arrrived at 15.33 by

which time the three patients were being resuscitated by

junior Staff already present.    Within a few minutes, a second
                        Hi 1 lsborough                              7



wave of ambulances arrived with large numbers of serious

casualties who required immediate attention.

        Failure to implement the major incident alert earlier

meant that small numbers of staff had to cope with this large

clinical workload in addition to the administrative tasks

required of them in the implementation of the Major Incident

Plan.     At 15.40 there was a request for a site mobile medical

team.     This could not be immediately supplied because at that

time there were not sufficient medical staff to cope with the

situation which already existed within the accident and

emergency department.     The consultant physician on call was

not included in the first line call of the Major Disaster

Plan but had been alerted by seeing the BBC television

broadcast at 15.25.     He arrived at 15.55 hrs, when his

presence was important in coordinating the efforts of medical
and nursing staff dealing with the immediate resuscitation

and treatment of the patients with crush asphyxia.        However,
within five minutes, many more staff had arrived and two

doctors were dispatched to the stadium with the major

accident equipment.

        Most of the seriously injured arrived within the first

30 minutes.     Thirteen patients were receiving basic

cardiopulmonary resuscitation upon arrival.        Initially these

patients were treated in the resuscitation areas and cardiac

output was restored in three of them.        As more patients

requiring resuscitation arrived, those patients arriving in

cardiac arrest were triaged to the mortuary.        Two of the

patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest reached intensive

care but both subsequently died.

        (Graham to redraft this paragraph.    Fifteen other
patients suffered from severe neurological problems.          Ten
                         Hillsborough                               8



were admitted unconscious or fitting.         A further five were

confused on arrival, subsequently deteriorated and all five

developed severe fitting, requiring resuscitation, intubation

and ventilation in the Accident And Emergency Department or

on the receiving ward.     An additional fifteen patients lost

consciousness in the crush*      Two of these were confused on

admission but rapidly improved.         One of these subsequently

developed cortical blindness.)

        In Pig 4 We summarise the status of patients on arrival,
with their subsequent management and disposition.

        The accident and emergency department of the Northern

Geherai is designed to cope with large numbers of patients

requiring resuscitation.     There are four permanent

resuscitation points with full anaesthetic equipment

including ventilators.     A further eight prepacked boxes

containing essentials for resuscitation are distributed to

the backup Oxygen and suction points during a major disaster.

Even these facilities for resuscitating twelve patients at

once were not sufficient and each resuscitation point was

Used more than once as patients were moved on, either as a

result of being declared dead or being removed to a support

ward.

        The management of the severely injured, and particularly

those with Crush asphyxia, will be described below.        By 17.30
hrs the resuscitation areas were clear of serious

emergencies.



This Royal Hallamshire

        The accident and emergency consultant, together with

senior registrar, both arrived at 15.37.        The nursing staff,

alerted by the media coverage, had already begun to prepare
                        Hillsborough                               9



the department to receive large numbers of casualties.        At

this time, two police officers arrived and confirmed that a

major disaster was taking place and the hospital then

formally implemented the major disaster plan.

     The first two patients arrived at 15.40.     One was dead
and the other required intubation and was transferred to the

intensive care unit.     Being further from the ground, the

Royal Hallamshire Hospital then had a quiet period when the

departmental plans could be organised.     Between 1600 and

17*00 the department received 75 patients of whom 24 required

admission.     The admission statistics are given in Fig 4.

Forty five patients were discharged after treatment, the

majority of whom were suffering from emotional disturbance

and minor soft tissue injuries.



Crush Asphyxia
     classically traumatic asphyxia presents with facial

oedema, cyanosis of the face, heck, shoulders and upper
chest* together with subconjunctival haemorrhages and

Scattered petechiae over the upper part of the body (refs

2,3,4,5).     Long-term neurological complications are said to

be rare (2,4,6).     The catastrophe at Hillsborough produced

unique circumstances resulting in a gradual and prolonged

crush affecting large numbers of previously fit young people.

Our patierits presented with little evidence of the classical

signs described above yet with a very high incidence of

serious neurological complication.

     All of our asphyxiated patients had craniocervical

cyanosis, which cleared completely within two hours of the

trauma.     Only two patients had petechial haemorrhages (thorax

and face) and one patient had retinal and optic disc oedema.
                        Hillsborough                              10



Fig 5 summarises the neurogical complications with subsequent

outcomes in these patients.     In all, 22 patients were admitted

with significant central nervous system damage from asphyxia.

Their ages ranged from 14-41 years (median 19 years).       All

had been unconscious at the ground.    Two patients died, 2

hours and 48 hours after admission, without regaining

consciousness.

     An important sub-group of six patients, who had shown

significant early improvement, deteriorated between 2 and 48

hours after their initial recovery, and without warning,
developed a depressed level of consciousness and status

epilepticus.    These patients, two of whom had already been
moved to medical wards, required urgent resuscitation for a

potentially a life-threatening complication.    All

six required ventilation and urgent treatment of seizures.

Cranial CT was normal in the two patients in whom it

was obtained*    Five of these six patients made a good

physical recovery*   A seventh patient developed cortical

blindness after six hours but subsequently made a good

neurological recovery.    These patients will be reported in

detail elsewhere.

     An important contribution to the eventual success of

resuscitation was the fact that 24 anaesthetists arrived at

the Accident And Emergency Department, making it possible to

allocate an individual anaesthetist to every unconscious
patient*

     patients With severe central nervous system damage were

treated with intravenous dexamethasone in the Accident And

Emergency Department.    Those in status epilepticus were given

diazemul bolus injections followed by diazepam infusions,

intubation and ventilation.    This was instituted in the
                        Hillsborough



Accident And Emergency Department prior to transfer to

intensive care.     Standard anti-epileptic drugs were also

given.



The Intensive Care Units:

     The Northern General Hospital has a general intensive
care unit (GITU) of maximum capacity 10 beds, a cardiac

intensive care unit maximum capacity 8 beds, and the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital has an intensive care unit maximum

capacity 10 beds.    Fortunately all but one bed at the

Northern General could be vacated to accommodate the large

emergency imput.    Seventeen patients were admitted to

intensive care at the Northern General and one to the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital.    Six of those initially admitted to the

Northern General were subsequently transferred to the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital, for CAT scans and to relieve pressure

on staff at the Northern General.      One patient was noted at

initial intubation to have severe laryngeal oedema, which

pefsisted and required a tracheostomy.

     On admission to ITU all patients had arterial lines,

central venous pressure lines, urinary catheters and
nasogastric tubes inserted.     Therapy was aimed at good

oxygenation, prevention of further seizures and the treatment

of presumed cerebral oedema.     All patients were

hyperventilated to achieve a paC02 of between 3.5 and 4 kpa

and an arterial p02 of between 15 and 20kpa, a regime aimed

at reducing intracranial pressure while maintaining good

cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (ref 7).     Ventilation was

continued for 1 - 1 5 days.    One patient admitted to ITU at

the Northern General died soon afterwards.     The ten patients

who remained at the Northern General were also treated with
                      Hillsborough                              12



mannitol, fluid restriction and frusemide to ensure a

slightly negative fluid balance, while ensuring an adequate

cardiac output.   All ten patients also received high dosage

dexamethasone (Img/kg).     Four patients who remained at the

Northern General and four admitted to the Royal Hallamshire

hospital had refractory seizures which were controlled with

intravenous anticonvulsants, two patients requiring

thiopentone.

     Computerised cranial tomography was obtained in five

(George says 7) patients either because of secondary

deterioration or severity of their neurological condition.

All were normal with no evidence of brain swelling.

Electroencephalograms were obtained in five patients, all of

which showed Changes compatible with acute cerebral anoxia.

Creatine kinase, or myoglobin estimations, were obtained as a
measure of the severity of the crush injury in 18 patients

With central nervous system injuries.    Creatine kinase (MB)

tanged from 600 to >37,700 u/1 (median 2390, n=9.     Normal

<180u/l).   Serum myoglobin ranged from 307 - 604 u/1 (median

433, n=6.   Normally undetectable).

     In five patients, there was evidence of inhalation of

gastric contents (observed at intubation, suction from

endotracheal tube or chest x-ray changes).    All these

patients received prophylactic metronidazole and cefuroxime

and none subsequently developed chest infection.    Five

patients not given prophylactic antibiotics did develop chest

infections,* but a potential cause additional to inhalation

may have been prolonged ventilation from four to eleven days.

One patient who died was confirmed to have inhalational

pneumonia at post-mortem.

     The one month outcome is shown in Fig 5.     Two patients

died in hospital.     Two patients remained in the vegetative

state, four patients were severely disabled at one month and

14 improved.



Other injuries

     Five patients developed pneumothoraces, bilateral in one
patient.     In four patients there was no pneumothorax on the

initial chest x-ray.     In three cases the pneumothoraces were
detected during repeat examinations and in one patient on a

routine chest x-ray the following day.     Four of these

patients required chest drainage.

     Nine patients had evidence of right heart strain on the

initial electrocardiogram.     Four of these were reported

earlier (ref 8).     Three patients developed pericardial

effusions.     Cardiac ultrasound showed transient impairment of

right ventricular function in seven patients.     Hypotension

was noted in two patients.     One underwent laparatomy for a

rigid abdomen and was found to have gastric dilatation.

     No patient developed delayed respiratory crush symptoms

or signs.    (George asks What does this mean - does it mean

shocked lufig - should we omit it entirely?)

     There were large numbers of soft tissue injuries to the

chest, back and pelvic area, especially in those patients who

had been crushed against the metal barriers.     Six patients

had neuropraxias, including three with brachial plexus

injuries, one each with sciatic nerve, lateral cutaneous

nerve of thigh and posterior interosseous nerve injuries.

     There were surprisingly few fractures.     The x-ray

departments at both hospitals performed more than 300 urgent

examinations within the first six hours of patient arrival.
                     Hillsborough                              14



As the films were processed, hand-written reports were

attached by the radiologists.   One patient, without serious

neurological damage, had a fractured skull, four patients had

rib fractures, and one patient each had fractures of radius

and ulna, styloid process and ankle.   One patient had an arch

aortogram because a widened mediastinum was suspected on the

chest x-ray but this was found to be normal.   Seven patients

had changes compatible with aspiration on the chest films.

                           DISCUSSION



       This incident has been the subject of a Public Enquiry

which has made a number of recommendations concerning crowd

safety at football stadia.    We focus our discussion on the

medical aspects of crush asphyxia and on how our experience

might help others involved in major disaster planning.

     We have used the term "crush asphyxia" to describe the

main neurological injury in our patients.    Although there are

some similarities to traumatic asphyxia, there are
significant differences in mechanism of injury, clinical

findings, main complications and outcome.    The term "crush
asphyxia" was also used in the Interim Report of the Official

Enquiry into the disaster.

     Traumatic asphyxia is usually caused by a heavy weight

falling on the chest or a violent crush between heavy objects

such as motor vehicles.    Often the victim has warning that he

is about to be crushed and the natural reflex in such a

situation would be to suddenly inhale and then close the

glottis (2,4).   It has been suggested that this results in

massive increase in pressure in the superior vena cava,

explaining the classical presentation of traumatic asphyxia,

fthen petechial haemorrhages in the superior vena caval

distribution and subconjunctival haemorrhages are almost

always found (9,10).   Neurological complications are reported

but they do not usually lead to permanent disability.     If the

patient survives the initial crush, then a full recovery
usually ensues*(2,4,5,6)

     Crush asphyxia, as in our patients, is caused by a slow

sustained pressure preventing inspiration.    It is more likely

under these circumstances that the glottis will remain open
                        Hillsborough                             16



and the increase in pressure on the chest may have been more

gradual than the sudden violent compression described in

papers on traumatic asphyxia.     These factors may have

lessened the increase in pressure in the superior vena cava
while the sustained nature of the crush in our patients must

have been important in the development of serious

neurological complication.

        The delayed neurological deterioration was unexpected in

patients who had seemed to be recovering and were already

being moved to medical wards away from intensive monitoring

and resuscitation facilities.     In retrospect, CT scanning,

which was undertaken because of uncertainty about the nature

of the acute brain injury, added nothing to patient

management.     Neither the delayed post-anoxic encephalopathy

or delayed post anoxic myoclonus was seen; the syndrome

encountered in these patients was seen much earlier than

either of these and there were no extrapyramidal features.

Recovery was complete in all but one patient.(11,12)

        Dexamethasone is known to reduce peritumour oedema but

its place in the management of hypoxic oedema is less

certaiiiu    It was used in these patients on the basis that it

might do good and was unlikely/ in short term usage, to do

harm*     inhalation of gastric Contents would appear to be

very likely in these circumstances: severe external pressure

on the abdomen, a full stomach and unconsciousness are potent

conditions for inhalational pneumonia.     Our experience would

suggest that prophylactic antibiotics did help to reduce the

risk of chest infection in these patients.

        Communication difficulties are often a significant

factor in most major disaster reports (ref 13, 14).     The

hospitals did not receive prior warning that a major disaster
                        Hillsborough                             17



was taking place.     This led to a short delay in implementing

the Major Disaster Plan at both hospitals.     Fortunately many

staff arrived because of the media coverage but in other

circumstances, particularly at night, this would have

resulted in important delays in dealing with such an

incident.     We strongly recommend the use of a standard coded

phrase country wide to alert hospitals of a major incident.

In the light of this, we believe that the government should

issue new guidelines to update the advice on the managment of

major diasters.     These should be clearly defined for the

emergency services, such as police, ambulance control and

fire.

        Our previous Major Disaster Plan expected the junior

staff, upon receiving the disaster call, to contact their

seniors in the cascade system.     This proved impractical
because of the large numbers of patients requiring their

immediate services for resuscitation.     We have altered our

plan to delegate this responsibility to administrative

personnel and we would suggest that other hospitals modify

their plans accordingly.     In most Major Disasters, the

casualties tend to be surgical.    Medical expertise proved to

be important in the early management of the neurological

cases*    We recommend that a consultant physician be included

With the anaesthetic and surgical teams in the first line

call for all Major Disaster plans.

     The victims wete similar in age, mainly wore T-shirts

and jeans and carried no identification.     Identification of

the unconscious and the dead was therefore a major problem in

and the uncertainties and process of identification was very

distressing to relatives.     The dead at the stadium were
photographed and this helped the identification process.       We
                        Hillsborough                             18



recommend the use of polaroid photography in respect of this

we now include a medical photographer in our Major Incident

Plan.

        The doctors at the ground had little equipment to help

with the resuscitation of large numbers of injured.     It seems

unlikely however that any sporting venue could set up such

facilities oh the unlikely risk of a recurrence.

Nevertheless large stadia and similar venues should ensure

that the personnel and equipment necessary for advanced life
support are available to deal with smaller scale emergencies

such as a cardiac arrest.     New legislation may be needed to

facilitate this.

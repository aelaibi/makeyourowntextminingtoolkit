                 On the 15th April       1989 (150489),              I worked football          duties   in relation

                 to the FA Cup Semi-Final Liverpool                     v, Nottingham Forest in uniform.

                After briefing my duty was to work in a serial that j ^s mobile.            The
                                                             ^ \2.1 i;

                 That morning we attended ^'t^hjr Pp. d land Station,                         channelling the

                 .iverpool supporters from tJie tr&ins/into                            buses to take them to

                Hillsborough Football Ground.

                We performed this duty all morning until                              the last train arrived,     We

                 then patrolled the city centre.

                at a fight at the Red Lion Publi/f Hou4e gjr^harles Street, Sheffield,

                On arrival     there was one man in jured to the w a d                        and he was    placed in

an a m b u l a n c e .   The fight had involved supporters of both clubs and

the people at the public house had been drinkixg*

At approximately 2.35 pm (1453) we wen^^tjK'^e^s t/ffiaffQp o 1 i c e Station for

meal .                                                                \.

At approximately 3.15 pm (1515) a telephone                 call was       received at the

canteen,       instructing all officers to attend Hillsborough Football

Ground.        Together with my serial, we attended at Hillsborough,

travelling at speed.

On parking the Police van on Penistone Road, we entered the ground

through the main gates.               As   we ran into the ground I looked over tomy

left and I could see people                laid on the floor surrounded by other

football supporters.              Acting on rny own initiative    I ran over to where

the    people were        laid.     With a St John's Ambulanceman and football

supporters we administered first ^ i d e ar's /best we could.                 I would

estimate there was about 6 or ~ / injure^ people, and they were all

alive.       As we were administering first aid, more supporters and police

officers were running to this corner of the ground with injured people

on wooden hoardings.

Some of the injured people were                 laid on the ground,    and some were

taken to the back of the stand.

As we were treating the              injured,    I had to shout at Liverpool

supporters to calm down, as they were wanting to ’get a t ’ the

Nottingham Forest           fans who were a short distance away.

With the supporters,              police   officers and the St J o h n ’s ambulanceman,

we carried on administering                first aid as best we could.         We then          •->

started to carry the injured supporters                 to the back of the main stand,

knowing that that would foe the place where the ambulances would attend.

I then went         running back onto the pitch to see what/bther assistance
                                                        /
could be given.        I ran across the pitch towards tWe Lappings Land end.

                                                                              S3884

brought    in the opposite directions on hoardings by police; officers and

supporters.     I could see some of these     people were obviously dead, as

I have seen dead bodies before and that was          plainly obvious to me.

Some of the limbs of the bodies were at grotesque angles.

Once at the Leppings Lane end there was numerous          people    laid on the

floor injured.     With other   police officers and football        supporters, we

administered first aid as best we could.

I am unable to say how long this went on for,          however after a length

of time, most of the people were transported from near the goals.

I was then told by a supervisory officer whose name I don't know to

form a cordon with other officers.         This we did across the pitch.

As we were stood across the pitch,        there was many Liverpool      fans

milling across the pitch.       A lot of fans were shouting obscenities at

the Police.     I had to shout to a lot of the fans to calm down.              They

were shouting at us that we were MURDERERS,          blaming the Police for

what had happened.      A lot of the people had been drinking,         as they

were approaching     the cordon, you could smell       it on their breath and

see that their eyes were glazed.         There were,   however,    a lot of

supporters that were getting hold of these supporters,             telling them to

get back    into the stands and also to calm down.

After some time many of the fans went back into the stand, and

supporters were making their respective ways home.

As   instructed,   I went back to the Penistone Road end,         got into a

Police mobile which dropped myself and another officer off at

Shalesinoor.   This was to supervise the fans walking        into the city.

This   is when I rejoined my original      serial.

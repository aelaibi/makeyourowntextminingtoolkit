POLICE CONSTABLE 295** MORLEDGE                                                                     QOR 153
E GROUP
HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION


At   8,00 a.m.     on Saturday 15th April               1989 I commenced duty at the Hillsborough

Football      Ground,     Sheffield         in    connection    with    the    semi    final    football    match

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs.                              On reporting for duty I

immediately made          my way       to   the    junction    of Niagara Road         and Beeley Wood Road

where    I controlled traffic               travelling along Niagara Road in an attempt to stop

parking within the police sports ground.

At 10.20 a.m.           that      same day I returned to the                  Hillsborough           FootballGround and

there commenced duty at the entrance to the gymnasium car park and police room

this entrance being situated on Penistone Road.                         While at this location I had a

number    of people       speak    to me who were obviously from the Liverpool                       area these

people were good humoured but in high spirits.                         I stayed at this location until

the main briefing had taken place,                    at the completion of the briefing I obtained

van keys      in order to commence duties as prison bus and prisoner transport from

the ground to Hammerton Road or Ecclesfield Police Station.

At approx 1.00 p.m.             due to the lack of activity within the police room at this

time I made a       visit         to the North Stand/Kop area                 of      the ground in order to look at

the pitch and           also      the crowd.          I noticed at this               time that      there were far more

Notts    fans    within    the    ground         compared   to Liverpool,          at the time    I spoke   to a

member of the ground staff and we discussed the match that had taken place the

year before       and    the    lack    of Liverpool        support    in the       ground   compared to last

years.

At   approx     1.30 p.m.       I did a prison run to Ecclesfield Police                       Station together

with PC 700, in order to get to the police station I travelled out of 'O' gate at

Hillsborough      along        Penistone      Road   away     from   city,    onto    Penistone    Road    North,

Halifax Road, Chaucer Road, Yew Lane to the police station. -I noticed throughout

the journey which passed a number of public houses that there were large numbers

                                                                                                             PAGE 2

of supporters who did not appear to be interested in making any attempt to travel

towards the ground and in fact there were large numbers walking in the opposite

direction.           I dropped off the prisoners at Ecclesfield and made my way back to

the football ground using the same route up to the junction with Leppings Lane

when I travelled along Leppings Lane into the ground through onto Penistone Road

North and to the police box.                    Again during the trip I noticed large numbers of

fans who did not appear to be making any attempt to make their way towards the

ground.        Near to the gates I saw fans who were having to be forced by officers

outside the ground to move towards the turnstiles and enter the ground. I parked

the   van      outside       the   police    room    at     the   ground   and made     enquiries       as    to   the

position with any new prisoners,                    I was informed that there were a number to be

transported          again    to    Ecclesfield.            I noticed at     this     time that   the    officers

working        in    the     police      room     were under       greatpressure      due to   the    number        of

prisoners           being      brought      in.      Iassisted      with     collecting paperwork            for   the

prisoners and at approx 2.15 pm I made a second run to Ecclesfield Police Station

together with a number of D Div officers. I used the same route to travel to the

station.            While     travelling        along Halifax      Road    Inoticed    more    fans   again        not

making any attempt to get to the ground.                           I heard transmissions on my personal

radio     re    the     crowd      in   Leppings     Lane    and    around   the    ground.       I dropped        the

prisoners at the station and returned to the ground again using the same route.

On the return I heard an officer on the radio ask that the kick off be put back

due to the crowd at Leppings Lane.                        I travelled along Leppings Lane very slowly

due to the crowds,              as I did this there were urgent messages on the radio to the

effect that people were dying.                     As I reached the ground at Leppings Lane I heard
PC 2954 MORLEDGE                                                                                     QOR 153

                                                                                                               PAGE 3

a voice on the radio which I recognised as that of PC 1285 Smith he requested

bolt   croppers         in order       to       cut   the    fence.    Due to these transmissions all the

other officers           in the van dropped out and moved into the crowd at the Leppings

Lane turnstiles.                 I continued round to Penistone Road using Parkside Road. As I

did this I heard requests for ambulances.                             I moved onto Penistone Road but could

see    that    the      road      was becoming blocked and the ambulances and police                        vehicles

could not move due                to this.      I parked my van on the central              reservation        and ran

into    the ground through the gym car park entrance.                              Imade my       way to the police

room    to    be     met    by     a   small      number      of   people    being treated         by the   St   Johns

Ambulance people, I could see by the reaction of people coming from the playing

area    that more assistance was needed in that area.                              I ran onto     the pitch.     I ran

to a male who was unconscious on the ground and asked the friends                                    around him to

let me in, I could                see that this person was not breathing and                       gave mouth to mouth

and heart massage.                After a short time I could see that there                        was little point in

continuing and asked for assistance to carry the body to the rear of the gym. A

number of supporters assisted me to carry the body to the rear of the north stand

where I could see that there were a number of bodies lying on the ground together

with grieving friends and relatives making the job for the St Johns and officers

more and more difficult.                    I made a request to Insp Barker that we start to move

bodies       out   of      the    area.     A    short      time   after    this   the   bodies    and a number of

injured started to be moved into the gym.

By    this    time      an ever growing number of people were                       carrying      injured/bodies    to

this area with each body there was six plus helpers who were then just milling in

the area getting in the way.                      I approached a number of bodies laid at the rear of
PC 2954 MORLEDGE                                                                                  QOR 153

                                                                                                           PAGE 4

the stand and attempted heart massage and mouth to mouth, all these attempts were

hopeless.       I returned to the playing area and moved around the track area asking

people sat against the wall if they needed any help.                               At this time I saw that a

line of police officers were forming a cordon at the Leppings Lane end and also a

loose cordon in front of the Kop.                   After a short time I returned to the rear of

the    North Stand and assisted to get the                      injured into ambulances and also show

doctors       that    were   arriving,      the    area    we    appeared     to    need   most   help.      I can

remember lifting a stretcher with an injured special constable and placing him in

an ambulance.

After what       appeared to be hours I moved into the police                       room in a state of shock,

I saw that       the officers in the room were giving verbal                        cautions to the prisoners

that had been on the prison bus.

I left the room to be met by a drunken Liverpool fan who said                                'What's the score

pal."     I told him to go home.              I then remember going to an injured male who was

starting to have difficulty breathing.                     I knelt at his side             tocheck his airway

and fans in the stand above started to urinate                          on the wall, this urine           fell onto

myself and       the injured.       A number of officers shouted at them but they                     continued

to do this       and then slowly walked away.

I continued to get people onto ambulances asking any doctor I could find if they

knew of any          urgent case that was waiting for an               ambulance.

When    the    scene     started    to slow       down    I saw a      large       number of police       officers

crying and in a great state of distress.

After    a while       we    were   asked    to    sit    in    the   north    stand   and wait     for    further

instructions.         On getting into the stand I was asked to board a PSV in Penistone

                                                                                       PAGE 5

Road   and   take   details   from   friends/relatives   of missing   persons   in   order   to

attempt to trace them.        I spoke to the brother of a missing person and then he

was transported to Hammerton Road Police Station.           I then returned to the north

stand.

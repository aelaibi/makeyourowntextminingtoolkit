Mr. Peter Robinson.

Liverpool F.C.



Dear Mr. Robinson,

                       Bill Shankly once said

           "FOOTBALL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN LIFE OR DEATH."

Those    p'rangely prophetic words are the banner under which

Liverpool       F.C.,        its       supporters             and     football         in    general

must continue.

                       The    most          important             thing   to     those      who gave

their     lives      was     LIVERPOOL                F.C.        Bill    Shankly        knew     that

Football      gave     them        a    release         from the          everyday^ struggles

that for many are part of life in Liverpool.

                       Although             it    may        be    hard     those      of    us   who

remain,    supporters and playing staff alike, must heed Bill

Shankly 1 s     words      and         do    our       utmost       to    pick    up     the    reins

and keep Liverpool at the top. This is the lasting Tribute

that those who have died would have wanted.

                       Next        years         Charity           Sheild      game      should    be

played    for     by    Liverpool            and       Everton       with      all proceeds         to

help    their     relatives            and       to    create       a monument         at Anfield

to those who died.
                       Ynlirs in <Q^nt>ss,
Dear                                                                 17   ,   4   , 1989.

                          My      Son       and     I    were    in           the    North stand          and

were     lucky       to       escape    injury,           over       15       minutes          before     the

main         disaster. Therefore                   we     were       able           to    see that        the

major cause of the tragedy was a combination of two factors.

1   ...There were insufficient turnstiles open which meant

      that people could not gain access to the ground quickly

      enough.        This led to a build-up of supporters thus

      causing a bottleneck around the entrances.

2   ...There      was     a    total        lack    of     organised              crowd        control by

      the Police, which made matters worse.

                          At     my     turnstile             there           was        only only       one

frail Policewoman no more than twenty years old, who despite

being       terrified           herself           stood    her        ground,             and tried        in

vain to assist us.

                          There        were        nomounted              police              near        the

turnstiles, and as far as I could see less than one Policeman

per    turnstile.              I saw only two mounted Policemen who were

on    the    main       road over           50     yards      away, for              what purpose           I

don't       know.       Despite        our        screams       of    terror,             neither       they

nor other available police made a serious attempt to relieve

the     tremendous               pressure, until itwas far                                    too late.

                          I    utterly           refute the      claims             that       many       of

those       who     were       eventually           allowed          into         the      ground       were

ticketless.             Hardly       anyone was           asking          for        "spares"          which

was     an indication           to     me    that       few     had           gone       to    the match

without tickets.

                          The obvious              solution          would           have        been     to

delay       the     Kick-off.           Will        the     authorities                  ever        consult

the fans themselves ???                     Regretfully yours.

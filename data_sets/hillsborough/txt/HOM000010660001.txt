MINISTER'S CASE: .          AMD THE HILLSBOROUGH FUND


I have seen Frank Smith's note to you of 18 May covering a draft
reply to the above case.


2,     As far as a general line on disaster funds is concerned
you might like to use material from two previous cases passed to
me by Tony Budd at Cabinet Office, copies of which I attach.      The
reply should also clearly have a DSS contribution on the
provisions available to the handicapped and their families, and
if, as |         |appears to suggest, the handicap is a result of
medical negligence, damages can be sought through the civil
courts.

3.     My personal view is that Frank's draft is perhaps a little
too full in its expression of sympathy, but that may be a matter
of taste.

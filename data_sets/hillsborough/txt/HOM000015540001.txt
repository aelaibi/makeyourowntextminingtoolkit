Dear Mr. Whitehurst,

               We          are in receipt of your letter of 5 May.

     We confirm that ITN was represented at the pre-inquiry
meeting on 28 April when Lord Justice Taylor requested that, to
avoid, prejudicing proceedings, no contact should be made with
witnesses.

     However when we spoke to Mr. J. Stone during the course of
our research into the background of the Hillsborough disaster,
wefound that he had no      communication from the police, the
inquiry solicitors or his employers, Sheffield Wednesday, even
though it was 17 days after the event. The fact that he had not
been interviewed by the police was confirmed by West Midlands
Police. It was on this basis that we interviewed Mr. Stone. We
should point out that he neither sought nor received any payments
for the interview.

     We would like to apologise to Lord Justice Taylor if our
action contravened his lordship's request and we confirm that it
is not ITN's intention to interview witnesses before they have
given evidence to the Inquiry.

                                                                                                     Yours sincerely,




                                                                                                     Hugh whitcomb

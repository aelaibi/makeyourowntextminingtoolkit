      25.5.89
1.        Purpose of Report


The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the work of the Task
Team, identify likely future needs, and to seek approval for staffing changes.


2.       Background


The Team was set up following a report to Programme Committee on 10th May,
1989.     The primary objective was to undertake work with Sheffield residents.
The secondary objective was to support Liverpool Social Services. The Team
comprises 3 social workers, 3 clerks, an Administrative'Assistant and a Team
Leader.       A senior clinical psychologist is attached to the Team from
Sheffield Area Health Authority.


3.       The Work of the Team


The Team has undertaken a wide range of work:


3.1       Individual Referrals


Over 50 referrals have been received. Some of these people simply required
reassurance about the effects of the disaster on them, whilst 11 required
ongoing casework assistance. Common problems have been depression, irritability,
nightmares, inability to sleep and flashbacks to the disaster. For those who
were on the Leppings Lane terraces,           a fear of crowds is common.


Team members are currently working with 11 individuals on a one to one
counselling basis. These include survivors, a bereaved person, rescuers,
stewards, helpers and the partners of some of these people.


_        CrtFtco'P .,
.5 . 2    GSae     W orx




One team member            has been working over a three month period with a group of
Sheffield Wednesday F.C. Stewards who were on duty during the disaster.                 A
group of approximately 10 Stewards            have met fortnightly. Several other
Stewards are in touch with this grouo.             They began as a therapeuti-: group
helping the Stewards to come to terras with their experience.             This is still
an. important element, but the          focus of   the group has shifted to look at   the
conditions under which stewards are           employed and to build links vrith stewards
and suooc-rters from Liverpool.           This has been important in order to overcome
2


their fears of animosity or blame being attached to them by survivors
and Liverpool fans.


3.3      Community Work


Contact has been established with residents in the Leppings Lane triangle.
A residents' action group is in the process of forming as a result of this
work.    The group is now pressing for improvements to the quality of life in
their area by negotiating with S.W.F.C., the Police and the City Council
to provide better facilities. The Group held a very successful public meeting
chaired by Councillor Helen Jackson in early October which was attended by
approximately 90 people.       Contact has also been made with a local Traders'
group who have erected a memorial stone to those who died.           The Task Team
has been instrumental in linking these Traders with the Liverpool Survivors
Group.    This work has highlighted the importance of forging links between
the two communities.


3.4      Visits to the Ground


Over 30 visits, involving 39 people, have been made to the ground since
July, principally by bereaved and survivors from the Liverpool area.           For
the bereaved,    these visits have been extremely important.'They have
allowed many to see the place where their relative or friend died.           It must
be appreciated that this is particularly important when a friend or relative
is last seen fit and healthy, but then suddenly disappears from one's life.
Coming to terms with a loss in these circumstances is especially hard, and
a visit to the scene of the disaster has therefore been particularly
valuable.    For survivors, it has been important in helping them to simply
understand what happened to them.       There will be more of this work in the
future. For many people, months must pass before the desire to return to
the ground is matched by the emotional strength to do so.


3.5      publicity


Preventative mental health work was an original objective of the project.
A substantial effort on this took place in July and August by producing
and distributing publicity and literature about the team and its work,
and to reassure members of the public about the feelings which followed
their experience. Specific material      was   produced   for local communities,
health workers       and the general public.    As well as leaflets, the local
3


press and radio were used.        This work has now come to an end.   Future
publicity will be concerned with specific events such as the first occasion
that the Liverpool team return to Sheffield, the Inquest and the anniversary
of the disaster. These can be used to continue to inform the public of the

availability of help.


3.6       Attending Matches


Members of the team attended the Sheffield Wednesday v Sverton match in
September, and will attend the Liverpool v Sheffield Wednesday match in
November to assist any distressed individuals.


3.7       Liaison with S.W.F.C.


Regular liaison with S.W.F.C. management has been necessary on a number of
issues such as access to the ground for the bereaved and injured, and
meetings between S.W.F.C. and the ground's stewards.


3.8       Liaison with Liverpool City Council and other Local Authorities


Close links have been maintained in order to answer enquiries such as who
rescued a particular survivor, or which helper was involved with a survivor
on the day of the tragedy.


Administrative staff on their own        dealt with enquiries like this between
April and July (when the Task Team was established) by using the computer
facilities they developed at that time and have since maintained.         Liaison
has also occurred on matters such as access to the ground, sharing helping
techniques, and planning the provision of future services.


3.9       Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry


The work of the inquiry was monitored in order to offer help to those
witnesses giving evidence who were distressed. At the inquiry, volunteer
counsellors were present.


3.10      Co-ordination


    It has been important to co-ordinate the Task Team's effort with that of
    other agencies such as Occupational Health workers, voluntary groups, and
    the local clergv.   A Steering Group has now been established for the Team,
    but has met only once so far.

3.11   Coroner's Inquest Training


A very successful study day was organised by the Team for social workers
working with bereaved, primarily from the Liverpool area, but also from
other parts of the country, in preparation for the Inquest.        Representatives
from the Family Support Group, a self-help group formed by the bereaved,
also attended.


3.12   Area Health Authority Survey


The Area Health Authority has undertaken a survey into the effectiveness
of the support that was offered to staff involved in the aftermath of the
disaster.


Team members offered advice in the compilation of the Survey and administrative
support has been given.     A commitment has been given to accept any referrals
generated by this survey. JTdL                                A*                     ?


3.13   Miscellaneous Tasks


Staff in other Departments have been debriefed.     This involved bringing
people together in groups in order to allow them to talk about their
experiences, actions and feelings in a structured, planned and guided way.
This is a specialised technique which research has shown to be very
effective in preventing future mental health problems. Other tasks have
included copying and distributing video material presented to the Taylor
Inquiry, giving casework advice to other F & CS staff and liaison with
Sheffield Education Dept.


a.     Comment on the Work Undertaken


^ .i   immediately following the disaster, there was a need for counselling
services whicn was met oy the Helpline and voluntary agencies. This need
quick!v declined and subsequent referrals to the Taks Team have tended
to be from people who experienced severe and direct exposure to the
aisaster, and continued to suffer     distress as a result.


m e presence and publicity generated by the Team has hopefully had a
                                     /tuw /le
reassuring effect on individuals.^ As a result of these factors, we       have
not experienced an overwhelming number of requests for one to one or group
5


counselling as was originally anticipated.       However, it should be noted
that offers of assistance to the largest group of front line personnel
involved in the disaster, the Police, have not been accepted.        It is
believed that a substantial number of Police officers remain seriously
      Aft* 0+4$
affected* ' tfe-irther     referrals been received from the other rescue
services.     This may be due to effective help having been offered at an
early stage.      Alternatively, cultural and organisational factors may have
prevented people seeking help as yet.        In the future, individuals who were
affected by the tragedy who do not resolve that experience may well absorb
these problems into their general life and might have to have them
•unpicked* by non-specialist staff later, when it will be much more
difficult.


A.2      It is particularly noteworthy that the Team has been able to use a
range of approaches in responding to the aftermath of the disaster.
INdividual casework, group work and community work techniques have been
adopted with success. The Coroner's Inquest Study Day required organisational
skills of a high order.


A.3      In summary, it is clear that essential and effective work has been
done with seriously distressed individuals and groups who would not other­
wise have been helped.     Hopefully, the residents' action group will be
firmly established and continues to press for positive improvements in the
area.


It is important thatall this work     iscontinued.


5.       Future Needs


Specialist resourceswill need     toremain    in order to undertake the following
tasKst


5.1      Continuing existing work with individuals


This is demanding, specialist work which requires experienced staff with
existing knowledge.


5.2      New Referrals


The Area Health Authority Survey     may well result in new referrals.
 6


To a large extent, the number of new referrals obtained will depend on
 the degree to which the Team is pro-active.    New referrals may also be
generated by future significant events e.g. match on 29th November.


5.3     Group Work


The work with the Stewards will need to be maintained.     '


5.A     Community Work


The Residents' meeting should be followed up by staff assisting this group
to build on their success, and press for the improvements in community
facilities and policy that they are seeking.


5.5     Liaison with S.W.F.C.


This work should focus on continuing to ensure good access to the ground
for bereaved and injured, and planning for the Liverpool v Sheffield
Wednesday game   on 29th November.


5.6     The Anniversary


Preparation for this event will involve continuing liaison, planning and
co-ordinating with Liverpool, S.W.F.C., the bereaved and their support
agencies.

                                                     i
5.7     Liaison with Liverpool and other Local Authorities


Specific enquiries will be received, joint work during visits to the ground
will be necessary and joint planning for future events will be needed.


5.8 i   Liaison with Education Department


This work' has yet to be started.    It is envisaged that the Team can be
instrumental in encouraging positive links between the young people of
Liverpool, Sheffield and Nottingham.


5.9     Coroner's Inquest


A range of social work tasks will be required to be performed, before,
during and after the Inquest.   It is difficult to predict the extent of
7


this at this stage, though Sheffield residents will be involved.      It will
be necessary to maintain liaison with the Coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, to
assess the level of need required to provide staffing support at the
Inquest.


6        Recommendations


It is recommended that:


1.       Social Work Posts
The present Hillsborough Task Team be reduced in size to two social work
posts from 30th November, 1989, and to be attached to an appropriate team
at Division 2.


2.       Administrative Posts
The present administrative support team should be reduced in size to one
scale    2/3 clerical posts from 30th November, 1989, and the postholder
should be accountable to the Administrative Assistant Division 2 there­
after.


3.       The Hillsborough Task Team as constituted in 1 and 2. above, should
continue in existence until 31st May, 1990.     Director of Family & Community
Services should be requested to review the work levels of the Team by
March, 1990 and report again to the Staffing Sub-Committee of the Family
& Community Services Programme Committee if, in his opinion, further
changes in staffing levels are necessary.




13.10.89
It is anticipated that 2 social work staff, one clerk and associated
running costs will be required for the next 6 months to perform these
tasks.

N.B.     These costings assume replacement of Task Team staff   in their
         original posts - this has not happened in all cases.
         Actual costs vail therefore be even lower depending    on the
         staff appointed.

Ir.oact Statement

The proposal will have no impact on Black pecple. Scne of the deceased
was black and no referrals of black Sheffield citizens has been received.
There is no evidence of significant ethnic minority involvement in the
Disaster.

Women were affected significantly by the disaster but the focus for most
of this work is with the North West Authorities. &n attempt has been
made to reach women as partners of Sheffield residents affected, there
has been a proactive approach to all those Sheffield people directly
involved.

Regarding disability most of the injured reside in the Scr th V e s t.
The team was established as a preventive mental health service for Sheffield
citizens.

There are no identified needs for disadvantaged groups which cannot be met
within the proposals. The staff were seconded from existing posts.
                 *p •
Conclusion

The expected high level cf need for specialist services has not been
revealed by the Task Team's efforts and it is reasonable to assume
that such need has not been in existence. Few stones have been left
unturned in efforts to discover that need and encourage individuals to seek
help. The answer to the questions must lie in the strength of Sheffield’s
communities and family networks and the fact that the greatest impact
was on those networks in the north west. Effective and essential wcrk
has been done with some seriously distressed individuals and groups,
this work needs to continue with the liaison work already described.
A future event which-.would have impact on the city but which is outside
a frame of referencf*‘is the Coroner's Court Inquest, it is expected
that will net take place until some time in 1991.


Recommendation

It is recommended that Committee approve the proposals contained in Section
6 above.
BACKGROUND TO THE REPORT PRESENTED TO THE 25 OCTOBER 1989 SERVICE
DEVELOPMENT AND BUILDINGS SU5 COMMITTEE - TITLED HILLSBOROUGH TASK
TEAM REVIEW REPORT

1    PREPARATION
The report was prepared against the back-cloth of the work situation
that existed in mid September.
SECTION
2    FACTORS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THE REPORT WAS PREPARED
a)   The "core" nature of the primary purpose in establishing the team
      is to work with affected Sheffield citizens.

     The   scheduled public meeting and the day conference
     The pattern and number cf referrals to the team
d)   The number of currently "active" cases.
e!   The outcome of specific and general information/publicity     effcrzs
f)   The pattern/number of visits to the ground being made.
g)   The outcome of checking of what level of need that might be
      existing in the general community.
hi   The response to offers of help made to, when known, still
      affected groups and the likelihood cf a future positive
      change .
i)   A "Final" check of the Sheffield position with an outside
      consultant.

3    ACTIVE CASES, NUMBER AND PATTERN OF REFERRALS
A total of 33 contacts/referrals had been either handed over to the
team or were made directly since the disaster. From the date of the
official "handover" to the Hillsborough Task Team on the 3 July,
nine of these referrals had been made. At the time of writing cf
the report there was nine active cases. The pattern of contact with
some of these referrals was one or two contacts and it was expected
that short term involvement would prove z h s most effective in the
rest (this was advised by the psychologist and agreed within the
team). Half of the referrals made were in Classification 1 (direct
exposure'’ and 7 in Classification 3 (rescue personnel).

4    PUBLICITY AND INFORMATION - GENERAL AND SPECIFIC
Mucn gensrc-.l and specific publicity and information had been generated
zr.d dispensed by the         These efforts v;ere coming to an end it:
mi: September and it was agreed within the teas that any future pucliti
should be around specific events.

DRAFT


T EAM R E - C O N S T R U C T I O N



General


There exists uncertainty about           the future needs of Sheffield people and when
certain legal processes will need to take place.           It is necessary that there
is general agreement to a plan which will allow future needs, some possibly
unknown, to be mat.            In resDonding to these future needs, the employment of
the present Task Team members' skills and knowledge will be required.            The
Task Team will shortly be reduced in size and therefore it is necessary to
confirm the necessary monitoring and call-back arrangements for its present

members.


Circumstances


Following the reduction in team size, the practical arrangements for the
 re-forming of eithe?^ the whole team or adding members to those remaining
might follow from one or more of the following circumstances;            an increase in

work because of:-


 (1)         known, planned for events taking place.
 (2)         A sudden rise in workload taking place.
 (3)         Gradual, sustained increase in workload.


Review                                                        °


Those who are part of reduced team need to monitor workload and make
 apDropriate Dlans to meet future, known needs.           This can be done via normal
monitoring and supervision and the review reports that Committee require.
 In order for team members who have returned or moved to other posts within
 the Authority, a way of keeping them informed must be agreed. Following the
 reduction in team size until the end of ADril, 1990,it is suggested that tne
 team meets on a monthly basis to review the work and participate in planning.
 2



 Recall Mechanism


 Team members are concerned that- any commitment to meeting the future needs
 of Sheffield citizens might inhibit their employment in posts other than
 those they presently occupy.    It is felt that their return to this area of
 work needs to be negotiated between senior management and the appropriate
 line manager when it is agreed extra services are required.     General
 acknowledgement should be made that at a future date, specific services will
 need to be provided for such events as the Coroner's Court Inquest.       This
 acknowledgement has already been made by an A.D.S.S. and the Services Programme
 Committee. The task of securing the release of team members is one which it
 is felt the A.D.S.S Operations needs to undertake and secure.
                                         •?ci

Agreement


There needs to be agreement about which team members' services are required
to supplement the reduced team and for how long.   Once this is decided at
Divisional level and with the team member(s) concerned, the request can then
be made to the A.D.S.S. Operations to secure their release.      If the period
of time the extra assistance is required can be specified, 'this     would assist
all those involved. If it cannot be, then it is suggested there should be
                ...                         °
agreement on an initial period of return and then a review.


Conclusion


These proposals require that the Department continues to give high priority
to the necessary work following Hillsborough.   The potential conflict between
"Hillsborough work" and any other work being undertaken by team members in
their substantive posts is recognised.   It would assist team members if the
actual task of securing their release and return to the team is secured bv a
Senior Manager.   Appropriate action shotgd be taken to fill any significant
gaps should staff be returned -to the team for longer than three weeks.

30.10.89
       TIMESCALE


       Areas of Work


1.     Existing/Ongoing..

1.1    Casework

        It is good casework practice that contact should be offered in such cases until
        the first anniversary.

        Individual work with Stewards is now being taken on. This has arisen from
        involvement with them in their group.

1.2    Groupwork/Community Work

        Stewards
        Residents

       It is planned with both of these groups that their control and running would
       gradually be handed over to them. This involves planning, training and
       support of the groups in the meantime, as well ashelping them toorganise
       events already planned, such as second public meeting for residents in
       January, 1990 and ongoing regular stewards' meetings.

1.3    Liaison with Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

        P.R. with Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

        Work with staff at the ground is currently being explored.    This is sensitive
        and time-consuming at the moment.

1.4    Liaison with other L.A.s and    Liverpool teams

        This work is ongoing and varies in time required.

1.5    Showing Video

        Requires work before and after showing. Video session can last 2-3 hours.

1.6    Ground Visits

        Take 2-3 hours. They are increasing in frequency.

1.7    P.R. WORK/Outreach Work

        Some work done by publicity already.

        Need to get out to people borne out to some extent by preliminary findings
        from Health questionnaires.

Already found that face to   face contact produces results.   e.g. residents/ground.

1.8    Coroner's Study Day

        To be written up and circulated.
Match on 29th November

Planning, organising and providing social work suppoft for the 29th November.

Casework that may arise from triggers such as:

(a)        29th November
(b)        second part of TaylorReport.
(c)        QuestionnalRES TOHealth Authority - results due in January
(d)        Anniversary
(e)        Coroner's Inquest

Initial interviews on average take over two hours. They are time-consuming,
intensive and draining.

Anniversary - .

Planning and liaising for this event.

Education Dept.

A piece of work planned for some time. So far we have not had time to start.

Coroner's Inquest

Work to be planned once outcome of report to D.P.P. known in April/May.
In the meantime, face to face approahces to be made to Coroner's staff.

F & CS Staff

Brief in document of 10th May. Has this changed? If not, then outreach and
follow up work needs to be offered to F & CS staff. Also P.R. work about the
team. F & CS staff have a lot of information which would be useful for the
Department and the city in plannin for another disaster.

Police

Continue approaches both in an informal face to face and a formal way to the
Police. The various triggers already mentioned may be factors in producing
work for the team.

Time also needs to be taken into account for:

(1)        Supervision/staff support within the team.
(2)        Recording work of the team in a document.
(3)        Writing up pieces of work.
(4)        Duty. If and when team is reduced a duty systemwould    have to
            operate for at least part of each day.
(5)        Team meetings of existing reduced and former larger team.
(6)        Steering Group.
(7)        Reading and keeping abreast of work being done in thefield of
            disasters.
(1)   Teamof 3 social workers and 2 Admin staff to remain in situ for
      6 months from setting up of team, i.e. end of July - end of January,
      1990. We acknowledge Paul has to return to Division 5 at the end
      of November. The team therefore agrees to be managed by someone yet
      to be named from Division 2. (Supervision of work could be taken on
      by a different person if need be).

(2)   From 1st February, 1990 the team be reduced to two social workers
      and one Admin staff until 4th May, 1990.

              This is general work and does not include any special project work
              that the Team is undertaking. This work takes approximately 19i hours
              per week.
The remit of the Task Team as stated in the report to Programme Committee
on 10th May, 1989 consisted of:

a primary focus of working with the people of Sheffield:

 a secondary focus of supporting Social Services Departments in the
North-West.

 the possibility of supporting families from outside of Liverpool who
chose to work directly with Sheffield.

 Research, and our own work, shows that many 'survivors' do not recognise
that they need help, or cannot seek help, for many months after the
event. We, therefore, must work from t'ne premiss that there is still a
need amongst the people of Sheffield, which includes helpingprofessions,
police, rescue workers, residents and supporters.

 It is clear that the soecialist teams on Merseyside have valued our
support so far, and would wish this to continue as their workload expands.
Workers in North West Local Authorities without specialist teams have
used the team for information and support.

The third aspect of the team's brief has not yet been fully explored.

Lessons learned from other disaster work, and our own experience, tell
us that social workers concerned with the mental health of the community
can only fully engage with those in need via ongoing pro-active outreach
work. This will involve various sorts of community work which are not
quantifiable. The following attempts to estimate working hours spent on
specific pieces of work do not take into account the lessformal, but still
important, work which surrounds meetings and visits.
RESIDENTS GROUP

Work with the residents will continue after November, 1989- It is
anticipated it will need to continue at least until April, 1990.
Through working with them as a group, individual residents have used
visits from the social worker as an opportunity to talk through their
own feelings about the 15th April. This work is not identified as
individual casework.

Developing this group has already involved a significant amount of time
of two workers in meeting with key group members to discuss with them
the development of the group, the decision making process within the
group, the group's relationship with other agencies, possible funding
for the group. The role of the Task Team in relation to the group, the
group's future development and goals. Running alongside this development
work, has been the necessary organisation around planning for a public
meeting. This included how the meeting would be organised, who should
be invited, issues   to be raised, deciding an agenda and drawing up of
minutes. Another public meeting isplanned for January, 1990, which
during December and January will average 2 hours per week.

In the future development work will need to continue with key individuals
involving two meetings per week of at least 2 nours, including planning
time for meetings.

Attending regular meetings of the group once a fortnight for approx.
2-3 hours. Individual work witn those who have been allocated tasks
within the group.   These tasks will include letter writing and liaising
with the club, the   Local Authority, the Police and the media, as well as
other similar community groups. This could well involve a further 2-3 hrs
per week.

It must be appreciated that guiding and supporting groups to do things
for themselves is more time consuming than doing it yourself.


                                                          I       o      , .
                                                        I X HAS   / ex         _
  GROUND    VISITS

 Each visit can take 2-3 hours, with preparation work taking anything
 up to an hour. The last 7 weeks have seen 36 people visiting the ground,
 with 3 more coming next week and other visits yet to be   arranged.

  Social workers in Liverpool inform us that as their caseload expands,
* so do the demands for visits to Hillsborough, although many feel that
  it will be some time before they are ready to do so. This area of work
  had peaks and troughs and this pattern may continue, although there is
  no good reason to expect the demand to cease until after the anniversary.
  This is supported by the impressions of some social workers from
  Liverpool, Xnowsley and Wirral.

 A full week of visits   (usually three, but occasionally more) can mean
 12 hours' work, and more on occasions when two social workers are required.




 STEWARDS

 Meetings with the stewards group are 3 weekly and last approximately
 3 hours.

 Other contact with group members to discuss and help with organisational
 tasks, and other meetings, as well as preparation for these take
 approximately an average of 7 hours per week.


 9 hours weekly




 VIDEO SHOWING

 This has been useful as , one-off or as part of ongoing work. Such
 sessions generally last 3 hours. Work before and after can take 2 hours.

  Five showings in the last five weeks has meant

  5 hours' work per week.
 CASEWORK

 It is good professional practice that contact should be offered in
 such cases until the first anniversary. At present, individual casework
 takes approximately

 10 hours per week.

'in the last month, we   have received 8 new referrals or re-referrals.

 There is good reason to believe that new referrals will come out of
 pro-active community work, specific trigger events, the A.H.A. survey,
 and the increasingly evident fact that people's own 'timetables' may
 only now make or allow them to seek help.

 Initial interviews on average take two hours. They are time consuming,
 intensive and draining. It would not require many new referrals to
 swamp and drain one worker already involved in other areas of 'Hillsborough'
 work.




 POLICE

 Neil Kay's report to Programme Committee on 10th May estimated that there
 were 257 Police in the ground. There is no question that a substantial
 number of these remain seriously affected. If only a small fraction of
 these were to approach the team for nelp it could create 50 - 100
 hours of work for first sessions alone.

 This area of work could develop as a result of increasing pressure on the
 Police, various triggers already mentioned, and our increasing face to
 face contact with members of the force through other aspects of our work.

 Two policemen have recently contacted the team anonymously.

 The above may well apply to the rescue services as well.
THE I N Q U E S T   - FUTURE WORK


The Task Team agreed to document information from the Training Day.
This work has not been done due to the pressure of other work. It is
likely to take each member of the Team 15 hours - this is 60 hours
total.

Regular liaison with Dr Popper to discuss issues arising around the
inquest. Meetings should take place initially on a monthly basis,
increasing in frequency as the inquest approaches. Initially this will
involve lfj-2 hours per month, increasing to 2 hours per week as the
inquest approaches.

Regular liaison with the Hillsborough unit of the West Midlands Police
for the ouroose of gaining information and discussing issues arising.
This will involve li-2 hours per month, increasing to 1-5 hours per
week as the inquest approaches.

Regular liaison with the Medico-Legal Centre staff to prepare for the
inquest. It was agreed earlier with Dr Popper that the Task Team would
interview his staff again to find out how they are feeling after
Hillsborough. This piece of work has not yet been done, but will take
about 10 hours in total (planning, letters, phone calls, interviews,
etc.).

Support for Medico-Legal staff is very important and regular contact
should be taking place with them to prepare for the inquest. Regular
involvement of 1\ hours per week is required.

Follow up Training Day was agreed at the Training day on 6.10.89,
which will involve Dr Popper, West Midlands Police, social workers
and the Hillsborough Family Support Group. This will take one person
3_4 weeks to arrange;  this is much less time than was allocated for
the Training Day on 6.10.89 because we now have a lot of information
which we did not have available to us before.

The Task team members will need to meet regularly to discuss the
progress of the inquest. This will involve members still within the
team and those who have returned to other worksites. The meetings will
need to increase in frequency as the inquest approaches. The duration
of the meeting should be 1^ hours per month, increasing to lj hours
per week. This does not allow time for any special meetings that may
need to be called.

Planning meetings will need to take place between team members and
Liverpool workers and H.F.S.G. members. These .may involve travelling to
Liverpool, each meeting may therefore require 7 hours.

Organisation of duty rotas to cover the inquest. This will involve
the recruitment of extra staff and decisions will need to be made
about the number and type of support workers required - it is difficult
to estimate how much work this will involve.

The Task Team will need to plan how they will co-ordinate the Inquest
and this will involve discussion and meetings which will increase in
frequency and duration as the inquest approaches.
2


It is very difficult at this stage to estimate the amount of work that
will be involved in the preparation for the Inquest because we do not
know the type of Inquest that we will be dealing with, and we have
never co-ordinated support at an inquest before.

An indication of planning time for this can be gleaned from examining
planning time for the Liverpool v Wednesday match. Despite being only
a one day event, this has required a variety of work over the past
3 week period totalling over 40 hours work and there remains a
substantial amount of work yet to be done.

According to                      who co-ordinated the Kings Cross
Inquest, planning for an inquest following a major disaster is extremely
time-consuming and should not be underestimated. There is at least
2 months' solid work required prior to the Inquest and a necessity to
maintain regular communication with bereaved families, solicitors, the
Coroner, the Police and witnesses,for many months prior to the Inquest.




16.11.89
 LIAI S O N WIT H S.W.F.C.

  Liaison with S.W.F.C. has been necessary to arrange visits to the ground
  and to plan for significant events. Relationships with the club are at
  a point now where work with an increasing number of staff at the ground
  is considered possible. They now understand the role of the Task Team
  and how we may meet their needs. The staff there are particularly
- sensitive to key events such as the match on the 29th, the second report
  from Lord Justice Taylor, the Anniversary and the regular visits by
  bereaved ana injured. It is not known as yet how many individuals
  may need ongoing support but social worker time does need to be available
  to continue building relationships with individuals at the club on a
  face to face basis, e.g. a social worker will be with the club's
  receptionist while she deals with the public on the 29 th November
  as she has expressed anxieties about the reactions of Liverpool fans on
  that day.

 Liaison at the moment is taking more than 2 hours per week, but it is
 strongly believed that the time required to respond to the needs of
 staff will increase now that individual needs are being openly
 acknowledged.
 EDUCATION PROJECT


 The Task Team has been planning to facilitate the development of links
 between Sheffield, Liverpool and Nottingham's educational institutions.
 We believe that it is important to include the children of these cities
 in joint work following on from links that were established through the
"Hillsborough disaster. At a meeting of Chief Officers of Education in
 July, it was acknowledged by Sheffield headteachers that they wish their
 schools to be involved in developing links with Liverpool and Nottingham
 schools.

 Unfortunately, due to the pressure of other work, it has not been
 possible to engage in further discussions with the Education Department.
 This project remains to be started and will therefore require a
 substantial amount of work, e.g.

 (1)   Meetings with local headteachers to discuss favoured projects.
 (2)   Liaision with Education Departments in Liverpool and Nottingham.
 (3)   The facilitating of joint educational activities, e.g. exhibitions
       of artwork from children of all three authorities, exchanges of
       Atn year work experience students between the three cities, joint
       sporting events, etc.

 This work is likely to be intensive initially and a lot of the groundwork
 will have to be undertaken by the Task Team to assist the setting up of
 the projects, after which time the Education departments of the three
 cities will assume overall control.

 This work will involve numerous telephone calls, letters, meetings to
 be arranged and interviews with Education Dept, staff in the three cities.
 After the first few months, when the work will be intensive, it will be
 possible to reduce the amount of work providing that the projects are
 getting under way and there are no holdups or hitches.
 THE ANNIVERSARY


  This work will begin in earnest in the New Year, although some
  foundation work is being done now in connection with planning for the
  match on the 29th November. Liaison will need to take place between
  Sheffield Wednesday F.C., Police, local churches and organisations
' and social workers in Liverpool and surrounding authorities. As
  with the 29th, extra volunteers will need to be recruited, briefed
  and then debriefed after the event.

 It is extremely difficult to estimate the work that will be necessary
 because of the Anniversary. However, as a team, we have spent well
 in excess of    AO  hours in joint planning for the 29th and at least
 a further 20 hours is anticipated. We expect the anniversary to be much
 more demanding.
FAMILY & COMMUNITY SERVICES


As stated in the F & CS Services Development Committee report dated
10.5.89 we believe that the Task Team has a specific role in relation
to F & CS staff in terms of providing counselling and support.

The impact of the disaster on F & CS staff was significant and a need
for a follow up review is necessary. This is not only the opinion of
the Task Team; many of the F & CS workers that we come into contact
with feel strongly that a review should take place (and is already
overdue). Also, research on disaster work has established that this
is good practice.

A thorough review of staff by the Task Team would serve two purposes

We are aware that some F & CS staff are still in contact with families
ana individuals that they met at the disaster and during the following
weeks. A review would enable us to locate these workers and offer them
 advice, information and support.

The Review would highlight any need or desire for counselling amongst
F & CS staff following their experience at Hillsborough.

Reviews of the staff involved would take a considerable amount of time
given the numbers of staff involved (it is well over 100 people).
There is the possibility of well over 200 hours work involved.

IF a member of staff requested counselling they should be given a
choice of whom they wish to fulfil this role. The Task Team should be
included in this choice because of the specialist knowledge that we
have accumulated. It could be anticipated that counselling sessions
might be required on a fortnightly basis; each interview taking
between one and two hours. IF only 10 staff requested counselling,
this would result in 7-10 hours per week counselling time.

We believe that the team also has another role in relation to F & CS
members. This involves the passing on of information. It has been
brought to the attention of the team that F & CS staff know little
about the work of the team and requests are frequently being mace for
information. In response to this, the team should be visiting major
worksites and keeping the Department fully informed of the work that
we are undertaking - this work would take 3 hours per week ofone
worker's time.

Total work required for above.

(1)              Review - 200 hours or more over 3 months - 16? per week.

(2)              Counselling - depends on the number of people
                  requesting it.

(3)               Information giving - 3 hours per week.
We argue that a need still exists in Sheffield and that it is still
possible that those in need will seek assistance. This requires a
team working pro-actively in the community and alongside other
"professionals.

 Consideration must be given to the support needed by workers. At
 present, this happens within the team. One social workers, even with
"supervision, would be isolated and inadequately supported.
THE ANNIVERSARY

This work will begin in earnest in the New Year, although some
foundation work is being done now in connectimr with planning for the
match on the 29th November. Liaison will need to take place between
Sheffield Wednesday F.C., Police, local churches and organisations
and social workers in Liverpool and surrounding authorities. As
with the 29th, extra volunteers will need to be recruited, briefed
and then debriefed after the event.

It is extremely difficult to estimate the work that will be necessary
because of the Anniversary. However, as a team, we have spent well
in excess of        hours in joint planning for the 29th and at least
a further 20 hours is anticipated. We expect the anniversary to be much
more demanding.
EDUCATION PROJECT

The Task Team has1 been planning to facilitate the development of links
between Sheffield, Liverpool and Nottingham’s educational institutions.
We believe that it is important to include the childeen of these cities
in joint work following on from links that were established through the
Hillsborough disaster. At a meeting of Chief Officers of Education in
July, it was acknowledged by Sheffield headteachers that they wish their
schools to be involved in developing links with Liverpool and Nottingham
schools.

Unfortunately, due to the pressure of other work, it has not been
possible to engage in further discussions with the Education Department.
This project remains to be started and will therefore require a
substantial amount of work, e.g.

(1)   Meetings with local headteachers to discuss favoured projects.
(2)   Liaision with Education Departments in Liverpool and Nottingham.
(3)   The facilitating of joint educational activities, e.g. exhibitions
      of artwork from children of all three authorities, exchanges of
      4th year work experience students between the three cities, joint
      sporting events, etc.

This work is likely t be intensive initially and a lot of the groundwork
will have to be undertaken by the Task Team to assist the setting up of
the projects, after whichgtime the Education departments of the three
cities will assume overall control.

This work will involve numerous telephone calls, letters, meetings to
be arranged and interviews with Education Dept, staff in the three cities.
After the first few months, when the work will be intensive, it.will be
possible to reduce the amount of work providing that the projects are
getting under way and there are no holdups or hitches.
LIAISON WITH S.W.F.C.

Liaison with S.W.F.C. has been necessary to arrange visits to the ground
and to plan for significant events. Relationships with the club are at
a point now where work with an increasing number of staff at the ground
is considered possible. They now understand the role of the Task Team
and how we may meet their needs. The staff there are particularly
sensitive to key events such as the match on the 29th, the second report

Liaison at the moment is taking more than 2 hours per week, but it is
strongly believed that the time required to respond to the needs of
staff will increase now that individual needs are being openly

 HILLSBQBOOSH TASK TEAM

 Following your interest in this natter and the meeting with team members
-we thought it would be useful to keep you informed or natters since the
 last meeting of the Service Development Sub Committee.

 Paul Walton has prepared an alternative report for the Sub Committee
 which, as you will probably realise, is based almost entirely on the
 report drawn up by the team members in response to his original very
 negative report*

He have met twice with management with a view to negotiating a tine-
table for winding down the teams activities. At the first meeting we
tabled a proposal which is as followst

     3 social workers and 2 admin staff to remain in post until the
     end of January.

     2 social workers and 1 admin worker to remain in post from
     February until the end of April.

Discussions to take place during April to consider the form of the
continued existence of the task team until the inquest.

In proposing this we raised the following points*

1.   We accepted the Admin Assistant post would not be replaced at
     any stage.

2.   We acknowledged that the cover for Paul Walton's post is due
     to leave at the beginning of December and we therefore accept
     that Paul should return to Division 5 and we suggested dis­
     cussions could take place with managers on Division 2 about
     supervision arrangements from there.

3.   We suggested that a monthly review of the level of activities
     should take place from a time in January after the next public
     meeting in order to judge whether the proposed staffing levels
     were appropriate.

Dan Perks asked us to provide additional information to justify our
proposals which we did and which is attached.

We in turn asked for information which was U3ed to Justify management's
proposal that the teams should be reduced from 1 social worker and 1
Admin worker from the beginning of December, two days after the first
visit of Liverpool Football Club to Hillsborough since the disaster.



                                              continued
  we have now received a document from management which provides In their
  view the Justification for their position as at mid-September. As you
  probably understand this isn’t of much value to the discussions we are
  trying to conclude in mid-November about the timetable especially as Dan
  and Paul suggested that new information has come to light which has
  affected their assessment. We don't know what information has arisen
• ^ c h wasn't previously available to than and they still appear to take
  the view that the winding down should take place from the 1st December.

 At the second meeting Dan didn’t comment on either our proposed time­
 table or our Justification because he said ha hadn’t had time to study
 the latter. In response to our concerns about the mounting uncertainties
 he conceded that it would be technically difficult to affect the December
 1st winding down and agreed that the status quo should continue until the
 end of December. This was not in any way an acknowledgement of the
 arguments about workload or service delivery, but simply an expedient to
 deal with a technical problem.

 Dan then proposed we meet to discuss our proposals on Tuesday 28th
 November, the day b efore the Sheffield Wednesday - Liverpool game!

 So in summary*

    (i)   Service Development Sub Committee will be receiving a report,
          essentially written by members of the team in response to
          Paul's original very negative report.

  (ii)    Halgo has tabled proposals for a timetable for a phased
          reduction in activities linked to key events like the 29th
          November game. The public meeting in January and the anniversary
          on Easter Sunday.

 (iil)    Halgo has produced a document detailing the anticipated future
          workloads Justifying their proposed timetable.

  (iv)    Management has produced a document which attempts to Justify
          their views on the reduction lnt he service as at the middle
          of September. None of the times quoted in this document were
          discused with memb ers of the team.

As you might guess from this memo, I have very serious concerns about
 the way these managers have handled this whole issue, in the way they
have failed to undertake even the most basic managerial functions of
consultation with staff. For a team whose function was essentially a
very sensitive and caring one, Paul and Dan have demonstrated a
singular lack of sensitivity of care in their handling of the Issue of
winding down the team. We are giving some serious consideration to how
we can deal with this deep felt grievance, but in the meantime we felt
you should be aware of the continuing commitment of the team to work
positively and proactively in this very difficult and f W m r H n g a ^ a
of work.

We feel that at least some members of the sub Committee should be aware
of our view of the events as they are unfolding and not just those views
which will be expressed by management at the meeting.

A further report was requested on the 26th October, 1989 by the Development
& Building Sub-Committee on the work of the Team.


2.      Background


The Team was set up following a report to Programme Committee on 10th Hay,
1989.     The primary objective was to undertakd work with Sheffield residents.
The secondary objective was to support Liverpool Social Services.              The
Team's establishment was 3 social workers, 3 clerks, an Administrative
Assistant and a Team Leader.        A senior clinical psychologist is attached
to the Team from Sheffield Area Health Authority.


3.     The Work of the Team


The Team has undertaken a wide range of work:


3.1     Individual Referrals


Over 50 referrals have been received. Some of these people simply required
reassurance about the effects of the disaster on them, whilst. 27 required
casework assistance.      Common problems have been depression, irritability,
nightmares, inability to sleep and flashbacks to the disaster.              For those
who were on the Leppings Lane terraces, a fear of crowds is common.


Team members are currently working with 11 individuals on a one to one
counselling basis.      These include survivors, a bereaved person, rescuers,
stewards, helpers and the partners of some of these peep1?.


3.2    Groupwork


One team member has been working over a three months period with Sheffield
Wednesday F.C. Stewards who were on duty during the disaster. A gropp of
2


approximately 10 Stewards have met footnightly.     Several other Stewards
are in touch with them.      They began as a therapeutic group helping the
Stewards to come to terms with their experience.     This is still an important
element, but the focus of the group has shifted to look at the conditions
under which Stewards are employed and to build lintcs with stewards and
supporters from Liverpool.      This has been important in order to overcone
their fears of animosity or blame being attached to them by survivors and
Liverpool fans.


3.3   Community Work


Contact has been established with residents in the Leppings Lane trigngle.
A residents' group-'.is now in the process of forming as a result of this
work. The group is now pressing for improvements to the quality of life
in their area by negotiating with S.W.F.C., fcne Police and the City Council
to provide better facilities.          Group held a very successful public
meeting chaired by Councillor Helen Jackson in early October, which was
attended by approximately 90 pepple.      Contact has also been made with a
local Traders' group who have erected a memorial stone to those who died.
The Task Team has been instrumental in linking these Traders with the
Liverpool Survivors' Group.      This work has highlighted the importance of
forging links between the two communities.


3.4   Visits to the Ground


Over 30 visits, involving 89 people, have been made to the ground since
July, principally by bereaved and survivors from the Liverpool area.         Tor
the bereaved, these visits have been extremely important. They have
allowed many to see the place where their relative or friend died.         It must
be appreciated that this is particularly important when a friend or
relative is last seen fit and healthy, but then suddenly disappears from
one's life.   Coming to terms with a loss in these circumstances is
especially hard, and a visit to the scene of the disaster has therefore
been particulal^yvaiuLuable.     For survivors, it has been important in
helping them to simply understand what happened to them.      There will be
more of this work in the future. For many people, months must pass before
thgedesire to return to the ground is matched by the emotional strengtn
to do so.
3


3.5   Publicity


Preventative mental health work was an original purpose of the project.
A substantial effort on this took place in July and August by producing
and distributing publicity and literature about the team and it s work,
and to reassure members of the public about the feelings which followed
their experience,    Specific material was produced for local communities,
health workers and the general public.    As sell as leaflets, the local
press and radio were used. This work has now come to an end. Future
pbblicity will be concerned with specific events such as the first occasion
that the Liverpool team return to Sheffield, fehe Inquest and the anniversary
of the disaster.    These can be used to continue to inform the public of
the availability of help.


2.6   Attending Matches


Members of the team attended the Sheffield Wednesday v Sverton match in
September, and will attend the Liverpool v Sheffield Wednesday match in
November to assist any distressed individuals.


3.7   Liaison with S.W.F.6.


Regular liaison with S.W.F.C. management has been necessary on a number
of issues such as access to the ground for t K bereaved and injured, services
available at football matches and arranging meetings between S.W.F.C. and
the ground’s stewards.


3.8   Liaison with Liverpool City Council and other Local Authorities


Close links have been maintained in order to answer enquiries such as who
rescued a particular survivor, or which helper was involved with a survivor
on the day of the tragedy.


Administrative staff on their own dealt with enquiries like this between
April and July (when the Task Team was established) by using the computer
facilities they developed at that time and have since maintained.
Liaison has also occurred on matters such as visits to the ground, sharing
helping techniques, and planning the provision of future services.
4


3.9    Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry


The work of the inqutty was monitored in order to offer help to those
witnesses giving evidence who were distressed.      At the Inquiry, volunteer
counsellors were present.


3.10   Co-Ordination


It has been important to co-ordinate the TatefesTeam’s effort with that, of
other agencies such as Occupational Health workers, voluntary groups, and
the local clergy. A Steering Group has now been established for the Team
with representatives on it from the churches, voluntary organisations, the
Area Health Authority and Sheffield Wednesday F.C.


3.11   Coroner’s Inquest Training


A St’jHy Day was organised by the Team for social workers working with
bereaved, primarily from the Liverpool area, but also from other parts of
the country, in preparation for the Inquest.     Representatives from the
Family Support Group, a self-help group formed by the bereaved, also
attended.


3.12   Area Health Authority Survey


The Areai:Health Authority has undertaken a survey into the effectiveness
of the support that was offered to staff involved in the aftermath of :he
disaster.


Team members offered advice in the compilation of the Survey and administrative
support has been given.      A commitment has been given to accept any referrals
generated by this survey.      The final results of this survey will not be
known for some months, as the scope fo the survey is being extended to
staff at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.


3.13   Miscellaneous Tasks


Staff in other Departments have been debriefed.     This inoolved bringing
people together in groups in order to allow them to talk about their
experiences, actions and feelings in a structured, planned and guided way.
5


This is a specialised technique   which research    has   shown   to   be effective
in preventing future mental health problems.       Other tasks have included
copying and distributing video material presented to the Taylor Inquiry,
giving casework advice to other F & CS staff and liaison with Sheffield
Education Department.


4.    Comment on the Work Undertaken


$.1   Immediately following the disaster, there was a need for counselling
services which was met by the Helpline and voluntary agencies.             & 24 hour

Helpline was established for a short period.       This number received many
calls from Sheffield people, some offering help erdasking for help for
Liverpool citizens that they had met.    This need quickly declined and
subsequent referrals to the Task Team have tended to be from people who
experienced severe and direct exposure to the disaster, and continued
to suffer distress as a result.


The presence and publicity generated by the Team has hopefully had a
reassuring effect on individuals.    Maybe as a result of these factors, we
have not experienced an overwhelming number of requests for one to one
or group counselling as was originally anticipated.         However, it should be
noted that offers of assistance to the largest group of front line personnel
involved in the disaster, the Police, have not been accepted.             It is
believed that a substantial number of Police officers remainsseriously
affected.   Few referrals have been received from the other rescue services.
This may be due to effective help having been offered at an early stage.
Alternatively, cultural and organisational factors may have prevented
people seeking help as yet.    In the future, individuals who were affec;ed
by the tragedy who do not resolve that experience may well absorb these
problems into their general life and might have to have them ’unpicked' by
non-specialist staff later, when it will be much more difficult.


4.2   It is particularly noteworthy that the Team has been able to use a
range of approaches in respondig to the aftermath of the disaster.                Individual
casework, group work and community work techniques have been adopted with
success.    The Coroner's Inquest Study Day required organisational skills.
6


4.2   In summary, it is clear that   essential   and   effective   work has been
done with seriously distressed individuals and groups who would not
otherwise have been helped.     Hoepfully, the residents’ action group will
be firmly established and continue to press for positive improvements in
the area.


It is important that all this work is continued.


5.    Future Heeds


Specialist resources will need to remain in order to undertake the following
tasks;-


5.1   Continujfig existing work with individuals


This is demanding, specialist work which requires experienced staff wi'r-h
existing knowledge.


5.2   Hew Referrals]


The Area Health Authority Survey could result in new referrals.          To a targe
extent, the number of new referrals obtained will depend on the degree to
which the Team is pro-active.     New referrals may also be generated by
future significant events, e.g. the match on ^9th November.


5.3   Group Work


The work with the Stewards will need to be maintained.


5.4   Community Work


The Residents' meeting should be followed up by staff assisting this group
to build on their success, and press for the improvements in community
facilities and policing that they are seeking.


5.5   Liaison with S.W.F.C.


This work should focus on continuing to ensure good access to the ground for
bereaved and injured, and planning for the Liverpool v Sheffield Wednesday
game on 29th November.
 7


 5.6     The Anniversary

 Preparation for this event will involve continuing liaison, planning and
 co-ordinating with Liverpool, S.W.F.C., the bereaved and their support
 agencies.


 5.7     Liaison with Liverpool and other Local Authorities


 Specific enquiries will be received, joint work during visits to the ground
will be necessary and joint planning for future events will be needed.


 5.8     Liaison with Education Department


 This work has yet to be started.    It is envisaged that the Team can be
 instrumental in encouraging positive links between the young people of
 Liverpool, Sheffield and Nottingham.


 5.9     Coroner's Inquest


 A range of social work tasks will be required to be performed, before,
 during and after the Inquest.    It is difficult to predmct the extent o"
 this at this stage, though Sheffield residents will be involved.     It will
 be necessary to maintain liaison with the Coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, to
 assess the level of staffing required to provide support at the Inquest.


 6.0     Conclusion


 The presence and work of the Team has been important in helping the ci:izenas
. of Sheffield adjust to fehe Hillsborough Disaster.   That work needs to
 continue and there needs to be the ability to flexibly respond to future


Ievents and any increase in work.    Currently, deaft proposals are being
 discussed about the monitoring of future work and the mechanism to be used
ito recall original team members should this be necessary.     Negotiations are
 also currently taking place on the scheduling of the reduction in team
 size.    It is expected that a reduced team will remain based at Hillsborough
 Library and this will assist in terms of the links that the team has
 already established with individuals and the community.      It is in the area
 of community focused work, whilst retaining the ability to respond to
 individual needs that future effort might be directed.

             HILLSBOROUGH TASK TEAM

             I wish to confirm the major items discussed in our meeting of
             19 January 1990 at which I believe an accord was reached on future
             working and an eventual cessation of the team's activities.

             In terms of a timetable the team would comprise two social
             workers and one administrative post as from 1 February 1990.
             It was fairly clear thatl             ~~lwould take up a post
             on Division 7 at that date and thus effect the social work
             reduction of one post on the task team. It is not yet clear
             on the staff move which will reduce the administrative team
             by one, however, the fall back position would be that
             Mai Hobson returns to her substantive post on Division 2.
             The team's activities will cease on 4 May 1990.

             Management did provide a summary of the case load for our
             meeting on 19 January 1990. This showed a much reduced workload
             for the team but the trade union produced a paper with a three
             point summary of other work which had been identified. These
             were:-

             1   Preparation of plans for the Department's resposse/activities
                 to the inquest.

             2   Planning the social work involvement in the anniversary.—

             3   Producing a written account of the team's activities and an
                 evaluation of its impact.

             There was some discussion of these point. In particular it was not
             clear that item 1 could be done in a very formal manner. It was
             acknowledged in relation to item 3 that the trade union had drawn
             attention to seme type of staff turnover phenomenon in the case of
             workers dealing with disasters. This might require further work
             as part of the evaluation process. However, at this stage the
             precise nature of the problem was not clear.

             At the end of the meeting I raised the position of two named
             individuals, one of whom would very likely require redeployment
             after 12 months service as a temporary worker and the other who is
             on secondment from Todwick. In the former case 12 months service was to be
             reached on 4 May 1990 and redeployment will occur unless this staff
             member obtains another job by his own initiative before then. In
             the latter case there is an excellent chance that a further field
             social work post might be identified on the basis of recent turnover
             trends. I therefore propose to see both individuals in the near
             _a .____
             future     \__
                    to progress their cases.

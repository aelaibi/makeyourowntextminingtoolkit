Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan
which has been passed to this department in view of our
responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I
apologise for the delay in replying to you.

T!!?nV OU for-,fxPressing your concern over the cost of
introducing all seated accommodation at football league
grounds, particularly those in the lower divisions.   However
it mioht i S i S n Y th6Se ClubS may not be quite 30 severe 'as
                   seem* As ^ou may be aware the Chancellor
announced in the recent Budget that the government would be
P?nnCin?ithe S°°iS b6tting tax thereforemaking SvaSable
£100 million to the football industry over the next five
         £7? S ? l tba11 TrUSL SXPeCtS              Provide c S S i £ £        a
almost £2 6 mTl"!    °V6^ 5® n6Xt ten ^ears' in addition to
 lmost £26 million provided each year by television and pools
companies    Consequently there is a considerable amoSnt of
improvements &      footba11 clubs    make the necessary ground

thf^rtherKreason for the cost incurred by the clubs being less
™    n3ay         expected is that current attendances at many
   S t S ?rS WB        below the maximum capacity of the ground
s S l s c a i e e J S 1CT            in     F in a l R e p o r t,9??™ a
small scale redevelopment possibly involving only part of th^
ground, might be sufficient in some cases.                     P

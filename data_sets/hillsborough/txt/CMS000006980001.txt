          REVIEW OF ALL SEATING REQUIREMENT AT FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS

          As you know responsibility for the safety of sports grounds in
          England and Wales is being transferred to my Department from the
          Home Office. I have been considering the terms of a review of the
          all-seating requirement at Football League grounds in England and
          Wales in the light of the many representations advocating such a
          review, including from the All-Party Football Committee.

          I have come to the view that it would be right to make a public
          announcement now on the terms of a review to remove some of the
          press speculation about its scope and the damaging uncertainty
          which this has created in football. The issues are such that it
          will take a few weeks yet, however, before we are able to
          announce the outcome of the review.

          During the election campaign the Prime Minister made clear that
          he would consider dropping the requirement at Third and Fourth
          Division grounds in the Football League, but that he was not
          prepared to give way on the central recommendations for the First
          and Second Divisions. The attached draft announcement reflects
          the Prime Minister's reported views with the minor qualification
          that in reviewing the policy for all-seating at Third and Fourth
          Division grounds I will need to ensure that no anomalies are
          created with respect to the Second Division clubs in view of the
          low level of average attendances at some of these grounds.
          Although I also intend to examine the timetable for the Second
          Division Clubs, any public announcement at this stage that the
          August 1994 deadline might be extended for any or all of those
          clubs would undermine the progress which is being made by some
          clubs to achieve it.

          Among the related issues which need to be addressed are the scope
          of the remit of the Football Licensing Authority, whether
          transitional arrangements are necessary for clubs which are

                                                                                         1
promoted and, if standing accommodation is to retained, whether
the FLA needs new powers to require terracing to be brought up to
a sufficient standard.

Subject to your views and those of other interested colleagues on
the draft text, I would then clear the announcement with the
Prime Minister. Although drafted as an answer to an inspired PQ,
assuming it can be cleared quickly, I would aim to make the
announcement next week in the form of a letter to Tom Pendry and
a Press Release. In view of my safety responsibilities for Wales
as well as England, I would be grateful if you could confirm that
you are content, after the announcement, for my officials to
consult relevant organisations in Wales. I hope to consult you
and other colleagues on the outcome of the review before the
summer recess.

I am writing in similar terms to Kenneth Clarke, in view of the
possible fire safety and public order implications, and Ian Lang
who I understand is considering whether a similar review should
be carried out for First and Second Division clubs in the
Scottish Football League. I would be grateful for your views by
close this Friday if possible.

           REVIEW OF ALL SEATING REQUIREMENT AT FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS

           As you know responsibility for the safety of sports grounds in
           England and Wales is being transferred to my Department from the
           Home Office. I have been considering the terms of a review of the

           Wales in the light of the many representations advocating such a
           review, including from the All-Party Football Committee. In view
           of the possible implications for Scotland I would be grateful for
           your advice on whether it should be a joint review from the
           outset.

           I have come to the view that it would be right to make a public
           announcement now on the terms of a review to remove some of the
           press speculation about its scope and the damaging uncertainty
           which this has created in football. The issues are such that it
           will take a few weeks yet, however, before we are able to
           announce the outcome of the review.

           During the election campaign the Prime Minister made clear that
           he would consider dropping the requirement at Third and Fourth
           Division grounds in the Football League, but that he was not

           clubs to achieve it.


                                                                                         1

of the remit of the Football Licensing Authority, whether
transitional arrangements are necessary for clubs which are
promoted and, if standing accommodation is to retained, whether
the FLA needs new powers to require terracing to be brought up to
a sufficient standard.

The announcement is drafted on the basis of a possible joint
review. It takes account of what I understand to be Sir Hector
Monro1s position that if there is to be a review in Scotland it
should be restricted to the First and Second Division clubs and
that the Scottish Stadia Committee would first be consulted on
the principle of such a review. If the review is to be extended
in this way, I would naturally be grateful for your advice on the
points of principle raised above in so far as they are relevant
to Scotland.

Subject to your views and those of other interested colleagues on
the draft text, I would then clear the announcement with the
Prime Minister. Although drafted as an answer to an inspired PQ,
assuming it can be cleared quickly, I would aim to make the
announcement next week in the form of a letter to Tom Pendry and
a Press Release. I hope that we can make a joint announcement on
the outcome of the review by the summer recess.

I am writing in similar terms to Kenneth Clarke, in view of the
possible fire safety and public order implications, and David
Hunt. I would be grateful for your views by close this Friday if
possible.

           REVIEW OF ALL SEATING REQUIREMENT AT FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS

           Following the decision to transfer responsibility for the safety
           of sports grounds in England and Wales from your Department to
           mine, and the correspondence between Kenneth Baker and yourself
           before the election, I have been considering the terms of a
           review of the all-seating requirement at Football League grounds
           in England and Wales. In view of the expertise which your
           Department still retains in this matter and the possible
           implications for fire safety and public order, I thought it
           helpful to give you an opportunity to comment on the terms of the
           proposed review before any announcement is made.

           I have come to the view that it would be right to make a public
           announcement now on the terms of a review to remove some of the
           press speculation about its scope and the damaging uncertainty
           which this has created in football. The issues are such that it
           will take a few weeks yet, however, before we are able to
           announce the outcome of the review.

           During the election campaign, as you know, the Prime Minister
           made clear that he would consider dropping the requirement at
           Third and Fourth Division grounds in the Football League, but
           that he was not prepared to give way on the central
           recommendations for the First and Second Divisions. The attached
           draft announcement reflects the Prime Minister's reported views
           with the minor qualification that in reviewing the policy for
           all-seating at Third and Fourth Division grounds we will need to
           ensure that no anomalies are created with respect to the Second
           Division clubs in view of the low level of average attendances at
           some of these grounds. Although I also intend to examine the
           timetable for the Second Division Clubs, any public announcement
           at this stage that the August 1994 deadline might be extended for
           any or all of those clubs would undermine the progress which is
           being made by some clubs to achieve it.

                                                                                         1

of the remit of the Football Licensing Authority, whether

announcement next week in the form of a letter to Tom Pendry and
a Press Release. I hope to consult you and other colleagues on
the outcome of the review before the summer recess. In the
meantime I have asked my officials to liaise with yours on the
fire safety and public order side to identify the issues in which
your Department has an interest.

I am writing in similar terms to Ian Lang who I understand is
considering whether a similar review should be carried out for
First and Second Division clubs in the Scottish Football League,
and David Hunt. I am copying this letter to Sir Robin Butler. I
would be grateful for your views by close this Friday if
possible.

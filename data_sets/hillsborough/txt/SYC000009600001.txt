    applies, it is suggested that one o f the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re

     (In any o f the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:

     C.D. died as the result o f an accident/misadventure.

     C.D. was killed lawfully.

         Dear Sirs,

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.



         If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
         of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
         on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the C o r oners’ Act 1988 and the C o r oners’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.     I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite          to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in    the matter, I am writing to                       you
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

         May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
         attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for consideration is nothing more than    that, and that    thedecision as
         to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

         I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
         heard from you by                      I will assume you have no names to
         submit

         Yours faithfully,

 Dear Dr Popper

 RE:   BARRY S BENNETT DECEASED

 I have recently been consulted Mr Bennett's former wife Patricia on
 behalf of herself and Mr Bennet's daughter             ~| m.y client has
 previously been represented by Messrs Goldsmiths of Liverpool but she
 wishes me to take over conduct of all matter arising as a result of
 her former husband's death and I have agreed to do so.

 I have written to Messrs Goldsmiths for the papers but anticipated
 may be several days before they     arrive, my client is anxious to see
 a copy of the Post-Mortem Report on  her former husband and she understands
 that Messrs Goldsmiths may not have  approached you for this.

 Could I please have a copy subject to the usual terms and conditions.

Dear        Sirs,

Re* E6SHT S. EEEiNETT (deceased) No.08,

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not*to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M. Coroner.

        Bear Sirs,

        You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
        reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when, they are
        in fact put in as evidence.

        However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
        and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
        I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
        I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
        report of your client(s).

        The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

              a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                      subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                      they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

              b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                      conselling of the deceased’s relatives or for proper
                      legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
                      in which solicitors may be engaged.

              c.      Subject to ih&-;afe§v§, they are to be kept confidential until
                      they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

        I have your request for the.post mortem report to hand in respect
        of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
        assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
        each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
        above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
        I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any.
        reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
        the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

        The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is ^        per sheet (total £ }.(&
        Please make your cheques payable to the Cits’- of Sheffield.

        Yours faithfully,

I have been asked to forward a copy of the post mortem

As you know from previous correspondence, I am prepared
to release this document to you on the terms thati-

           a.      the post mortem report is treated as provisional
                   and subject to amendment and alteration until
                   such time as it is given or produced in evidence
                   at the Inquest.

           b.      That it is used only for the purposes of
                   bereavement counselling, or for proper
                   legitimate purposes in connection with any
                   legal proceedings in which solicitors may be
                   engaged.

            c.     Subject to this, it is to be kept confidential.

You have already confirmed in another case that you are prepared
to accept the post mortem report on these conditions, and I
therefore enclose a copy in this case as well.

If for some reason this is not acceptable to you, would you
please return it to me.

Yours sincerely,

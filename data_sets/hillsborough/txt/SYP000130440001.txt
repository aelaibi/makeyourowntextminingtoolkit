                 On      14th April      1989       (140489?,      I a t t e n d e d a briefing at H i l l s b o r o u g h

                 above.       During         that   briefing       I recollect             that m e nt io n was made         by one

Ipriefed by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G R E E N W O O D .      I n the   course       o + that .far i ef i ng       1_

can    c o n f irm that m e n ti o n was made and                i nstruction given that             no

Liverpool       supp o r t e rs a dm it t ed to the S pion Kop end of                      the ground on

N o t t i n g h a m Forest     tickets,        w ould be t r a n s feree to the L ep pinqs Lane                      e nd

GREENWOOD.         Those L i verpoo l           fans wit h tickets          for that        end of the

g r o u n d w ou l d be    retained          in the t r iangular       area on the Kop for                the

period of the g a m e .

Although       I can rerriemb'er this             in s t r uc ti on being given by S u p e r i nt e nd e nt

GREENWOOD       I am u nf or t un a te l y        unable      to say whether           it was    related        to

crowd safety and. the               p r evention of ove r cr ow di ng or to do with

s e g r e g a t i o n and violent         c o nf r on ta ti on or a c ombination of both because

of the time         that     has    elapsed since           the occasion.

I have     p r eviously        performed duty on F di visi on and so                       r e g u 1a t i y po a i ceU

football      m a t c h e s at H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium.        Because         of this e xperience              i

am aware      of the        incident         that took      place    in 1981 /'IspOQOSi) at a cup

s emi-final       which      involved         crowd disorder         and sorfid injuries           in the S outh

West    terrace       of L e pp in gs Lane.              In fact    this    incident was as           I recall

mentioned       by the officer               I p reviously m en t io n ed       in his      dealing with

the    need to moni t o r          the volume           of the    crowd at all         times    to ensure

public     safety during            the      briefing.        I now believe        that     officer       to be

Superintendent            GREENWOOD.

I also a t t e n d e d the full              briefing      by Chief S up e ri n te n de n t D U CK EN FI EL D

match.       Although        I am sure         that      crowd safety was touched on by Chief

Superintendent            D U C K E N F I E L D , but    I am unable       to be more       specific       because

of the     period that           has    elap se d since          the occasion.

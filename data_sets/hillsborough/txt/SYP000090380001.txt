              matc he s as         possible.



               I purchased my ticket              from Anfield,           being a season ticket         holder,

               paying £ 6 . 0 0 for the L ep pings Lane               standing area.

          traffic delays            on the     jour           near    the end of the M&3 Motorway.                    This

          was due to the sheer                vclume     of traffic



          We a r r iv ed at our d e s t i na ti on at approx.                  1415 hours        (1415)    & parked

          the    car near         some w a re ho us es    just off the A61 & opposite Fox Hill.                             We

          then w alked the short               journey to the ground,                 a distance     of about         1/2

          (half)       mile.       There were      no    police       officers        giving   directions,          but

          there was a police                presence     in t h e / S t r e e t s .   En route we saw various

          supporters,          ma in ly from Liver^ooly^ d y i n k i n g/ fr om            cans.     The y were

          all    very good humoured.               There W a s        no\dj^«mkenness o r         fighting.



          We a r r i ve d at the           entrance     to the ground at ah                                    4,1430)

          but did not go d ir ec tl y             into the ground as we had a r r a n g e d                to meet a

          f ri en d outside.           We w ai t e d for about 20 m inutes <1 during                    this    time we

          saw a lot of s upporters arrive,                      but to me there did not appear                      to be

          too m uch of a problem.                 The only thing           to stand efu.t        in my min d was

          made       our way to the turnstiles.                  We      fated until       the       ficers on

               climb out of the             crowd & over the           root    of the turnstiles.               I think

              the    very young          fans who      gained entry to the ground this way were

              a s si s t e d    into the ground          in order      that    they would not be             crushed

              outside.            There were        other     fans $jot in the same way,                who,    in my

              opinion,          probably did not have            tiekfets.

              Once     inside         the ground     I saw no signs di recting me /                        ''mat ch

              v iewing         position.         Other   than a white          placard w

              This     posed me no problem as                 I have a tt en d e d this g

              previous          occasions,       including      the    1988    (000088)

              knew e xactly where              to go.



              I e ntered the ground via the tunnel                       leara^x\<{ to Jfne         central     pens.

              I saw a s teward by the tunnel,                    but    no one ers& T"         I had free

              passage along             into the     central     pens where         I took     up the      position         I

              have m ar ked on the             plan G S / 1     is soon as we were in position I had the

              feeling          that    something w a s H ^ r p n g .    It was      not normal.         I was still

              stood with both of my friends & we all                           had diff ic ul ty keeping              our

              feet.       The     crowd ar ou nd us was e x t r em el y tight.                 We    could not move             in
                                                                               \

              f orth several            times.      X would not        say the      crowd surged forward,                the

              pressure          in the     pens just      increased.          The   time would be just after 3pm

               (1500)     as the teams had just                kicked off.          S h or tl y after      kick-off         the

              pressure          seemed to ease ar ou nd us.              This happened several                 times,

              during which,             I, my brother &                   a s s i s t e d fans out of the.

              so mething wrong,          but he also appeared,                 like the      police,       to show

              conf us io n & did not know what                 to do.      At the same time               I saw

              s up po rt ers    climb the f r a n t       ^rimeter        fence & attempt            to get out of the

              At about 3 . 1 0 p m      (1510)     the    crush a ro u n d us eased & 1 saw a young

              s upporter       rushing    back to our          position,        saying,      "He's dead,          h e ’s

              dead."     This was said several                times & I then saw a lad about                       10"     in

              front    of us who had his            back     towards us & in the              process       of    pulling

              his    friend out of the terracing.                   He had hold of him under                     his arms &

              the    lad was     prostrate       on the te r rac i n g .         We all m o ve d forward to

              •assist him & m a n ag ed to get him to his feet.                           I wouLfl describe           the

              injured fan as white male,                  aged about 2 3 - 2 4 y e a r ^ < 5 * 1 0         tall & very

              well    built,     probably a little            too fat.          He h a ^ s h o r j ^ fai r hair,

        /rj   si ightly curly.           He was w earing a light                coloured y^hirt                   a fine

              cannot    remember a ny more about                him.      I startedL-lrtT s^jjK'fTim a r o u n d the

              face    in an a ttempt       to revive him as he was                  unconscious.            His    face at

              this    time was very blue & his eyes were                        closed.       As    I did this        his

              comp le xi on     changed to red & his eyes                 opened.         He a p p e a r e d to be

              coming    round.       P eo pl e    round us were         shouting       to his friend to taka

              him out of the         crush & to get a s s is ta nc e             outside.          His    friend

              a s s i s t e d him out    t hrough the tunnel,             but    he was still            very groggy.

           until    e ve nt ua ll y the    police & St J ohn Amb ul an ce            entered the area &

           tended to those who were               dead & injured.



          At about      1445 hours        (1445)    & having     heard no a n n o u n ce me nt s       over    the

           public address       system,      we decided to         leave the ground & make                  our way

           home.     We went    back      through the       tunnel    & on e me rgip^Vinto            the

           turnstile are a      I saw dead & injured fans                 lyinq/eve/ywhere.              You had to

           step over     them to get o u t .         As   I step pe d oV er a                     e c t ly outside

           the tunnel,      I looked down & immedi at el y              r ecognised f/om t hg ^e lo th in g

          his back & his friend was                leaning    over    him    crying.        I a s s u m e d him to

          be dead.



          We then     left the stadium & made               our way home.



          D uring    the time    I was at H i l l s b o r o u g h there was          nothing      I saw      I would

           consider     to be a criminal           offence.

 that    numerous             Liverpool             supporters              were      drinking          alcoholic                beverages

 off-licences.                     A    number          of    these       supporters             had    obviously                travelled

 by    private          vehicles             and    by       this    time       some       of    their       numbers             were

 heavily       intoxicated                   with       drink.            I would          estimate          that       this          would

 have    been       approximately                   11.00       am/11.30am              (1100/1130).




 I recall          later       on,       approximately                12     noon       (1200)         , walking             into          the

 large       quantities                from       off- 1 icsnces.                These          were    in       the    form          of    cans

and     bottles.                                                                                                  i

Whilst        inside          the       Section          Staton           I heard          noises       on       the    roof.               On

 iven    during          this          time       other       supporters           were         walking          round       the       building

 in    order       to    relieve             themselves.                  All    these          youths       mentioned                were

" h ^ i l y ^ intoxicated                    and    showed          the     usual       signs      of    drunkenness.                           I

 recall       watching             one       youth       who    was       about       19/20       years          of    age       standing

a     bottle       of    vodka          in    the       space       of- a    matter         of    minutes.               After

 finishing          the       bottle          he    simply          walked       away       to    the    ground             or    rather

 in    the    general          direction                of    it.




 Approximately                2.45pm          (1445)          following          foot       patrol       in M i d d l e w o o d             Rd       I

returning              to      Mi d d l e w o o d        Rd    via       Leppings             Ln.            It w a s     obvious        to      myself

at     this       time,          having            worked          numerNsus            football             matches       at    Hillsborough,

mostly          in     uniform,               that       the       large       iwF'lux            of    people          outside       the

entrance               ways         to       the       Leppings          Ln    enclosure                was       unusual       for     that      time

of      day.           There            is    usually          a    heavy          influx          of    supporters             going       into       the

ground          at     this         time       but       on    this       particular                   day    this      was     well     above

normal.                I also            recall          supporters                standing             on w a l l s      above       the

turnstiles.                      From         Leppings             Lri w e     made          our       way    into      Hillsborough              Park

with        the      intention                of       making       this       a    short          cut       up    to   Middlewood            Rd.




Whilst          in     the       park,         and       I can        only         hazard          a    guess    a \ 3 .1 0 p m / 3 .1 5 p m ,

radioV               It a p p e a r e d            to    me    at     this         time       that       supporters             were     fighting

within          the       Leppings             Ln       enclosure/turnstiles                                 After      what     seemed          only    a

matter          of     minutes               I then          heard       that       a    temporary                mortuary       was     being         set

up     in     the      gymnasium               and       we    therefore                immediately                made    our    way       to    the

ground,           going          in      through             the    Penistone                Rd    entrance.               On    getting

inside          I saw          as       what       I    can    only       describe                as    numerous          people        being

carried           in      by     other         supporters                on    p l a c a r d s / b i 11 b o a r d s .            Some       of    these

were        obviously               injured/dead.                        I rendered                assistance             to    one     man      who

was      already            dead         and       1 saw       that       other          bodies/injured                   persons        were

being         taken\ito                  the       gym.            After       directing                someone          into    the     gym      with

bodies          scattered                all       across          the    floor,             all       obviously          dead.          Other

injured           parties               were       at    the       far    side          of    the       gym       where    first        aid      was

being         rendered              by       police/ambulance                      and       supporters             from       both     factions.




1 then          left        the         gym    and       made       my    way       down          the    ramp       between       the       Spion

there       had       been       a    pitch          invasion          although             realising        the       enormity             of    the

situation             quickly             realised          it w a k not.                   I recall        seeing          three       b o d i es

laid       out       and    covered             up    in    front                the

young       probationer                   constables^ to              renders h e a r t           massage        to    a    man    in       his

twenties             who    by       his    appearance\as                       already          dead.       I instructed                   him    to

remove       the       body          to    the       gym    which          he    did       having     been       assisted          by

supporters-                  There          were       numerous             bodies          strewn       around        in    front          of    the

North       Stand          and       both       police          officers             and    supporters           were       rendering

assistance.




I    saw    at       this    time          that       bodies          were       still        being      transported              across          the

pitch       by       both    police             and    supporters                alike       on m a k e s h i f t      stretchers.                     I

made    my       way       across          the       pitch       towards             the    Leppings        Ln    enclosure             and       saw

bodies       being          pulled          through             an    open       part       of    fencing,        this       fencing             had

obviously             been       cut       open       to    allow          fans       to    escape.          At       this       time       rival

supporters             began          chanting             towards          the       Liverpool          supporters              and    a    large

number       who       had a l r e a d y             spilled          out       onto       the    pitch     ran       towards          the

Spion      Kop.             I was          unable          to    render          assistance           due    to       the    large          amount

of   people           in    front          of    the       fencing,             so    I    ran    back    across           the    pitch          and

through          a    cordon          of    police          who       were       by       this    time    across           the    centre




After       some       semblence                of    order          was    restored             I was    instructed              to    assist

together          with       others       I was          transported           up     to    Hammerton          Rd    Pol       Stn    in

order       to    obtain          missing       person          reports        from        relatives/friends                   who    had

accumulated             outside          the    station.




A    number       of    reports          were    taken          by m y s e l f      although           I would       not       like     to

hazard       a    guess       as    to    how    many.




Later       that       night,       I do       not       know     what       time,     I was          transported             back    to

the    gym       at    the    ground.            I there           assisted           with       relatives          and       the    like

re    identification                (formal)             and    the     completion              of    documentation.




At    one    period          after       the    temporary              mortuary        had       closed       down,       I

transported             relatives          to    the       Medico           Legal     Centre          for    the    formal

identification                of    a    body.            I recall           going     into          the    rear    of    the

mortuary          where       I saw       numerous             bodies,        approximately                 15/20    in       number,

which       had       had    to    be    laid    out       on     the       floor     due       to    shortage       of       space.

Following             the    identification                I returned            to    the       gym       where,    together

with    other          officers,          went       formally           off    duty        at    6.00am       (0600).               I then

returned          to    Ecclesfield             leaving           at    7.00am        (0700)          on    Sunday       16 A p r i l

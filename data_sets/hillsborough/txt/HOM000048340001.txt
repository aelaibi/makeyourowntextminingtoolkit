LONDON SW1H9AT.


^ e a r Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,

    I have received into my possession copies o f two statements made by James
WARDROPE. The first is undated, and the second is dated 06/06/89.

        The first begins:
                “James WARDROPE will say as follows:- ”
but is unsigned, undated, and unwitnessed.

          In this statement, he says the following beginning at the bottom o f page 2:
                   “A Senior House Officer from Rotherham, who had ju st been passing the
                          hospital, was resuscitating another patient and one o f my SHOs was
                          working on the third patient

        Although this statement is undated, it was obviously made after the date o f the
disaster, by which time Mr. Wardrope was aware that I had not ju st been passing the
hospital. I had travelled specifically to the hospital after witnessing the scenes on television. I
told him this in conversations afterwards, and o f course in my account prepared for him, for
which I received a written acknowledgement dated 3rd May 1989.

         On the 6th of May that year, Mr. Wardrope makes his second statement, which differs
somewhat from the first, and is witnessed by Julie APPLETON (PS7844), who as you will
recall is the West Midlands officer who added her name to my statements after they had been
written. In this statement there is no reference at all to me.

          I felt this should be brought to your attention.

Paediatric        "cardiac arrest" was expected                    (via Ambulance Control),                    and

The first Casualty arrived within two or three minutes,,                                      1 believe thi

patient to be a boy T. know only as "Lee",                           who I believe was declared

"Brain Dead" on the Intensive Care Unit, (ITU) the following Monday.

hair.      He was also         in Cardiopulmonary arrest.                    I intubated, him, and

noticed evidence of gross                  inhalation of stomach contents.                       He also had

marked gaseous abdominal                 distension,         possibly indicating that he had

had   "mouth to mouth"            resuscitation at some time.

i also established venous access,                      and gave appropriate drugs.                     This

boy was also established in a normal                         sinus heart rhythm,              but his

pupils were         Fixed and dilated throughout,                    and T. believe he has since
                                                                                              PAGF         3

  These two boy a had taken up the space                    i.mme d iat, e I.y available   in the

  resuscitation area, and the next                     patient   1 dealt with was      in the A & E

  0 epartment Theatre.

  This     patient was; aged around twenty, with fair hair of slim build..                            He

  was cerebrally irritable,                     but not actually fitting.       1 was able to

  intubate him without any drugs, and left him in the care of another

  ill ne x t saw ano 11’ie r u nc o nsc i ous , c:e r e bra 11 y i r r itable pat ie n t , w it hi

  shoulder        length brown hair, and aged around twenty.                    I judged his

  airway to be adequate,                     and left him in the care of a non-medical

  m e inb e r o f s ta f f ..
O . The next patient 1 dealt with was in car d.:i.o — pulmonary arrest.                       He was

  aged around twenty,                 of stocky build with ginger hair.            I. intubated

  him, and gave appropriate drugs down the endotracheal                           tube, as he did

  not have any venous access.                      C was assisted by a doctor of around my

  own age from the football ground.,                    1 never discovered his name..

  I resorted to a central venous                     line via the right sutoelavican route in

  this     patient,.         We got his heart beating            in a normal   rhythm and he was

  v e n t i 1a t e d. a d e q ua X e I.y .

  However,        he re-arrested on two distinct occasions and developed

  Jbixzare ECG complexes,                    with a very poor output.     At this stage 1 took

  the decision to abandon re sus c:itat i ve measures on this                      patient.

   [ next saw a patient of around forty, with thinning hair and of heavy

  build.         He was having cardiopulmonary resuscitation from another

  doctor.         I intubated the patient to help with this.,

  I then was asked to see a boy of around fifteen with black hair, who

  had already had resuscitative treatment.                        He was however fitting,           and

  had a poor airway.                  1 gave this boy appropriate anaesthetic drugs to

  sedate and paralyse him,                     intubated him and transferred him to the i t"U,.

   1 believe he has since made a good recovery,,
                                                                                                PACE      4
                                                                                                S319E

          I then performed a virtually identical                procedure on a boy of similar

          age with '.Light brown hair.             1 transferred him to the 11U also.            1 do

          not know what has happened to this boy.

          1 wa? then briefly involved with a male of around thirty in the

          resuscitation room.              hie had already had considerable effort        put    into

          his resuscitation,            but was sti 111 asystolic    (ie his heart was not

          beating).        1 placed a central        venous   line on this patient.       I believe

          resuscitative measures on this patient were abandoned.

          '.[ then went to Ward 60, and perfo rrned rapi d sequence              induc.t :i.ons and

          intubations on two patients who had deteriorated neurologically.                         I



      O   transferred these

          I later dealt with a female
                                       patients to the Cardiac Intensive Therapy Unit.

                                                    patient who came into the A & E department

          having "arrested"»              She was not from the Hillsborough ground.             She was

          1 1"a n s f e r re d t o t h e 1'IU ..

          This,     1 believe,        covers the bulk of the work      1 did on the day of the

          d :i.saste r „

          1 left the Northern General Hospital                at around 9„0(J pm (fc’K.HJ) „

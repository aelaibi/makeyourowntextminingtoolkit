       Dear Ms Brookes
       Mr Andrew Brookes (deceased)
       Thank you for your letter of the 6th June 1997 requesting copies of various documents.
       Because many of the papers involved were plans or photographs it was easier to ask PC
       Greenway to copy these items and send them out to you. In particular we do not have the
       facility here to give colour copies of photographs.
       I have spoken to PC Greenway this morning and understand that he has spoken with you
       and sent out everything that you asked for. If there are any problems please do not
{_ )   hesitate to get in touch with me again.
       Yours sincerely

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                         Re

     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or

De ar Sirs,

Re:    R E S UME D INQUESTS 19th NOVEM BER 1990.



If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
on the 19th of N o v emb er 1990 at 1 0 . a.m. Details of venue w i l l be n o t i f i e d in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
ev idence has already been taken, n or of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investig ati on w h i c h you wi l l recollect is not ad versarial but
inqui sit oria l in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
un der my control, and in particular, it is m y responsibility to select the
w i t n e s s e s w h o w i s h to give evidence. I am at pres ent engaged in considering
this and in d e term ini ng w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

Wi t h o u t p reju dic e in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
to give you an oppo rtun ity to dra w to my attention the names and other
ap propriate details of any witne ss or wi tnesses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
co n s i d e r calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

M a y I please ask you in con sidering w h e t h e r you w i s h to d r a w any names        to my
attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also w a n t to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for c o n si dera tio n is noth ing more than that, and that the deci sion as
to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
h ea rd from you by the end of Sep£ei»fcrerr I w i l l assume you have no names to
submit.

Yours     faithfully.

Dear Sirs,

He:          MARK A 3300EES (deoeaaed) 8b*50#

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990*

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S .L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner

         Dear Sir

        Mark Andrew Brookes deceased


         Thank you for your letter of 31st July regarding the release of
         post mortem reports.
        We have no pressing requirement for the report to be released in
        advance of the inquest as we are not actively engaged in
        litigation at present.
         In the case of the deceased will the report give any indication of
         the period during which the deceased was in a "crushed state"
         prior to his actual death or is it only related to general
         findings of fact.

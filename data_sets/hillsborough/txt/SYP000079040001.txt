               I live at the above address with my two sisters and my parents.
                          C ^ rJ~
               I have supported Liverpool FC since my childhood.

               On Saturday          15th April     1989 (150489)          I visited Hillsborough Football

               ground Sheffield to view the FA Cup Semi Final match between Liverpool

               and Nottingham Forest.

               I had obtained a £6.00 standing ticket for                       the   Leppings         Ln area ofthe

               ground through the season ticket allocation at Anfield,

               On the morning o f            he match I trave l i ^ ■"* t-oPhpf fipl.    n    ar a r l ( \ r / v o r \

                              a/passenger      in a car that travelled with us was Andrew                                INE

               Andreikas 23 years of age and I have known him socially and through

               visiting football matches for abomt/ 2. y e a r s .                The car Andrew travelled
                                                                                  PAGE        2
                                                                                  S2330

I be 1ieve             lives at                          also in the car was

         brother       in law and a friend of theirs but I do not know their

names.     Also there were £our ..other Jbargs travelled to the game with us

in a car driven by                             I do not know the names of these

other    lads.

We all met at Burtenwood Services on the M62 at about               10.00 am

(1000) and then travelled via the M62 and Huddersfield but I am not

quite sure of the direct            route.   We travelled direct to Sheffield and

did not stop on the way or encounter any travel              delays.     We arrived

at Sheffield at about          12.00 midday    (1200) and parked near to a Police

Club in Shef f i e l d .On the journey at one point I recal 1           id^yw i

rear of                car drinking a can of lager.      I did not see any other

fans dr inking.The whole          group of us 12 in all went    into the Police

Club and I had 3 bottles of Pils             lager.   I far as I can recall         the

others had about the same amount.

Some of the group left at 2.20 pm (1420) approximately to go to the

 ground and I left about 2.30 pm (1430) with Andrew DIVINE.                  We walked
/                                                         .
to the ground amongst other fans and on route did not receive

directions or escort from the Police.

The general atmosphere was one of excitement by most people I saw no

signs of fighting drunkeness or disorder or anyone drinking on the way

to the g r o u n d »

I will say that whilst            in the Police Club 1 was   in a "round" to buy

drinks with                                            and                     avid I

think we purchased one round             each, we were not drunk but happy,         happy

tpr be going to the match.

 e arrived at the turnstiles             at about 2.40 pm (1440).      On arrival         I

saw there were no queues as such just             large crowds trying     tp s e n t e r .

Andrew had visited the ground last year and knew how to/smter the

            were    completely open,        I did not witness anyone open them.         As we got

            through them the pressure of the crowd eased and I had more free

            movement.

            At this point          in time I did not see any Stewards.         Throughout this

            period of time I still           remained with Andrew,       but did not see the rest

            of our friends.           No one took our tickets from us, we still         retained

            them.      ,1 still have the ticket at home somewhere.

             roifri/our/entry point        I could see the tunnel       leading to the ground as

                          had been to Hillsborough before he knew the way so I followed

            fim through the tunnel.            As we walked towards the tunnel,        I was still
Ottwd
            aware of people following us still gaining access through,this gate.

            I cannot     remember seeing either Police officers atf St awards giving
                                                                      ^CTm O J 3 1 G t »V 3

            directing people also.

            I did not see any other gates open into the ground.                  I did not see any

            unauthorised entry into the ground,               people   climbing over walls or

            fences.         It was quite easy for people to have gained entry into the

            ground via this gate without showing their tickets.

            We walked through the tunnel without any crush, we had a relatively

            free passage,.           My impression is that the game had not started because

            if so,        I believe there would have been a rush of people to the
terraces to see it.      We came out of the tunnel          to the right, what         I

now know to be Pen 3.

I have seen a sketch plan/grid of Pens 3 and 4 and have marked on it

as No    1 what   I believe to be our 1st match viewing point.               This    is G2.

 1' reached this point with Andrew.       People were still             coming in

behind us and reached this point by people pushing us forward.                      The

pushing of the crowd was such that I could not see the pitch.                       I was

aware that the game had started and I asked Andrew if he could see the

pitch but he replied he could not.        I could not feel my feet touching

the ground the crush was so great,       it was lifting me from the floor,                  I

asked Andrew and he replied that he co ul dn ’t touch the floor either.

Little by little we were      constantly being      pushed forward.

At this time my body was being twisted to my right hand side although

my legs were still towards the pitch,         I was unable to do anything

about this because of the crush.

Andrew was stood in front of me,      between me and the pitch and he was

facing towards the Police Control box,         being twisted more to the right

than me.     At one point   I was aware of Peter Beardsley standing on the

pitch,    I think taking a free kick at the far end of the ground on the

right.                                                                  /

It was at this point the crowd pushed me forward and/l/foupj4 myself

near to Andrew,     my feet were still   not t o u c h i n > ^ n e          a^rid^J>1*?as

facing the pitch but tilted forward,        and Andrew appeared to be in the

same    position.   There was no one in between us now.                I was leaning

onto his back being      pushed by people from behind.               I began looking

round and could hear      people shouting for the gates to be opened.

I remember seeing Nottingham Forrest attacking the Liverpool goal

which I believe resulted in a corner kick to my left hand side.                       I did

not see anything else,      because of the crowd pushing again.

I presume the corner had been taken because we were pushed again,
                                                                               PAGE      5
                                                                               S2330

Andrew was pushed and went down further forward,            I was pushed on to

him, we were leaning forward,        but not on the floor, we were nearly

horizontal,    people around us were     in the same position.       I saw to my

right that people appeared to be standing though.            Other    people had

been pushed on top of me.

I could see that Andrew was leaning forward,          I could not see all of

him but I could see that his head was slumped forward.               I was lying on

top of him,    I could not move much but managed to move my head slightly

in order to see his head.

I remember my arm was trapped forward and this was held down by

another body, my right arm was trapped behind my back I could not feel

my legs,   they were trapped also.       The only part of my body I could

move was my head because of other        people around me.

I have marked on the sketch plan/grid the approximate position as No

2.   This I estimate as F6 I have signed this and produce as             (Ex

No         > (Ref       1).    We remained in this   position for what appeared

to be 5 or 10 minutes.         I could still   not move,   and at first I could

feel myself going further down towards the floor and further forward.

I was aware maybe one,        or more were trapped underneath Andrew. My head

was still slightly free and to my right          I could see people

some stooping,      half standing and some standing,       they could not move

because of the crush.         The further to the right hand side of me I

could see the more      people were standing.

During this time someone to my right saw my face and said something

like "I t ’s alright    lad they afre going >p get us out."

While   in this crush 1 ocul4 hearj Aryare/ws breathing deteriorating he

was not breathing      co^re^tly buy rarakirwj a crackling noise.      I thought

to myself that maybe V ^ o p l e wg/e dyiirg^

After what seemed an eternity I felt someone grab my right arm and I

was pulled from the pile of people, who ever          it was I never saw.         Then
                                                                             PAGE      6
                                                                             S2330

      I was grabbed by someone else I was dazed,       he pulled me up the

      steps of the terraces    clear of the pile.    All    I can remember about him

      is that he had a Scottish accent.

      I started to look around and just to the right of where         I had been

      pulled from I saw    mans body lying face up on his back with his head

      towards Pen 4 and his legs towards Pen 2.

      I would describe him ^    white male,   he was aged I would say in his

      3 0 ’s he was a larg^        lightly overweight,      he had brown curly hair

      and a moustache.           on a/light T shirt.        I think and blue jeans

      He was obvio                  was blue in the face        I had not been

      aware of this man before this time.

      I started looking for Andrew I looked > o      the left of this man and I

      saw Andrew being pulled from the floor,       he/w)as face up, he was being

      pulled by a policeman and another fajj         »nt over to him, I saw he
      -                                     y.
      was blue in the face, I ,tho,«fght he was de^d, but a> I got near to him

      I realised he was not,    I thought   I saw life in his eyes.     He was being

      carried back towards the tunnel.
-13
      The Policeman was wearing a jacket but      I cannot say if it was a tunic

      or a top coat,   I do not know if he had a helmet on or not.        I can only

      say the other fellow carrying Andrew was a white male about 5*9 and

      had fair hair, and was wearing a light T shirt possibly blue.

      I went and helped to carry Andrew.      I went to his head but the

      Policeman said to get hold of his feet.       The Policeman had his arms

      under Andrews body with his head to the left hand side.

      We went back up through the terraces,     through the tunel which was

      clear of people and back into the ^ e a    near to the tu r nst i1e s .The PC

      put Andrew onto the floor.     The       C WasV leaning over him and I

      think he was giving him the                          was shouting for help for

      an ambulance.    This other man I rnent i/oned who was helping to carry

      Andrew had gone by this time,    I do not know where.
                                                                               PAGE    7
                                                                               S2330

I do remember a Policewoman at one stage          coming to see what was going

on she spoke to the POL PC and then left.           It was then an Ambulance

man came he put a tube down Andrews throat and then a mask onto his

face and administered oxygen to him.                             /

The POL PC and the Ambulance man then took Andrew ipt^o g ^ A m b u l a n c e .

I tried to get into the Ambulanceman whilst giving tTie Pod i c&maTT

Andrews details,       the Ambulance told me to stay whjre I was in case

there were other people to put in.         He then realised that Andrew

should get to hospital       quickly and told me t o   get in.       The PC

Travelled to the hospital        in the Ambulance as well and I gave him

Andrews details.       Andrew appeared to still     be unconscious he was the

only casualty in the Ambulance.

We were taken to the Royal Hal lamshi re Hospital

I was not injured as such,        I just receiyec^/bruisi>^§ to my left hand

side,   chest and arm. C A " P   l/s'£T

My details were taken at the hospital         but did not receive any

treatment other than a nurse taking my pulse.

Whilst at the Hospital       I asked a Security man or Ambulance man to

leave a message for                       at the Police Club as to where we

were.    The Police Club     being our rendezvous   point.

Sometime    later            rrived at the hospital and later still A n d r e w ’s

parents although I did       not speak to them.

        eventually took      me to the Police Club and I      went home to

Liverpool    in the same car I arrived home around midnight.             The

clothing I wore to the match consists of a dark blue T shirt, a

black sweatshirt with a crew neck, and blue trousers,            dark blue, and

black shoes.        I am 5*9 tall of slim build and have short black hair

with a right hand parting.        I was clean shaven.

As I was    pulled from the pile of people by the Scotsman I took my

jumper off because       I was hot.

       * Andrew was wearing a brown leather bomber jacket,           dark brown with a

         zip fastening,    it was new about 2 weeks old.         He had on a light blue T

         shirt    (as far as I can remember)       he had blue jeans on and white

         training shoes.        He is about S ’?" tall,    of stocky build,   clean shaven

         does not wear spectacles.          He had the jacket on up until     I was on top

         of him,    but when I saw him when        the Policeman was with him he was

         minus his leather       jacket.    This   was the point when I saw him on the

         terraces with the       PC.     At this time also one of his trainers was

         missing.     I think    the left one.      As far as I am aware his wallet was

         in his jacket .

         I will add that whilst          in the ground before and after the events I

         have described I did not witness anyone drinking alcohol             or see any

         fights or disturbances.

         At no time did I witness anything           I consider to be a Criminal Offence.

Lord       Justice   Taylor made 76 recommendations       in his Final
R e p o r t , many of them   concerning crowd safety.    Our information
is      that they were      largely and quickly     implemented by      the
responsible        authorities.      Indeed many    of   them had     been
originally        included   in his    Interim Report     and had     been
implemented even prior to           the Final   Report being publi s h e d .
The      Government have made it clear that       the responsibility for
the provision        of all   seated accomodation    at football  league
grounds rests with the         clubs themselves. As you will pr o b a b l y
know the Government         has made available Â£100 million    available
to the Football Trust over a five           year period to assist clubs
in carrying        out these   improvements.     The Footbal1 licensing
Authority has been established and will provide in England and
Wales the national inspectorate and review body recommended in
the Final Report.          In addition the    Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds        (The Green    Guide)   has been revised    incorpor a ti ng ,
where appropiate, the safety recommendations of Lord Justice
Taylor.

Your letter also    refers     to an  incident  at a match between
Notts County and Leicester City on 23 March 1991.          Nottingham
County Council are the local authority responsible for issuing
a safety certificate to the      ground under the Safety    of Sports
Grounds Act  1975.      They have    assured me that    no   injuries
resulting from  crushing occurred at      the match   and that   fans
were  easily able   to pass through     the gates   in the perim et e r
fence which  were o p e n . They have also assured me    that in the
part of the ground    where the incident    occurred the attendance
was only 77% of the capacity.

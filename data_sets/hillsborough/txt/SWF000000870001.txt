Dear Sirs,

Hillaborough

It seems to us that there are a number of points which remain
outstanding in relation to this matter.

These could be clarified by a further directions hearing or by
agreement.

Firstly# there appeared to be general agreement at the last hearing
that it would be convenient to have so&e shorter form of title for
use in the contribution proceedings. We attach a suggested format
for consideration.

Secondly, we do not yet appear to have a direction which actually
fixes the starting date of the trial.

Thirdly, we do not have a direction which fixes the venue of the
trial.

There may be other matters worthy of consideration, but perhaps you
could let us have your views on the foregoing.


Yours faithfully.

I          Dear Sirs


I
           Hillsborough - Eastwood & Partners

           Thank you for your letters of 9th and 10th April.

           We acknowledge receipt of the cheque for £125. 86 and return our
II         account, duly receipted.

          We have no objections to the shorter form of title suggested by
I         you under Action 1989 C No 5925.

          We agree with you that the starting date and venue of the trial
          have yet to be fixed.     On 11th April we spoke to the Civil
          Listing Officer at Liverpool District Registry,
          who is familiar with this case.  He was not aware of Mr Justice
          Steyn's direction in the Order of 20th December 1989 that the
          Contribution Proceedings be tried at the beginning of the
          Michaelmas Terms 1990 on a date to be fixed.   He was unable to
          locate a copy of the sealed Order.        We have subsequently
          obtained a ©opy of the sealed Order from you, but have not yet
          forwarded it to the Liverpool District Registry.   We understand
          fr°n             that, on receipt of the sealed Order, he will
          make representations to enable the trial to commence at the
          beginning of the Michaelmas Term 1990 in Liverpool.

          We believe it appropriate that the parties agree to the venue
          for trial and then notify the Court of the agreed preference
          It may be that the availability of a Judge and Court time is
          such that no other venue on the Northern Circuit would be
          available, but for Liverpool.      Having discussed this wit^
          Counsel, our own particular preference would be for the trial
          to be heard in Manchester, the Court being fairly familiar wit~
          chis case already.

          we c.o not think it appropriate, let alone necessary, for ~her=
          zo be a further hearing to discuss these -ac:ers.    We believe

                          C"< )V . k v                       U-,.. ; - •                    ; • -m:                 • V k-:

      hat they can be dealt with by liaison with the Court Listing
     office.

     We have sent a copy of this letter to the Club's solicitors   for
     their information and a/j*?^it your comments shortly.

g|    Dear Sirs,
      Hillsborough

      Thank you for your letters of 12th and 17th April with enclosures*

      There appears to be considerable confusion as to the exact meaning
      of the Order of 20th December, the more so as there does not appear
      to be a copy on the Liverpool District Registry file although, as
      you are aware, the original was sealed out of that Registryi .

      As there are other natters on which directions are needed, it is
      now our intention to issue a further Suasions, which we hope can be
 .    speedily heard.

      We will serve a copy on you as soon as it is available.

      With reference sto your I*ist of. Documents, we wonder if yon did note
      the cooaaehts of Mr. Justice Steyn, deprecating the idea that lists
fft   should be served dealing with documentation already disclosed at
      the Inquiry.                                                  -p-

      With that in mind, it did not seem to us that there was any further
      disqovery to be given.
          \
      On reflection, there may be some post inquiry documentation of
      relevance, with particular reference to matters which ought to be
      on your list, but do not in fact appear.


                                                                 /... contd


      Reynolds Porter Chamberlain
      DX 81
      LONDON.
We have in mind, specifically, documentation relating to the
emergency amendment of the general Safety Certificate dated
24th November, 1989. In particular, you should have available a
letter of 24th Hovember, 1989 from Sheffield City Council to your
clients, consequential correspondence and any internal notes and
memoranda relating thereto. There may also be plans.

We are also seeking the whereabouts of Minutes of the meeting which
took place on 13th April, 1979 between your clients, the Fire
Service and the City Council. This meeting and the Minutes thereto
are referred to in the Minute of the further meeting of 18th April,
1979, but have not been produced by any party.

There should also be files and documents relating to the coaaaission
given to your clients by the Club by letter of loth March, 1987,
which were introduced to the inquiry, we think by the Club, on day
26 {see page 73 of transcript).

Perhaps you can ensure that these items are listed in the very near
future.


Yours faithfully.

      We    refer to your letter                                             of 2 7 th        April    and    our          telephone
      conversation of 3rd May.

      We confirm that we do not see any confusion in the Order of
      20th December 1989 regarding the fixing of a trial date.    The
      confusion appears to have arisen in that, unfortunately, the
      listing Officer at Liverpool District Registry was not aware of
      the direction and so had not made provision for it.  We believe
      that the Order ox 20th December 1989 is sufficient for the
      Court to now make arrangements for a trial date and understand
      this is what they are now doing.

     You    gave us details of the other directions you propose
     seeking.     You informed us you believe Sheffield is the
     appropriate place for the venue of the trial.      We are, of
     course, reliant to an extent upon both the Listing Officer and
     the availability of either Mr Justice Steyn or Mr Justice Rose
     for the venue.     Please will you let us have a copy of vour
     proposed  Summons    so that we can consider your proposed
     directions fully.

     We note your comments regarding discovery.      However, as we
     explained, our clients were not present at the whole Inauiry
     and, therefore, we do not believe we have all the documents
     disclosed   at the Inquiry.  We look forward to receiving from
     youthe List    you agreed to prepare of the documents you have
     from the Inquiry together with all relevant Post-Incuiry
     documentation in your clients' possession.

     tfe confirm that c                                      cj.i6.its r.ave disclosed in Schedule 2 o:

         have not been carried out, or at least clearly and finally arranged
         by the directions hearing on 23rd May, it may be necessary for us to

       Dear Sirs

       Hillsborough - Eastwood & Partners

      We refer to the hearing before Mr Justice Rose in Manchester an
      Monday 14th May.                                             “

      We confirm that no order was made on your clients7 Summons for
      Third Party Directions in the nervous shock cases, save that
      your clients pay our clients7 costs in any event.        We look
      forward to receiving a copy of the sealed Order- from you in any
      event.

     In the circumstances, we confirm that we have now filed the
     Acknowledgements of Service to all the Third Party Notices
     issued against our clients by your clients for the nervous
     shock cases.    We have stated on these Acknowledgements our
     clients' intention to defend these proceedings.

     As you are aware, Mr Justice Rose directed that attempts could
     be made to re-arrange the date for your Summons for Further
     Directions  in the phapman and Rimmer actions,        presently
     returnable on 23rd May.  We have instructed our Counsel's Clerk
     to liaise    with the Clerks ' for other Counsel,      so that
     alternative dates can be placed before the Court.

     In the meantime, we enclose a copy of your proposed directions
     which we have amended slightly and comment* on the paragraphs
     adopting the numbering used: -

                   1.       Agreed as amended.

                   2.       We consider that the procedure which should be
                            adopted is that adopted by the Plaintiffs Pursuant to
                            paragraph 5 of the Order of Mr Justice 'Rose dated
                            2 6 ch October 1989 in the ChapiTiSr. anc. Riitm.sr actions.
                            xou will recall that in November 1989 the Plaintiffs'

           Payne, following the hearing on 14th Kay as he was
           not aware of this document.     We therefore enclose a

           clients are the "Plaintiffs" in the Contribution

           and Final Reports of Lord Justice Taylor underlining
           those findings of fact which you wish admitted.      We
           will then respond indicating which of those ve do not

     5.    Agreed as amended.

     6.    You are aware that Mr Justice Rose indicated at the
            hearing on 14th May that he did not feel this case
            should be tried in Sheffield. We take the view that
            the case should be tried in Liverpool or Manchester
            as fixed by the Court.

     7.    You are also aware of Mr Justice Rose's direction
            that this case be tried on the first working day in
            the Michaelmas Term, which will be the beginning of
            October 1990.  We agree with this.

     8.    Agreed.

     9.    Agreed, as slightly'amended.

     10.   We believe that a    date for the Pre-Trial Review
           should be fixed     at   the hearing    for further
           directions.  Please will you, therefore, arrange for
           your Counsel's Clerk to arrange with our Counsel's
           Clerk for available dates to be agreed in advance.
           We accept your time estimate for the Pre-Trial
           Revi ew.

As regards other directions, we confirm that we will be seeking
an appropriate Order from your clients in respect of discovery
which is still outstanding.   Our views are clearly set out in
our letter of 3rd May.

We are sending a copy of this letter to Davies Arnold Cooper
for their information.

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough -Ea st w o o d &'Partners

Thank you for your letter of 15th May.

If proposed directions are agreed or at least substantially agreed
then there is no difficulty about rearranging datessfor the hearing.
However, quite aside from the fact that there remain substantial
points of difference between us and we do not yet have your comments
on proposed direction number 4, which is crucial, we have not heard
anything from the Club and, of course, any agreement as to
directions will have to be tripartite.

Finally, we have been very concerned to hear from our Engineer that
he has heard nothing whatsoever from Dr. Weaver and we are
considering the issue of a further Summons to ensure that either,
tests are carried out pursuant to an agreement between the Engineers
or that each Engineer.has access to the ground to carry out his own
tests.  The latter would be less satisfactory but, if no progress is
made on reaching agreement, it will be the only solution.

       Dear Sirs,

       Hillsborough

      We refer to Thursday's discussion between Mr. Metcalf and Mr. Wyles.
      We have yet to be able to speak to Counsel about directions, but. we
      set out below one or two points in connection with your proposals,
      following the numbering of the Summons:                 ’


                  1. : We-are -not very -happy j-with your-'-addition, because-
                    . ;;it, leaves ..open, an. area|of doubt, as to .what :.is. and

                          the List of Issues goes beyond the existing
                          pleadings, then we will wish to apply for leave
                          to amend.

      5.   This is only six weeks before trial, which leaves
           little time for any reports in reply but, again,
           if Counsel sees no problem, we will be content.

      6.   This is a matter on which we may wish to put
           argument before the Judge, notwithstanding that
           some views have already been expressed.

      7.   No doubt the Listing Officer will be able to
           indicate precisely which dates are available.

     10.   We agree with what you say.


We await hearing further from yourselves and.also from Messrs.
Davies Arnold Cooper. We would be content for the Summons to be
moved (always supposing that there, is a convenient date available),
provided that only limited points remain for argument.


Yours faithfully,




                                                               7^

     our Counsel's Clerk that the hearing for further directions has
     been adjourned until Thursday 24th May at 10.30 a.m. A request
     has been made for the hearing to start later that morning as

     travelling from London.   We shall let you know if there is any
     alteration in. the time of the hearing.

     We are informed by Davies Arnold Cooper that you do not agree
     to all the suggestions they have made in their letter of 22nd

     so that we are aware of your clients' position in advance of
     the hearing.

    Yours faithfully

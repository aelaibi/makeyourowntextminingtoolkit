           On    stand-by             Gymnasium,          full       unit,




           1400

           With       Inspector           Delaney         to    the    corner       entranee          Spion       Hop    and      North

           Stand.           At    this       time    I could          see    that       the    majority          of    Notts      Forest

           fans       were       in    the    ground       but       the    West    Stand       was       virtually          empty.        The

           West       Stand       Terrace        middle         section       was       half    full       of    Liverpool         fans,

           there       was       still       plenty       of    room.        In    the    North       Stand       there       were      about

           four       to    five       hundred.           With„Inspector                Delaney       I    remained          at   this

           location          till       about       1420.        By    this       time    the    Hop       end    was    full      and     the

           North       Stand          filling       up.        The    West    Stand       and    Terraces             were    still      half

           empty.

           Message          from       match     control         to    attend       Leppings          Lane       end,    trouble         at

           the       turnstiles.              I went       over       the    air    to    see    if       my    full    unit      was
                                                                                                                                PAGE            2

required.              The    reply        was       'full          unit*




With    Inspector             Delaney,              I gathered             the     Unit      and     went    via       the     rear    of
                                                                                                                                            4


the    North       Stand          to     Gate       A.




At    this    time          the     Liverpool             fans        were    shouting          and    swearing          and     some

physically             remonstrating                 with           officers       of   my     unit    to    get       more     horses

and    officers             outside           the    turnstiles.                                                   —   —^ ^
                                                                                                                               -j V.CJLC/.


I    could       see    fans        c 1 i m b i ng       over        the    gate    walls       to    my    left       and     then

helping          others           up.     These          then        jumped      down     into       the    open       area     at    the

rear    of       the    West        Stand       and           Terrace.




People       were       lifting           children              up    through       the      turnstile            to   the     North

Stand    and          many        were    complaining                 of    chest       injuries.




Children,             men    and. w o m e n         were        crying       and    shouting.              Nearly        all

verbally          attacked              ourselves              saying       someone       is    going        to    get    killed

outside          if    nothing           is    done.            A    small    woman       dressed           in    bright       red    aged

about    30       plus       years        started              screaming         and     shouting          and     physically

having       a    go    at        officers          present           inside       and    myself.          She     was    pulled       away

by    three       men        similar          ages.




A    short       time        later       she     returned             and    started         again.




I went       over       the        air    to     reguest             the    assistance          of    Mounted          Officers        to

ease    the       crush           outside.               We    were    trapped          inside       and     could       not    get

through          to    assist.




The    Gate       had        to    be    held       by        two    stewards,          they    were        having       to    push    up
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      R 141

the    top       bolts          as    continuing             pressure         and     shaking            of    it    loosened

them.        It       was       similar          for    the       bottom      bolts.




This    continued                for       some       time    and       at   one     stage         I thought             the    gate    was

going       to       be    forced          open.


                                           ~n                                                                        '
1    went    over          the       air    and       requested          that      Gate       A    be    opened          to    save    life

and    limb,          stating          that       if    not       someone       would         be    killed.




A    reply       came       back       over       the       air    to    open      gate       ’A ".       (Not       sure       Supt

Marshall?)




Prior       to       opening          the       gate,       I gathered          my    unit         and    made       a    single       file

on    the    wall          side,       myself          being       nearest         the     gate.          I then          told    another

unit    to       do       likewise          on    the       turnstile         side       of       the    gate.




1 then       ordered             this       gate       to    be    opened,         the     Steward            at    first       refused.

I explained                my    actions          to    him.        The      Steward          then       shouted          through       th e

glass       spy       panels          to    the       fans    telling         them       he       was    opening          the    gate.




1 shouted             to    them       to       stop    trying          to   force       the       gate       as    we    were    going

to    open       it.        The       steward          then       showed      them       the       key    demonstrating                he

was    going          to    use       it    to    o pe n     up,




The    lock          part       was    opened          first       then      the     top      and       bottom       bolts.




Seconds          before          the       opening          1 shouted         to     the      two       lines       to    steady       them

down    and          try    to       stop       any    stampede.,

                                                                                                                                    R 141




On    opening          the       gates       there       were       shouts          of   relief        and     to      the    effect          it

should       have       been       done       earlier          as    they       all      had     tickets          which       they       were

waving       in    the       air.




Together          with       one    of       my    unit,       I think          Police          Constable           Billins         (2551)

X forced          my    way       through          this       crowd       shouting          at    them       to     stop      pushing

and    take       their          time.




After    a    few       minutes          X saw          Inspector          Sykes.           I    informed           him      why    I had

opened       the       gate.        By       now    there          was    only       about       50-70       waiting          to    enter

through       this       gate.




Inspector          Sykes          then       shut       this       gate.        I    remember          talking          to    a    fan    and

he    said    its       past       three          have    they       kicked          off.        I did       not       know.




I    could    see       hundreds             of    fans       on    the    bridge         obviously            without            tickets.




A message          was       sent       over       the    air       to    the       effect       all    officers             on    to    the

ground       or    pitch.           I    cannot          remember          the       actual       words.




On    arrival          I thought             it    was    a    pitch       invasion            and     with       my    unit       were

telling       fans       to       leave       the       pitch       and    enter         the     north       side       terrace

through       the       open       gate.           It    was       not    for    some       time       that       it    was       realised

what    had       taken          place       and    people          were    seriously             injured.




At    some    stage          I    remember          going          down    to    the      Spion        Kop     end      and

assisting          officers             in    bringing             back    Liverpool             fans    who        had      ran

towards       the       Forest          fans       who    were       shouting            and     singing.              Several

officers          had    their          staffs          out.        I ordered            them     to    p ut      them       away       and
                                                                                                                                     PAGE
        ,    '                                                            4                                                          R 141

grab    a Liverpool                   fan       and    push    him    back          away    from       the    Spion          Kop     end.




1 d o n ’t t h i n k         at       this       stage       the    Forest          fans    knew       what       had    taken        place.




Whilst       outside          I saw             that    the    two    men       who    had       spoke       to    me    inside           were

re-united          with       their             children.




One    of    the       men    had       approached             me    inside          stating       1 think          that        he    was

something          to    do       with          the    match/sponsors                and    showed           m y red

identification                card          of    some       sort.        He    had    arranged              to m e e t h i s        son

outside          gate    A.           I told          him    what    my       intention          was    and       told him           to

wait    near       the       wall.




Left    the       message             with       other       officers,          I ran       down       the    rear       of     the

North       Stand       and       up    the       first       gangway          and    onto       the    pitch,          no    players

were    on       the    pitch          at       this    time.




I   could        see    people          running             about    on       the    pitch       near        to t h e     Leppings

Lane    end       goal.




Officers          had    formed             a    loose       cordon       and       I joined       them.




I   could        not    see       a    reason          for    this    but       then       saw    several          people

wandering          about          in    a       daze.




I started          to    assist             the       injured       people.           As    to    time       scale       I had        no

idea.        Officers             were          lifting       people          over    the    fencing          and       dragging

people       through          the       escape          gate.        The       wire    meshing          was       being       forced         by
                                                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                ;,f.                                                        R 141

It "was      at      this        stags          1    realised             that         people          were    seriously          injured.

I    could       see       that       a    cordon          had       been       set         up   about        the    half    way       line.              I

went    up      to     the       line       and          saw   some        of      my       unit.           Boardings       were       being

used    to       take       dead          and       injured          fans       from         the       West    side       down    to       the

corner          past       North          Stand,          Spion       Kop.




I told       my       unit       to       leave          the   cordon           and         a s s it     in a n y   way     they       could.




1    remember          assisting                carrying             out    a      male          fan     obviously         dead       on    a

boarding.




All    over          the    pitch          people          were       doing            mouth        to      mouth    and    other          life

saving          methods.              I took             the    body       end         we     put      it    down    on    the    floor          near

to    the       gymnasium.                 I    could          see    bodies            all       over       some    with    jumpers             over

their       faces.




I then          gave       assistance                to    the       seriously                injured         in    this    area       to       t he

rear    of       the       North          Stand.




Two    of       my    unit       utilised                the   Freight             Rover          to     ferry      the    injured          to       t he

Northern             General          Hospital.                 I continued                   giving         assistance          to    the

injured          and       placing             them       in    the       waiting            ambulances.




Later       I    requested                all       my    unit       to    re-groupin                  Penistone          Road    near          to

D    C Cooks.              Once       re-grouped               apart        from            Police          Constable       1398,          we    went

on    mobile          patrol          as       numerous          reports               of     supporters            fighting.




After       attending             at       Hillsborough                   Park         where        fans      had    been    fighting                we

were    called             to    the       Burgoyne            Arms        where            trouble          had    been    reported.                  On

arrival          all       was    quiet             and    it w o u l d         appear            that       some    fans    had       thrown
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          R-141

  bottles         at   people     walking      at    the    side    of    the   road.




  The    Unit      then    went    on   stand-by       in    H a wk s 1ey     Avenue,      until   directed     to

  Niagara         Sports    Ground      for    stand-by       duties,         where   we    remained    until

  0700.




  Prior      to    going    on    stand-by      duties       at    Niagara      the   unit,    with    myself,

  did    a   fingertip       search       of   the    terracing          at   the   West    Stand.     Several
                                                                                                      V
  items      including       a    watch    were      recovered.

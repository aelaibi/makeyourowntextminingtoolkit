             During        this    time          there       was     a steady          influx        of    f a n s , s l o w l y at       first

             build       up df     people          on    the       outside.            These      persons         all    appeared            to

             h a v e a r r i v e d at        the    same       time.

             As    the     crowd       outside          built        up a n d     the       turnstiles           were    getting          busy         I

             had     occasion          to    eject       4    people        for    climbing           over       the    revolving

             barrier,,       having          no    tickets.             These      were        ejected        via G a t e      C as       to      take

             them     to    the P o l i c e        Room would             have     resulted           in a s h o r t a g e        of m a n p o w e r

             at    the     turnstiles.              1 could only                 see    one^Serial            in the        area among                A~

             G and Gate           C.        As    the    crowd          outside        got     bigger       a number         of    f ans w e r e

             coming        through          the    turnstiles             and making             complaints            about      the     crush

             outside.          All      the       fans       who     entered       appeared           v ery a g i t a t e d a n d         some

             very     frightened             by w h a t       wa s      happening           outside.          Women and           children

             appeared        to    be       suffering          the m o s t        and were           in v a r i o u s    states         of

             shock.         I received             a substantial                 amount        of a b u s e      from    s ome     f ans         at

in    possession          of    tickets           purchased             from Notts,             and when                  theywere

unable       to    gain     entry         into     the       turnstiles           they were           having          to t u r n

around       thereby        blocking             the    turnstiles           e v e n mor e .         By    t his      time       I

could    see       outside          and     could       see       people     being       pushed       towards             the

turnstiles          and     s ome      getting          stuck        on    the    revolving          barrier          which

because       of    the     amount          of    people          c o u l d n ’t be     operated          properly.

At    this    point       Gate       C w as       ope n e d ,      I did     not      see     by w h o     but       in    company

with    PS C r a w f o r d      I s hu t         the    left       s ide    of    the    g ate     and     locked          it but

not    before       quite       a number           of     fans       had    run    in.           T h e g ate              was    shut

before       the m a j o r i t y       realised           it was          a way    in,

I then       returned          to    the     turnstiles              and    could       see    people       climbing             the

walls    and       fences       from        the    outside,             youths     were       also    climbing             onto       the

turnstiles          roof       from       the     inside          and were        throwing         tickets           down       to

those    waiting          outside.               I suggest           these       were    the y o u t h s        who       had

entered Gate             C when        it w a s        briefly          opened.

I could also             see    fa ns       entering          the       turnstiles          without        tickets          and

passing Bank             of E n g l a n d        notes       of    various        denominations             to       the

stewards.           Those       1 sa w       were       ejected.            I h ave      no k n o w l e d g e        of a n y

successfully             paying        to    get       in.

By    this    time       I was       again        nea r      to G a t e     C and       looking       outside             through

the    turnstiles           it w a s        obvious          t hat      there     was    no    control          over       the m a s s

of    people       1 could          see.

A man and young                woman        entered          through        turnstile          A and       t h i s w o m a n was

in a s t a t e      of    shcok        and       received          first     aid,       allegedly          as    a    result          of         .

being    crushed against                    the    wall       outside.            I was       assisting          them       n ear      to

the wall          between Gate              C and       turnstile           A when       the     g a te    was       opened

fully again.              I could           see    a mass          of     people      outside        who    all       surged

forward       towards          t his      gate.         The m a j o r i t y       I would        describe            as y o u n g      men

and youths          between          17-S3 years.                  I braced myself               against         the       w all      to

prevent       the y o u n g         woman        getting          carried along             by the        cr owd,         who    by

                                                                                                                                          R333

t hi s    time       were         rushing            heading          through          the    g ate      in w h a t         seemed        like        a

never         ending        torrent             of    people.

This      mass       of     people          had       one a i m a n d           that w a s         to e n t e r        the     ground.

They      were       unstopable                 and    certainly             undi r e c t a b l e .          In m y         opinion

s h o u l d a PC          or P C ' s        h av e     attempted             to    direct          the s e       fans       they would

have      been swept                along        with       them.          It w a s      obvious            the       s i t u a t i o n was

out      of    control            both      outside             and      inside        the    gro u n d .

After         a time        the      gates           were       closed and             the    area       between            the

turnstiles               and      the      terraces             emptied         quickly.            I did         not       see w h e r e

these         fans       went.          I then         resumed my               duties        at    the      turnstiles.

I did         not    h ear        the      match       kick        off     because           of    the      sheer        volume        of

noise         around my             location.               A short          time       l a t er    I heard a shout                    that

t h e r e was        a    pitch         invasion and                  as a      result        of    this         in    company with

other         officers            ran a r o u n d          to     the     rear     of     the S o u t h S t a n d , t h r o u g h                the

stand and            over         the      w a ll     o nto       the     cinder        track.

I c o u l d see           people           climbing             o ve r    the     fences          between         the       track      and       the

terrace         and also             people           being        lifted         from       the    terrace            up     to    the

seating         a rea above.                    As    I got        nearer         to    the       fence      I could           see     the

reason         for       t hi s     and     t ha t     was       the      excessively              larg e        number        of    people

in the         central            pen.          I do       not     r e c a l 1 how many             other         officers           were

present         at       t his      t ime       but    I could            see a n u m b e r         on the            fence        attempting

to    pull      people            o ve r    onto       the       track.           This       was    hampered             by    the     forward

facing         spikes          at    the        t o p of        the      fence.         I could          see      people           pressed

against         the       fence         with         their       bodies         and     some       faces         with a        crush        of

people         at    the       rear        of    them.            This      was    ap pr oximately 20                    or 3 0     deep         in

the      c e n t r e as        they        were       obviously            unable        to m o v e         or    s p e a k but       just

appeared            to    be w a t c h i n g          us w i t h         terrified           l o oks     on t h e i r         faces .

I could         see       individuals                 were       obviously             dead and          dieing          with       th e i r

colouration and                     looks.

could        then        see a        lot      of       these       people were              lying       at     the     bottom        of    the

wall        u n der      the     fence.                I can o n l y           describe          it as a        l a rge    mound       of

p e o p l e , most            we re o b v i o u s l y             dead.

I approached                  a gate          to       the    rear       of     the    goal       and    saw     two      officers          on

the     fence          to     the     left         of       the    gate        trying       to    reach a young               boy w h o         was

at    the        front.          He      was       alive          but    obviously           shocked.            I entered            the

gate        by    c 1 imbing          around            it u s i n g      the     fence          and    standing          on the       fence

swung        through           to     the      interior             of     the    terrace.              I wa s       then able         to get

an arm a r o u n d             this       bo y a n d          lift       him     enough          for    the     officers         reaching

over        to    pull        him     up.

By    this        time        the     crush            seemed       to     be e a s i n g        slightly        from      the       rear.

The     only way              to a s s i s t           the    injured           due    to    the       entanglement             of    l i mbs

was     to       get     to    the       rear          of    them and           start       from       the     back     towards        the

fence,           in o r d e r       to    do       this       I was       obliged           to    crawl        o ver    s ome    bodies.

I    c o uld      then        see     t ha t       a    crash       barrier           had    given way           just      above       the

area        containing              the       people who                ha d    fallen       over       and     down      towards          the

wa 11   .
A    p ath was           then       cleared             f r o m the        gate       towards          the     tunnel      at    the

rear.            This       enabled           bodies          to    be     passed       along          t his    path and         out       of

the     gate        to w a i t i n g          officers.

There        was       no     r oom      inside             the    terrace        to a t t e m p t       first         aid.

I could           see       that      some         of       the    trapped        people          were       obviously alive                and

as a        resul t         they were              given          priority when              released.

The     noise          was      very      loud          during          all     this    with       some        fans     still

shouting            and       chanting.

A    number         of      f ans     assisted               us    removing           people       from        the     terrace        and

o nto       the     pitch,          wi t h o u t        them       I have        no    doubt       that mo re w o u l d              have

d i e d as        in the m o s t              they assisted                    speedily.

Some        fan s, mainly                young          men,       were        obviously          d r u n k , they        h a d all        the

signs        and       smelled           of    intoxicants.                     These       fans       were     not     assisting           taut

                                                                                                                          R333

 were      abusing        and     pushing        myelf       and     others.           I was    threatened            in a

 number      of    occasions            by t h e s e m e n a n d a l t h o u g h         not    directly           associated

 was     p o ke d a n d      pushed      repeatedly with                 comments        like     "You     bastards,             its

 all     your     fa u l t " .

 I have      no     recollection            of    the      number       of      people       1 removed        but    they

 were      pulled       from      the    pile a n d        carried        to     the    gate.       I only         recollect

 one     young     girl       about      17/SO years             with     black        hair    wearing        what

 appeared         to    be a b r o w n      leather          jacket.            She    was    immediately           to    the

 ri g ht    of    the     g ate    when      looking         up t o w a r d s     the    stands.         When       the    last

 bo d y w a s     cleared         I returned           to the        pitch area and             joined        other

 officers         giving         first     aid    to      those      s t i ll    on the       pitch.

 As a      result       of    climbing        through          the     g ate     I trapped        the     s ol e    of my

  left     bo ot a n d       suffered a minor                ankle       strain which           has     now     cleared          up.

 F r o m what       I could        see     throughout            the     incident        the    problem         seemed       to

  stem     from     the      large      number       of     people       attending           outside      the      g r o u n d at

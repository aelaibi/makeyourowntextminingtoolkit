Dear Mr Whalley

In answer to your questions of 7 July 1989, I have caused the issues to be
researched and the following is applicable:

Police Constable               refers to people in the Spion Kop urinating over
Police Officers (Statement attached S .2768) and Mr Irvine Patwick, OB E, M.P.,
wrote a letter (attached) referring to this specific al.l egation. It may be
other Police Officers will refer tc this aspect but until all of the statements
are entered onto the system 1 cannot give you further information,

                  |, a blacksmith, describes fourteen distinct burns to one of
the Police Horses on duty on 15 April 1989.   This horse was at the Leppings
Lane entrance and used by PC 2316 SCOTT. 1 enclose the statements of        Iand
      for your information.

I trust this information is sufficient at tins Lime.


Yours faithfully




M J FOSTER
Detective Chief Superintendent

               and     I then took           up mobile         van     patrol        on serial No 62.              Under       the

               I saw at this              time     that all         the    public       houses were           e x t r e m e l y full      of

               football           fans    ma i n l y from Mott i ngham *                Also        the off     licens     were

'//■ai 1 s at      the    sides    of the     road were       covered        in empty       beer       tins and

also     the       public     house    near      to the    ground only         looked to be

a p p r e c i a b l y empty after 2 * 1 3           pm.,   I also       noticed that many of the                        fans

walking         to the ground a p p e a r e d          to be d r u n k .

a t t e n d e d at the Pe n i s t o n e       Road end arid parked             up the       van.        We    entered

in this area *               I saw at      this     time   that    fans      in the Spion Kop were

I and      rest of the officers                  present      then were directed            to     take up

p o s ition on the touchline                  of the N o r t h S t a n d and across               the    centre

i ins    of t.it' pitch,            when     1 too?-: up position            I saw that          large       numbers

of fans were a l r e a d y on the                  pitch on the west           stand end and that many

of the       fans        in the N o r t h S tand a p p e a r e d     to be aggravated,,                 1 did not

at    this      stage      know what       the     s i t uation was     in the West          S tand and            it

appeared           only to       be a pub'i i c order        situation,.         A number         of    fans on tr.e

pitchy       Liverpool           f a n s , were abus i n g myself         and other         officers          and       1

clearly         remember         tnat man y of them,          smelt     of    beer    and other          alcholic

drinks,         it was       only after a few minutes                that the     sit u a t i o n      became

clear,.         An    inspector       i n structed me         to assist in removing                bodies          and

the     injured from the              pitch and       I helped to         carry      fans    off       using

advertising              hoardings      as   stretchers,.         The    first    one       I helped to            carry

off     was a whits male, probably                  in this    thirties           and a p p e a r e d to           be

overweight -              I cannot     remember what          he was w e a r i n g     he was          carried          to

the     rear       of the N o r t h    Stand,        He was obv i o u s l y dead.           At    the        rear       of

the     N o r t h Stand offic e r s were            taking     the      bodies       into    the    gym so         I

             returned          Id the     playing         area,      1 then a s s i s t e d fans with another

             hoarding          taking another             fan    into    the    rear      of the    stand.          I cannot

             describe          the   fan other         than he was a white                 youth,       h© a p p e a r e d    to have

             a leg      injury.          I left       him at the area            i n b ©tween the N o r t h Sta nd and

             the S p i o n Kop,           I then       returned         to the     pitch near           to the West Stand.,

             I saw that           there were a number                of fans       laid on the grass               who       looked

             injured,            I went    to speak          to them but g e n e r a l l y         they were         distressed

             dy the          sit u a t i o n and they        smelt      of a l coholic        drink,.       There      were also        a

             number          of fans w h o      were acting          vio l e n t l y    towards     myself and other

             officers, but they were                   being      r e strained         by other     fans.         Under      the

             circumstances              I did    not      think    it was wise            to arrest        these     individuals,

             in other          circumstances           1 w ould      neve      done as they were              hindering

             could see that              the    s i t u a t i o n was well       in hand w ith fans               in the       goal

             area and          I returned        to    the      centre    line of         the   pitch and         gen e r a l l y

             assisted          in telling        fans        where      to go when needing               to know how to             check

             if friends           and    relatives        were     to go,The           gr o u n d was    then emptied and we

             were     debriefed         both at the             ground

             and at      the      police       garage        before      going     off duty       back to sect i o n at 7 pr*

pitch arrd were            then o r d e r e d by an          inspector           to form a cordon                 facing

the N o r t h S t a n d       in order     to    prevent          the    supp o r t e r s       in that         stand from

leaving        their      seats an d      coming          onto    the    pitch,

As    I entered         the    playing     area       I saw that          there were             thousands         of

L i v erpool      supporters       already           on the       pitch and           there was a l r e a d y a

police         cordon along        the    halfway          line    preventing              the Liverpool

supporters          from corrsi ng       into    contact w ith the N o t t i n g h a m fans,

I saw numerous Liverpool                   fans a t t e m p t i n g       to get           through this           cordon

ar;d shouting abuse a i m e d at                 the N o t t i n g h a m        fans.         After a p p r o x i m a t e l y

15 minutes          I saw a s e r geant a p p r o a c h myself                   and

the other        officers       with me and               I thought       T heard him say that D

Division        officers       should      report          to the       gym,.     I was         unaware         as to

whether        he said 8 or D so            I went          to the gym behind                   the N o r t h S tand to

check,.        On arrival       at the      gym       I saw officers              clearing           away the       tables

and    chairs and          I asisted       them until             the floor           of    the gym was           cleared

0 f f u r n it u r e ,
                     .

Im m e d iatley      that     this was      done          I saw bodies           being        brought       i nto the

gym,        I could see that             I was       of    no further           use    in the gym and              so   I

joi n e d a stretcher            crew w h i c h was a man short                       owing      to one         of their

team having          to    remain w i t h a casualty.

We    p r oceeded onto the            pitch and helped                  carry dead            bodies      from the goal

m o u t h area      to the     gym,      After        some       time at about              4 ,00    pm the

c a sualties        had been       removed       from the          pitch and           I returned          to the

co r d o n ,

Of    the    dead      I saw several        of       them had v o m i t t e d and               I noticed         that at

least       three    of these,        adult      casualties,             smelled           s t r o n g l y of

1 n t o i ca n t s ,

Whilst       in the       cordon    I saw one Liv e r p o o l             fan openly u r inating                   in front

of Po l i c e    officers       and one         of    this       group of about               4 men a t t a c k e d a

              advised        to    return to the          standing a rea away from the                     pitch,        I saw a

              numbsr      of Liverpool             fans    swearing,        shouting    abuse        at both Police             and

              Nottingham           fans.        Man y of these Liver poo 3. fans             were         under    the

              influence           of drink and several               were    comp l e t e l y drunk,.        Some were

              overcome         by emot i o n and          I saw a group of          these attack a photographer

             Police       Cordon,             I saw   several       L i verpool   fans a s s i s t i n g     with    the

              casualties          and these           people were      using a d v e r t i s i n g    hoardings          to    carry

              off the        injured and dead.

             At    about 4,45               pm I located      the    officers     who were        from the same

15th April        1989      Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

The following are my recollections of the above date




•
" I viaz in the room I use as an office at home when my wife came to inform
   of 'trouble' shown on television at the foot-ball match being played at
   •fieia Wednesdays' Football ground and switched on and moved a
   t e l e v i s i o n set to enable me to watch the scenes.

It, became compulsive viewing and I virtually stopped work on my word
processor .

It be;ame obvious after several telephone interruptions by reporters to me
I should leave home and find out what was happening. My wife informed me
t.:;.-u -,t. .iff were being called into Hospitals.

1 left home I am not aware at what time and went to the Royal Hallamshire
Hospital parked in Glossop Road and went into the hospital spoke with a
                  H a n d inquired if they were OK she implied they were it was
v e r y o u s y and I left just as a physician some one that I did not know
o t t e r e d to help and was instructed to see if any patients could be sent
   rp,0




From there I decided to visit Hanunerton Road Police Station which I
considered would be used by the Police. When I arrived near Hammerton Road
the police were assisting traffic ,a double deck coach from Liverpool was
parked outside Hillsborough Barracks opposite Hillsborough Boys Club on
Langsett Road .

I went in to- the Boys Club which was crowded with people including police
officers who were speaking to people present whom I deduced were from
Liverpool , I inquired of a police who was in charge , and he pointed to a
clergy man I said Hello to a police officer who recognised me and left and
went to Hammerton Road   police station which was very busy and after
introducing myself to a police constable decided to move off.

The next place to visit was the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground ,1
parked in Leppings Lane and went toward the main entrance produced my House
of Commons pass and requested to see the Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club. After a while the person on the door informed me that he had
gone home and that admission to the club was not possible.

Leaving the ground I saw a Radio Sheffield mobile transmitter and was
invited by David Holmes a political reporter if I would care to do an
interview which   I did-. Robert Jackson Radio Sheffields sports reporter then
spo.Ke with me .  They informed me that The Hon. Colin Moynih'an     MPThe
Minister for Sport was flying to Sheffield but did not know how or where he
would land.

Having a mobile telephone I tried to obtain the ministers mobile telephone
number whilst still at the ground the mobile telephone number of the
Minister from a   colleague David Evans MP but he did not have it.

I spoke with rny Private Secretary Miss Daphne Hickson at her home in London
by mobile telephone .I informed of a paper I had left in a file on her desk
with the ministers mobile phone number and inquired how I could obtain this
information from the file .She stated that no staff would be on duty to do
       but offered to go to her office and then telephone me back with the
p W i e number. She did just that and informed she had spoken to the duty
officer at the D. of E. The minister was leaving Biggin Hill at 9.00 pm was
in his car and I may just catch him. The time was then about 8. 30pm. I went
on to the S. Y Police H. Q.left my car on a double yellow line whilst I went
in to ask if I may see the Chief Constable I had to show my identity to the
officer on duty whom I later discovered had answered a public call for off
duty police officers to report for duty he gave me a visitors pass,I
inquire'! wnere to park and was informed the Police car park was full and so
went to park niy car elsewhere, I tried to telephone the Minister but was
nri       .'>t ul. 1 then walked back to HQ. and was informed that the Chief
Constable was tied up giving TV interviews one crew was with h i m and
another waiting.
                                                   .<• ''

I a£;ain telephoned the minister who answered I explained the situation
looked grim offered him and his press officer accommodation if they were
staying and inquired of the place the helicopter they were to travel to
Sheffield by would be landing .He did not know but requested   I should meet
him and the police would know his place of landing .

Radio Hallam rang me for an interview I took a note of the number and
stated I would call up afterwards.

The PC on duty rang the Chief Constables staff officer and then informed me
that the Deputy Chief Constable would be coming to see me in reception .The
Deputy Chief Constable Peter Hayes came to see me and I inquired where the
minister was to land .he was unaware of the visit but thought other
Ministers were probably visiting tomorrow (Sunday morning). He checked out
if the Minister of Sport was visiting Saturday confirmed this and would be
landing at the Niagara Ground. I inquired how long the flying time was- we
discussed this -and I concluded an hour and a quarter plus.

I thanked him handed back my visitors pass and left the building I
telephoned Radio Hallam agreed to be interviewed and then walked up to the
station and gave the interview .Jim Greensmith the head of news at the
station then inquired if the minister was visiting which I confirmed he
asked where he would be landing which I declined to give but after further
inquiry indicated it could be on the football ground side of the city. He
informed me the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary were to visit the
next day.

I left Radio Hallam and went to Niagara Ground and arrived at the SY Police
Transport dept, arid wearing casual clothes was challenged by a police
officer I my produced my identity and requested information on the
helicopters landing site he directions which were the sports ground just at
the rear of the building. I then went by car to the ground and parked.

It must have been then around 9.30 pm. . some while later police cars
arrived and moved on to the sports field and manoeuvred into position made
  cross with on the ground with headlights and set the blue lights going .

I locked my car and moved towards the senior police officers who were
gathering. A Chief Superintendent David Duckworth whom I knew from my years
as a senior member of South Yorkshire County Council when he had a lower
rank asked if I would go and speak with some of the officers that had been
on duty at the     stadium , he stated they were down inthe dumps .This I
readily agreed     to .Someone who Ithink   was a senior officer came toward                     the
Chief Superintendent and attempted to console! each other.

I moved into the building there were many officers I noted a sergeant and a
superintendents'crown on jackets amongst those present they were sitting
around in groups they were wearing police sweaters it was very quiet and my
reception I would describe as 'frosty*.
I moved away from them and was greeted by a Sergeant not on duty in mufti
who was cn sick leave I had met during my South Yorkshire Council days, We
spoke I inquired if he was         better when an officer detached himself from     a
sitting around      a nearby table and said    words to the effect I quote 'Did     I
want to know the truth' I indicated that I did and the following is my
recollection .1 was taken back to his table and from police officers around
this table I heard the following which I will try to convey Just as I heard
it : - ‘Soma of the supporters were pissed out of their minds . They were
pissing on us while we were pulling the dead and injured out they were
swearing at us kicking and punching us and hampering our work'. One seated
showed me the marks of the kicks on his left trouser leg and the marks on
his skin. Another one informed h o w the crowd had lifted up a Police horse
how the fans had been crawling beneath the horses and inqiuired if I was
like him and        gave them a wide berth I affirmed this
One said ' I        picked up a girl she was dead she was in my arms her blouse
was torn she        had no b r a ' on her breasts were exposed when someone shouted
at me throw over here we'll fuck her. It was booze that did it~you speak up
for us tell them in Parliament what happened. '

I was advised by senior officers to take what had been said           'with a pinch
of salt '.The lights of the helicopter indicated its arrival and I left to
greet the minister and introduce him to the Senior police officers present.
I informed the minister of what I had heard.
On Monday the press were telephoning me with 'stories' they had heard and
on Tuesday           18th April the media were on to the story of looting, violence
a n a drink and could I confirm this. Some calls were taken by my secretary
a n d not returned by me .Despite the fact on those two days I did not speak
to s o m e newspapers and yet some took and printed a garbled tale. On the 19th
of April a Graham Boon of Whites News Agency asked if I could confirm the
p o l i c e had found dead bodies outsided the ground I could not and asked why
after a telephone conversation yesterday with a colleague I                    some
comment.3 had beeen attributed to me the day before which I had not made. He
a p o l o g i s e d and informed me it had been garbled by others that had used it.

Eventually after being sickened by the 'myths ' that had sprung up about
the disaster I repeated the story in part to the media in order to correct
the rumours circulating the police officers had related to me .
A p m not aware of names ranks or numbers of the officers but do believe
W e y were telling me the truth.


    What a reporter says I said, is always open to misrepresentation.
    For a true record of what I said, the television video recording
    will no doubt be available.

I have       in the      past w o r k e d    for seven years at New m a r k e t                   and w o uld

describe         myself    as having         a very broad           e xperience           of horse matters.



On   1st March,          1988    (010388)         I c o mmenced a contract                 with    the S

Y o r k s h i r e Police     Force      as a farrier            to the    horses          based at the Niag a r a

M o u n t e d Stables       in H i l l sborough,          Sheffield.,          I also,       when       required,

visit      stables       in Barnsley,.



My   contract          is flexible       in that        one week        it may       be    the horses are          ail

in order         but    I try to go down at               least     every other            day    to    check    the

horses,.         On average       i probably work               nine    hours       a week at the Niag a r a

Ground,        I know all        nine    horses       that are kept            at    the gro u n d well          and

have     on many o c c asions           shoed and tended them.



In p a rticular          I have    reason         to recall        one horse         known as Si Iverwood.,

He   is a bay about             16 hands      high.        He     is a geld i n g w i t h a white               Maize

down the         centre    of his       face.       He has a black mane and tail and                            in my

experience            of horses    he    is one       of the most         placid horses                1 have    come

across.          PC D a v i d Scott,        who    I now know          personally,          has    been the       rider

of that       horse      for 2 mo n t h s     at N i a g a r a and       I believe          he used       to    ride

the same         horse w h e n he was         stationed           in Barnsley,



1 recall         on either      Thursday          or Fr i d a y    13t h / 1 4 t h April,         1989    (130489 .

140489)        (the exact       date w o u l d be         in a book       kept      at     the    stables),        i

had o c c a s i o n to shoe Si h'erwood.                   On that       day    I remember             nothing

unusual       about S i I v e r w o o d who        like    the other       horses         was     in immaculate

c:o nd i t i o n ,.



Early      the    following week,            Tuesday       18th April,          1989       (180489)       I returned
                                                                                                                              P AGE
        *                                                                                  S 1764

              to the N i a g a r a aware          that    the horses              w ould have      beer? utilised at            the

              Cu p s e m i      fianl match at         the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y     football          Ground.



              I can only           say when      I saw S i I v e r w o o d        I was    disgusted.           I,    in my 9

              years       e x perience     with horses,            was      not    prepared for what             I saw that

              d a y .,



              Si 1verwood          had numerous        burns,        consistent w i t h          cigarettes           being     put

              oat    on his       skin and       cigarettes          being m a l i c i o u s l y      twisted        into    his

              skin,.       The     burns were       p r e d o m i n a n t l y to his       backside,          round his tail,

              to his       left     side a f the b o d y .



              1 counted          f o u r t e e n dist i nct    bums         and    couId see       nurne rous        other    burns ,.

              There were          burns    to the      tail      itself.          A number       of    the    burns     went

              b eyond the outer            skin and       into the flesh,.                Before       that w e e k - e n d you

              could a p p r o a c h S i I v e r w o o d an d he would               not move,         whe n   I a p p r o a c h e d hi

              that       day    he f l i nched    in a manner              that was       clearly nervous.              I have

              shoed horses           on numerous         occasions           wi t h i n my year        on contract after

              football          matches.       I have     never        seen wounds          of that       nature       before.



              I have       r e t urned on other          o c c asions        since    that T u e s d a y      and the horse              i

Whilst      en route            to the       railway    station along            Halifax

Rd,    we were met              by   large     numbers      of Liverpool            supporters          who were

making      their way            to the ground.            H o w e v e r , I also         saw    literally

hundreds        other Liverpool                suppo r t e r s    sitting      on walls          and at the       sides

of the      road drinking               from     cans and        bottles      of what a p p e a r e d       to be

alcohol,.            They were ma k i n g         no attempt         to go to the              stadium,.



Man y of      those also walk i n g               to the ground           from their            own transport        were

discarded            can s ,.



On arrival            at Wads ley Station,              agai n on        i n s t r uctions       from    Inspector

H a n d Davis,          I took up a position at                   the    front      of    the    train escort

w h i c h had only just arrived,.                      After      a short      period of time,              together

with a I1erseysi.de M o u n t e d officer                    I led the         train escort             down H a l i f a x

Rd to the L e p p i n g s Ln end of the                     stadium.          The    escort was          flanked      on

its    nearside          by six       (6)     other m o u n t e d    officers        and foot        officers.         Th e

bafors'      large        numbers       of    people making          their way       to the ground?             many

of who were          carrying and             drinking       from    cans and       bottles       of    lager    ana

beer and others              sat down and            laid down at        the      sides    of the       footpath,

surrounded          by more       cans       of alcohol,.          I heard man y of these who were                       at

the side       of the        road ask         of    those    on the    train escort          for       spare

match     tickets,.          I did not            see any    pass h a n d s .

no al t e r n a t i v e    but    to allow          it to    intermingle, wit h the m any other

hundreds       of L i v erpool          supporters          who ‘were making         their       own way along

that    road towards             tne    ground,.       Yet    again m any of these were                  consuming

alcohol      from       cans and        Pottles       which,       when emptied,          were    d i s c a r d e d at

the side       of the        road.



On arrival          at the Leppings Ln end of the                      stadium I saw that the area

around     that     end of the           ground was a l r e a d y        inundated wit h a large

influx     of Liverpool            supporters,              Other    mounted       officers we re alre a d y

in position at             that    location dealing                wit h the      control    and       supervision

of the fans          entering          the    ground.         There    did not appear             to    be many

problems       at    this     stage.,



The s i t u a t i o n     on L e p p i n g s ;....n was     such that       the    bridge w h i c h      crosses

the River Don,             adjacent          to    the ground was       t h r o n g e d with      people       who

we re sitting and stand i n g                     about,    still    drinking       cans of       lager     and bee r

and other a l c o h o l i c        beverages.,             These    people making          their way from the

M i d d l e w o o d Rd area to the L e p p i n g s Ln t u r n s t i l e s            via this          bridge    were

then having          to walk       on to the          road    into    the    path of oncoming             vehicular

traffic.         It was        possible           that someone       may have       been    injured as a

On    instructions             from       Inspector H a n d - D a v i s . together with Pol icewoman

Main,         and two        other       Mers e y s i d e    Mounted          officers,      I a t t e m p t e d to

persuade many of the fans a r o u n d                             the    bridge       to move away,           Most

refused         to move and              those who          did m e r e l y      changed     location        to the       othe r

side of the             road and          c o n tinued       d r i nking       from their       cans    and bottles.,

Many of these                people a p p e a r e d         to    be    in drunken states             but    the

si t uation         being as         it w a s , wit h 2                 3,000     persons      in the area,           it was

both     Drastically and                  p h ysically           impossible          to do anythi ng about              this

matter.,          On one occasion,                 I took         it upon myself,           whilst      riding        the

full     length of the               bridge,,       to knock            off    the    bridge    wail    and     into     the

river         numerous        empty       p a rtially        full and u n o pened           cans and         bottles        of

m a :t,n Iy    1a g e r ,.



On my own           initiative            I abandoned             this    idea as       it was       not having         any

desired effect                and    the m a j o r i t y         of the       supporters a p p e a r e d      to treat

our    requests wit h total                    disregard           in that we were             treated to a barrage

of verbal          abuse and             obs ceni t i es .,



At one stage             I do       recall       a radio          transmission          being       passed,     requesting

that Leppings                Ln be closed off                to all       v e h icular     traffic.,



By this         time     1 could see             that       the    t u rnstiles        leading       to the L e p pings

Ln    (standing area)                for L i verpool              supporters         was   very h e a v i l y      con g e s t e d

and    large        numbers         of    them were          literally          pushing     and shoving            in waves

f r o m t It e ha c k o f t h e q u e u e s



Other         mounted        officers were            already           in the area and a p p e a r e d            to be

making         vain    requests           and a t t empts          to stop the          pushing       i n order       that

the    pressure          on those           at the      front          of the     turns t i l e s    could    be

                                                                                                                  S1226



I than took up a position next to the iron perimeter gates which gave

access       to the         standing area and together                       wit h other m o u n t e d officers,

at t e m p t e d    to form a barrier wit h                   horses        through       the    crowd.     The    idea

being      that         pressure       on the     queues       from those              surging    could be

relieved,           til is preventing           possible         injuries          to those most at          risk    is

those      nearest          the turnstiles.              The     fans by this             time were       clearly

incensed,           man y      still    drinking a n d obv i o u s l y             the worse       for wear and

falatant1y r ef used               t o s t o p >;•ushi ng and move                back ,



On numerous              occasions       myself        ana my horse were                 being    pushed    sideways

into     tne metal             uprights w h i c h       su p p o r t e d    the    perimeter       gates.     This

caused more              supporters          to surge      past     me,      aading       to the    c o ngestion

already at the turnstiles,                            A number      of fans also            crawled       on hands and

knees      between my horses                  legs     just    to get        nearer       to the    turnstiles.,



The mood           of the fans were             s o m ewhat      nasty and many             vented their

feelings           at    not    being    able     to get       into        tne ground.,         on myself and       other

mounted       officers.               This    consisted        of obscene              verbal    abuse,    being    spat

on and being              s h o wered w i t h a l c o h o l i c     liquid.



It was      impossible            to m a i n t a i n a static: barrier                   of horses    as the       horses

and    riders           were    literally       being      shoved out             of    the way    by the    surging

mass ,



At one      point         I saw a y oung          boy being          passed over           head high from the

queuing       fans at           the    front    of the        queues        to a sterile area away                from

the turnstiles.                  He a p p e a r e d    to be     in a limp and             dazed state,.



As a result              of 'what      I had seen,         I a g a i n made m a n y         requests       of the mass-

on my nearside                to a g a i n stop      pushing arm to move                  aack,    but      I was a g a i n

met with a car rage                  of abuse,



I also        caught       sight      of a number         of fans scaling                the   perimeter wall

adjacent         to Gate B and gain                 entry     to the       ground.,



A number         of both y o u n g i s h and middis                 aged    s u p p o r t e r s around me who

were      in obvious           fear    for    their     own safety          tried        in vain      to stop the

pushing        from behind            them by s h o uting           v e r b a l l y at    their    fellow

s u p p o f•t e r s .,



Those      entering           the    ground    via the        turnstiles         appeared         to be doing          so

only slowly due                to the      congestion around               them,



I saw two fellow moun t e d                   officers        attempt       to form o r d e r l y queues             on

the a p p r o a c h      to    the turnstiles           but      this was a g a i n a          physical

impossibility,.                They were       lit e r a l l y    being     shoved aside           by sneer weight

of numbers           who      had total       disregard          for    the horses         presence*



At one       point       in the       events,       it was       decided      that       the   iron    perimeter

gates      should        be    closed,       this    providing an extra barrier                       to assist       the

horses       and     prevent         the   incessant        surging        from behind,.           Foot o fficers

on the outer             side       of the    gates a t t e m p t e d      to    p h y s i c a l l y hold them       in a

closed       p o s ition so that             those     fans      nearest      the    turnstiles          could be

made     to enter          the      ground as       sa f e l y as      possible.



Those      fans      to my       nearside      (those       outside        the    perimeter        gates)       some 2 —

3,000      in number were              by this       time     even more          increased,           They were        in

time     being       joined         by still     more     supporters          just a r r i v i n g     at    the

ground,          I tried         to expl a i n      to those        around me        that      people were          being

crushed at        the    front       of    the queues.             Some a p p e a r e d     to u n d e r s t a n d the

problem,       but    others,        still       consuming         a l c o h o l , were     oblivious         to any

form of     reasoning          whasoever,              They     still       attempted       to force         their way

through-        On two occasions                 I assisted           fathers w i t h young            children          to

escape    the melee and through                       the gates        to    relative       safety.,



Some    irrate       fans     insisted          on trying        to    climb over         the    iron gates          and

an occasions          I had     to     refrain         them from doing             so ay p h ysicall y             pul 1 in

them from off oftne              gates,.          I caught        sight      of one youth

behind me with a               lighted          cigarette in his             hand.       He was        being urged o

by some    of     these       around       rum to stub his              cigarette         out    on my horses

hind quarters,              1 attempted           to    refrain him from doing                   so,    but    the

situation       being as        it was,          I could        only speak         to    him severel y about

the    consequences            of     his acti o n s         ie that my horse            may k i ck out and

strike    someone        causing          injury       arm that        he    could     be a r r e s t e d    for    his

behav i o u r ,



As the    numbers        of those          queuing          at the     t u rnstiles       slowly       diminished,

the    iron perimeter           gates       were       slowly opened           so that        those     outside

cou 1 d then f o rm ’queues               i n some      s e mblance         of order,         However,        at    thi s

instant,       a surge        of hundreds             of fans      l i terally s w a m p e d throug h              the

gates    towards        the    t u r n s t i l e s - some        thro u g h the i r own volition,                   but

others,    through          sheer weights              of    numbers        surging     from     behind,



I saw some        people       near       to me       stumble      and fall        to the       ground and          get

t r a m p l e d on by others           in their         eagerness           to get     into     the    ground.

Young    children were              scr e a m i n g    out    in fear        and   I pers o n a l l y       felt at

this    time    that     someone          was   going        to be s e r i o u s l y    injured        in the melee

I made        several          local     appeals       to those       surging         from the         rear      but was

again met with taunts                       and    verbal     abuse       and most       of all,        a blatant

refusal           to      stop surging.             I did notice       that      man y of those a r o u n d me

were     still           drinking        from cans and         bottles.           I m a n a g e d to     confiscate

a nd dispose             of some       of    them but many           refused        to hand         them over.,



The    throng           of    people     in the area at             the    time was          such that        1 felt       it

would        only add to the a l r e a d y                dangerous        sit u a t i o n    if I went          into     the

crowd with my horse,                    that       I gently w i t h d r e w      him.         As well       as     being       in

fear     for my          own safely          and    that    of my horse,            1 was most          fearful         for

the safety of tne                 s u pporters         ar o u n d me,.



Although           radio       recept ion was          poor    due    to the shouting                and scr e a m i n g

round aaout              me >. I do     recall       a mess a g e     requesting             one    of the       concertina

gates        to be opened up to                   relieve     the    pressure        on the turnstiles.

Pe o p l e    were       literally          being    crushed and no amount                    of vocal        or    physical

persuasion               could        prevent it.          I first    noticed       'Gate A ’ being              opened

(this        leads       to the N o r t h         Stand) for        a short       period of time.                  This

a l l o w e d an        influx    of    s upporters         into     the    ground      thus        relieving        the

pressure          at that        location.           This was        followed,         I believe,           a short        time

later        by    'Gate C '.          This also          housed a large            influx         of fans       into     the

West Stand area,.                 I cannot          recall     'Gate S * being               opened a l t h o u g h       it

may well          have        been.     My a t t e n t i o n was      c o n c e n t r a t e d on what         was

hap p e n i n g        directly       towards       me.     1 was     lit e r a l l y being          shoved        into    tne

perimeter              gate    upright      with     no    room for manoeuvre.                     E ven after       the

conce r t i n a         gates    'A ••••• C ’ were        again     in a closed          position there were

still        man y hundreds            of    fans    still     outside        the    ground.



I held my              position as best as                I could     but e v e n t u a l l y w i t n d r e w       to await

further           instructions.              1 was    then d e t a i l e d with         five        other     officers          to
                                                                                                              PAGE

attend at          the     rear of the N o r t h S tand           via Gate        'O'    on standby          for a

possible        pitch       invasion.



On arrival          at that       location         it became      a p p arent     that    there was          no p 1ay-

on the        field and after a short                 time      I saw numerous persons of both

sexes,        both dead and alive              being      carried on m a k e s h i f t         stret c h e r s     from

the    playing area.,           past me       to the gymnasium.              Some       time    later    the m a t c h

was    o f f i c i a l l y a b a n d o n e d ana    I was    d i r ected    to    patrol       the exterior

perimeter          of the stad i u m         in company w ith           Inspector H a n d Davis,              to

supervise          the    dispersal      of fans         from the area,.           I was       later    stoosi down

to N i a g a r a    stables where            I later      retired       from duty.



In my        13 years       e x perience     as a Police         Officer,         8 of which          have    been as

these years,             I have      never    come across        a situation            as bad as       1 have

described.,             The act ions w h i c h      I have       carried out        on this        o c c a s i o n are

similar        to those w h i c h       I have      carried       out    on numerous           previous

occasions          at    football      matches,       but    never      before     have      I been met          with

such    hos t i l i t y and       drun k e n abus i v e      behaviour       from football             fans,       who

seemed,        in the main,           totally      oblivious       to any        requests       for    calm and

Since     the      events of S a t u r d a y       15 April       (150489)        I have       since    i n spected

my horse and             have   found    that      there are       several        lumps      on both     its"       rear

hind and off "-hind quarters,.                     The    coat   surround         those      lumps appears

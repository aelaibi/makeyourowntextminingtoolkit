     Dear Sir

     RE: THE HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

     I am writing in connection with recent correspondence detailing schedules of material
     currently held or viewed by the CPS.

     As indicated, I am in possession of a police report dated 22 April 1990 and associated
     documents stemming from the remarks allegedly overheard by                    made in
     conversation between the late Lord Chief Justice and a Chief Constable.

     The report does not relate to evidential material pertinent to the Hillsborough disaster.

     I have taken the opportunity to discuss the matter with the Director (who is currently away
     from the office) who would, of course, be happy to discuss the matter with you.
     Alternatively, the material is available for inspection at this office or can be forwarded at
     your convenience. I look forward to hearing from you.

     Yours faithfully

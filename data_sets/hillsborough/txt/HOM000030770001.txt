STATEMENT BY LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH ON HIS
VISIT TO HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith today visited Hillsborough Stadium in
Sheffield as part of the independent scrutiny announced by the
Home Secretary on 30 June.

He said:

“I know that a great deal has changed in and around the stadium
since the disaster, including the way police and the club deal with
the large numbers of fans who attend each match.

“However, I wanted to familiarise myself with the site of the events
of 15th April 1989, and with the atmosphere and build-up to a
major match.

“I am planning to go to Liverpool shortly to meet the relatives of
those killed and their legal representatives.

“The meetings I have will be private and I will not be making any
public comments on the evidence or representations which are
made to me during the course of the scrutiny. I hope to report my
findings to the Home Secretary towards the end of the year.”

“Anyone who feels that they are able to submit material to me
should contact my secretary via Room 1106, Home Office, 50
Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT.”

Please contact Sarah Clifford at the Home Office Press Office on
tel. 0171 273 4610 if you require further details.

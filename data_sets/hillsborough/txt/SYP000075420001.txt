            I am a single woman and I have lived at the above address all my life

            with my father and brother.



            I work as an accounts          clerk at the Geographical Association,          343

            Fulwood Road, Sheffield           10.



            At about     1.00pm   (1300)    on Saturday      15th April   1989 (150489) my

            boyfr iend                     'came to my home address.        He had been to the

            Beehive Public                 D yk e s h a l 1 Road, Hillsborough that morning and

            had managed to buy two tickets for £6.00 each,                 from a man in the pub

            who he d i d n ’t know.    The tickets were for the West Stand Standing area,



            We left my house and walked to the ground via Wadsley Lane.

                  At the junction of Wads ley Lane a nd Middlewood Road,                     there    is a pub

                  called The Park this would be about                    1.50pm (1350).   In front of the

                  pub is a small      car park and thjjje^we could see about                 10 to 12

                  Liverpool supporters sat jem the wall, with a couple of cans of beer

                  each,   they weren't c a u s i n g   any problems.          There were also some        police

                  there just keVptng their eye on them.



                  We carried on towards the ground along Leppings Lane.                        Along Leppings

                  Lane there were some Liverpool           supporters asking us for spare tickets

                  but not causing any problems and there were police there walking up

                  and down.



                  When we got to the ground about/S-'QoOprn (1400)                 the turnstiles were

                  inside and I saw one lad b/ring searched.



                  I ’ve been to Hi 1 IsborougfT many times before and I knew exactly where                         I

                  wanted to stand to waftch the match, so              ind I went to the

                  When we got     into the stand it was quite full but not packed.



                  From where we were stood you couldn’t actually see the tunnel                          that

                  runs under the West Stand,           but at about 2.30pm          (143p4    I could see

                  People began climbing over the fences                    into pens 2 and 5 and people

                  were being pulled up into the West Stand above the pens.                           What I
                                                                      PAGE         3
                                                                      SI 968

co ul dn’t understand why people were having to climb out, and I could

see that the gates at the rear of pens 3 and 4 which lead into pens 2

and 5 were closed.



I think that there was a lack of police       in the pens themselves because

usually they do have them there.



From 2.30pm   (1430)   onwards there were just more and more    people going

into pens3 and 4 and not into the wings.        I could actually see then

that   people were getting   crushed because they were having to climb out.



Kick off started at 3.00pm     (1500) and th^Cs when people started
                                          /
climbing over the front fencing onto p rte     pitch.   A few police went

over to the West Stand and for ttajs'next couple of minutes were

actually helping people over.      More and more fans were coming over the

top of the fence and as they were coming out of the pens more were

coming   in from the tunnel.



Then a policeman ran over to the referee and the match was stopped

straight away.



I saw children being     pulled over and more fans corning over the front

fences and people were just collapsing on the pitch.         The police,    fans

and St J o h n ’s Ambulance men were trying their best to pull people over.



I think it was about half past three when lots of police officers           came

onto the pitch from the Spion Kop/North End corner and they just

formed a line across the centre of the pitch,       standing facing the West

Stand.

                                                                                 S1968

            Meanwhile the other police officers and fans/tfere still     pulling people

        »   over the fence onto the pitch.  The fan^/lhen started to use the

* W G 2 T   advertising boards to stretcher pe(bj>ite across to the Spion Kop/North

            Stand corner.



            All   through this the policemen across the middle of the pitch remained

            where they were to prevent any Liverpool     supporters going over to the

            Notts Forest supporters     in the Kop.



            The stretchers   carrying people across the pitch went on for a long

            time.    One ambulance   came onto the pitch and stopped behind the goal

            posts at the West Stand,     it was just a terrible situation,   fans,

            police officers, ambulance men,      stewards were everywhere giving the

            kiss of life to people,    giving them heart massage.    It just seemed to

            go on forever.


                                                                      NJ <b I 3 0
            I don't how long that we were there for, but I remember Kenny D/>LGLISH
            C/VT      I T-w/sioy   /                                       ~T        '

            speaking over the taryroy telling us that it was a terrible situation

            and to compl^NwdJWI^the    police.



            Then another message     came over to tell us all to stay put until they

            had got the ambulances away.



            So after that and I d o n ’t know how long it was we came away from the

            ground and went home.                (sgd)

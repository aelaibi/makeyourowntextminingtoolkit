seen       outside          the    shop.           Most     of      t h e se    men       walked          across       the       road       into

The       crowd      seemed        good       natured          on    the       whole          and    the    biggest          problem             fa

the      fans     seemed          to    be    where       to     urinate.                Myself       and       Constable          POL

EKWUBIRI          stood        in the         White       Horse        grounds,               stopping          people       urinating

in the          rear     yard      and       monitoring             their       behaviour.

The     only      facts       regarding             the      death       toll,       were         what      wa s    being       overhear

on    the      car     radios       of       the    fans.



The     f a ns    were       quiet       and       subdued         on    the       whole,         but      many were           obviously

distressed             and    upset       at       what      had happened.                   Some        were      angry       and     we

received          comments          from          some      of    them       s u c h as,         " Y o u ’ re f u c k i n g     shit,"

"Satisfied             now?"       and       "I    hope      you       can    sleep         tonight."              The     comments

were     ignored             due    to    t he      situation            being         potentially               very     volatile.

People         wh o    asked       us    for       advice         were       told      to    telephone             their       families

as    a matter          of    priority.                 Eventually            the      crowds         cleared,           apart       from

the     odd      person awaiting                   and      looking          for    family and              friends.            We

resumed          to C l a y w h e e l s       Ln.        After         something            to    eat      we    resumed        to M a i n

St P o l i c e        Station       and went             off      duty       at    7.15      pm     (1915).

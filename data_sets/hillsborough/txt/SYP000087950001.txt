the fans were              trying      to   climb out        of a very overcr o w d e d       pan.

I s u ggested we          leaVe     the blue ones where             they were.

quieten this          chanting, as some of the Liverpool                   spectators,,         who were

iware of the enormity ofXjis                     tragedy,     were    becoming       very aggressive.

I suppose             in planning adv ert i s i n g                                hoardings,               it would not be

impossible                to construct               the hoarding                         so that           it could be used as
                                                                                                         P AGE     7
                                                                                                         S32c! 1

           stretchers         in an emergency,      with the handles        clipping        into   receptors



           Tne       problem of using      the hoarding at H i l l s b o r o u g h   that    very often the

           patients         fell   from them and    landed on the ground             (this was     due   to the

           fact      that    they were    t 1at and not      curved).

                 We did not make any stqrps on the way to Sheffield,                               but we   did

between junctions                   twenty one and twenty tt^ff.                The delays a pp ea r ed         to

he due to the                 amount    of traffic.

We a r r i v e d    in        She ff ie ld at about half         past one.         We    parked the van          in

a side     street             off   the main dual         carriageway that          leads to the ground,

Pen is to n e Rd.             I think    it was.         I c a n ’t remember      the    name    of the    road,

but    it was about             half a mile       from the ground.               There was a large          pub

on the     corner         of the dual          carriageway and the side                 street.     I cant

reraember the            name of the        pub which was             closed that afternoon.

As we were         parking the van,             there were            other Liverpool       supporters          also

parking/up.              As    I m e nt io ne d e a r l i e r / I went        to Sheffields without a

mat ch /t i cket.                      d i d n ’t have         ticket    eitner

other     supporters            to see     if .they had any spare               tickets.        We were

lucky,     the second               person that we a p p ro a ch e d had two spare tickets.

The man,      who was           unknown to me., a ^ked for more                  than the face       value       of

the pickets,             w hich was      six   pou/ds and for the Leppings Ln.                     standing

area.      I paid the man twent $                 odd pounds           for    the two tickets.        We    then

had a slow walk                towards V h e    ground,

There were a lot of                   people making        their way          towards    the ground and

they were all             in good spirits.               Ail    the    pums    on the way to the ground

were    closed,          but there were          off— 1i c e n c a / open on- the way to the

ground.       There were              long queues at the o ff -l icences a nd there were a

lot of Liverpool                supporters       sittings outside             pubs drinking       from cans

bought     from off-licences.                  I diu^^sot see any fighting                 or any

disorder.          I did see a few supporters who were                          obviously drunk,          but

they w e r e n ’t any harm to anybody.                         There were also supporters             carrying

cans    in the street.                 I h a d n ’t been to H i l l s b o ro u gh before.           I ’m not

the way to the                ground who were giving              directions       to fans,       we just

followed the             crowd.        As we got nearer tne ground,                 we decided to nave a

walk around the                stadium,     just out of curiosity.                 We wese able       to walk

    around         the stadium quite freely.                   Because we weren't           q u i t e sure

    exac tl y where          to go,       we followed the crowd and even tu al ly a r r i v ed at

    people across.              There were           four queues,       one at each set of turnstiles.

    Myself and                    joined the          left hand queue          intending to enter             through

    the   turnstile          to the       left hand side. /The             queues were moving             steadily

    towards        the turnstiles.                By a b o u ^ iialf past t w o , the volume          of      people

    was   so great          inside       the turnstile area that               .it became a s p l id mass             of

    p e o p 1e .    There were           no qujmss at all          now.     It was a real          free for all

    I was     now being          c r u s h e ^ i n the      crowd outsi^fe.        I have been in crushes

    before at football matches                       but this w a ^ t h e      worst     crush    I have      been

    in.     There were           still        moun te d    policemen    in the turnstile a rea a t that

    time,     but such was              the    pressure      f/om the     crowd,    that the officers were

    i n danger of bei ng knocke d from the i r h o r s e s .                       I d o n ’t r em e mb e r

    outside        the turnstiles.                At some stage        I was    crushed up against a wall

    to the         left of the turnstiles,                  but m a na ge d to push myself away from

    there.         E v e nt u al l y    I got     towards a turnstile,           the one second from the

    right as you            look at       the front.          There was a P ol i ce m an at the entrance

    to the turnstile              who was         trying     to get    people    through the turnstile as

    quick as he           could.         He w a s n ’t searching        them.      I remember       that      there

    was an anno u n ce me nt             from     inside     the ground at aba j / f       that    time.        The

side w aiting        tor me*        whilst      outside the      turnstiles,         I did not see

any gates         open other than the turnstiles,                 neither       did I see any gates

being      opened.     I did       not see any u n a u t h o rised epfcry           into the ground,

but at about         the    time    that    I met up with                  a gain    inside      the

ground?      I saw a number          of supporters        on j m e   wall above           the turnstile^

 These      supporters were showing                the i r y ^ t ch tickets      to th^

police      below and       pleading       to be let     into the ground. / Ihe Police

were      telling    them to get          back down and enter         throt^h a t u r n s t i l e .              The

 s upporters        just wai te d on the wall?            they wereyr^rt going            back    down       into

 the      crush outside.           Myself    and              had a look at the            rear of       the

s tand to see where              to go.     We d i d n ’t see any signs          telling      us wnich

way to go and all            we    could see was        the    central     tunnel     running

u n d e r n e a t h the West Stand.          The tunnel        a pp ea r ed to be the        sole way

onto      the terraces.          /Ae paid a visit to the gents toilet and then

went      into the tun/el.            I did not see any fighting                or any form of

disorder      inSyide/ the ground?           neither     did y see any          people      drinking.

T here were        no police       or stewards at j/Ke e n t r a n i ^ t o          the tunnel         or

an ywhere     inside       it.     In fact?      I saw four      pq/^icemen on the           inside         of

the turnstiles ? but              didn't see another           one until       1 was a ct ua ll y       into

the    central      pens,    where     I saw P ol i ce m en on the track             next    to the

pitch.       We    had a free       passage along        the tunnel        and at the        bottom there

 was      still    a small       bit of    rpom at the        rear of the       central      pens.          We

went      slightly to the          righ/at       the end of the        tunnel       and    into what         I

now know as         pen number       |fliree,      1 he time at that        point, was about, ten to

t h res       ne    players       t/ua/l not yet    come out onto the           pitch.       It was         our

                  to go across       to the      right hand side         diagonally,         to get         to

the    right hand      corner       flag.       1 though^at        the time that           it was a large

open terrace and that we                  could get aytross to the             corner flag.            We werw

down there were               steady surges           backwards       and forwards           on the         terraces.

The    surges would            carry you down two or three                      steps    but you          could

regain your          position after.                 Wi th in four or five minutes we were

towards       the    front       of the       pen?    when we      came up against a crush barrier.

 It was about            then that                    said to me that there was a dividing

fence     to our         right,      which       prevented us from getting                  further across                     the

 terraces.           Because         of this?        we decided to w atch tbar match from behind

came    out onto         the     pitch?       it became       very tight A n the terraces?                              there

was a real          increase         in pressure.            The   surgsfs/had been iTior'S/frequent

just    before       it becanj^f very tight.                  It was     j ust after                  to three

able       to climb out         from the         pen like    I did.      I was walking a ro un d          in a

virtual       daze     looking       for    him.      1 tried to have a look              i n s i d e the pens

a g ai n    to see     if    I could see him,             but by now there was/a            line of Police

in front          of the     pens    preventing        people    from go i n q y M .c k    towards      the

pens.        I had been w an d er i ng about               for b e tw ee n/ te n and fifteen minutes

when       I saw              standi rtg near to the goal,               having a cigarette.              I

went       straight     ova f    and we hugged each other.                  We    then decided to see

if we       could h&ap out           in any way and made a start                  by ripping      down

a.,dv e r t is i n /iioa r d i n g s ..    We    ripped down a hoarding            from    in front      of the

S ou th St^rni.         It was       the    second hoarding along            from L ep pings Ln end.

We went       back to the goal area and saw a line of                            people    lying on the

ground all          in varying        states       of physical      injury.        There was a w om an

tending       to a lad on the              pitch who was        near    to the     penalty spot,         in

front       of the goal.            We asked       if we    cotrid help     in any way.          The w oman

said she          thought     he was alright,             b u y I could see the         lad was

unconscious.            We    rolled this          lad </\\to the      hoarding and wit h the            help

of other          lads we     picked the hoWrding up and started                       running    to the       far

left       hand    corner    of the ground,            in between the S pion            Kop and     the North

Stand.        The    time     then was about                                                 ^                the

rear       of the hoarding with my hand on the                      lads    neck,      feeling    his    pulse.

I remember          that     it became          harder and harder        to find a puj.se.

                                                                                 At the other end of

the ground we went               into a courtyard area,                u nd er ne at h the N or th Stand.

It was       next to the g y mn as iu m            I think.      There were        numerous      other
                                                                        /
people       lying     in that area,             both dead and a y i v e .        We   put the hoaruing

down and an a m b u l a n ce m an           came over and         hay a look at         the lad .       The    lad

was    then       placed on a stretcher and the                   a m bu l a n c e m a n took over.      I'm

not sure          if this     lad was       dead or alive,        but    if he was alive he

a p p e a r e d to be       in a bad way.           The    lad was a white male a n d about               six.

                         emember a ny thing           else about           him.     Having       left the >ad

             u n d e r n e a t h the N or th Stand,        we    picked up the hoardingyragain and went

             to    return to the L ep pi ng s Ln.               end.        As we were walking              back towards

             the    pitch,       we saw a body         lying on the g r o u n d .               yt was a male

                                    The man was        probably        i                fties and was obviously

             dead.       There were         other     dead bodies                  irii a s w e l l .     This appeared to

             be where        the bodies were           laid before           being m oved         into the gymnasium,

             Upon seeing           the man,               shouted over             to a P ol i ce m an who was

             standing        nearby.        He shouted,         "Cover him up

             The P o l i c e m an    replied,,       " H e ’s dead".

                       went      frantic      then,    he shouted,           "For F        —     s sake,     cover   him up

             then,     show him some F                g respect then".

                       then stormed           off and     I had to grab him and hold him back.                             I

             d o n ’t think        he was     going    for the Policeman,                he was         probably going         to

             cove r up the body hirnself .

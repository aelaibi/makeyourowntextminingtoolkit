Mr Chilcot

HILLSBOROUGH - POLICE OPERATIONS

I am replying to your note of 25 April.

2. Sir Cecil Clothier tells me that he has written to Mr Wright
about the proposed arrangements in the event of complaint by a
member of the public about Hillsborough. This includes the
proposal that in the event of a complaint Mr Dear should be
appointed as the investigating officer for the purposes of PACE.
Mr Wright has acknowledged Sir Cecil's letter but has said that
he wishes to consult Lord Justice Taylor and Mr Dear. I
understand that the latter has some misgivings about taking on a
dual role but Sir Cecil is in close touch with Lord Justice
Taylor and thinks that there should be no difficulties. I shall
let you know when I hear something more.
3. From recent correspondence and discussions I know that the
West Yorkshire team is alive to the need to serve notices under
section 7 of the Police Discipline Regulations in appropriate
cases.

RE. HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

I attach a letter that I have received from Jim Anderton whereby
he draws my attention to articles that have appeared in the Guardian
newspaper which quote at some length from the A.C.P.O. Guide to
Policing Football.   I am not sure precisely sure what he is complaining
of here other than a concern that the A.C.P.O. guides have been
disclosed to the media. He also makes the point that the style and
context of the articles are calculated to predjudice the work of
Lord Justice Taylor.

I must say I find it difficult to support him in his contention given
that it was inevitable that any guides given by A.C.P.O. in respect
of the policing of football matches would end up as the subject of
press comment.  I cannot conceive of a situation that the A.C.P.O.
Guide to Policing Football will not become the subject of debate and
discussion during the hearing of the Inquiry.  It seems to me to be
inextricably linked to the evidence that will be given by police
officers in support of some of the decisions they made on the day.
I think Lord Justice Taylor would not entertain the view that the
information contained in this guide cannot be disclosed without the
approval of the Chairman of the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee.

As to the suggestion that the articles might prejudice the work of
the police inquiry team and that ofLord Justice Taylor, I cannot
think that what the Guardian has to say will inhibit any evidence or
discussion which will take place at the actual Inquiry.

In short, I am not terribly sympathetic to the views expressed by
Jim Anderton, but he obviously woud like Lord Justice Taylor to be
aware of his concern and no doubt you will get an opportunity of
referring the matter to the Judge when an opportunity arises.

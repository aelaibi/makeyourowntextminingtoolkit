Dear Sir


As yew may be aware every Saturday on TV-am, the Saturday Shorts
prograrane runs a telepoll in which we ask viewers to ring in and
register their vote on a sporting topic.


We thought the result of our telepoll after the tragic events at
Hillsborough would be of sane interest to you.


The question was "Should our football stadiums be all seating?"
75% said yes, 25% said no, out of a total of 5161 calls over a one
hour period.


Yours

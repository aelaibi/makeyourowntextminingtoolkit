                                                            27th April, 1989.



Secretary to the Inquiry,
Room 662,

London.   SW1H 9AT.




Dear Sir,


I would welcome the opportunity of writing this letter to explain our experiences
during the afternoon of 15th April at Hillsborough, Sheffield.      I would also
point out that due to our experience at Gate 'A1, prior to kick-off, it was in
my mind then, to write a letter of complaint to Liverpool Football Club, but
due to the final outcome of this football match I feel this letter may now bear
greater significance.


We entered Sheffield by car following the route which was advised by police for
those supporters coming across the M62 (North Sheffield), finding a parking place
in a side street at 2.00pm.      It could be assumed that most supporters had
already arrived by this time as we had no great difficulty with traffic jams
leading in or when we were heading for a street to park our car.      I should
also say that this was practically the same spot at which we parked in 1988 for
the semi-final.      By our experience of the previous year we felt quite
comfortable by the time of our arrival and started to walk to Hillsborough at
approximately eight minutes past two.


Our walk to Hil-lsborough took approximately fifteen minutes at which one would
expect still leave enough time to take our seats by 2.45pm as requested      at the
rear of ticket.      On our way to Hillsborough we passed numerous fans who were
consuming beer from cans but not once did I see drunkenness or any other signs
of trouble     and there was quite a strong police presence on the road to the
ground.      A fifty yard distance from the ground was now fairly heavyily
 2/




populated with fans and the police presence on the main street was not so
evident except for a side street which was blocked off with barriers and manned
by three or four police.     Our arrival at the gate 'A' area at 2.30pm seemed
to be one of total confusion and there were no queues being formed, infact I
never saw a policeman at this part at all.       It was as if you just joined the
rear of a mass of people and you would eventually filter through the turnstiles.
Within minutes one became engulfed in the crowd and it also grew very
uncomfortable, while looking over to my right side there were people openly
climbing over the perimiter wall and into the ground,at this point the
seriousness of the situation was worrying me, and we were now experiencing a
terrible crush (not pushing) due to the amount of people who were confined
within this 'Area1.     My wife was screaming to get out as she was having
trouble breathing, this was not possible, others were shouting in panic.        At
this point I s&w two police officers on my left who had pushed their way
up the side of the wall towards the'exit' gate and they were shouting
"get back", after a minute of so the police officers disappeared, presumably
going back out the same way.       The crush was now becoming unbearable for ail
and there was a lot of shouting and screaming which unfortunately drowned the
announcement made by someone over a loud-speaker.       This announcement, I
think, was given out two or three times and was directed towards the problems
at 1our e n d 1.


My great fears were that either the perimiter wall holding the turnstiles
would Jive way or the exit gate would be opened and then because of the crush
outside, everyone would 'fall' in.     While all this was going on we ourselves
were gradually edging closer to the actual turnstile but the crush was now
becoming more intense and two little boys were passed horizontally over our
heads and through the turnstile, those boys looking shocked and stunned as
they passed over.     At this point I saw a policeman with his back to the
turnstile wall trying to push back, he had lost his helmet, and was himself
looking very distressed as he was hopelessly trying to assert some control
but unfortunately this was a lost cause.      It was now nearly my turn to go
through the turnstile, with my wife directly behind me, and I was praying
that the turnstile and wall would hold out and we would be released from this
potential death trap.    We were now going through the turnstile and I was
under the impression that the man who was manning the turnstile was also aware




                               i
3/




of the problems outside and he was equally anxious that people went through
as quickly as possible as there was no request made for the ticket stub, the
ticket only had to be shown.              When entering the ground my wife ran to about
six or seven police officers standing behind the the exit Gate 'A', next to
our entry turnstiles, and explained the experiences and problems outside, they
seemed quite calm and unconcerned about the problems and one replied "We didn't
expect the fans to leave it to the last minute'.'               While in a state of
exasperation and shock, she replied "this was not the case as we arrived ten
minutes later last year and our entry to the ground was better organised with
mounted police in attendance".                 I myself found a step to sit on and regain
my breath as at this point I was totally drained and                exhausted.


Our entry to the ground was about 2.57pm which was also slightly later than last
year.        We made our way to our seats and entered Gangway 'O' as kick-off was
taking place.             As soon as we sat down we could see there were problems of
congestion at the Leppings Lane end.


This is the end of my/our experiences on that tragic                day but inconclusion
further observations and opinions can be made.

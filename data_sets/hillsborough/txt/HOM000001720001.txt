Dear Sir/Madam,
     Whilst I was not at the scene at the disaster, I in fact attended the Leeds
United v Coventry F.A. Cup Semi-Final match two years previously and was in the
s3rnp section at the ground where the disaster occurred.

     At the game two years ago there were two major differences which prevented a
similar disaster

     (A) Dae to fans arrive late the kick-off was put back

     (B) Leeds United fans without tickets were not allowed near the ground.

     Despite there differences there were sane frightening similarities between
 the two games.
     (1) The police and stewards failed to steward the crowd properly outside the
 gates to the ground.

     (2) Once past the gates no attempts were made to steward fans into any
 particular section. This meant severe crushing behind the goal, but plenty of
 space on the left hand side.

     (3) Like the gy>mp involving Liverpool, Leeds had an early chance and this
 led to a surge to enter the section behind the goal. This led to crushing and
 minor injury,” but still no attempt was made to steward or police fans into
 uncrowded sections.

     Clearly if extra fans had been allowed in the disaster may have happened two
 years earlier and I may not have been able to write this. Whilst not wishing to
 be critical at the police and stewards it does appear that rather than learn
 from their mistakes they appear to have the situation deteriorate.

                                   Yours faithfully,

                                   Ferenc Morath.

PRIME MINISTER                                a--4cfe,<e-^ k^/

HILLSBOROUGH

We have just received Lord Justice Taylor's interim report, which
the Home Secretary wants to publish on Friday.                                He will minute
you    - probably tomorrow                  - about the terms of the statement he
proposes to make and about the consequences of the report for the
police.


I do not yet have advice from Carolyn Sinclair on the report (who
is    at   a conference           with       the Home    Secretary), but            thought you
would like an early opportunity to see it.


I have not had time to read it all myself, but recommend to you
the conclusions (Flag A) and the recommendations (Flag 5).


The report is particularly critical o f :


       - senior police                ("for    the most part the quality of their
       evidence        was       in     inverse     proportion        to   their     rank...the
       senior       officers           in     command   were     defensive         and   evasive
       witnesses... neither                 their handling of problems              of the day
       nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of
       leadership to be expected of their rank...it would have been
       more seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility
       had been faced");


       - particularly the officer in charge, Mr Duckenfield,                               whose
       "capacity        to       take       decisions    and     give      orders    seemed    to
       collapse.."       and who            gave out a report           after the        incident
       that it had been caused by fans forcing open a gate which
       "was     not     only          untruthful..it         caused     grave   offence       and
       distress";


       - the City council which was "inefficient and dilatory"                                 in
     its duties for the review and amend the safety certificate;
                               r   ---------------------------------------------- --- —   _   _     —       _      —    —     —   ,



     - the Club,       which despite generally a good record,                                                                should
     have       alerted   police           that                     turnstiles                      were         likely      to       be
     swamped.


Notably, Lord Taylor does not attach any significant blame to:


        - the behaviour of fans;


        - the    lack of medical facilities at theground                                                           or the late
        arrival of the emergency services;


        - the choice of the Football Ground;


        - the    allocation to Liverpool of the LeppingsLane end.



The report includes a large number of recommendations,                                                                      many of
which Lord Taylor wishes to be introduced before the new season.
These    seem to me to be practical and remarkably thorough.                                                                          He
describes them "as the minimum necessary to ensure that existing
football grounds can for the present be safely used."                                                                       He does
not touch on wider issues such as membership schemes,                                                                     identity
cards     all-seater      stadia,             super-stadia                                    etc       ,       which     will        be
considered in his final report.

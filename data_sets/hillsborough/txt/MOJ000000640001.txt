    DEBATE ON A MOTION FOR THE ADJOURNMENT ON HILLSBOROUGH


    We have been advised today by the Chief Whip's Office that the above debate will take place
    on Friday 8 May and that it is expected to take up all available time between 9.30am and
    2.30pm. Although the Home Secretary will definitely be opening the debate it is unclear
    whether he will be available to close or whether a junior Minister will wind-up. I shall, of
    course, keep you informed of any developments.

    I should be grateful, therefore, if you could set in hand the preparation of opening and closing
    speeches for the debate o f about twenty minutes and ten minutes duration respectively, along
    with any necessary background material, to reach Clare Sumner, PS to the Home Secretary,
    by 3pm on Friday 1 May.

    It would be helpful if, nearer the time, you could let Mark Woodward (Ext 3526) know which
    officials will be attending the debate.




                                                                 ANDREW ENGLEFIELD

                     At   8.20 am 15.4.89,        I    reported for duty at Hackenthorpe Police

                     Station       I ascertained       then that I was on Serial No.16 under PS 1288
e /s Tkvreyv
 I                   Payne.
     / A %^          Bus transport to Hillsborough and arrived for briefing in the North

                     Stand well before 10.00am.            During the briefing found we were to work

                     turnstiles A-G on Leppings Lane - outside the ground.

                pf   Packed meal was provided and eaten in the s,tand prior to taking up
      ,    jT !                     ;                         ,        ":        ■ ■■ / v
      'h             positions at the turnstiles.

                     Positions were taken up at the turnstiles in plenty of time for them

                     opening at 12 noon.          One turnstile opened up at about 11.50 am,            they

                     were all open by about 12.10 pm.

                     Initially I was paired up with PC 3066 Huckstepp at the turnstile

                     nearest the barrier,         furthest away from the wall.

                     Once s p e c t a t O E # began to arive the numbers were low enough to allow

                     that EVERYONE was searched before entering the ground.                   Other

                     officers on the serial made arrests for various offences committed by

                     persons attempting to enter the ground.

                     The first arrivals at the ground were generally very good humoured,

                     sober and caused few problems.
                                                                           X7        PAGE
                                                                                     R349

As the numbers arriving at the turnstiles began to g r o w - from about

2 pm onwards,          the searching of spectators became selective - but the

atmosphere was generally still good.

At this time,          the number of Police Officers on duty had decreased at

these turnstiles due to prisoners having been a r r e s t e d .

At 2.30 pm or th e r e a b o u t s , the numbers at the gates swelled

considerably.          Many of these late arrivals were worse for drink but

m a y not be classified as drunk.              They were singing and chanting and

began to push from the b a c k , causing congestion between the barrier

and the wall on the approach to the turnstile.

Further problems were caused by numerous supporters working their way

to the turnstiles and finding that they had no ticket at all,                       or that

they had a ticket for another part of the g r o u n d .

Many Liverpool supporters had bought their tickets from the

Nottingham area where they lived, but they wanted to stand with the

Liverpool s u p p o r t e r s , not with the N o t t s . F o r e s t .

Earlier in the afternoon,           the turnstile operators,             on the instruction

of the S t e w a r d s , had allowed people into the Leppings Lane end of the

g r o u n d , even though there tickets were for the Notts Forest Kop end

of the g r o u n d .

When the turnstiles became very busy h o w e v e r , this policy was changed

and no one was allowed through unless they had the correct t i c k e t s .

Consequently,      people arrived at the t u r n s t i l e , w e r e n 't allowed

through,    but then c o u l d n ’t get b a c k , they were blocked in.           This

happened at most of the turnstiles and the crowd built up

without being able to get t h r o u g h .

After 2.30 pm the push at the turnstiles was so great that the Police

officers on them had to go back through the turnstiles t h e m s e l v e s .

I managed to get through the barrier and stand outside the crush.

Despite shouting to the crowd to get back and stop pushing ~ the
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              R349

rowdy mob at the back kept pushing f o r w a r d .      It was apparent at that

time that a number of people were in difficulty up against the

barrier where I saw two young boys          (separately) who were just tall

enough to have their wind-pipes pushed up against the top rail of

the b a r .    With the help of their respective parents I mana ged to push

some room and p u l 1 the boys to my side of the b a r r i e r .

By this time there were a large number of youths and men -

considerably worse for drink - many were d r u n k .         They came down the

outside of the barrier and tried to force themselves              in at the

turnstile.       This caused a great deal of trouble - resulting in fights

taking place between f a n s , and scuffles with Police officers who were

trying to prevent them.

The push on the crowd at the front of the turnstiles was so great

that many of the suffering fans were begging for the large gates to

be opened,      they kept saying that they had all got tickets and that

people were getting h u r t .

A number of children were lifted out of the crowd and carried

overhead towards m e , and to where I n s p . PURDY stood near to the

barrier.      We helped to lift them out of the crowd.

Of the drunken youths trying to push in at the front of the

t u r n s t il e s , one was causing particular p r o b l e m s , he was so drunk that

he had no idea where he w a s .      I had pulled him out of the crowd twice

already,      he had been assaulted several     times by other spectators but

still continued to make for the turnstiles.             He was                  - I

had to arrest him and remove him from the a r e a .          I took h i m through

the side gate to the Police room.          I should have been assisted in

escorting him but the situation was that Pol ice Officers were

required more urgently on the outside of the g r o u n d .

        was   deta ined at the Police room and I had to stay with him

until he could be booked in - there were already numerous prisoners
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               R349

waiting to be booked in.

I did not have a Police r a d i o , and there was no radio on in the

Police room.         No one there knew what was happening outside that

building.

Once booked in - I completed the pro forma statement - in the gym in

the company of other officers who also had no r a d i o , and who were

also oblivious to what was happening anywhere else.

At approximately 3.10 pm I made my way back under the North Stand

towards Leppings Lane to return to my s e r i a l .       At that time I still

had no idea that anything was wrong.

On arrival at the rear of Leppings Lane I saw what can only be

described as confusion.           Police Officers and spectators were carrying

people from an area near t o , and in the t u n n e l , back towards the lane

outside the g a t e s .

I had no idea what had happened and could not see any members of my

own s e r i a l .   I helped to carry persons from that a r e a .

One man I helped to carry was l a r g e , approx.       25-30 y r s , fair h a i r ,

not wearing any shirt - he was breathing when I put him on the l a n e .

Moments later when I returned with someone else I saw that he was

dead ~ I was shocked that this would happen at a football m a t c h .

When I saw an ambulance man he suggested putting him at the side of

the lane with the o t h e r s .     I carried him with other officers to where

I saw about 7 people covered up - obviously d e a d .          I still had no

idea what had happened.

At the back of the lane there were numerous police constables

standing a b o u t , helpless to do a n y t h i n g .

I c o u l d n ’t see any of my serial and c a n 't recall seeing anyone above

the rank of Sergeant         in that a r e a .

Many spectators were swearing and abusive towards the Pol ice - a high

proportion still        in a drunken s t a t e .
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    R349

    •'*'   After moat dead and injured had been removed from the Leppings Lane

           stand,     I stood at the entrance to the tunnel with other officers -

           attempting to prevent fans re-entering to find relatives - many

           became violent when prevented from entering the t u n n e l .

           Once the game was abandoned and the m a j ority of spectators had left

           the g r o u n d , I made my way through the tunnel on to the pitch where I

           rejoined other members of my s e r i a l .

           I later attended at the de-briefing and went off-duty at E . 1 at

           7.30 p m .

^          During the push outside the ground - my fears were for the other

           police officers pushed up against the gates and the walls,           and for

           the children,           especially the ones with their necks pushed up against

           the b a r r i e r s .

           If I had been in charge outside the ground I would not have hesitated

           in opening the gates - at that t i m e .

             At 8.20 am           15.4.89,       I reported         for duty at H a c k e n t h o r p e        Police

             S t a n d well       before      10.00am.        During       the    briefing        found we were            to work

              turn s t i l e s A-G        on L a p p i n g s Lane         outside       the     ground.

             P a c k e d meal was          provided and .eaten,in the                   stand     prior     to taking        up

              positions at the turnstiles.

             P o s i t i o n s were       taken up at      the      turns t i l e s     in plenty of time                for them

              opening at          12 noon.        One    t u rnstile       opened       up at about         11.50 am,        they

             were     all     open by about           12.10    pm.

              Initially        I was       paired up w ith PC 3066 H u c k s t e p p at the                     turnstile

              nearest       the    barrier,       furthest       away from the wall.

              Once    spect a t o r s      began to arive           the    numbers were           low eno u g h      to a l l o w

              that EVERYONE:" was             searched     before         e n t ering     the    ground.        Other

              officers        on the       serial    made arre s t s        for     various       offences        co m m i t t e d by

              persons a t t e m p t i n g       to enter      the    ground.

             The     first-arrivals            at the gr o u n d were            generally        very good        humoured,

              sober and         caused few         problems.

              As    the   numbers         arriving      at the      turnstiles          began to grow — from about
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   R349

£ pm onwards,             the    sea r c h i n g    of s p e c t a t o r s    became     selective        - but the

a t m o s p h e r e was    generally          still      good.

At   this     time,       the    number       of Police O f f i c e r s            on duty had      d e c r e a s e d at

these     turnstiles            due    to    prisoners        having         been arrested.

At E.30       pm or thereabouts,                   the numbers         at the gates swelled

considerably.              Many       of these       late a r r i v a l s were worse             for     drink      but

may not       be c l a s s i f i e d as drunk.              T h e y were       singing and         chanting and

began     to push from the                  back,    causing        cong e s t i o n between        the      barrier

and the wall           on the a p p r o a c h        to the      turnstile.

Furt h e r    problems were             caused by numerous                   supporters w o r k i n g        their way

to the turns t i l e s and              finding        that     they had no ticket at all,                     or that

they    had a ticket             for another           part     of the        ground.

M any Liverpool            supporters          had bought           their      tickets      from the

N o t t i n g h a m area w here         they       lived,     but    they wa n t e d to stand w i t h the

Li verpool      supporters,             not with the Notts.                   Forest.

Earlier       in the a f ternoon,              the     turnstile        operators,          on the       i n s t r uction

of the Stewards,                had a l l o w e d    people      into        the L e p p i n g s Lane     end of the

ground,       even though             there    tickets were            for     the Notts Fores t             K o p end

of the ground.

W h e n the    t u rnstiles           became       very busy however,                this    policy was        changed

and no one was a l l o w e d                through      unless      they      had the       correct      tickets.

Conseq u e n t l y ,      people       a r r i v e d at the      turnstile,           weren't     allowed

through,       but then          c o u l d n ’t get      back,      they were         blocked      in.       This

h a p p e n e d at most         of    the t urnstiles an d the                  crowd built       up

with o u t    being able             to get    through.

A fter £.3 0      pm the         push at the           turnstiles            was    so great     that     the Police

officers       on them          had to go back            thro u g h    the        t urnstiles    themselves.

X managed       to get          t h r o u g h the barrier and                stand outside        the     crush.

Desp i t e    shouting          to the       crowd to get           back and. stop           pushing - the

rowdy mob at           the      back    kept       pushing      forward.            It was a p p a r e n t    at    that
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                R349

time that a number                  of    people were         in d i f f i c u l t y up a g a i n s t    the

barrier where            I saw two young               boys    (separately)           who were         Just    tall

enough to have              their wi nd~ p.i pes          pushed         up against       the    top    rail    of

the bar.         W i t h the        help of their           respective          parents      I managed         to      push

some    room and        pull        the boys       to my side            of the    barrier.

By this time           there were a large                 number         of youths an d m e n -

cons i d e r a b l y w orse         for    drink - m any were              drunk.       T hey    came    down the

outside        of the       barrier and tried              to force         themselves          in at the

turnstile.            This    caused a great deal                   of    trouble     - resulting          infights

taking     place       b e t w e e n fans,        and s c u f f l e s     with Police        o f f i c e r s who were

trying     to    prevent       them.

The    push on the           crowd at the            front     of the       turnstiles was             so great

that many of           the    s u ffering         fans were         begging       for the       large    gates         to

be opened,           they    kept        saying    that    they had all            got tickets          and that

people were           getting        hurt.

A number        of    children           were     lifted      out    of the       crowd and carried

overhead towards              me,        and to w here         Insp.      PURDY     stood near          to the

barrier.         We    he l p e d    to    lift them       out      of    the    crowd.

Of    the drun k e n yo u t h s           trying     to   push      in    at the front          of the

turnstiles,           one was        causing .particular                 problems,      he was     so drunk, that

he had no        idea where              he was.       I had        pulled him out of the               crowd twice

already,        he had       been        assaulted        several        times     by other s p e c t a t o r s        but

still     continued          to make        for the       turnstiles.             He was                             • I

had to arrest           him and           remove     him from the area.                 I took     him through

the    side gate        to the Police              room.       I sh o u l d have        been a s s i s t e d      in

escorting        him but        the s i t u a t i o n was        that Poli ce Offi cers were

required more           urgently           on the      outside       of the ground.

          was    d e t a i n e d at       the Police        room and        I had to stay w i t h him

until     he    could be booked              in - there were a l r e a d y              numer o u s     prisoner

wait i ng t o be bo o ke d i n .
                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                    R349

I did not         have a Police                radio,    and there was            no    radio     on    in the

Police       room.          No    cine there       knew what        was    happening       outside           that

building.

Once      booked       in - I completed the                  pro    forma     statement         -• in the gym             in

the      company of other                officers who also             had no      radio,       and who were

also      oblivious          to what was           happening        a n y where    else.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.1 0        pm I made my way back                under      the N o r t h S tand

towards L e p p i n g s Lane              to    return to my         serial.           At that     time       I still

had no       idea that a n y t h i n g was wrong.

O n arrival           at    the    rear of L e p p i n g s      Lane      I saw what       can only be

de scribed as              confusion.           Police      Officers       and spect a t o r s were            carrying

people       from an a r e a near to,                 and    in the tunnel,             back    towa rds       the       lane

outside       the      gates.

I had no        idea what           had happened and               could    not see any memb e r s                 of my

own serial.                I helped       to    carry    persons       from that area.

One man       I helped to               carry was       large,     approx.        25-30 yrs,           fair    hair,

not wearing any                  shirt - he was          b r e a t h i n g when    I put       him on the           lane.

Mome n t s    later w h e n         I returned wit h            someone      else       I saw that           he was

dead - I was               shocked      that      this w o u l d   happen at a football                  match.

Wh e n    I saw an a m b u l a n c e           man he s u g g e s t e d    putting him at              the    side       of

the      lane w ith the            others.         X carried       him with other              o f f ice rs    to where

I saw about 7 people                     covered up - o b v i o u s l y dead.              I still           had    no

idea what         had happened.

M a n y spectators               were   swearing and abus i v e             towards       the     Police       - a high

p r oportion still                in a drunken state.

After most dead and                     injured had         been    removed from the L e p p i n g s                Lane
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         R349

   stand,       I stood at      the entrance          to the      tunnel   with other      officers --

   at t e m p t i n g   tci prevent    fans    r e-entering        to find    relatives          m any

   became       violent w h e n     p r e vented from enter i n g          the tunnel.

   Once      the    game was a b a n d o n e d and      the m a j o r i t y of spect a t o r s   had     left

   the ground,           I made my way t h r o u g h the          tunnel    on to the     pitch where           I

   rejoined other m e m b e r s         of my serial.

   I later a t t e n d e d at       the d e - b r i e f i n g   and went    o f f - d u t y at E.1 at

   7,30      pm.

   During       the     push outside      the ground             rny fears were     for   the    other

   police       officers      pushed up against            the    gates and the walls,           and for

   the      children,      e s p e c i a l l y the ones wit h their         necks   pushed up against

   the      barriers.

   If I had been           in charge      outside       the     ground   I would    not   have    hes i t a t e d

   in opening           the gates     - at that       time.

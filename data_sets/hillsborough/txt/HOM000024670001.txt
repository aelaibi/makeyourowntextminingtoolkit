      Further to our correspondence dated 30 October 1989 on the
      subject of the safety of indoor sports centres, I enclose
      copies  of   correspondence  from the English Basket Ball
      Asssociation and the Southern Counties Amateur Swimming
      Association to indicate that sporting events at the local
      level are being very carefully scrutinised by the local
      authorities to the extent that some sports activities run by
      voluntary clubs are now being cancelled.

       In the light of the Lord Justice Taylor's Report I wonder if
       these matters could be drawn to his attention, since the
       present Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987
       appears to be jeopardising the development of community sport.

      Kind regards,

      Yours sincerely

                                                The Fire Safety & Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987
         Dear David,                            --------------
                          Since I raised this matter at the ASA Swimming Rxcilities
         Committee on 8th September many more cases of restriction on clubs activities
         as a result have come to light. The effect is catastrophic on major events    €
         with large numbers of swimmers and spectators, most of which are designated /Vi / jS i/'A
         and a number of which have had to be cancelled or postponed in the South.
                          As an example of the effects I enclose copies of a report
         from the Director of Property Services, of the Borough of Southend-on-Sea,
         which was accompanied by fifteen pages of alterations to exits, etc, at
         Warrior Square Pool, a limit of a total of 500 persons to be allowed in the
         building at a time till all the work is completed, which because of financial
         restrictions which affect all councils, has to be done over two financial years,
         which is Easter 1990.
                          Also a copy of my letter to Essex CountyASA alerting them to
         these problems which effect many pools injthecounty. As you will see from the
         ASA Eicility Committee minutes 17.2.5, these problems are also being experienced
         in the Western District.
                           In^lew of the letter from the P&cilities Consultant to you on
         this subject, whicri followed his investigation of the Act, I felt you should also
         be informed of the serious effect it is having on the promotion of designated
         events by clubs.
                          It may be a dispensation can be obtained for a special event
         provided additional safety precautions are taken a s agreed with the Fire Authority,
         but clubs need to know this in advance. I fail to see how "Guidelines" issued to
         certain clubs would encourage their authorities to act more quickly. In view of
         the public concern following the recent spate of disasters most authorities will
         surely be teen to be seen to be taking all precautions, and not waiting till the
         last moment, when it may be too late.
                                                             Yours sincerely,

Dear Nigel,
I would like to draw your attention to a considerable difficulty that has
occurred as a result of the recent legislation regarding indoor sports facilities.
A National League Basketball Premier Division match was recently due to take place
at Stretford Sports Centre, Manchester between Manchester and Sunderland.    This
venue has been used for promoted basketball events for many years, always without
any difficulties.   However, on this occasion the club was notified some two hours
prior to the start of the match that the Fire Officer had refused to permit
spectators into the arena that evening in view of the fact that the Exit signs did
not remain illuminated in the event of a total power failure in the building.
I am sure you can understand that a decision taken at such short notice causes
considerable difficulty in terms of spectators, both from Manchester and from
Sunderland, who arrived at the match and were unable to watch the game.
It was, of course, permissible for the game to be played provided there were no
spectators present in the Hall, and this in fact took place.    In addition, spectators
were permitted to. watch the match on closed circuit television in the Bar, but this we
unable to accommodate: a. small percentage of the original number wishing to watch
the match, and was only permitted provided no admission charge was levied.
You will appreciate that the Club concerned suffered considerable loss of revenue,
and potential bad public relations.   Fortunately the local authority which owns
the arena agreed to spend approximately £10,000 to rectify the problem before the
next match the following week, but you will appreciate that local authorities may
not always be so prompt or willing to commit such levels of expenditure.
I hope that you can bring this matter to the attention of those people with whom
you are discussing this legislation.
         sincerely,



M. D. Welch

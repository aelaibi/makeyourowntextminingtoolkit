 waiting               to get    Into the ground,                      These       s upporters were well                  behaved.

  gr ound who had no                          intention of entering                 the ground.         M a n y of these

  an d    if they did not                        have    tickets move             them away from the turnstile

  area.               All   the time             the volume           of fans was         increasing.

  At     12.20 pm I saw a large group of fans                                       on the f o o tpath             in Leppings

  going towards                 the           group     I saw a man 1 now know to be

  that    he had a handful                         of tickets he was                offering       for sale.              On seeing

  me a p p r o a c h i n g       he pl a c e d the tickets                       in his    pocket.      He was              rested

T he se were       p r e v e n t e d from entering           the ground.            L e p p u i i s ^ L a n e was

fro m the fo o t p a t h s and from the mi d d l e                  of the       road.       These        fans were

d i r e c t e d to the      turns t i l e s    or a w a y    if t h e y ' d i d not have a ticket.

Due to the         pr ob l e m v e h i c u l a r traffic was having d i f f i c u l t y

ne g o t i a t i n g L e p p i n g s Lane,     the    road was        blocked off at both ends.

I was made a w a r e          just a f t e r 2 pm that a special                    train had a r r i v e d at

W a d s l e y Br i d g e S t a t i o n   containing Liv e r p o o l          fans.        On their arrival

at L e p pi ng s L ane they greatly                  i n creased the volume               of suppo r t e r s

there.        As time went          on it became            clear that the amount                    of ans

wi th o u t   ti cke ts was        growing.

At ab out 2.3 0         pm I was aware            of an incident             that took            place    in

Leppings       Lane a b o u t 5 0 yards C a t c h Bar Lane                   side o f       the turnstiles.

I had he ard the sound of br eaking                         glass and a gap ap p e a r                  in the fans

a p p r o a c h i n g me.    I could not see what was                     happ ening        but went towards

toward s me w i t h two y o u t h s who were                  o b v i o u s l y under arrest.                  I

a s c e r t a i n e d that there         had been a         fight    betw e e n the         rival       fans.         I

I then re tu r n e d to a p o s ition nearer                    the turnstiles.                   All   the time

the 'crowd was          gr ow i n g and w ith other             officers ente r e d the                 crowd to

try an d ease the            congestion.

I tannot 8 a y the exact time but for a short time the double exit

 M o u n t e d o f f icers were               still a t t e m p t i n g   to get the fans ,in o r d e r l y

 queues.            I could see fans                climbing      on the w alls outside            the

 turnstiles              that a l l o w fans          into the s t a nding area.             T h e s l fans were

 cl im b i n g over          the wall and             into the g r o u n d . ■ I became aware            of

 possib le Se rious               problem s         outside      these turnstiles           due   to the sheer,

 v ol um e of fans            present.            W i t h other     officers We went          into the        crowd

 in order           to    close the           iron gates s i t u a t e d about        15 yards      in front of

 the tu rn s t i l e s and at                 the head of the             road leading      to the official

 car        park*        So that        the    crowd could have a more direct access                       to the

 t ur nst iles.            I then saw a m o u n t e d officer a l o n g s i d e              these gates

 h av in g a problem w ith some s upporters and one a p p e a r e d                               intent on

 ge tt in g       to this officer,                  I got hold of this             person an d     pulled him

 a w a y f ro m the horse,                telling him to            calm down he was still               trying to

 push forward.                 I pulled several               other       people a way from trying            to push

 past        the horse.           The horse did not have                    room   in w h i c h to manoeuvre.

 While        I Was       in the        crowd several          fans who were o b v i o u s l y N o t t i n g h a m

 Fo r e s t    fans w i t h tickets               for the S o u t h S t a n d were a t t e m p t i n g to       reach

 this        stand via the              road     leading to the official              car park.          I inform ed

 across        the       road,    an d d i r e c t e d them to the            correct way to the stand.

T h e y got a g i t a t e d and a n n o y e d be cause they                    could see a large s ign

above         the turnstiles.                  The sigh showed S O U T H S T A N D an d an a r r o w

 underneath              pointing        down the        road to the         car   park.

D ue    to the           immense        pressure       of supp o r t e r s a r o u n d me    I had to

 p h y s i c a l l y push my way back out of the                          crowd into L e p p i n g s Lane.        The

                   f air ly empty.            I could see the             crowd    in the centre         pen being         crushed

                     FA CUP S M I FINAL   -   SATUSBA* 15 A m i . 19*9.



With regards to the above event I have to raport that I reported for duty at Icclesfield
Police Station at 9a* and was transported t® Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground
for the sat eh between Liverpool and » ® t t i | ^ a Forest.
H 10aa all.: officersc present war* briefe d b y Senior offieors,
I was a member of Serial 1f with Police Sargoaat 323 *r®ctor      as supervisingofficer.
©ur duties wore outside the ground at tha lappings W e end nearto tha turnstiles which
ware to he ased by tbs Mverpool fans. The duty coasisted of tha reception of coaches and
other foras of traasport attending directly at Lappings Lane and generaal public order duty
At 11aa after tha general briefiagwe attended at tha rear of      tha Wost    Standwhere wa
received a farther briefing from Inspector Sykas who ehsuard      that all    officers ware
of there duties . *e instructed us to carry oat saloativa searching of fans outside the gr
ground.
At about 11*1Qam the serial took up there positions in tappings W e outside the turnstiles
and the mouth of the road that leads to the official car park at the rear of the South Sta*
On leaving the ground I saw that there was quite a number of Mverpool fans there waiting
to get into the grouad. These supporters were well heaved. *everal fsas enquired of me
where they could find a public house open. This was a regular enquiry throughout the day.

At abott 12 noon the turnstiles were opened and fans started to enter the ground.Ther was
still a fair amount of supporters outside the ground who had no intention of entering
the ground, ^any of these fans were drinking from elnohol from wans and bottles and you
could sea them stopping other fans asking if they had any spare tickets, together with
Mounted Officers at this location and other menbers of my serial we were constantly e
encouraging people to enter the ground and if they did not havetickets move them away from
the turnstile area. A n the time the volume of fans was increasing.

 At 12.20pm I saw a large group of fans on thefootpath in Leppimgs Lane approximately
50 yards away from the turnstiles in the direction of Peniittae Boad North. There was about
 30 - hO people bicoking the footpath and spilling over onto the road„causing traffic fco^__
 stop. On going towards tha grpup I saw a man I now know to b e ---------------              i
--------- ----------------- Liverpool. I could see that he had a handfull of tickets he was
offering for sale, n seeing me approaching he placed thetickets in his pocket. I*.was
 arrested for Obstructing the Highway and taken to the Police room at the rear of the
 Worth Stand. On searching           11 found that he had 11 tickets for the Liverpool end
 and ? tickets for the lottinghaa Forest ead togethervith «701.6%u The tickets were checked
 with the Football Club office and wer* originals. I ascertained that the tickets *her«
 being offerdd for sale at *35*.           stated that he had obtained the tickets from the
 Anfield ticket office. After completing the detention and submitting the file against
          I returned to my postioa in Leppings    W e.Thetime then was 1.15pm.
 The crowds had grown but there did not seem to be any problems. From that point onwards
 the flow of fans greatly increased and it was noticable that many were carrying cans and
 bottles of alcohol, These were prevented from enetering the ground. Leppimgs Lanewas
 thronged with supporters and I was continously moving people away from the footpaths and .
 from the middle of the road. These fans were directed to the turnstiles or away if they
 did not have a ticket. Due to fcha problem vehielular traffic was having negotiating tapping
Laae the road was blocked off at both ends.                  . . j. u j i       a *.*    nm
I was made aware just after 2 pm that a special train had arrived at Wadsley Bridge station
containg Liverpool fans . % there arrival at tappings W e they greatly increased the
volume of supporters there. As time went on it became clear that the amount of fans
without tickets was growing.

           ,
At about 2 30m I was aware of an incident that took place in tapping W w about 50 yard#
                                              m m heard th« sound of breaking glass^and _
tiateb Sar m w o side of the turnstiles . I had
a gap appear in the fans approaching mo. 1 could not sea what was happening but went toward
this location where I saw K 2120 Thorpe aad PC 2333 feglisb 1diking ^ ^ ^ i J S t ’totwoS
       who ware obviously under arrest. I ascertained that there had boeaafight m t m m
    rival fans*I was thea *proached by three mea who showed me tickets they had purchased
these tickets were obviously photo stat copies*
                                                                                 2cP\
I. the* returned to a position nearer the turnstiles. All thetime the crowd was growing
aad with §th*? iffiiSiPi entered,the crowd to try and ease the congestion.
I cannot say the exact time but for a short time the double exit gates alongside
turnstiles A were open and then closed.
Mounted officers were still attempting to get the fans in orderly queues . I copld see f
fans climbing on the walls outside the turnstiles that allow fans into the standing are®
These fans were cliabiag over the wall and into the gaaund. I became aware of possible
serious problems outside these turnstiles due to the sheer volume of fans present.
With other officers we ent into the erowd in order to ©lose the iron gates situated
about 13 yards infront of the turnstiles and at the head of the road leading to the
official ear park,    that the crowd could havea aore direct access tc the tarnstiiem*
1 then saw a mounted officer alongside these gate* haring a problem with sdae supporters
and one appeared intent on getting to this officer. 9 got hold of this person and pullec
hia away froa the horse , telling him to ©ala down he was still trying to push forward.

While I was in the crowd several fans who were obvious Nottingham Forest fans with
tickets for the louth tamd were attesting to reach this stand via the road leading to
the official ear park. * informed them that they could not reach the stand this way due
to a barrier across the road, and directed them to the correct way to the stand*.
They got agitated and annoyed beeaacc they could see a large sign above the turnstiles
The sign showed SQTJTI STAND and an arrow underneath pointing down the road to the ear p<

Duet© the immense pressure of supporters around me I had to physically push my way
back outof the crowd into Leppings W . The crowd was getting denser as kick off time
approached and the mood more agitated and aggresive.                         j
®he pressure seemed to ease £mxx and * found out later that a double exit door had been
opened although X was not aware of that at the time.
Sometine after 3pm I received a radio message requesting that all officers attend insid
the ground at the Leppings ^ e end, I ran through A gate with other officers* through
the «orth Stand and onto the playing area. % entering the playing area I saw people
on thepitch ( supporters and Police). It seemed to me that there had been a pitch in
invasion.Many supporters were climbing over the perimeter fence and through the gate
in the perimeter fence. A lot of people after getting out of                              °a
to the pitch. Others were directed to enter the pen adjacent to the North ^tand that
was mix fairly empty. I could see the crowd in the centre pen being crushed forward and
right up to the fencing. The situation worsened and there seemd to be hundreds off
people and Police around.I saw some officers and supporters trying to pull away the
fencing from there supports. I assited them and then helped lift the bodies ^ i n j u r e
from the terracing on to the pitch. *t this time a t Johns ambulance had been brought
onto the pitch and was adjacent to the terracing. I helped lift two Jodies into the
ambulance, they were obviously dead and were checked by the attendant. Two more
people were taken out and after giving them oxygen they recovered. I then assitted in e
carrying sevrel bodies to the gymnasium on makeshift stretchers.                       26 vr
One of the bodies had had taken out of the terracing was a P a u l Anthony MlW IfSQtf, 26 yr
                           Liverpool. With hej§> I carried the body to the gymnasium
wane m was roruiiBu uead at 3«55p®* by a ®p*           ( loyal lallamshire      remained
with the body until it was identified by the youths father at 12 .15 am 16 .^.8 $U
 I was then present when the body was conveyed to the Medico Legal Gentr© where
details were given to Police Officers and the Mortuary Staff.
Throughout the time I was on the pitch I was aware of Police, ambulance men and supporte
giving first aid to people on the pitch.
 In my opinion due to the volume of supporters outside the turnstiles in ^ p p i n g s W
 if the double doors had not been opened to relieve pressure there would certainly
 have been fatalities aad series. injuries to he fans there*

 I have been a Police Offi«*r for 22 years in the Sheffield area aad have           i* the
 division that coversSheffield Wednesday Football Ground for 17        3
 I have been on duty at most of the matches that have taken place there ^ j j i a g

LETTER FROM MR B DEVONSIDE, HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP TO
THE MINISTER FOR SPORT

We recently spoke about this matter.   Mr Devonside's letter was
transferred to this Division by DES to be treated at official
level.  No indication was given by DES as to whether or not an
acknowledgement had been sent to Mr Devonside. I understand that
Mr Devonside has now telephoned you seeking an explanation why
he has not received either an acknowledgment or a reply.

2.   Mr Devonside is the Secretary of the Hillsborough Family
Support Group and has written to the Home Office on several
occasions in the past. Together with other members of the Group
he met with Lord Ferrers in May 1990 to discuss matters arising
from the Taylor Report.

3.   In the light of Mr Devonside's connections with the
Hillsborough tragedy you suggested that you would wish to reply
to him direct. A draft reply is attached which takes account of
pressure from some other Ministers to review the all-seater
policy and your note of 4 March to Mr Miles.

4.   Would you please remind the Minister for Sport's officials
of the need to adhere to the usual procedures and conventions
when transferring ministerial correspondence. Their habits have
become very lax of late.

DRAFT LETTER FOR SIGNATURE BY THE ASSISTANT PRIVATE SECRETARY TO
THE MINISTER

Barry W Devonside Esq


                                                           FEP/90 19/35/1

                                                             March 1992




Dear Mr Devonside


Thank you for your letter of 4 February to the Minister for Sport
expressing     your        concern      about     the   implementation       of      the
recommendations       of Lord Justice           Taylor's     Final    Report on      the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.                 As you know your letter has been
passed to this Department in view of our responsibilities                            for
matters    arising    from the Taylor Report               and   for sports ground
safety in general.          I apologise for the delay in replying to you.


Lord Justice Taylor recognised, in his Final Report, that there
is no single solution to all the problems of crowd safety and
control     that   exist      at     football     matches.        However,      he   was
satisfied that seating does more to achieve these objectives than
any other measure.         This is a view which the Government supported
when the Report was first published and which it continues to
support.


As you also know Lord Justice Taylor recommended that clubs in
Divisions    One     and    Two    of    the    Football     League    should     admit
spectators only to seated accommodation from August 1994, whilst
those in Divisions Three and Four should do so from August 1999.
The Government continues to urge all Football League clubs to
meet these deadlines,          and intends that the same timing should
apply to the Premier League.


Under the Football Spectators Act 1989 the Football Licensing
Authority     (FLA)    was        established      to   implement      certain       key
recommendations of the Taylor Report, among them the conversion
of all Football League grounds to all seated.                      It is intended
that     the    FLA     will begin     issuing   licences     to Football     League
grounds        later    this year.      Once the licensing procedure           is in
operation        it     will be      against     the    law    to knowingly    admit
spectators to          watch a designated football match at an unlicensed
g r ou nd.


I am     aware     that   the House      of   Commons   all-party    committee on
football recently recommended that the all seater requirement be
relaxed for grounds in Divisions Three and Four of the Football
League.        I am also aware that the Labour Party has declared that
in the event of it forming a Government, it would review the all
seater requirement.            However, while the Government would not say
there is no case for reviewing the all-seater policy,                       it is of
the view that it is too early to do so at present.


I   am   very     aware   of    your    interest   in   this    matter   and   fully
appreciate your concern.


Once again I apologise for the delay in a reply being sent to

      I am Ian Daines, Assistant C hief Constable, South Yorkshire Police. Amongst my many other

      duties is a responsibility to assist the Chief Constable in the handling of matters arising out of the

      Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989. I transferred from Northumbria Police to South

      Yorkshire Police on promotion to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable in July 1996. I had had no

      previous dealing with Hillsborough Stadium Disaster issues and took on this responsibility in 1997.



      The Chief Constable has an archive of material relating to the disaster which is kept at Heeley

      Police Station, Windsor Road, Sheffield. The archive is kept in a room which measures

      approximately 17 feet square. It is stocked from floor to ceiling with Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

      material. This material includes maps, sketches, photographs, questionnaires, statements, video

      tapes, transcripts of Lord Justice Taylor’s Public Enquiry and of the 1991 Inquest, copies of the

      Taylor Report and many other documents concerned with the disaster and its aftermath. These

      documents have arrived in the archive from a number of different sources. Som e are generated

      by South Yorkshire Police staff, some were generated by the 1991 Inquest (and are held on behalf

      of the Coroner). Some w ere generated by the W est Midlands Police, who assisted Lord Justice

   Taylor in his Judicial Enquiry, and later prepared papers for the Director of Public Prosecutions.

      The archive contains perhaps as many as one million pieces of paper. The HOLMES computer is

   used as an index to some of the material which is held in the archive.



      I cannot prove the authenticity of any document in the archive in the sense that I cannot say that

   the document is an accurate record of what it purports to record nor that it was made by the

   person who is purported to have made it.

      The archive is an historical record of a tragedy. I am required to produce to the court a large

      number of documents and 1do so. 1would ask that these documents are returned to me at the

      conclusion of these proceedings so that I can preserve the integrity of the archive. Also I would

      ask that these documents are used only for the purpose of these proceedings as they relate to a

      traumatic event in the lives of many people.



      I have received a summons from the Leeds Magistrates Court, dated 26 April 1999, which was

      issued in connection with the prosecution by Ann Addlington of David Godfrey Duckenfield and

      Bernard Dean Murray. The summons requires me to produce a large number of documents to the

      court on the 24 M ay 1999. I have caused staff to look most carefully for the documents described

      in the summons. In some cases they have found only copies. I will now go through the schedules

      of documents and each item individually. The summons requires me to produce documents as

      listed in Schedules 1 to 4. There is no Schedule 1 so I shall progress immediately to Schedule 2.



      I am required to produce a document described as “Plan by witness Holdsworth”, number 36, I

      have located a photocopy of a plan of Sheffield W ednesday Football Club Hillsborough Ground. It

      bears the name Roger Holdsworth and a signature which could be that of M r Holdsworth.



      I am required to produce a series of plans “prepared by Brades for the Judicial Enquiry", document

      numbers 91, 92, 93, 94 and 95. I produce plans which purport to be prepared by Ralph Brade and

      Associates, Consulting Engineers. The plans are in the form of transparencies as used by

      draughtsmen and engineers but they bear no signatures. I also produce paper copies of these

      transparencies.



      I am required to produce documents “Prepared by the W est Midlands Police for the Judicial

      Enquiry”, these are document numbers 96, 97, 99, 100, 101, 103 and 106.

      Document 96 appears to me to be a photocopy, it is not dated but has printed on it the words

      “Surveyed 2 7/4 /89 ” and purports to be singed by D R Goodhall.

      Document number 97 also appears to be a photocopy, it shows no date and contains the words

      “Surveyed 2 6/4/89”, it purports to be singed by D R Goodhail.

      Each of my references to survey dates is text printed on the documents and is not hand written.

      Each of the documents contains no date to indicate when the author signed it.

      Document number 103 purports to be singed by D R Goodhail but with no date of signing. There

      is printed text that it was “Surveyed 21/4/89 - 25/4/89".

      W ednesday Football Club Hillsborough Ground. It is not signed or dated and itself contains no

      information as to its author. Written in pencil in the top right-hand comer is "D2532”. On the

      H O LM ES computer index D 2532 refers to a plan of the Hillsborough Stadium.



   I am required to produce the "BBC plan showing position of cameras and cameramen”, document

   108. I have located a document which purports to contain that information, it appears to be a

           I am required to produce one item in Schedule 3. This is described as “Document identified in

           Inspector Harry W hite's report” (R215A ), dated 6/5/89, note from Inspector Sewell written in red ink

           on the operational briefing notes". I have located a report dated 6 May 1989 by Inspector White,

           which states that he is in possession of his briefing notes and that they are endorsed by Inspector

           Sewell in red ink. There is no record that Inspector W hite’s briefing notes w ere ever brought into

           the archive of material. I cannot locate them.



           I am also required to produce in Schedule 3, item 4, sub item 4, photographs by Scenes of Crime

           Officers. All the photographs referred to under this heading are produced under Schedule 2 or

           Schedule 4 as indicated below

   In Schedule 3 , 1am required under item 2, to produce a (tape) “extract identified in C I Malcolm

   Edmuridson’s Report (R139), dated 29/4/89". 1have read his report and can find no reference to a

  tape extract.



   Item 3 to Schedule 3 relates to documents identified in an internal South Yorkshire Police Report

   compiled by DS Carr, item 3.1 requires production of the Ground Control Log. The only such

   document identified is the one already produced in accordance with Schedule 2, item 207, of the

   summons issued on 26 April 1999. Item 3.2 requires production of the Command and Control Log

   and i produce a photocopy of a computer print out of that log.



   At item 3 . 3 , 1am requested to produce copies of briefing notes identified as CCB 16 April 1989,

   CCB 17 April 1989 and CCB 19 April 1989 from the Chief Constable’s Briefing with Operational

   Staff. I produce copies of notes of De-brief Meetings from the above dates, the Chief Constable

   being present at the first two, but not at the third. There are no signatures on these notes and no

   identified author.



      Items 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 require me to produce the briefing notes of

      Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, Superintendent Greenwood and Superintendent Marshall. I

      have previously been required to produce these via the summons of 26 April 1999, Schedule 2

      No-S 197 and 198 and Schedule 2, No.s 200 and 201 of this summons and have done so.



   At item 4 of this schedule I am required to produce a compilation video, ref. MRE1. I produce the

      master tape of this video compiled by the West Midlands Police and in U-Matic format, which will

      require a U-Matic player for it to be viewed. Nothing with this video identifies the person who

      complied it.

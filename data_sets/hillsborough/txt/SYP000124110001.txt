 1.        I BELIEVE THAT AS SOON AS THE   POLICE REALISE     THE EXTENT OF THE

 INCIDENT,     EVEN THOUGH IT TOOK SOME    TIME,   THEY DID   EVERYTHING THEY C O U L D „

       THE STEWARDS NEVER DID ANYTHING THEY WERE JUST          STOOD AROUND W A T C H I N G .

 THE FIRST AIDERS AND THE FANS DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF POLICEMEN ON THE ROADS AS YOU APPROACHED THE

 GROUND,     BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GOT TO THE ENTRANCE,        EVEN AT 2PM (1400)         THERE

 SEEMED VERY FEW, HARDLY ANY AS I REMEMBER.

 2.    AT NO TIME WHEN YOU ENTER THE       GROUND ARE YOU     AWARE

 T^pT YOU CAN GET TO THE SIDE TERRACING.           THE ONLY THING YOU        SEE IS THE

 TUNNEL.

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 I C O U L D N ’T REMEMBER THE TIME.

 051

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 STEWARD, A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.


018

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A

jj R'RIMINAL
     U         OFFENCE?



 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIME FOR THE AMBULANCES AND FIRE BRIGADE

 TO ARRIVE.       IT WAS JUST TOTAL CHAOS, NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

 THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION FROM THE AUTHORITIES,          AS TO THE SERIOUS

 NATURE OF THE DISASTER.

 I FEEL THAT THE LACK OF ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND CONTRIBUTED

 TO THE DISASTER,         THE FANS SHOULD HAVE B£EN MAINTAINED IN ORDERLY

 QUEUES BUT THERE W E R E N ’T ENOUGH POLICE TO DO IT I ALSO FEEL THAT PEOPLE

 WERE LATE TURNING UP FOR THE MATCH^/AND THIS MAY BE DUE TO SIGNS PUT

 ON LAMP POSTS INDICATING HOW FAR AWAY FROM THE GROUND PEOPLE HAD

 PARKED.       WE PARKED IN HALIFAX ROAD AND I NOTICED A SIGN WHICH SAID FIVE

 MINUTES WALK TO THE GROUND.         IN ACTUAL FACT IT TOOK US FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?                    ^ ^—                          C O M ^

 THE MEDICAL FACILITIES WERE INADEQUATE.         T            NO POLICE LEADERSHIP:
                                               j—

 THE OFFICERS WERE DEPLOYED WRONGLY,      I T ’S NOT THEIR FAULT BUT THEIR

 SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO DIRECTED THEM.         IT SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIME
                                                                                               PAGE      9

 FOR THE POLICE TO ASSESS THE SITUATION,        TO US IT WAS OBVIOUS WHAT WAS

 HAPPENING BUT NOBODY IN CHARGE OF THE POLICE GRASPED THE NATURE OF THE

 INCIDENT.     THE DOCTOR WHO'S BEEN ON THE TV WAS TRYING TO ORGANISE

 EVERYTHING,    HE WAS TRYING TO SAVE LIVES AS WELL,          IN MY OPINION HE DESERVES

 A HIGH COMMENDATION.


Q20

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WENT WRONG.         THE*"'PROBLEM STARTED WITH THE

 L®K     OF ORGANISATION OUTSIDE AND IT GOT W?       I.^ H I L L S B O R O U G H   I FEEL IS

 THE WRONG CHOICE OF GROUND,     THE LEPPINGS l ( ^ O E N D    Ig INADEQUATE FOR

 LARGE CROWDS.     PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIED OUTSIDE IF THE GATE H A D N ’T BEEN

 OPENED BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN NO COMMUNICATION TO THE INSIDE OF THE

 GROUND TO ENABLE THE FANS TO BE DIRECTED,         I FELT SORRY FOR THE

 3 MOUNTED OFFICERS OUTSIDE,     THEY STUCK TO THEIR JOB ALTHOUGH THEY

 CAME IN FOR A LOAD OF ABUSE, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN VERY FRIGHTENED BUT

 TRIED THEIR BEST.

 judicial    inquiry?

 The   police   could have organised the fans outside the ground into orderly

 >^ues.     Also   comparing the average gate attendances of Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest,      Liverpool should have been given the bigger area of the

 ground instead of being crammed into small Lappings Lane Area.

 ' ^ R E WAS NO INFORMATION GIVEN OUT AND A LOT OF POLICEMEN SEEMED TO BE

 STANDING ROUND DOING NOTHING. THEY SEEMED MORE INTERESTED IN CORDONING OFF THE

 PITCH. THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION?    IT WAS A TOTAL SHAMBLES FROM START TO

 FINISH. THE SUPPORTERS ON THE PITCH ALL HELPED OUT.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 •1) LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENTS TO THE CROWD OUTSIDE. THE TURNSTILES WOULD HAVE

HELPED IN ORGANISING QUEUES.

       THE 1988 <000088) SEMI-FINAL WAS BETTER ORGANISED OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES.

WE HAD ARRIVED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AND ENTERED THE GROUND WITHOUT

 DIFFICULTY.

 3) VIEWS OF COMPETING CLUBS SHOULD BE TAKEN ACCOUNT OF.

 4) STADIUM TO BE USED SHOULD BE PROPERLY EQUIPPED & ADEQUATELY POLICED OUTSIDE

 3) POLICE SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED IN HANDLING LARGE CROWDS, PARTICULARLY WHERE

 FANS ARE EXPECTED WITHOUT TICKETS.

 6) POLICE SHOULD HAVE POWER TO DELAY KICK-OFF.

 7)    I DO NOT ACCEPT THAT THERE WAS ANY NEED TO HAVE SEPARATE TURNSTILES FOR

 W STAND SEATED AND THE LEPPINGS LN TERRACES.    THEY LED TO THE SAME AREA.

 8) THE DIVIDING FENCES LEADING DOWN TO THE PERIMETER FENCE SHOULDN'T BE THERE

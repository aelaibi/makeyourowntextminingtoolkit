                     I am a qualified doctor my qualificatioj                      are MBBS I qualfieid in 1985

                     at the London Hospital.

                     I have worked at the Northern Ge                                al for the past eighteen

                     months.         On Saturday 15th April                          > it was my working

                     weekend and I .was at the Northern General Hospital.                     At approximately

                     15.05/15^10 Jnours that afternoon, I received a telephone call from
                      N 9739
                     John DUNC    whjr is a Senior registrar at the Norther,   ?ral/flos pi tal

                     and he st£t&ft that he was at home watching the TV and tJrvstl something

                     was occurring at the Hillsborough football ground.                      He went on to say

                     that there were ambulances present and to expect patients at the

                     hospital.

                                                       call I made my way to casualty t

                                                                          S3500
was unable to provide me with further details          I ensured that the staff

on the general surgical wards and in theatre were aware           and that their

services may be required and then I made my way back to casualty.

Upon my return I contacted switchboard and^informed them t h ^           we had a

major incident and asked them to contact Mr >PU51^ N       a nd Mr/ lyffilANE

(Registrar)    I believe that this was done.

By this time the first patients were arriving by ambulance.              The first

patient that I had any dealings with was
                       -------- J "...... .
                                                          tall,   of medium

build and had short dark brown hair.          I am unable to recall what he

was wearing,    I think he pad a       r of jeans on and that his top

clothing had already be'en r e e v e d .   He was in the resuscitation room

when I first made contact/a/d tp^the best of my recollection there was

a staff nurse from c/as^lty whose name I do not know, with the

patient.    The youth was cynosed but there were       no obvious external

injuries.     He was having difficulty breathing.

He had small    pupils but they were reactive to light. ; I intubated the

patient and together with the nurse we ventilated him.            In a short

time his colour returned to normal.

I re examined the patient who was still unconscious and could not find

any obvious major abdominal or chest injuries.          The patient appeared

stable and in view of this and the fact that I was required to assist

with other patients I left the nurse, who had been assisting me, to

continue ventilating the patient.          As far as I am awware this patient

1ived,   I would certainly have expected him to.

The next person I a s sisted w^*f a young female,      I now know that    this
           t / l !7        J //
patient was Victoria /HICKSf./ /She/was brought into the room where I: was

dealing with the patient h i hSgy& described above.       I remember she was

accompanied by a young man w ho I believe was wearing a Liverpoo l

shirt, h© was definately a football supporter and an ambulance man or
                                                                                    PAGE         3
                                                                                    S3500
po1ice man.    The supporter appeared distressed and was calling for a

doctor to assist.




                                                         After approximately ten

to fifteen minutes,      I made the decision to stop treatment.               I then

moved on to other patients to see if I could be of assistance.                       I did

I recall that I moved on to two or three t & h e if j^ftients to see if I

could help but all of them had sufficient medical staff with them and

appeared to be receiving adequate treatment.              I cannot describe any of

the above patients or their condition.             By this time the place was

chaot i c .

The next patient that I had specific deali              sv^ith was a young white

male, aged approximately fourteen/fiftee              ejirs^-e-f a g e .   He was

brought into the clean theatre on an ambulance stretcher.                    I can't

:emember who carried the patient into the hospital                  Majftin Me SHANE,

yt.ohn DU N C A N a nd I approached the patient I i m m e d i a t e l y V:saw that he was

not breathing and that he was cynosed.

                                                 John DUNCAN         rtitied the

patient dead and instructed me not to proceed
                                                                                       t\    ■

         As previously stated the patient was a white male aged fourteen to

         f ifteen years.   He has short dark hair and w a y of very slim build I

         cannot recall what clothing he was wearing.

         I have been shown some photographs by           APPLET     n todays d a t e , 16.

         •
         10.89 (161089) and from the photograph                    Id say that the
                                                                    ■    ' u .
         photograph bearing the print number e                        ip/STEELE) is the

         best resemblance to the patient that

                           Once the patient had been     certified
                                                                DUNCAN
                                                                    deadIby
                                                                          had no

         further dealings with the     patient.

         I moved on and assisted with several other patients including some in

         ITU but to the best of my     knowledge   none of these people   died.

         At the beginning of my statement I refer to thefirst patient that I

         dealt with whom I believe lives,      to be in the resuscitation room,       I

         now believe that this patient was in fact in clean threatre.             He was

         definately in the same room that Victoria HICKS received her treatment

         in.

             I am a qualified doctor my qualifications are MBBS I qualfieid in 1985

             at the London Hospital.

             I have worked at the Northern General Hospital for the past eighteen

            months.       On Saturday 15th April              1989 (150489)             it was my working

            weekend and I was at the Northern General Hospital.                                At approximately

             15.05/15.10 hours that afternoon,                      I received a telephone         call from

            John DUNCAN who is a Senior registrar at the Northern General Hospital

            and he stated that he was at home watching the TV and that something

             was occurring at the Hillsborough football ground.                               He went on to say

             that there were ambulances present and to expect patients at the

             hosp i t a l .

             As a result of this call I made my way to casualty to see if I could
                                                                    7 2 .55"
             obtain any further details.  I spoke with Charge Nurse BATTY but he
                                                                       PAGE     2
                                                                       S3500

was unable to provide me with further details I ensured that the staff

on the general    surgical wards and in theatre were aware and that their

services may be required and then I made my way back to casualty.

Upon my return I contacted switchboard and informed them that we had a

major    incident and asked them to contact Mr DUNCAN and Mr M SHANE

(Registrar)    I believe that this was done.

By this time the first patients were arriving by ambulance.         The first

patient that I had any dealings with was

                                                       tall,   of medium

build and had short dark brown hair.       I am unable to recall what he

was wearing,    I think he had a pair of jeans on and that his top

clothing had already been removed.       He was in the resuscitation room

when I first made contact and to the best of my recollection there was

a staff nurse from casualty whose name I do not know, with the

patient.    The youth was cynosed but there were     noobvious   external

injuries.     He was having difficulty breathing.

He had small    pupils but they were reactive to light.    I intubated the

patient and together with the nurse we ventilated him.         In a short

time his colour returned to normal.

I re examined the patient who was still unconscious and could not find

any obvious major abdominal or chest injuries.       The patient appeared

stable and in view of this and the fact that I was required to assist

with other patients I left the nurse, who had been assisting me,           to

continue ventilating the patient.       As far as I am awware this patient

lived,   1' would certainly have expected him to.

The next person I assisted was a young female,       I now know that   this

patient was Victoria H1CKST.    She was brought into the room where X was

dealing with the patient I have described above.       I remember she was

accompanied by a young man who I believe was wearing a Liverpool

shirt,   he was definately a football    supporter and an ambulance man or
                                                                           PAGE     3
                                                                           S3500
policeman.       The supporter appeared distressed and was calling for a

doctor to assist.




                                                   After approximately ten

to fifteen minutes,       I made the decision to stop treatment.     I then

moved on to other patients to see if I could be of assistance.              I did

not have any further dealings with Victoria HICKS.

I recall that I moved on to two or three other patients to see if 1

could help but all of them had sufficient medical staff with them and

appeared to be receiving adequate treatment.        I cannot describe any of

the above patients or their condition.        By this time the place was

chaot i c .

The next patient that I had specific dealings with was a young white

male, aged approximately fourteen/fifteen years of age.           He was

brought       into the clean theatre on an ambulance stretcher.     I can't
                                                                   loW
remember who carried the patient       into the hospital.   Martin McSHANE,

John DUNCAN and I approached the patient       I immediately saw that he was

not breathing and that he was cynosed.

                                             John DUNCAN certified the

patient dead and instructed me not to proceed.

                                                                                 S3300

         As previously stated the patient was a white male aged fourteen to

         fifteen years.   He has short dark hair and was of very slim build I

         cannot recall what   clothing he was wearing.

         I have been shown some photographs by WPS APPLETON on todays date,              16.

         10.89 (161089) and from the photographs shown I would say that the
                                                        r-^Vocn
         photograph bearing the print number eighty two (Philip STEELE) is the

         best resemblance to the patient that 1 am referring t o .

         Once the patient had been    certified    dead by John DUNCAN I had    no

         further dealings with the    patient.

         I moved on and assisted with several other patients including some in

         ITU but to the best of my    knowledge    none of these people died.

         At the beginning of my statement 1       refer to the first patient    that I

         dealt with whom I believe lives,    to be in the resuscitation room,        I

         now believe that this patient was       in fact in clean threatre.     He was

         definately in the same room that Victoria HICKS received her treatment

         in.

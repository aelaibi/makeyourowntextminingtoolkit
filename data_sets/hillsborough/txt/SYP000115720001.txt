                        players         were         leaving        the    pitch and         we w a l k e d across it to                the West

                        pitch,,          I believed               that    this was       to quell         a pitch         invasion,          however

                       when       1    wa l k e d     up to the           fence    I saw a white              female's       face       pressed

    pitch and            laid him           down.      His pulse was            beating    frantically           but he

            directly behind               the goat         mouth I could see              that      many

 I 5 aw that the g a t e s           Leading out             onto      tne     pitch were

 Once the           gates       w e r e o p e n e d I a s s i s t e d in c a r r y i n g  out

 O n c e all      ttie b o d i e s w e r e     removed       f r o m t h e g a t e to t h e

 directly       b e h i n d the goal.

Upon my arrival               I saw         at l e a s t       20+     bodies apparently
 d e a d on the       t e r r a c i n g and p o l i c e m e n s t r u g g l i n g     to m o v e
 them.        Behind        them were Liverpool supporters screaming
at        the  police stating                there        were        others that           were
 i n j ured but b r e a t h i n g .         I s h o u t e d to t h e p o l i c e o f f i c e r s

concern        ourselves            with those             that        were     alive        but
seriously injured.                   I then took           h o l d of an I n s p e c t o r a nd
organised a chain                  of p o l i c e m e n    a t t h i s g a t e i n o r d e r to

w e r e out we       t h e n c o n t i n u e d to         m o v e th e o e a d ou t of the
West 5 t a n d and onto the pitch.

I recall removing              both m s n ; women         and      children       who were
apparen tly dead.

T h e r e w e r e m a n y b o d i e s on the p i t c h        in t h e p e n a l t y area
and o t h e r s a b out the p i t c h whp w e r e             seriously injured.

It^was  a b s o l u t e m a y h e m at     this         time with        many police
officers stanaing around               a p p a r e n t l y n e t k n o w i n g w h a t to
do .

I recall being               given a young         y o u t h at t h e g a t e to t h e
West Stand, I c a r r i e d him with Pc                  w a l t o n onto the p i tch
and       gave him m o u t h - t o - m o u t h and     heart massage, shortly
after         he    began     breathing, _         i     then       shouted   to   an
a m b u l a n c e m a n w h o r e l i e v e d us'.

Once         all    the b o dies were             out  of   the     West.     S t a n d I,
together with other                o f f i c e r s and    supporters, organised
c a r r y i n g the d ead      and i n j u r e d on a d v e r t i s i n g b o a r d s and
S t r e t c h e r s to t h e g y m n a s i u m .
      Rt s o m e t i m e d u r i n g the c a t a s t r o p h y X r e c a l l the            Forest
      fans     c h a n t i n g to t h e L i v e r p o o l f a n s , w h i c h r e s u l t e d     in
      the    Liverpool fans running                    towards        the     S p i o n Kop,       1
      honestly believed             that s e r i o u s d i s o r d e r w o u l d a r i s e and
      I,   together           with    o t h e r o f f i c e r s , t r i e d f r a n t i c a l l y to
      stop the L i v e r p o o l fans and Luc k i l y s u c c e e d e d .

     This then resulted             in a     tine      of p o l i c e o f f i c e r s b e i n g
     deployed         at  the    halfway         line      to      prevent           further
     confrontation.          I r e c a l l s e e i n g a n u m b e r of     d o g s on the
     p i t c h n e a r to the S p i o n Kop.

     Once      order had         been established             I,           together with Pcs
     H O R O a n d W R L T O N , t r i e d to c o n s o l e m a n y        of t h e d i s t r a u g h t
     Liverpool fans .

     S o m e t i m e l a t e r an a n n o u n c e m e n t    w a s m a d e to      the ef f e c t

     asked        to    leave the           ground.          Rs     the r e s u l t of      this
     m e s s a g e I, t o g e t h e r w i t h P c s H O R G a n d      WRLTON, went onto
     the        Penniston Road            outside the.Kop and              monitored         the
     F o r e s t f a n s as th e y left.

     There        w e r e an u m b e r o f s m a l l   sporadic                 fights               between
     rival      f a n s w h i c h w e r e q u i c k Iv d e a l t w i t h .

     We later     r e t u r n e d to t h e          gymnasium        to      offer          assistance
     but we w e r e not r e q u i r e d .

     All p o l i c e o f f i c e s not c u r r e n t l y 'deployed w e r e then                              told

     During.this incident I would estimate                               that     we    carried
     a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 to 30        e i t h e r d e a d or s e r i o u s l y i n j u r e d

At this       stage only one              or two     coaches had arrived.             It was

approximately            11.30am          11SQ w he n our Serial           attended        H al i fa x Rd for the

regi st er ed numbers             of the a r r i vi ng      coaches.

O n ly a few L iverpool              coaches        had a r r i v e d up until a bout 2 . 0 0 p m      1400 as

we spent        our time       chatting          to the    coach drivers.           Fans d e s ce n di n g

these       coaches      had been         s e a r ch ed a nd a l t h o u g h they were in high

spirits,        they were all             well    behaved.      M a ny went     off in s e ar c h of local

public      houses.        Numerous         private vans a n d        cars    cont ai ni ng     fans were

a r r i v i n g a nd these        parked     in nearby side          streets.        M an y of the

oc cu p an ts    had a l r e a d y been drinking.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2. 1 5 p m    1415 there was a constant                flow of coaches

arriving        on H al i f a x Rd a n d these were d i r e c t e d to park down the                     length

of that       road.

Duri ng the time of thei r a r r i v a l , g r e a t \ m m b e r s             of fans were h u r r i ed l y

de sc en di ng     the    coaches.          M a ny of these      fans w ereh e a r r y i n g    cans of beer

a nd   lager,      some of them several at a time.                        T he re were a large number

of fans who were             u n s t ea dy on their         feet,    appearing       to be f a ir l y drunk.

I remember         one y o u t h being           so drunk that       he could h ardly walk            in a

stra ig ht      line.      I comm en te d that            he w o ul d have to do a lot better                than

that     if he hoped to get                in the ground.           One   of his f ri ends         replied,

"He's doing          his best        love."

As each coach arrived,                    a lmost    in c o ns ec ut iv e o r d e r , groups       of fans

a s s e m b l e d to ask     if any of the fans on the                    coaches    had spare tickets.

as a s s i s t a n c e was a m at te r            of urgency.

T h er e were        large numbers              of football      fans      crowded      round the entrance

w a y to the L e p p in gs Ln end,                 the m a j o r i t y of w h o m were a b us i v e and

a gitated.           U pon   running        into the L ep p in g s Ln entrance,                  we w er e g re e te d

by hostile           fans who were              shouting a buse at          us dema nd in g       to know where

we had been and why                it had taken us so long to get                          to them.        S om e of

the fans were            injured      c lutchin g their             chests,       some blood stained.

A h e a d of me,        I could see             several    people     laid on the floor at                  the

w er e bent        over them a t t e m p t i n g    to give them the kiss                 of    life.      T he re

was a n air         of great       panic and       c o nf us io n a nd my        i mmediate      i m p r es s io n

was    that       fighting      had b ro ke n out on the terraces.                   However,         I was

unable        to reconcile         this    thought w i t h the sight of persons                     having       to

be    resuscitated.

The    tunnel       leading down to the terraces was very                          congested,         people

were       pushing and s hoving            each other       in <and out of the tunnel.                     T here

s ee me d to be many            inj ured    p e o p l e , some a c t u a l l y    lying    in the tunnel

itself.           I could hear       s cr ea mi ng ^nd shouting,            many     people were

hysterical.            On getting         into the     l eft hand s e ct i o n of t er r ac i ng             (as

y ou d e scen d the tunnel)               Ikcould    see thapa people had f al le n forwa rd s

upon one ano ther and were                  pirvqed up a g ai n s t      the wire         fences.        Not

being fully aware               ofNt<hat had a c t u a l l y h a p p e ne d together w i t h other

Offi ce rs ,       I began      pul 1 ine^ people up.          M a n y w er e badly injured,               holding

their       chests and being          unable       to breathe.          Several      times       I rushed

in jured       people     upto the top of the tunnel                  at the L ep p in g s Ln entr an ce

w h er e    I thought       I had seen an ambulance.

The sheer          number    of    injured     people was ove rw he lm in g,              some were

o b v i o u s l y se ve re ly     injured or dying.            A large number             of fans were

a n g r y and hostile           towards     us,    blam in g us for what            had happened.

O th e rs were a tt em p t i n g      to help us,         blaming       their own         ’hot    h e a d s ’ for

what       had happened.          A large number of fans                refused to leave the

s e ct i o n of t erracing          statin g t h e y ’d come to see the match,                      this was

d e sp i te    pleas    from m ys el f and others.               Some    fans a p p e a r e d too s h oc ke d

to do anything,             s e e m i n g l y f roz en w i t h fear.

It was obvious            that     people    just    c o u l d n ’t get out of this s e ct i o n of

t er ra ce     because      of the sheer numbers and the high wire                             fences.       I

remember          helping one m a n to the top of the tunnel who a p p e a r e d

s e r i ou s ly    injured.       He was     clutching       his    chest,        could not       b re at h and

was    d ou b le d up in pain.             I had to leave him prop pe d up agai ns t a wall

       at the top of the tunnel,                       leaving him in the arms             of a fan who

       p romised to stay w i th him so that                       I could help others.                  I am unable to

       recall what           he looked       like.

       I r eturned to the terraces w here                        people were       still     pushing and shoving

       and at that           point,      w i t h o t h e r s , tried to     clear a g a ng w ay for Off i cers

       rushing          the dead and        injured up t hro ug h the tunnel.                     O f f i c er s and

       fans alike were f r a n t i c a l l y trying                 to rip the wire          fencing        b e hi n d the

people.

It was a scene of             chaos,     panic a nd fear,        e s p e c i a l l y w he n the extent          of

what     had h a p p en ed began to dawn upon             people.

At one stage,           t ogether w i t h fans,      I a s s i s t e d w i t h the     c o l l ec t io n of

advertising           boards w h i c h w ere   used as m a k e s h i f t    s t re tc he rs     pending the

a rr iv al       of a mb ulances .

Throughout           this time     the m oo d of the S t a d i u m was        one of       panic and

fear.        Fans were hysterical,             it was    obvious      that m a n y t ho us a nd s        of

people       in the other        stands w e r e n ’t a ware      of what was h ap p en i ng and

were     j ee ring     the Liv er po ol     fans.    I g e n u i n e l y f ea re d that       the fans

would      riot,      a ng ry because     of what    had happened,          a n gr y w i t h us as

P ol i ce O ff ic e rs and a n gr y w it h       rival    fans.

I remember a call            for doctors        being made over          the a dd re ss       s ys te m and

a ft er a m b ul an ce s arrived,         PC B AKER a nd I a t t e m p t e d to        console

d i st r a u g h t   fans and    calm those who w a n t e d to vent             their a nger           out on

us.      One St Johns A m b u l a n c e O ffice r        broke    down a nd wept           for m i nu t e s     on

my shoulder.            At one stage        I was   o rd e re d to prevent         further           fans from

climbing          t hroug h the holes       in the fencing        out on the         pitch b e hi n d the

goal.        M an y of these       fans were d eeply dis tr es se d,            s e ar ch in g for their

loved ones.            We were     unable    to prevent       them from doing this                   out of

sheer sympathy.

Until      the fans we re a d d r e s s e d by K e n n y D ALGLISH,           they     remai ned

agitated.            T hey then s lo wl y began to        leave the ground.

As PC BAKER and            I had been s e p a ra t ed from our Serial,                 we j oi ne d

D e t e c t i v e S e r g ea nt T I S S I N G T O N and his S erial    on the       pitch.

I am unable           to recall      seeing a ny stewards at           the g ro un d but was aware

of    people handing         out     cups of w ater      to   people on the          pitch at the

L e pp i n g s    Ln end of the ground.

Not    having a radio,           I was    unaware    of any      radio     t r a n s m is s io n s    that    took

place      during the       incident.

            A ft er what       s eemed    like hours,        under the s u p e r v i s i o n of C hief

                                                     17th April 1989




  We are a middle aged couple with two teenage daughters. We were
  both in the stand above where all the Liverpool Supporters were
  killed.

  We left our house at 11.00 a.m. and got into the ground at 2.10 p.m.
  At' 2.20 p.m. we went into our seats and then walked forward to look
  over the balcony at the fans below. It was obvious to us thst there
  were too many fans in the area behind the goal and indeed many looked
  distressed and many of them were chanting "no mors room no more room"
  "don't let anyone else in hare".     Surely ths Police must have had
  their eurveilljgnce cameras focused on that area and surely if we
  could see M   wae overcrowded at 2.20 p.m. they must have been able
  to see it.    Wh|; didn't they tell the Stewards not to let anyone
  else into that area and to direct people to the two side areas
  where there was room?     Why did they allow people to keep coming
  into that area in a steady stream from 2.20 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. WHY ?

  My hueband went to the toilet at 2.40 p.m. and said there were
  thousands outside and he could see a group of about 100 to 200
  baing allowed to run down the street as fast as they could towards
  the crowds that were already there.

  Then of course the event which if you wanted to be kind you would call
  "groes incompetence and bad management" but if you were being really
  truthful and honest you would call wicked, was allowed to happen.
  The Police opened a 16 foot gate and let the crowd rush in as if this
  was not bad enough, nobody had their ticket checked to eee if they
  had a correct ticket or in fact any ticket at all, this was at a
  match that was supposed to be all ticket, I myself was frisked when
  we went in and my bag was searched and my husband was also searched.
  Then to make matters even worse the Police and Stewards allowed the
  crowd to rush towards the first entrance they saw which was of course
  the tunnel leading directly into the already overcrowded area.

  Why was the gate opened to let everyone in irrespective of whether
  they had a correct ticket or not ?   Why wers they allowed to rush
  towards the most crowded area of the ground ? Why were they not
  directed towards areas with more empty spaces ?

  Now we have heard the Police opened the gate to alleviate pressure outside
  which we just cannot comprehend was a valid reason knowing the
  state of the ground inside.   Why was there so much pressure outside ?
  Why couldn't the Police control it ? Isn'-t that what they are there for?
  Why weren't there more Police outside ? Why wsre 100 to 200 fans allowed
  to run down the road towards the rest of the crowd trying to get in
  to the ground ?   Why did Police on horseback not make the croud queue in
  an orderly fashion as the Police at Anfield do weak in and week out in
  far worse conditions i.e. the alleways to the bop and the main road
\ outside the ground ? Why were the Police outside the ground if not to
                        Why didn't thepolice inside communicate the position
  to the Police outside ?
 Lastly of course there is why uiere Liverpool allocated less tickets
 than Nottingham Forest.    We have twice as many regular supporters as
 N0ttingham Forest and were given 4,000 or whatever less tickets than
 them.    In fact people who got into the ground when the gate was
 opened by the Police had tickets which they had bought from Nottingham
 Forest fans.    The Police say it was easier to control us and the
 traffice if we were given the Lickers Lane End.    This has been proved
 to be totally untrue as there was no crowd control outside and most of
 the people arrived late because of traffic problems, not to mention
 Police holding up coaches and checking for alcohol, and being made
 to walk riles from their coaches to the ground.   This has happened
 many times to us, most recently at Coventry and prior to that at
 Aston Villa when Liverpool played Arsenal in the Littleuoods Cup.
 So there is no way giving us fewer tickets can be justified.

..Me will never forget the scenes we saw and people being dragged out
  of the paddock below us and thrown on to the pitch and left to die.
  People trying to get out through totally inadequate gates and being
  pushed back by the Police at first.    People being carried away on
  hoarding by the Fans not ambulance men, policemen or stewards.
  Uhy weren't t|»e stretchers there where were they ? Where uere the
  ambulancel! ? Why weren t wirs cutters used in the fence more quickly ?
  Uhy didn't th% Police react quicker to this terrible situation ?
  Uhy were there no announcements over the loudspeaker made to inform
  everyone who didn't know of the problem ?

 UHY was this terrible thing allowed to happen ?

 Ue will never be able to forget it anyone who was there and especially
 those who have lost loved ones and friends until we get some answers
 to the above questions.

 Ue are enclosing an article which we think answers those questions
 but we hope and pray that some one can show us some other reason
 to keep us sane.

                                                  17th April 1989




We are a middle aged couple with two teenage daughters. We were
both in the stand above where all the Liverpool Supporters were
killed.

We left our house at 11.00 a.m. and got into the ground at 2.10 p.m.
At 2.20 p.m. we went into our seats and then walked forward to look
over the balcony at the fans below. It was obvious to us that there
were too many fans in the area behind the goal and indeed many looked
distressed and many of them were chanting "no more room no more room"
"don't let anyone else in here".   Surely the Police must have had
their surveillance cameras focused on that area and surely if we
could see it was overcrowded at 2.20 p.m. they must have been able
to see it.   Why didn’t they tell the Stewards not to let anyone
else into that area and to direct people to the two side areas
wher8 there was room?   Why did they allow people to keep coming
into that area in a steady stream from 2*20 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. WHY ?

My husband went to the toilet at 2.40 p.m. and said there were
thousands outside and he could see s group of about 100 to 200
being allowed to run down the street as fast as they could towards
the crowds that were already there.

Then of course the event which if you wanted to be kind you would call
"gross incompetence and bad management" but if you were being really
truthful and honest you would call wicked, was allowed to happen.
The Police opened a 16 foot gate and let the crowd rush in as if this
was not bad enough, nobody had their ticket checked to see if they
had a correct ticket or in fact any ticket at all, this was at a
match that was supposed to be all ticket, I myself was frisked when
we went in and my bag was searched and my husband was also searched.
Then to make matters even worse the Police and Stewards allowed the
crowd to rush towards the first entrance they saw which was of course
the tunnel leading directly into the already overcrowded area.

Why was the gate opened to let everyone in irrespective of whether
they had a correct ticket or not ?   Why were they allowed to rush
towards the most crowded area of the ground ? Why were they not
directed towards areas with more empty spaces ?

Now we have heard the Police opened the gate to alleviate pressure outside
which we just cannot comprehend was a valid reason knowing the
state of the ground inside.   Why was there so much pressure outside ?
Why couldn't the Police control it ? Isn't that what they are there for?
Why weren't there more Police outside ? Why were 100 to 200 fane allowed
to run down the road towards the rest of the crowd trying to get in
to the ground ?   Why did Police on horseback not make the croud queue in
an orderly fashion as the Police at Anfield do week in and week out in
far worse conditions i.e. the alleways to the bop and the main road
outside the ground ? Why were the Police outside the ground if not to
control the fans ?    Why didn't the police inside communicate the position
to the Police outside ?
Lastly of course there is why were Liverpool allocated less tickets
than Nottingham Forest.    We have twice as many regular supporters as
N0ttingham Forest and were given 4,000 or whatever less tickets than
them.    In fact people who got into the ground when the gate was
opened by the Police had tickets which they had bought from Nottingham
Forest fans.    The Police say it was easier to control us and the
traffic^ if we were given the Lickers Lane End.    This has been proved
to be totally untrue as there was no crowd control outside and most of
the people arrived late because of traffic problems, not to mention
Police holding up coaches and checking for alcohol, and being made
to walk niles from their coaches to the ground.   This has happened
many times to us, most recently at Coventry and prior to that at
Aston Villa when Liverpool played Arsenal in the Littlewoods Cup.
So there is no way giving us fewer tickets can be justified.

We will never forget the scenes we saw and people being dragged out
of the paddock below us and thrown on to the pitch and left to die.
People trying to get out through totally inadequate gates and being
pushed back by the Police at first.   People being carried away on
hoarding by the Fans not ambulance men, policemen or stewards.
Why weren't the stretchers there where were they ? Where were the
ambulances ? Why weren1t wire cutters used in the fence more quickly ?
Why didn't the Police react quicker to this terrible situation ?
Why were there no announcements over the loudspeaker made to inform
everyone who didn't know of the problem ?

WHY was this terrible thing allowed to happen ?

We will never be able to forget it anyone who was there and especially
those who have lost loved ones and friends until we get some answers
to the above questions.

We are enclosing an article which we think answers those questions
but we hope and pray that some one can show us some other reason

                                                  17th April 1989




We are a middle aged couple with two teenage daughters* We uere
both in the stand above where all the Liverpool Supporters were
killed.

We left our house at 11.00 a.m. and got into the ground at 2.10 p.m.
At 2.20 p.m. we went into our seats and then walked forward to look
over the balcony at the fans below. It was obvious to us that there
were too many fans in the area behind the goal and indeed many looked
distressed and many of them were chanting "no more room no more room"
"don't let anyone else in hers".   Surely the Police must have had
their surveillance cameras focused on that area and surely if we
could see it was overcrowded at 2.20 p.m. they must have been able
to see it.   Uhy didn’t they tell the Stewards not to let anyone
else into that area and to direct people to the two side areas
where there was room?   Why did they allow people to keep coming
into that area in a steady stream from 2.20 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. WHY ?

My husband went to the toilet at 2.40 p.m. and said there were
thousands outside and he could see a group of about 100 to 200
being allowed to run down the street as fast as they could towards
the crowds that were already there.

Then of course the event which if you wanted to be kind you would call
"gross incompetence and bad management" but if you were being really
truthful and honest you would call wickedf was allowed to happen.
The Police opened a 16 foot gate and let the crowd rush in as if this
was not bad enough* nobody had their ticket checked to see if they
had a correct ticket or in fact any ticket at all, this was at a
match that was supposed to be all ticket, I myself was frisked when
we went in and my bag was searched and my husband was also searched.
Then to make matters even worse the Police and Stewards allowed the
crowd to rush towards the first entrance they saw which was of course
the tunnel leading directly into the already overcrowded area.

Why was the gate opened to let everyone in irrespective of whether
they had a correct ticket or not ?   Why were they allowed to rush
towards the most crowded area of the ground ? Why were they not
directed towards areas with more empty spaces ?

Now we have heard the Police opened the gate to alleviate pressure outside
which we just cannot comprehend was a valid reason knowing the
state of the ground inside.   Why was there so much pressure outside ?
Why couldn't the Police control it ? Isn't that what they are there fort
Why weren't there more Police outside ? Why were 100 to 200 fans allowed
to run down the road towards the rest of the crowd trying to get in
to the ground ?   Why did Police on horseback not make the croud queue in
an orderly fashion as the Police at Anfield do week in and week out in
far worse conditions i.e. the alleways to the taop and the main road
outside the ground ? Why were the Police outside the ground if not to
control the fans ?    Why didn't the police inside communicate the position
to the Police outside ?
Lastly of course there is why uere Liverpool allocated less tickets
than Nottingham Forest.     We have twice as many regular supporters as
NQttingham Forest and uere given 4,000 or whatever less tickets than
them.    In fact people uho got into the ground uhen the gate mas
opened by the Police had tickets uhich they had bought from Nottingham
Forest fans.     The Police say it uas easier to control us and the
traffic/j if ue uere given the Lickers Lane End.    This has been proved
to be totally untrue as there uas no croud control outside and most of
the people arrived late because of traffic problems, not to mention
Police holding up coaches and checking for alcohol, and being made
to ualk rcLles from their coaches to the ground.   This has happened
many times to us, most recently at Coventry and prior to that at
Aston Villa when Liverpool played Arsenal in the Littlewoods Cup.
So there is no way giving us fewer tickets can be justified.

We will never forget the scenes we saw and people being dragged out
of the paddock bslow us and thrown on to the pitch and left to die.
People trying to get out through totally inadequate gates and bsing
pushed back by the Police at first.   People being carried away on
hoarding by the Fans not ambulance men, policemen or stewards.
Uhy weren't the stretchers there where were they ? Where were the
ambulances ? Why weren't wire cutters ueed in the fence more quickly ?
Why didn't the Police react quicker to this terrible situation ?
Why were there no announcements over the loudspeaker made to inform
everyone who didn't know of the problem ?

WHY was this terrible thing allowed to happen ?

We will never be able to forget it anyone who was there and especially
those who have lost loved ones and friends until we get some answers
to the above questions.

We are enclosing an article which we think answers those questions
but we hope and pray that some one can show us some other reason
to keep us sane.

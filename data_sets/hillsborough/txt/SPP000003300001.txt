Dear Ms. Adlington,

           The Hillsborough Disaster : Adlington v Duckenfield & Murray

I received your letter of 10th June on 19th June 1999.

For obvious reasons I am extremely reluctant to get involved any further in matters
relating to the Hillsborough Disaster. This is reinforced by the fact that it is now ten
years since the disaster and I have been retired for a considerable time. I am also
getting older. Recall suffers as a result.

I did however read through the documentation you forwarded. The vast majority
concerns matters on which I feel that I cannot, need not or should not comment. I
have however written to Mr. Croston on some matters. To what extent he thinks they
are relevant is a matter for him.

I want however to make it absolutely plain that the mere fact that I have not
commented or written about other matters cannot and must not be construed as
meaning that I agree or disagree, accept or reject the points in the paragraphs.


Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper

Dear Mr Pyne

Hillsborough Scrutiny

 Thank you for your letter of 7 May 1998.

 I have no objection to the release of the two letters to which you refer.

I should make the point - which is made in the letter of 11 November 1997 - that only my clients,
Municipal Mutual Insurance and The South Yorkshire Police, can give permission for the documents
attached to that letter to be released.

No doubt you will be separately obtaining that confirmation if you wish to release the attachments as
well as the letter.

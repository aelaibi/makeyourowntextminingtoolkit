Police Constable 2327

HQ T r a ining Department, Ecclesfield.



I am a Constable in the South Yorkshire Police, p r e s e n t l y stationed at HQ
T r a ining Department, Ecclesfield.



At 9.45am, on Saturday, 15 April 1989, I paraded for duty at the Hillsborough

Football Ground, Sheffield.



A f t e r initial briefings I took up m y duties with PS C r e s s e y and four other

Police Constables in a m o b i l e patrol van, designated Tango Six.                  Our duties

involved   patrol    of   the    G r e n oside   area   of    Sheffield,    paying    particular

attention to Licensed premises.



About 3.10pm that date, as a result of information received by radio, we

attended at the Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough Football Ground.



On arrival, it was obvious that a number of persons had been injured in the

ground.    These were being carried out of the ground by other officers.                      There

had been fatalities and about 11 bodies were lying alongside the railings

adjacent to the river, at that end of the ground.                  Other injured persons were

being given first aid by Police Officers and members of the public.



I assisted    with   crowd      control,     to effect       the   access   of   ambulances     and

e m e r g e n c y vehicles, and with the evacuation of the injured.              I did not enter

the ground itself.
    We later conveyed o f f - d u t y nurses to local hospitals, as a result of the

    appeal given by the m e d i a and assisted w h e rever required.



    I concluded duty at 7 . 00pm that date.

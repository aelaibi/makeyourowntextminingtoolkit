       Dear Dr Popper

       RE: HILLSBOROUGH

       Thank you for your letter of the 15th February 1990.

       I note what you say in connection with the disclosure of
       information to the Steering Committee by means of resuming the
       inquests.

       We have considerable sympathy for the relatives of the
       deceased and we are anxious to assist but we must ensure that
       the criminal investigation and any criminal prosecution is not
       prejudiced in any way by such disclosure.

       I have today sent papers to Mr Gareth Williams QC and
       Mr Peter Birts of Counsel who have been advising the Director
       of Public Prosecutions in connection with matters arising from
       the events at Hillsborough on the 15th April 1989.

       I hope very shortly to receive their Opinion and thereafter I
       will contact you to discuss the possibility of a meeting.

       We have spoken with Mr Jones to keep him appraised of our
       feelings on this delicate point.

       Yours sincerely




       C J Cleugh
       Head of Police Complaints Division

           Dear Bob,
           HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

           I enclose herewith a number of letters which have been sent to me from
           Sheffield Town Hall.

           I also enclose a letter and plan from Blackburn Rovers FC to go with the papers
           regarding the First and Second Division Grounds plans.

           I understand from Elizabeth Steel that Professor Usher's evidence has been
           removed from the Liverpool Law Society Library.

           By way of light relief I also enclose a letter and sample which has been sent
           to me from a Bristol firm.

            Not only is their suggestion bizarre in itself but, as we have discovered by
            simple experiment, the net cuts very easily and also burns nicely!



            Yours sincerely,


                 |(fcr AiW r

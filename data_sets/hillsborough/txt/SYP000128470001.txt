           I am Special Constable        serving    in the S Yorkshire Police-        I have

           been a Special since September,       1988 (000988) and am attached to FI

           Division Hammerton Rd Sheffield.



           During the period I have been a Special Constable          I have performed

           duty at most Sheffield Wednesday football matches and am familiar

           with the ground.



           On Saturday 15th April,    1989 I paraded for 9.30 am       (0930 h r s ) at

           Sheffield Wednesday football    ground in preparation for the Liverpool             v

           Notts Forest semi final.



           I sat in the North Stand together with other          regular Officers and
                                                                          PAGE


Special Officers.     We were briefed by various Regular Officers, and

covered emergency procedures and evacuation plans,          I was not at the

1988 semi    final.



Myself and Special Constable                  were posted together to covei

traffic on Langsett Rd,    this was to cover parking and also to try and

keep most of the Liverpool     supporters to that side of the ground.

There was six Officers    in our section under the supervision of

Section O f f i c e r ________ who was in possession of a personal    radio.



After the briefing    I went to the gym at the ground where I had a meal

and drink before starting    patrol   in Langsett Rd,    it was now between

ten thirty and eleven o ’clock    (1030 hrs -1100 hrs 5.



At this time Langsett Rd was pretty quiet and I did not see anyone

drinking from cans or any trouble.        At about   12 o ’clock   (1200 hrs) we

moved into Holme Ln where we had seen numbers of supporters walking.

In Holme Ln I saw a few noisy groups of supporters making their way to

Hillsborough Centre and the pubs.       Alt hough they were noisy I did not

see anyone    causing any trouble.     I made my way to the Yew Tree, Public

House which is in Holme Ln and this was very quiet,          but there were

still supporters making their way along Holme Ln towards the ground,

these were mainly Liverpool     supporters.    From there we made our way,

SC           and myself to the Hillsborough Centre and into the shopping

precinct.     As we made our way to the shopping area we passed the

Public House.     I think is called The Florist,      this was very busy and a

lot of people were stood outside in the beer garden drinking.             The

fans were not causing any trouble they were Liverpool          supporters and

it was just before one o'clock       (1300 hrs).
                                                                     PAGE     3


We walked through the Hillsborough shopping       precinct and it was full

of shoppers and no fans that    I saw.    Regular Officers were stationed

either end of the shopping    precinct.   We then returned to Langsett Rd

and I saw that.   The Shakespeare Public House was open and very busy

inside but no one drinking outside.       The Blue Bull, Public House in

Bradfield was closed.     I saw that   it was very busy outside the Owl

Public House near Penistone Rd I was looking from a distance and could

not be sure which supporters were using this pub,       but I could see red

and white clothing.



We continued to patrol Langsett Rd which remained pretty quiet and I

saw no trouble.     At about 2.45 pm (1445 hrs) we decided to make our

way to the ground for a meal, and in Middlewood Rd I met a regular

Officer who told me there had been some trouble with a gate in

Leppings Ln area.     When I was told this SC           and myself made our

way towards Leppings Ln when I saw and heard Police       cars and

ambulances going towards the ground,      but because we did not have a

radio we did not know what had gone off.        We walked towards Leppings

Ln turnstiles and looking at them from a distance       it looked all quiet

there at this stage.     It was now after three o'clock    (1500 hrs) and

from the cheering    I had heard it was obvious the game had started.



We walked along Parkside Rd because we could see people standing on

walls, a Police Box and other things from where you could see a little

bit of the pitch.     We tried to get the fans down some got down some

didn't.   We then made our way to the ground and walked around the

outside of the ground from Penistone Rd towards Leppings Ln.



As we reached Leppings Ln end it was now about quarter to twenty past

three   <1515 - 1520 hrs) and I saw some bodies laid out on the floor
                                                                          PAGE     '


outside the turnstiles towards the directors        car park.    This was the

first   I knew there had been any problems.       I think there was si:-:

bodies lying there,      together with people that were     injured.    There

were regular Officers      in attendance,   keeping people away from the dead

and injured.     Myself and SC         ] assisted several    people who were

injured and clear the road to enable ambulances to reach the injured,

We assisted in this area for about ten to fifteen minutes and I saw

that the bodies     lying on the floor were a blue green colour, most of

them did not have shirts on and most were without shoes.



As more and more     injured people came to us for assistance we moved

along to behind the South stand where I came across a young            lady and

her friend.     I do not know their names but they appeared to be in

their mid twenties.       Both girls were injured but one appeared worse

than the other and she was lying on a hoarding board and was wearing a

pink track suit.      This girl   complained of no feeling    in her legs and

pins and needles in her arms.       Eventually we stopped a passing

ambulance and the men got out and started to attend to the girl and at

the same time a Doctor arrived.       The girls were attended to and taken

away in the ambulance which drove away towards Leppings Ln I have no

idea how the girls got to the back of the South Stand.



At this time I think it was about 3.30 pm (1530 hrs) and a lot of

people were milling around,       I was unable to tell them what the

position was because      I did not have a radio.    I later asked a regular

Officer with a radio and he told me that the game had been cancelled.

After this I told people the situation and suggested they made their

way home,   these were Nottingham Forest supporters       leaving the    'Spiort

H o p ’ end of the g r o und.
                                                                       PAGE        !


I continued the task in clearing the area and I then heard a public

announcement that the game had been cancelled.        After most of the

people had left I made my way into the Kop and with SC                 it was

then I realised what had gone on in the ground.        The pitch was

littered with hoardings and paper     cups and other bits and pieces.         We

cleared the people out of the Kop and then made our way to behind the

North Stand.     We had a drink and then sat in the North Stand where

we had a little de brief were dismissed and went home.        It was now 6.

30 pm <1830 hrs).



At 9.30 pm (2130 hrs)    I again went to Hammerton Rd Police Station for

my regular    patrol duty.   On reaching Hammerton Rd I was teamed up with

PC408 Shults and were directed to the Boys       club at the junction of

Hammerton Rd and Infirmary Rd where relatives of the dead and injured

were meeting.     We were there for about 20 minutes and then went to

Forbes Rd community centre where again families were meeting and being

counselled by Social Workers,     Ministers,   Salavation Army and other

helpers.     My duties were to keep people out who should not be there

and also to help record details of persons reported missing to the

Social workers.     I remained at this location until 4.30 am (0430

hrs) when I came home.



I could not    identify any of the dead bodies or injured as I did not

deal with them apart from seeing the dead lying on the floor near

Leppings Ln end and assisting the injured into ambulances.

            I am PC905 BUTLER,       I am stationed at Doncaster Police Station on

            Rota 1.      I have been there since 6 March 1989 (060389).

            On Saturday 15 April          1989 (150489),      I started duty at D.H.Q.,

            Doncaster,       at 8.30 am    (0830).     I was in Serial 24.     The Serial

                Se rgeant was PS DOLAN and the P C ’s in the S e r ia 1 were BROGKSHAW,

            WARD,     SOWERBY,   CLIFTON,    and         I

            At 8.45 am       (0845), we boarded the coaches to take us to Hillsborough.

            Ours was the double decker bus.              There were several    in the convoy.       We

            arrived at the Ground at 9.30 am             (0930).

            On arrival we went to the N Stand where the briefing took place at

            10.00 am     (1000).    We were seated in our Serials.           Serial 24 was

            about halfway up the stand.              When it was over we had our packed meal.

            When the briefing was over we made our way by foot to the area we were
                                                                          PAGE


to patrol.     Serial 24 had responsibility to patrol     in pairs in

Middlewood Rd,    from liinto Rd to Hillsborough Precinct to maintain

order and prevent any clash of supporters and to pay special attention

to shops,    and in particular,   licensed premises.

At this time I was in company with PC__________ |.     His name is not on

the Serial Order;    I understand he was a replacement.

On the walk from the Ground I noticed that the area was busy,           traffic

and shoppers.     During the course of the morning we were approached by

fans from both sides who wanted to know where the Ground was or where

they could find a pub which was open.       One group of middle-aged Notts.

Forest fans asked us where they could get a rnealp they had tried the

various public houses    in the immediate area but none were open.

As the morning progressed we saw a steady increase        in the passage of

fans from both sides through the area.       A group of   girls, possibly        in

their   late teens or early twenties,    carrying plastic bags containing

cans,   one of them was holding a large,    less than full,    plastic cider

bottle, asked us where the toilets were?      there were about four or five

in the group.     On one of our journeys through the shopping area there

was a group of jovial youths taking photos of each other near the coin

operated childrens    play machines.

Quite late on in the morning as we were on our way        around the

precinct,    on the bottom edge of our area fans were     going in both

directions.     Mostly they semed to be in good humour.       Fans from both

sides were asking us which way it was to their entrance point for the

game.

Towards midday there was a steady progression of fans on foot and in

cars up Middlewood Rd towards the Liverpool entrance.          I recall    seeing

one group of youths sitting on a low wall drinking a bottle of wine

and eating bags of chips?    this was opposite Minto Rd.

As the afternoon drew on I saw numbers of Liverpool        fans who    I believe
                                                                          PAGE


by their    conduct had been drinking.       Shortly before the game, about

800 yards after the traffic lights at the bottom of Middlewood Rd,

three or four youths crossed the road towards us, the worse for drink?

one of them began walking up the middle of the road.             His friends took

charge of him and they went up towards the stadium.

Shortly before 3.00 pm (1500) we were asked on a lot of occasions by

Liverpool    fans where the match was,      or how far was it.    Many of these

fans looked as though they were the worse for drink.

At about 3.00 pm (1500) we heard that there had been some trouble at

the game,    so we started to walk up towards the stadium along with the

rest of our Serial and Serial 25.          Then a transit van pulled up with

room for 5.     I got in and travelled to the stadium in this way.             When

we got there at first we were told to stand-by,         then to get out,       by

which time the rest of the Serial had arrived and assist            in crowd

control.     We were at the Leppings Ln entrance.

At this time there was a steady trickle of fans, a lot of whom were

upset.     Soon after this increased greatly.       Many of them were    clearly

upset and I was asked on a number of occasions how many were dead, and

did I know what had happened in there.          As well as being upset, many

of the fans coming out of Leppings Ln were abusive and unco-operative

when they were asked to move away from the road in order to allow

ambulance/fire brigade to pass.

I stayed at Leppings Ln until about 4.45 pm (1645) when we were

instructed to resume patrol.       I was    in company with PC FINNERTY at

this time.     We arrived back at the Ground at about 5.15 pm (1715).

When we got the re we were told to form a cordon to stop people go i ng

into the gym.     Whilst there I was told by the Control Officer to take

charge of body 16.     However,   when I had located it, the Control

Officer told me it had already been dealt with.

From there    I went to the N Stand for debrief and then to C lay whee 1s

         Ln,     Here we had a meal    in the mobile   canteen,   then boarded the

          transport for D.H.G.    I went off duty at D.H.Q. at 7.45 pm (1945),

                I am employed as a Bar Steward a t _____________                                and J.

                live at the above address with my girl friend



                I have been a Liverpool Football            supporter for at least 20 years     I go

                to all the home matches and when I can afford it I go to the away

                matches as well.



                On Saturday 13th April,        1989 (150489)     I left my house at approximately

                9.00am   (0900 hrs),      I was going to meet a friend called

                at the                                i n                next door to the

                                        We left the             at approximately 1 1 . 0 0 am to 11

                13 am    (1100 to 1115 hrs) and travelled down the M57 onto the M62 and

                then on the Ml,        We stopped off for about half an hour on the Ml just
                                                                     PAGE


to get a drink and go to the toilet.



We arrived in Sheffield at approximately 2.20 pm (1420 hrs) and parked

at the top of a steep hill at the bottom was a railway bridge.           We

then both walked towards the ground.     We arrived at the ground at

about 2.35 pm (1435 hrs) and it was utter      chaos then.   There was

hundreds of people trying to get into the gates,       I had a 'B * ticket

and was trying to head for the   'B* gate.     There was such a crush

because there were that many people that I said to           that I was

going to try and make it to the front,    if I do not see you I will see

you back at the car after the match.     I then left



I eventually got to the middle gate and people were becoming very

squashed.    Some were becoming distressed.     There were about three

Police Officers on Police horses teling      people to get back but we

could not, as you could not move due to the amount of pressure that

was on us.



One of the mounted Police Officers was hitting      people with his hands

saying people are getting squashed at the front get back.        Then they

just started pushing   people with the horses.



I managed to get through the turnstile and into the yard,       I gave rny

ticket   in as I went through the turnstile.     There were no Police

officers or stewards .in the yard directing people where to go,      so I

just headed down to the tunnel and onto the terraces.        I went straight

into Pen 3, that is the middle   pen right behind the goal.      I moved

over to the right hand side, and moved down to the front where the

•front railings meet the side railings of the pen on my left hand side.

At the front there is what   I can only explain as a large concrete step
                                                                          PAGE


in between the railings.       I put my right foot on it and held onto the

spikes on the fence di v i di. ng the two p en s .   The only reason in

doing this was so that I could see the rest of the crowd and could see

the match.    This being about 2.35 pm (1455 hrs).



At this point I thought the pen was full then and that no more could

fit in,   people were being squashed,     some people were being lifted out

over the front railings and other       people were screaming for the gates

to be opened.    This was about 3.00 pm (1500 hrs).



Some   people were climbing over the side railings and some were being

helped over the front railings.        I would say it took the Police      10 to

15 minutes to open the front gate and to start taking people out one

by one.



At about 3.05 pm (1505 hrs)      there was a large surge      in the crowd.      I

fell from where I was standing to the floor but my leg was still on

the railings.    As I hit the floor     I felt this terrific     pain in my leg

then my leg went down.



I was helped up by a man who      put his hands      in the middle of my back

and another man helped me up.       My leg went dead and I could not fee^

it.    I somehow managed to get over the top of the railings and threw

myself onto the pitch just behind the goal.



One of the men who had helped me up shouted over to give him a hand

getting his young lad out.       I stood on the advertising boards at the

side of the fence and leaned over and managed to get the young            lad

out.    I then put him down on the pitch as far as I can remember he was

fully conscious just very upset.        I do not know now and I do not think
                                                                      PAGE      4


I will ever know if his father got out.



I got down and sat on the pitch behind the goal, when some first

aiders moved me over to the goal and made me sit leaning against the

upright goal post.     They then splinted my right leg.      All around there

were dead and dying people.         There must have been about 20 people just

behind the goal.     Some were being given cardiac massage to their

chests and others were being given the kiss or life by Firemen and

Policemen,    but the majority of bodies next to me had their heads

covered up because they were dead.



I was asked at least twice     if I was OK, and I said my leg was sore but

to see to the others who were seriously ill.



At about 3.35 pm (1355 h r s 5 I was asked if I was OK yet again,     but I

was so depressed with all these dead bodies around me and I asked to

be moved.     It was like a scene from a war film.



I was taken to the Forest end of the ground by a load of Liverpool

supporters who put me on a makeshift stretcher made out of an

advertising hoarding and I was        put down at the other end of the ground

where the ambulances were entering the ground.



I sat up and looked around me and I was sitting on the floor for about

20 minutes,    I was the only injured person down this end of the pitch,

                 On Saturday 15 April        1989 (150489)     I was on duty in company with other

                 officers;,     involved in duties at the FA Semi Final           football match at

                 the Hillsborough football        stadium,     between Liverpool FC and Nottingham

                 Fores t FC »

                 I was   part of serial 34,      under the supervision of PS 2248 S H E R R A T T .

                 At 10am (1000) we all attended a briefing                in the grounds North Stand

                 area.

                 At 11am (1100)      serials 34 and 35 were briefed by our Commander,

                 Inspector T O W NE ND .

                 At 11.15am      (1115) we   all took up our positions on Claywheels Ln.          Each

                 bus that arrived was        met by officers in our two serials,          they were

                 directed to drive to        the end of this particular        road and   there turn

                 around and return to        park alongside our serials.
                                                                                            PAGE         2


A n o f f i ce r f r om our seria I g r e e Z e d ea c h ca a c:h a n d t h e y w ere all

directed towards the football             stadium.      These buses       contained a wide

cross section in ages of Liverpool               supporters and I can state that

from this section of supporters whilst they were in this location,

they appeared to be well behaved and in good spirits.

At   1345 hours Claywheels Ln was completely full of supporters buses,                               I

recorded a total        of 52 buses and 2 mini          buses at this location.

At 1425 hours we were further deployed to the junction of Claywheels

L n with P en i stone R d N o r t h .

we positioned outside a public house named The Gate,                       and our duties

were defined as supervising the arriving fans who were walking down

Halifax Rd towards us.

We were instructed to form a filter                lane of officers and to inform the

supporters that all alcoholic drinks would be left at this location.

From this     position you can see a good distance up this Halifax Rd and

as far as the eye could see I saw that there was a continuous flow of

Live r pool supporters       i n groups a p p r o k . 1 0 abreast on both sides of the

car r iageway.

The majority of these were males              in the lower age bracket,            it was very

apparent to me that a large amount of alcohol had been consumed by the

vast majo r ity of these m e n .

A large number of them were still               drinking on their way towards the

ground and a large number of them were halted and asked to leave their

intoxicants at this location.              Some of them left their drinks,                  others

insisted on consuming them at this               location.

Generally they were all of good behaviour,                   they were drunk but not

incapable or disorderly.

From me and the other officers taking up this                    position the thing that

became most -apparent to me other than their drunken states was how

late thousands of them had left it to go to get into the ground.                               This

recollection will   not at this time allow me to recall much more.             This

area was heavily congested with emergency vehicles and large numbers

of Liverpool   supporters who did not assist the already      chaotic

si tuati on? a large number of them were obviously very drunk and were

verbally abusing every Police Officer   present.

We had a difficult task in moving these persons to allow for the

movement of the ambulances   carrying away their   injured.    None of these

so called fans seemed concerned with assisting such movement,,          they

seemed bent on abusing the Police.

After a while a Police   Inspector ordered me into his Police van and we

were despatched to attend a fight'.

The whole area was a seething mass of persons, we found no fight

taking place so we returned to the Leppings Ln e n d .

By this time the ground was emptying further and we were getting

similar hostile abuse from a large number of such persons.         We stood

our ground and accepted this abuse,   we had no alternative,      crowd

control was totally impossible.

As the crowds began to thin out we entered the ground via the

concertina gates at the Leppings Ln end and made our way on standby

into the North Stand.

I then took no further part in this incident.

ambulance    personnel   or similar.      I made my way through the tunnel to

the te r races.    There were injured pea pie ly i ng on the ground with

fans     milling around t he m .     I assisted some i njured peo pie through the

tunnel    to the yard at the rear.        There many bodies and injured people

on the terraces     close to the perimeter fence.         These    people were

being tended to by Police Officers and spectators.                There was a large

•number of spectators on the          pitch just on the other side of the

fence.     I could see injured people and bodies being passed over the

fence and through a gap in it.           There were Police Officers and

spectators trying to break down the fence to gain access to the

terraces.



I assisted in removing several          injured people from the terraces to the

tunnel and into the yard.          This was extremely difficult we had to

force our way through the crowd to reach injured people and then force

our way back.      Whilst on the terraces the crowd on the stand above us

were shouting and jeering          insults at the police.     Many of them were

spitting down onto the people below.           The noise was deafening,        it was

almost    impossible to hear what a person next to you was saying.               The

stench of stale beer and faeces was strong.              It was obvious that the

police were being blamed for what had happened,             at times   I was

concerned for my own and other          peoples safety,    I thought we would be

overrun by the crowd.       People were     climbing bath up and down from the

stand above us.      Whilst this was happening we had to prevent           people

coming onto the terraces from the tunnel             they were trying to force

their way past us.       These     people were displaying anger towards Police

Officers again blaming us for what had happened.              Some of these      people

were obviously genuinely distressed and were trying to find friends

and. relatives they had lost         contact with.

                 duty at the H i l l s b o ro u gh Football            Ground,     Sheffield,        in conne ction

                 with     the semi-final         football      match    between Liverpool            and N ot ti n gh a m

                 Forest Football            Clubs,    On reporting            for duty     I immediately made my

                 way     to the j un ction of Niag ar a Rd and B ee le y Wood Rd where                        I

                 c ontrolled traffic, travelling along N i ag a ra Rd in an attempt                               to stop

                 parking w it hi n the          police   sports     ground.

                 At    10.20am     (1020)      that   same day,     I returned to the H i ll s bo r ou g h

                 Football     Gro un d and there         commenced at           the entrance       to the     gym na si um

                 were     obviously from the Li verpool                area,     these     people were      good

                 humoured,       but    in high spirits.           I stayed at          this   location until          the

                 mai n    briefing      had taken      place,    at the        completion of the briefing                1

prisoner transport from the ground to Hammer ton Rd or Ecclesfield

Police Station,

At approx       1.00pm      (1300),    due to the    lack of a c t i v i t y wi t h i n the    police

room at this        time,        1 made a visit    to the N orth S t a n d / K o p area of the

ground,       in order      to    look at the   pitch and also        the. crowd,    I noticed

at    this    t irne that    the re were   f ar mo re No11s     fa n s wi thin the g round

compared to L.i ve r poo 1 , at the         time    I spoke    to a membe r of the        ground

staff and we dis c u s s e d the match that had               taken    place   the year       before

and    the    lack of Liverpool         support    in the ground       compared to     last

y e a r ’s.

At approx 1.30pm            (1330)    I did a prison run to Ecclesfield Police

Station,       together with POL PC"700, in order to get to the police

station I travelled out of               '0' gate at Hillsborough along Penistone Rd

away from city,          onto Penistone Rd North,          Halifax Rd, Chaucer Rd, Yew

Ln to the police station.                I noticed throughout the journey which

passed a number of public houses that there were                        large numbers of

supporters who did not appear to be interested in making any attempt

to travel       towards the ground and in fact there were                  large numbers

walking       in the opposite direction.             I dropped off the prisoners at

Ecclesfield a n d m a d e rny w a y faa c k t o t h e foot ba 11 g ro u n d u s in g the sa rne

route up to the junction with Leppings Ln when I travelled along

Leppings Ln into the ground through onto Penistone Rd North and to the

police box.         Again during the trip I noticed large numbers of fans who

did not appear to be making any attempt to make their way towards the

ground.        Hear to the gates         I saw fans who were having to be forced by

officers outside the ground to move towards the turnstiles and enter

the ground.         I parked the van outside the police room at the ground

and made enquiries as to the position with any new prisoners.                                 I was

informed that there were a number to be transported again to

                   On Saturday 15 April                1989 (150489),            I performed duty as Logistics

                   at 6 am      (0600) and worked at various                      locations    throughout the ground.

                   About 3 pm (1500)              I heard a radio message directing                   officers on to the

                   pitch at the Lappings Lane end of the ground.                               To find out what was

                   happening       I went to the perimeter track by the pitch in front of the

                    I could see large numbers of people                          including Police Officers and

                    civilians on the pitch in front of the Leppings Lane terraces.

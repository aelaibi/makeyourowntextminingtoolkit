     Phase 2.             It was a concern                of mine that we had full cover on half time in                                            that

     West Stand. This was agreed by Inspector Bullas.

     At Leppings Lane I formed a                          liaison with the horsemen, theywere clearing the                                          non

     ticket holders.                There seemed to be hundreds, young and old mixed, some drunk.

The    C I D w e r e there          outside           the g a t e s in      the     'pull-in',                  ev e r y o n e       s e emed    to g at h e r

Y o u ke p t     s e e i n g the same faces a g a i n a n d again,                               some w i t h cans o f beer,                     some w i t h


plastic        bottles.

I    kept      going     round           all     my      men.     I     also       ke p t    seeing           the    Sergeants             and    liaising


with    the CID.

The    fa n s were ve r y mixed.                      I t a l k e d w i t h a L o n d o n w o m a n and her friend,                              they were

the    Liverpool             Club         L o n d o n Section.              T h e y we r e nice           but      others           we r e    not, a n d       it

was    apparent              by      the       general       attitude          o f some of             the L i v e r p o o l     supporters             that

t h e y r e s e n t e d the p o l i c e presence.

I don't        k n o w wh a t        time       it was but we               knew     that the t r ains had a r r i v e d ju s t after

2.00     p.m.     T h e C I D we re             outside         the    shop.         T h e r e were           ticket touts I think there.

Someone        said     the h o r s e s w o u l d c l e a r             the     pavements              as     they arrived.                  I warned        the


CID.

T h e y a r r i v e d but it d i d n ' t s e e m as h e c t i c                    as I thought.                    The t u r n s t i l e s s e e m e d to

Y o u c o u l d smell             the b e e r in the a t m o s p h e r e .

At    some       stage        I     we n t     to     turnstile         A.G.           I    h ad    kept        che c k i n g       the      turnstile         at


regular        intervals.

Soon     after         that       the      c r owds      we r e   there.        Al l       the     large       perimeter             g a t es w e r e    open,

the    funnel         w as    filling,           there we r e          others        on     the r i v e r side.                  I knew they hadn't

tickets.          I h ad that a r e a swept b y the h o r s e s                             to get t h e m back o ut                      to the road.

I knelt        d o w n on the si d e bar o f the f u n n e l                           a n d saw all the PC's on the gate,                                   they

were     struggling               b ut     coping.          I checked           them.            I s aw Poli c e C o n s t a b l e              9 63    Evans,

he    was      r ed    in     the        face,      he    seemed       to     be    so      busy.           The     others          seemed      to be        just


pressed        a g a i n s t the wall.

I     think      then        I     s aw      Chief       Inspector           Creaser.              I     mentioned             my    concern           for    the

s a f e t y o f the p o l i c e o f f i c e r s on the gate.

It     was     decided          to     leave       the   officers           in pos i t i o n     and      to c o n t i n u e     to m o n i t o r       the

situation,            w h i c h I did.

The horses were                  a s s i s t i n g us then.            I d i r e c t e d them to a s s i s t              the turnstiles.                It

wa s    most        difficult           for    th e m    due     to the        construction            a nd    siting of             the b ar w h i c h

acts      to       funnel        them     into       the     turn s t i le s .      They      had      to s t a r t at the             back.           They

t r i e d to get the m into q u eu e s ,                     b ut    it was a problem.

I j u s t c a n ' t r e m e m b e r w h a t h a p p e n e d next.

T he    n e x t t h i n g wa s I l o o k e d o v e r again.                      I s t o o d at the c o r n e r o f the wall on the

bar,     a n d then c l i m b e d up there to a c h i e v e a vantage p o i n t - I s a w the two horses.

T h e r e was       the        'E'    D i v i s i o n PC f r o m H a c k e n t h o r p e at the far side,                    P o l ic e C o n s t a b l e

Evans         in    the    middle            and    Police       Constable            Duffy      nearest.             I    saw       the   horses        go

t o wa r d s       the     gate.          Police         Constable            Duffy      s tumbled but          quickly          r e g ai n e d    his

position.

I t h i n k I s aw I n s p e c t o r S y k e s a g a i n ,                m a y b e C h i e f I n s p e c t o r C r ea s e r ,       I'm not sure.

A    decision            was    made      to    take       the o f f i c e r s     out of that            area.       I s t o o d on       the rail.

I    told       the       remaining            officers         to     get      out.        They       c o u l d n ' t go      up      the     funnel.

P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e D u f f y h a d t r i e d bu t ha d be e n forced ba c k b y the crowd.

I    think         there       was     just     Police        Constable          Evans      and     the       'El'    PC.        I    signalled          to

h i m a n d he went,                 I think       t h r o u g h the      turnstile.           I h ad b e e n s h o u t i n g to them,                  the

p ubl i c ,        'get    back,        get    back.'           Police        Constable        Evans w a s           left,     he     c ou l d n ' t    get

o f f the wall,            he w a s stuck.               P e o p l e w e r e j u s t p r e s s i n g a n d pushing.                   I 'm not sure

n o w o f the o r d e r of events.

I c o u l d see p e o p l e            b e i n g s q u a s h e d up at the turnstile walls,                           the h o r s e s h a d m o v e d

back.          I think P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e           E v a n s w a s still there,               I s h o u t e d at him.              He just

c o u l d n ' t move,          a n d I w a s c o n c e r n e d fo r h is safety.

There        was     a    strong        smell       of   alcohol          in the       air.       Peop l e     were       throwing         things        at

the     hors e s ,        beer        cans     and      such.        At     some     point      I   s aw      Detective          Superintendent
ROBERT PURDY                                                                 -4-

McKay.            He w a s     b e h i n d me      near        the    river        barrier.              I do n ot       imagine that he could

see      the c r o w d to the              same e x t e n t as m y s e l f due to the v a n t a g e p o i n t I held.

A t some          s tage I s aw that P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e                 Evans got t h r o u g h the turnstile.

They were              crushed        up   agai n s t         the    wall,     the         turnstile,         the      far wall,            the barrier.

I saw people                in pain,        suffering.

I sa w     Detective             S u p e r i n t e n d e n t McKay.           He       l o oked       at me      a n d s a id "They'll have to

o p e n the g a t e s          or s o m e t h i n g w i l l         happen.'1

I think           I just        got     back       on    the    rail,       but    this m a y be out o f sequence.                             T h e r e was

a   child         passed        f r o m we l l      in    the        middle       of       the    crowd       to me      on    the     rail.          He was

limp.         I        thought       at    first         he    was     dead.           He     was limp          in m y hands.               I have since

e s t a b l i s h e d that         the     c h i l d w a s p a s s e d tos a f e t y and is n o w r ecovered.

I   think          a TV       c a m e r a w as     there        or    had    been,          a man        with     curly       hair,         sports      coat,

a bout 35-45»               p e r h a p s ITV,      BBC.

There       was         another        c h il d    being        either       crushed             or     passed    out.        We    t r i ed   to     get    to

him.          I    t hi n k     D e t e c ti v e   Constable           Cerrone             tried        but   a man      was       pulling       h im    back

saying        " H e ' s g o i n g in."

T he p r e s s u r e w a s so g r e a t             then tha t p e o p l e were crying,                          scream i n g .       T h e y c o u l d not

move.      T h e y w e r e p r e s s e d up a r o u n d the bar,                           the wall a nd the stiles.

Th a t    child         I     thought       then        had     been       squashed          or       suffocated        in     the     crush.           I got

down.

I   saw,          either       before        or     after,          Superintendent                Marshall         on    the       wa l l    outside        the

p e r i m e t e r gate.            He ha d t a k en a v a n t a g e p o i n t to get an o v e r a l l p e r c e p t i o n o f the


s i t u a t io n .

I   went          to    him,      signalled             him.         All    the    side          w as    full     now.         I    started          off.     I

 the     side        gates       w e r e shut.              I    remember        a       big fat y o u t h        in      m y way.        I shouted          at

 him     to move.             I saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t          Marshall.             I said        "We're           going       to have      to    do

 s o m e t h i n g,    someone          is g o i n g to d i e . "

 We m e n t i o n e d      the      gates.          He      stopped,           obviously assessing                      the    s ituation.            He said

 "O p e n the gates."

 The s i t u a t i o n w a s         life o r d e a t h           f o r the p u blic trapped in there.

 I      r e t u r n e d to the b a r r i e r o n the s i d e o f                               the turnstile.

 I      organised            the     horses         to      block off          the             g a t e s at the            p e r i m e t e r . It seem e d that

 we     could         deal    w i t h the n u m b e r s           in    there        if we c o n t a i n e d the p e o p l e              outside.          When

 that     w as        secure        by all        the       horses,       n o w five perhaps,                 and        u n i f o r m PC's,      I c a used

  the    gate         to   be     opened         down       the        side.         I    think    Detective               Constable        Cerrone          was

  there and P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e                Evans.

  It w as the o n l y              w a y to save li f e                in there at that time.

 A    throng          moved        in, I         was     pushed         to     the       left.    Then        I    ordered          the    gate       closed,

 a l t h o u g h they m a y have                 a l r e a d y b e e n closed.

 I looked,            o r s o m e o n e did,           to see i f it was clear o utside.                                  It w as      a nd I w e n t out.

 T h e h o r s e s we re          there.

 It     h ad    alleviated              the    situation               bu t    people        were still            trapped          on      that       side bar.

 I       pulled         th e m under.            Those          with tickets                   we r e   filed           through       by h o r s e s to the open

 gates.          It was          or de r l y .    There          appeared        to be room now.                       I th e n t h o u g h t    it wa s no

  I was        somewhere            down       the    side n e a r the r iver now.

  T hen,       sometime             after        that,       the       gate I          was    f a cing      opened        a nd       it just       emptied.

  T h a t w as       the ga t e          on the left w h e n a p p r o a c h i n g the turns t i l e s .                           I think I n s p e c t o r

  B e n n e t was       sat a b o v e          it.

  It s e e m e d       to e m p t y          then.      I h ad no t          ordered          that or k n e w wh y it h a d h a p p e n e d but

  I felt          initial       r e l i e f f or those people.

  The     next         thing        I   can     recall        is      a message          either       on       the    system         or    radio,    saying

  "All o f f i c e r s o n t o               the pitc h . "           This    is the first r a d i o m e s s a g e I h ad r e c e i v e d or

  heard transmitted                      for n e a r l y one           hour.           I took a Ser i a l ,           u n d e r the s u p e r v i s i o n of

  Police          Sergeant          Whitlam,           a r ound        un d e r    the       command       box       into S o u t h Stand          and do w n

  on t o the t r a c k at L e p p i n g s Lane.

  At     so m e     point      very           shortly        afterwards            I went       to    the      centre        of Leppings           Lane    and

  behind          the goal.              I s aw the extent o f the disorder.

  Superintendent                Greenwood              was       in    the    centre,         there      w as     only       one     gate.        There    was

  n ot p h y s i c a l l y      r o o m to do a n y t h i n g there.

  I moved           to m y     left,           I s aw only            four ways         out for the t r a p p e d a nd injured,                      to the

  front,          to    the    back,           left,        right      even       perh a ps     up.        I    decided         to    go    to the      left.

  There were no ot h e r                      senior officers                there so I t o o k r e s p o n s i b i l i t y               for that area.

  I    climbed          on    the        f e n ce    an d    pleaded         with       the    fans      to     mo v e    to my       left,       I us ed my

^^arms.           It w o r k e d        in part.        T h e r e w e r e some o f f i c e r s a n d p e o p l e now,                     getting o t h e rs

  out o v e r the            s p i k e d railings.

  I w as       joined         by        Inspector           Darling.          I remember             trying          to   get      a Serial        into    the

  p en    on      the      le f t       to    keep     the       crowd       back       so    that    we       could      evacuate          the    injured.

  T h e y d i d this.

  People        started         to com e out this way.

  I    could        n ot     continue            where       I    was       and    I    got    onto      the         track      again,       I    carried     a

  small p e r s o n          f r o m the gate on my own.                          Others wanted                to h e l p but I insisted I did

  it.       I carried               her or          h i m onto        the    pitch.          Someone        to o k    over      then.        I we n t     ba c k

At   the     track           I    could        see         spiked     railings,              fans    boxed       in.        No      w a y out       and still

h o s t i l e y o u t h s w a n t i n g to invade the p i t c h a nd fight.

I walked          along          at    some       point        and s o m e o n e        said       "That     one's dead,             try a n o t h e r . "       I

saw a blue bar                   (crash b arrier)                  b e i n g h u r l e d o v e r the fence,               I t h o u g h t by the             fans

at the Police.

I    remember           dealing          with          a    lad.         I    don't         know     if   this      is    the       one    I    carried        or

after.            He     had      a    white           shirt       on.        He    w as         alive.      His    breathing             was       short     and

rushed.            I     put      him        in     the     recovery           po s i t i o n .      I kept        his     airway         open.         I    kept

t a l k i n g t o him.                I ha d to c l e a r his m o u t h out,                        it was     full o f w h i t e froth.                    I was

joined by          s o meone.                On c e    I thought             his   b r e a t h i n g was       i n c r e a si n g we p l a c e d h i m on

I we n t    back            to   the     gate.             I h ad    instructed              a PC to go w i t h e a c h person.                        I spent

thought       him           dead,      then       they h ad a t t e m p t e d               to s t a r t his h e a rt again.                   I performed

    At the briefing, i saw all four Serials and Inspector Syk s. they were all present.

    On e change in 'E' Division, Police Constable Duffy.

    I oaw Sergeant Payne brief his men.                   He did it well, very professional.

    It was agreed all w o u l d meet at the rear of West Stand, w h e n Inspector Sj.                        . :iu

    the Serials.              He had worked that location in the past and it seemed totally
    he should complete it.

    I was aware after that about safety of the Officers under ray contnand                                    ergeant

   I saw Sergeant WhitIam.                  He had his Serial well organised, he was familiar w i c h his
   area of responsibility.

   sergeant m > c t o r was on the road w i t h Inspector Sykes, who was in overall coi,.                      -i of

   wie . dd area.                  As such, I decided to supervise all other Serials on the turnstile.

   I had ascertained there were problems of relief, Serial 16 relieved Serial 13, r.o i

   thought it pertinent to e s t a blish their full duties, i saw Inspector Bui las                          in the

   company of Sergeant Payne.                  We all discu ss e d strategy for Phas.* 2.

   It was a concern of m i n e that we had full cover on half time in.that West Stand.                           This
                                                                                          \


  was agreed by Inspector Bullas.

  At Leppings Lane I formed a liaison w i t h the horsemen,                    they w e r e clearing the non-ticket

  holders.           There seemed to be hundreds, young and old mixed, some drunk.

  T he C.*.D. were there, outside the gates in the 'pull -i n ' , everyone seemed so gather

  there.                           people to go into the ground, they seemed reluctant and a b u s ,■.t.-            You

 The c o m e r shop was a concern, I thought it was a target for a robbery.

       C.I,D.

       The fans were v e r y mixed.          I talked w i t h a London w o m a n and her .riend, they we re the

       Liverpool C l u b London Section.          T he y h a d chips and shared them, I joked about m y diet.

       T h e y were nice, but others were just animals.                   They looked at you, the ground, then

       off, then back, then off.

       I don't k n o w what time it was but we k n e w that the trains h a d arrived just after 2.OOpm.

       The C.l.D, were outside the shop.             T he r e were ticket touts I think there.                    Someone said

       the horses would clear the pavements as they arrived.                           I w a r n e d the C.l.D,

       T h e y arrived but it          didn't seem as hectic as I thought.                 I thought that was later, some

       came then went I'm sure.            The turnstiles seemed to fill.                  I seemed to dc nothing then

       but direct people and inspect tickets.

       Y o u could smell the beer in the atmosphere.

       At some stage I went to turnstile A.G., that's when it seemed worst.                                I don't k n o w why.

       I think the Sergeant w a s there, 1 had kept checking at regular intervals.

       Soon after that the crowds were there.                  All the large perimeter gates                w e r e open, the

       funnel was filling, there w e r e others            on the river side.                I k n e w they hadn't tickets.

       I h a d that area swept by          the horses to get them back out to the road.

       I knelt down on the side            bar of the funnel and saw all the P.C.'s on the                           gate, they

       were struggling but coping.            I checked them.             I saw Police Constable 963 Evans, he was

       red in the face, he             seemed to be so busy.         I shouted, 'Are y o u alright?'              H e said, 'Yeah.'

       I was concerned for them, they were getting hassle.                        The others seemed to be just pressed

       against the wall.             It was heaving in the funnel to the turnstiles.

       I think then I saw Chief            Inspector Greaser.            I m e n t i on e d the problem for           the lads.

       I h a d remembered what M r         Duckenfield had said about safety, 'IT'S PARAMOUNT!1

       It was decided to leave them in then.              I did but kept checking.

       The horses \v ■ 3 assisting us then.            Idirected them to assist the t u r n s l i 1:                      was

      most difficult, there was this long funnel bar, it made it difficult.                                 T m , ..an i, start

       at the back.            T h e y tried to get them into queues, but it was a problem.

       I just can't remember what happened next.

       The next thing was I looked over again, I think.                       I stood at the corner of the wall

    on the bar,               I k n ow no-cne k n e w h o w it was because you can't tell unless you are above

    it.

    I climbed up there next, I thought it was the only way.                         I didn't feel stable in that

    p o s i t i o n but it was the only vantage point I could see to use, near that sector.

    Detec t i v e Constable Cerrone was still there, he helped m e up.                        I saw the two horses,

    There w a s the 'E' Division P.C. from H a c k e nthorpe at the far side, Police Constable

    Evans m           the middle and Police Constable Duffy nearest.

    I saw the horses go towards the gate.                  Police      Constable Du f f y stumbled.          Ithought     if

    he goes d o w n we've h a d it, then he po p p e d up.              I think, as I look back, r had            no personal

    fear of injury there, but was fearful for those Officers in there.                               It was them first

    I      know, not the public, then.

    I      think I saw Inspector Sykes again,                  m a y b e Chief Inspector C r e a s e r . I'm not sure, but

    w e agreed to pull them out.               It was p o l i c y 1 gathered.

    I've still no real percep t i o n of time, 2.20 - 2.30, I just don't know.                              I kn o w I stood

    on the rail.                I told the remaining Officers to get out.           T h e y couldn't go up the funnel,

    Police Constable D u f f y had tried but h a d been forced back.

    I think there was just Police Constable Evans and the 'El' P.C,                               I signalled to him

    and h e went, I think through the turnstile.

    I had been shouting to them, the public, ’Get                      back, get    back.'

    Just Police Constable Evans wa s left, he couldn't get off the wall, he was stuck.                                   People

    w e r e just pressing and pushing,

    I'm h o n e s t ly not sure n o w of the order.

    I     could see people being squashed up                   at the turnstile walls, the horses ha d m o v e d back.

    I      think Police Constable Evans was still there. I shouted at him.                         He just couldn't

   move.         The element in there, I k n e w if he went down he was dead. It just smelled like

    the tap r o om of a pub.             People were throwing things at the horses, beer cans and such,

   At some point I saw Detective Superintendent McKay.                       He was behind m e near the river

    barrier,            I looked at him. he looked at me.            I don't think he could see what I could

    see, due to m y vantage point.

   Then, or just after, or even before, I just don't know, Police Constable Evans got through

    the turnstile.

    People w e r e screaming, 'Do something, we're going to die.                Do s o m e t h i n g . 1   It was turmoil.

    T n e y w e re crushed up against the wall, the turnstile, the far wall, the barrier.                          I saw

    people in pain, suffering.

   The next thing I m a y have got down.            I saw Detective Superintendent McKay.                   He looked

    at m e and said, 'They'll have to open the gates or something will happen.'

    I think I just got b a c k on the rail, but this m a y be out of sequence.

   There was a child passed from well in the m i d d l e of the crowd to m e on                        the rail. He

   was limp,             I thought he was dead.   He was limp in m y hands.

   %      fear h a d cha n g e d n o w to the public.     Children, I saw others, and girls.                I thinx a

   T.V. camera was there or had been, a m a n w i t h curly hair, sports coat, about 35 - 45,

   perhaps ITV, BBC.

   T here was another child being either crushed or passed out.                    We tried to get him,             I

    think Detective Constable Cerrone tried but this m a n was pulling h i m back, saying, 'He's
   going i n . ’

   The pressure was so great then people w e r e crying, screaming.                   T h e y could not move.

   T h e y w e re pres s e d up around the bar, the wall, stiles.

    It seemed then that if a per s o n was going down, they w e re sure to die.                        That child I

    thought then h a d been squashed or suffocated in the crush.                 I got down.

   1 saw, either before or after. Superintendent Marhsall on the wall outside                              theperimeter

   gate.        He had taken a vantage point.           It was the o n l y w a y to supervise,          If not you wo u l d

   have no overall perception.

   I went to him, signalled him,             All the side was full now.         I started off.             I shouted

   D etec t i v e Constable Cerrone,        I think if I had any personal fear of injury this was the
   only time.

   T he people n o w w e r e just like animals there, I was pushed, jostled, punched.                        Detective

   C onstable Cerrone followed me, 1 never lost sight of him, that was m y policy.

   W h e n I got there, I think I h a d re-swept the side w i t h horses, and the side gates were

   shut,        I remember a big fat you t h in m y way,          I shouted at h i m to move, I was probably
   rude.

 I s a w Superintendent Marshall, h e looked perplexed.             I do not k n o w hi m well but I can

 e mpathise - X probably looked worse.

 I said, 'We're going to have to do something, someone is going to d i e . 1                    'They'll die

 at the turnstiles' he spoke.           I can remember what he said,

 We m e n t i o n e d the gates.   H e stopped, obviously assessing the situation.            H e said, 'Open

 the gates.'       I supplied h i m w i t h m y thoughts,    i hope I am right that Superintendent

M c K a y had those same reservations.        The situation was life or de a t h for the public trapped
 in there.

 I returned to the barrier on the side of the turnstile.

 I think then I organised the horses to block off the gates at the perimeter.                        It seemed

 that w e could deal w i t h the numbers in there if we contained the people outside.

 When that was secure b y all the horses, n o w five perhaps, and uni f o r m P.C.'s, I caused

 the gate to be opened down the side.            I think Detective Constable Cerrone w a s there and

 Police Constable Evans.

 It was, i am sure or I hope, the only w a y to save life in there at that time,

A throng m o v e d m ,     I was pushed to the left.        T h e n I ordered the gate closed, although

 they m a y have already been closed.

 I looked, or someone did, to see if it w a s clear outside.              Not for fear, but so no other'
                                                                                                                     «
c ould come in.       It was and I went out.       The horses were there.

It h a d alleviated the situation, but people were still trapped on that side bar.                         I pulled

them under.       T h o s e w i t h tickets were filed through by horses to the open gates.               It was

orderly.      There appeared to be room now.         I then thought it was no longer life threatening

and the gates were shut again.

T o m e it was two bursts, the first larger, the second short but a steady flow and
controlled.

I saw the Superintendent on the wall again, I think.                 The people in the funnel had pulled

back and it appeared safe.           I think I indicated to the Superintendent by putting m y arms
up in the air.

H e Signalled for the centre gate perimeter to be opened.                T h e h o rs e m e n did this.

It then filled again.          I'm sure it got back to the same proportion yet again.

  I was somewhere down the side near the river now.

  Then, sometime after that, the gate I was facing opened and it just emptied.                             That was

  the gate on the left w h e n approaching the turnstiles.                    I think Inspector Bennett was

  sat above it.

  It seemed to e m p t y then.          I had not ordered that or k n e w w h y it had happened, but I felt

  initial relief for those people.

  T h e next thing I can recall is a m e s s a g e either on the system or radio, saying 'All

 Officers onto the p i t c h 1 , This is the first                 radio m e s s a g e I had received or heard

  transmitted for nearly one hour,               I took a Serial, under the supervision of Police

  Sergeant Whitlam, around under the command b o x into South Stand and down onto the track

  at Leppings Lane.

  I have no recollection of what I first did.

  At some point v e r y shortly afterwards, I went to the centre of Leppings Lane and behind

  the goal.            I saw the extent of the disorder.

  Superintendent Greenwood was in the centre, there was only one gate.                          There was not

  physic a l l y r o o m to do anything there.

  I m o v e d to m y left.         I saw only four ways out for the trapped and injured, to the front,

  to the back, left, right, even perhaps up.                   I decided to go to the left.           Th e r e were

  no senior Officers there, so I took responsibility for that area.

  I climbed on the fence and ple a d e d w i t h the fans to move to ray left.                   I used m y arms.

  It wor k e d in parts.           There w e r e some Offi c er s and decent people now,       getting people out

  over the spiked railings.

  I was joined by Inspector Darling.                I remember trying to get a Serial into the pen on

  the left to keep the crowd back, so that we could evacuate the injured.                            T h e y did this.

  I shouted at Offi c e rs on the pitch, they seemed to be stood there mesmorised, they did

  not seem to comprehend the enormity of the situation.

  People started to come out this way.

  I could not continue w h e r e I was and I got onto the track again.

  I carried a small person from the gate on m y own.                     Others w a n t e d to h e l p but I insisted

  I did it.            I carried her or him onto the pitch.

 Some o n e took over then.        I went back and got another person or I had dealt w i t h another

 person.

 At the track I could only see problems, spiked railings, fans boxed in.                     No w a y out and

 still hostile youths wanting to invade the pitch and fight.

 I w a l k e d along at same point and someone said, 'That one's dead, try a n o t h e r . 1

 I saw a blue bar (crash barrier) being hurled over the fence, I thought by the fans,

 at the Police.

 I remember d e a li n g { w i t h a lad.    I don't k n o w if this is the one I carried or after,

 hie h a d a white shirt on.        He was alive.        His breathing was short and rushed.

 I put h i m in the reco v er y position,         I kept his airway open.     I kept talking to him.

 I had to clear his        m o u t h out, it was full of wh i t e froth.   I was joined b y someone.

 O nce I thought his       breathing was increasing we placed h i m on            a board.

 I went back to the gate.           I h a d instructed a P.C. to go w i t h each person.

 I spent sometime then I think w i t h a man w i t h a grey beard.           I had seen h i m before but

 thought h i m dead, then they had attempted to start his heart again.               I performed heart

 massage,     A Doctor     or Surgeon did m o u t h to mouth.      His lungs started to fill up then.

 I thought we had a chance,           We kept going for a number of minutes.        Someone wa n t e d to

 take over but I refused.

 I think I carried h i m into an ambulance or I carried one pe rs o n into an ambulance.

 Someone said he was dead.           Police Constable 851 Wi c k e n was present.

 I can recall an Offi c e r saying, 'They're picking up money', referring to Liverpool fans

 on the pitch, but I said, ‘Leave them.'

 I think everyone was out now.              I tried to re-group people.     Chief Superintendent Nesbitt

 was there in the middle.

 T h e r e was some trouble then in the c r o w d , in Leppings Lane.        At this point they wanted
 to fight.

 I took three Serials and told them to w a l k to Halifax Road.

 I saw a Doctor at the rear of the N o r t h Stand and I'm sure it was P olice Constable 2508

 Following that tour of the ground, I spent some time in the company of Superintendent

 Greenwood, concerning the welfare of the Officers involved.

 I went off duty at 7.30pm.

 Since the events of that day, I have given great thought to actions I took and I have

 io s a y without the benefit of hindsight that I w o u l d have arrived at the same conclusions,

 w h i c h w e r e m a d e w i t h o n l y one objection in mind, that being the IIMMEDIATE preservation
 of h u m a n life.

             Further to my previous paper:

             I have since been requested to elaborate on the circumstances concerning

             the recovery of the child from the pressing crowd outside the Leppings Lane

             turnstiles .

             In respect of that matter and to the best of my knowledge,   I can say that

             although 1 feared the child was initially dead, I have established that to

             the contrary he was alive and was passed to safety on the river side of the

             barrier to other persons.

checking at        r e g ul ar intervals.

Soffn a ^ l w ; that the       crowdswere           there.         AH       the large      perimeter gates

I kne w they hadn't           tickets.         I had that are a swept by tha horses                             to

get them back out           to the       road-

I knelt down on the side bar of the                          tunnel and s aw all             the P C s         on

the gate,      they were s t ru gg li ng but                 coping.    I checked them.                  I saw

P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e 9 6 3 Evans,    h e >w a s     red in the face,           he seemed to be

so busy.        I shouted,        'Are you alright?'                He said         'Yeah*.       I was

c on ce rn ed for them,        they were g e t ti ng            hassle.         The others s ee m e d to

be just     pressed a g a i n s t the wall.                 It was heaving           in the tunnel             to

the turnstiles.

I think then         I saw Chief          Inspector Creaser.                , I m e n t i o n e d the    problem

for the     lads.       I had r emembered what Mr.                  D u c k e n f i e l d had sai d about

did but kept checking.

The horses w ere a s s i s t i n g         us then.           I d ir e c t e d them to as si st           the

turnstiles.         It was most          difficult,          there was this            long tunnel         bar,

it m ade     it d i ff ic ul t.     T h e y had to           start at the back.             They        t ri ed to •

get them into queues,              but     it was a          problem.

I just     can't    rem ember what           h ap pe ne d next.

The next thing w as           I l o o k e d over acja-in,          I think.          I s tood at the

I kno w I stood             on the        rail.      I told the        remaining         officers         to get out.

They     c o u l d n ’t go up the tunnel,                   P ol i c e C o n s ta bl e   D u f f y had    t ried but

had been f o r c e d         back.

 I     think there was              just Police C o n s t a b l e Evans and the                 ’E l ’ PC.           I

s ig na ll ed to him and he went,                       I think       t h ro ug h the turnstile.

 I    had been s ho uting                to them,      the     public,      ’Get          back,     get b a c k ’ .

Just Police C o n s t a b l e             Evans was          left,     he couldn't get off the                  wall,

he was stuck.               P eo p l e    were just          pressing and        pushing.

It seemed then that                 if a person was                going      down,   they wer e sure to

die.      That        child    I thought         t h e n 1 had been s q u a s h e d or S u f f o c a t e d        in the

I saw,      either         before     or after,            S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall    on the wall

I returned to the barrier on the side of the turnstile.

I think then            I o r g a n i s e d the h or s e s         to block Off the gates at the

perimeter.             It seemed that we               could deal w it h the numbers in there                                 if

we   contained the            people outside.                 W h e n that was secure by all                         the

horses,       now five        perhaps,           and u n i f o r m P C ’s,          I caused the gate, to be

It was,       I a m sure or           I hope,        the o n l y w ay to save                life    in there at

that time.

A throng m o v e d          in,    I was       pushed to the              left.       Then    I orde re d the gate

I looked,        or some on e         did,       to see      if it was, clear outside.                         Not    for

fear,    but     so no others            could come           in.         It was and         I went      out.

I was      s om ewhere      down the side near the                  river      now.

Then,     s o metime after           that,      the gate       I was facing opentd and                    it just

emptied.          That was        the gate on the             left w h e n a p p r o ac hi ng       the

Robert M. Purdy, Inspector, South Yorkshire Police, Headquarters.


I attended at the ground at 9.20am - 9.30am, booked in and received a radio.        I was
under the supervision of Chief Inspector Greaser and Superintendent Greenwood.

At the briefing, I saw all four Serials and Inspector Sykes, they were all present.

One change in 'E' Division, Police Constable Duffy.

I saw Sergeant Papie brief his men.     He did it well, very professional.

It was agreed all would meet at the rear of West Stand, when Inspector Sykes would brief

the Serials.     He had worked that location in the past and it seemed totally applicable

he should complete it.

I was aware after that about safety of the Officers under my canmand.        I saw Sergeant

Payne and told him to ensure they were in pairs for the turnstile and to keep someone

with him.

Detective Constable Cerrone was with me.

I saw Sergeant Whitlam.     He had his Serial well organised, he was familiar with his

area of responsibility.
Sergeant Proctor was on the road with Inspector Sykes, who was in overall command of

the road area.     As such, I decided to supervise all other Serials on the turnstiles.

I had ascertained there were problems of relief, Serial 16 relieved Serial 13, so I

thought it pertinent to establish their full duties.     I saw Inspector Bullas in the

company of Sergeant Payne.     We all discussed strategy for Phase 2.

It was a concern of mine that we had full cover on half time in that West Stand.        This

was agreed by Inspector Bullas.
At Leppings Lane I formed a liaison with the horsemen, they were clearing the non-ticket

holders.     There seemed to be hundreds, young and old mixed, some drunk.

The C.I.D. were there, outside the gates in the 'pull-in', everyone seemed to gather

there.     We urged people to go into the ground, they seemed reluctant and abusive.        You

kept seeing the same faces again and again, some with cans of beer, some with plastic

bottles.

Hie corner shop was a concern, I thought it was a target for a robbery.

I kept going round all my men.     I also kept seeing the Sergeants and liaising with the
                                           -    2   -




C.I.D.
The fans were very mixed.     I talked with a London woman and her friend, they were the

Liverpool Club London Section.     They had chips and shared them, I joked about my diet.

They were nice, but others were just animals.              They looked at you, the ground, then

off, then back, then off.
I don't know what time it was but we knew that the trains had arrived just after 2.00pm.

The C.I.D. were outside the shop.      There were ticket touts I think there.           Someone said

the horses would clear the pavements as theyarrived.              I warned the C.I.D.

They arrived but it     didn't seem as hectic as I thought.           I thought tjiat was later, some

came then went I'm sure.     The turnstiles seemed to fill.           I seemed to do nothing then

but direct people and inspect tickets.

You could smell the beer in the atmosphere.
At some stage I went to turnstile      A.G., that's when it seemed worst.I don't know why.

I think the Sergeant was there, I      had kept checking at regular intervals.

Soon after that the crowds were there.         All the large perimeter gates were open, the

funnel was filling, there were others on the river side.              I knew they hadn't tickets.

I had that area swept by thehorses to get them back out to the road.
I knelt down on the side bar of the funnel and saw all the P.C.'s on the gate, they

were struggling butcoping.     I checked them.            I saw Police Constable 963 Evans, he was

red in the face, he     seemed to be so busy.           I shouted, 'Are you alright?'   He said, 'Yeah.'

I was concerned for them, they were getting hassle.              The others seemed to be just pressed

against the wall.     It was heaving   in the funnel to the turnstiles.

I think then I saw Chief Inspector Creaser.              I mentioned the problem for the lads.

I had remembered what Mr Duckenfield had said about safety, 'IT'S PARAMOUNT!'

It was decided to leave them in then.      I did but kept checking.
The horses were assisting us then.     I directed them to assist the turnstiles.             It was

most difficult,     there was this long funnel bar, it made it difficult.          They had to start

at the back.   They tried to get them into queues, but it was a problem.

I just can't remember what happened next.
The next thing was I looked over again, I think.              I stood at the corner of the wall



                                                *
                                          -   3   -




on the bar.    I know no-one knew how it was because you can't tell unless you are above

it.
I climbed up there next, I thought it was the only way.          I didn't feel stable in that

position but it was the only vantage point I could see to use, near that sector.

Detective Constable Cerrone was still there, he helped me up.          I saw the two horses.

There was the 'E' Division P.C. from Hackenthorpe at the far side, Police Constable

Evans in the middle and Police Constable Duffy nearest.

I saw the horses go towards the gate.     Police Constable Duffy stumbled.       I thought if

he goes down we've had it, then he popped up.          I think, as I look back, I had no personal

fear of injury there, but was fearful for those Officers in there.          It was them first

I know, not the public, then.
I think I saw Inspector Sykes again, maybe Chief Inspector Creaser, I'm not sure, but

we agreed to pull them out.     It was policy I gathered.
I've still no real perception of time, 2.20 - 2.30, I just don't know.           I know I stood

on the rail.    I told the remaining Officers to get out.        They couldn't go up the funnel,

Police Constable Duffy had tried but had been forced back.
I think there was just Police Constable Evans and the 'El' P.C.           I signalled to him

and he went, I think through the turnstile.

I had been shouting to them, the public, 'Get back, get back.'
Just Police Constable Evans was left, he couldn't get off the wall, he was stuck.             People

were just pressing and pushing.

I'm honestly not sure now of the order.
I could see people being squashed up at the turnstile walls, the horses had moved back.

I think Police Constable Evans was still there, I shouted at him.          He just couldn't

move.   The element in there, I knew if he went down he was dead.          It just smelled like

the tap room of a pub.    People were throwing things at the horses, beer cans and such.

At some point I saw Detective Superintendent McKay.          He was behind me near the river

barrier.   I looked at him, he looked at me.          I don't think he could see what I could

see, due to my vantage point.
Then, or just after, or even before, I just don't know, Police Constable Evans got through
                                             -   4   -




the turnstile.

People were screaming, 'Do something, we're going to die.             Do something.'     It was turmoil.

They were crushed up against the wall, the turnstile, the far wall, the barrier.                I saw
people in pain, suffering.

The next thing I may have got down.     I saw Detective Superintendent McKay.            He looked

at me and said, 'They'll have to open the gates or something will happen.'

I think I just got back on the rail, but this may be out of sequence.

There was a child passed from well in the middle of the crowd to me on the rail.                He
was limp.    I thought he was dead.   He was limp in my hands.

IVfy fear had changed now to the public.     Children, I saw others, and girls.           I think a

T.V. camera was there or had been, a man with curly hair, sports coat, about 35 - 45,
perhaps ITV, BBC.

There was another child being either crushed or passed out.             We tried to get him.     I

think Detective Constable Cerrone tried but this man was pulling him back, saying, 'He's
going in.'

The pressure was so great then people were crying, screaming.             They could not move.
They were pressed up around the bar, the wall, stiles.

It seemed then that if a person was going down, they were sure to die.               That child I

thought then had been squashed or suffocated in the crush.             I got down.

I saw, either before or after, Superintendent Marhsall on the wall outside theperimeter

gate.   He had taken a vantage point.      It was the only way to supervise.           If not you would
have no overall perception.

I went to him, signalled him.   All the side was full now.            I started off.    I shouted

Detective Constable Cerrone.    I think if I had any personal fear of injury this was the
only time.

The people now were just like animals there, I was pushed, jostled, punched.               Detective

Constable Cerrone followed me, I never lost sight of him, that was my policy.

When I got there, I think I had re-swept the side with horses, and the side gates were

shut.   I remember a big fat youth in my way.            I shouted at him to move, I was probably
rude.
I saw Superintendent Marshall, he looked perplexed.       I do not know him well but I can

empathise - I probably looked worse.
I said, ‘We're going to have     to do something, someone is going todie.'    'They'lldie

at the turnstiles' he spoke,     I cantremember what he said.

We mentioned the gates.    He stopped, obviously assessing the situation.     He said, 'Open

the gates.'    I supplied him with my thoughts.     I hope I am right that Superintendent

McKay had those same reservations.     The situation was life or death for the public trapped

in there.
I returned to the barrier on the side of the turnstile.

I think then I organised the horses to block off the gates at the perimeter.        It seemed

that we could deal with the numbers in there if we contained the people outside.

When that was secure by all the horses, now five perhaps, and uniform P.C.'s, I caused

the gate to be opened down the side.       I think Detective Constable Cerrone was there and

Police Constable Evans.
It was, I am sure or I hope, the only way to save life in there at that time.
A throng moved in, I was pushed to the left.       Then I ordered the gate closed, although

they may have already been closed.
I looked, or someone did, to     see if it was clear outside.     Not forfear, but so no others

could come in.    It was and I went out.     The horses were there.
It had alleviated the situation, but people were still trapped on that side bar.          I pulled

them under.    Those with tickets were filed through by horses to the open gates.        It was
orderly.    There appeared to be room now.     I then thought it was no longer life threatening

and the gates were shut again.
To me it was two bursts, the first larger, the second short but a steady flow and

controlled.
I saw the Superintendent on the wall again, I think.       The people in the funnel had pulled

back and it appeared safe.     I think I indicated to the Superintendent by putting my arms

up in the air.
He signalled for the centre gate perimeter to be opened.        The horsemen did this.

It then filled again.     I'm sure it got back to the same proportion yet again.

I was somewhere down the side near the river now.

Then, sometime after that, the gate I was facing opened and it just emptied.             That was

the gate on the left when approaching the turnstiles.            I think Inspector Bennett was

sat above it.
It seemed to empty then.    I had not ordered that or knew why it had happened, but I felt

initial relief for those people.

The next thing I can recall is a message either on the system or radio, saying 'All

Officers onto the pitch'.   This is the first          radio message I had received or heard

transmitted for nearly one hour.     I took a Serial, under the supervision of Police

Sergeant Whitiara, around under the command box into South Stand and down onto the track

at Leppings Lane.

I have no recollection of what I first did.

At some point very shortly afterwards, I went to the centre of Leppings Lane and behind

the goal.   I saw the extent of the disorder.

Superintendent Greenwood was in the centre, there was only one gate.            There was not

physically room to do anything there.

I moved to my left.   I saw only four ways out for the trapped and injured, to the front,

to the back, left, right, even perhaps up.            I decided to go to the left.    There were

no senior Officers there,, so I took responsibility for that area.

I climbed on the fence and pleaded with the fans to move to my left.            I used my arms.

It worked in parts.   There were seme Officers and decent people now,          getting people out

over the spiked railings.
I was joined by Inspector Darling.     I remember trying to get a Serial into the pen on

the left to keep the crowd back, so that we could evacuate the injured.              They did this.

I shouted at Officers on the pitch, they seemed to be stood there mesmorised, they did

not seem to comprehend the enormity of the situation.

People started to come out this way.

I could not continue where I was and I got onto the track again.

I carried a small person from the gate on my own.            Others wanted to help but I insisted

I did it.   I carried her or him onto the pitch.




                                                                ■'                            '
Someone took over then.     I went back and got another person or I had dealt with another

person.
At the track I could only see problems, spiked railings, fans boxed in.        No way out and

still hostile youths wanting to invade the pitch and fight.

I walked along at some point and someone said, 'That one's dead, try another.'

I saw a blue bar (crash barrier) being hurled over the fence, I thought by the fans,

at the Police.
I remember dealing with a lad.     I don't know if this is the one I carried or after.

He had a white shirt on.     He was alive.   His breathing was short and    rushed.

I put him in the recovery position.     I kept his airway open.       I kept talking to him.
I had to clear his mouth out, it was full of white froth.       I was joined by someone.

Once I thought his breathing was increasing we placed him on a board.

I went back to the gate.     I had instructed a P.C. to go with each person.

I spent sometime then I think with a man with a grey beard.         I had seen him before but

thought him dead, then they had attempted to start his heart          again. I performed heart

massage.    A Doctor or Surgeon did mouth to mouth.    His lungs     started to fill up then.

I thought we had a chance.     We kept going for a number of minutes.      Someone wanted to

take over but I refused.
I think I carried him into an ambulance or I carried one person into an ambulance.

Someone said he was dead.     Police Constable 851 Wicken was present.

I can recall an Officer saying, 'They're picking up money', referring to Liverpool fans

on the pitch, but I said, 'Leave them.'
I think everyone was out now.     I tried to re-group people.      Chief Superintendent Nesbitt

was there in the middle.
There was some trouble then in the crowd, in Leppings Lane.        At this point they wanted

to fight.

I took three Serials and told them to walk to Halifax Road.
I saw a Doctor at the rear of the North Stand and I'm sure it was Police Constable 2508

who had broken down.    The Doctor said he must be seen, not left unattended.         I saw

Detective Inspector Webster, he said he would see to him.
Following that tour of the ground, I spent sane time in the company of Superintendent

Greenwood, concerning the welfare of the Officers involved.

I went off duty at 7.30pm.

Since the events of that day, I have given great thought to actions I took and I have

to say without the benefit of hindsight that I would have arrived at the sane conclusions*

which were made with only one objection in mind, that being the IMVEDIATE preservation
of hunan life.

Robert M. Purdy, Inspector, South Yorkshire Police.



Further to my previous paper:

I have since been requested to elaborate on the circumstances concerning

the recovery of the child from the pressing crowd outside the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.

In respect of that matter and to the best of my knowledge, I can say that

although I feared the child was initially dead, I have established that to

the contrary he was alive and was passed to safety on the river side of the

barrier to other persons.                   ^

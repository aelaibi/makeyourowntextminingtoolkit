               Our      duties          involved                  ensuring       that        Liverpool             mini       coaches        were      parked

About          £ . 5 0 pm      (1450)             my    serial        was    due       for     refreshment                 at    C l a y w h e e 1s

Lane       and       we       made          our    way       there,,        At    this       time         I noticed             large

quantities                of       empty          cans       littering           the    sidewalks                 and    gardens.             There

were       s t i 11       n um e ro u 5           s u p po rters       en    ro u t e     to       th e      g ro und      none     o f w h ich

could          have       possibly                got    into       the     ground        before             the     kick       off,,    I thought

this       rather             unusual             having          worked     semi       finals            before.

As    a    result             of    a       conversation             with        control           we     were       instructed              not       to

proceed           for         meal          but    to    go       immediately           to     Leppings              Lane       because           of     an

We    arrived             at       Leppings             Lane       altogether           as     a    serial           and    joined           up    with

other          serials             awaiting             in s t r u c t i o n s .At      a p p r o x i m a t e ly 3 . 1 0 p rn ( 1 5 1 D ) I

entered           the         tunnel          under          the    West     Stand,          there           was     total       confusion

near       the       entrance                I saw       numerous           people       being            given         mouth     to     mouth           and

cardiac           resuscitation                        some       people     were       shouting               and      swearing         some

crying          and       some          just       stood          staring.

I    ran       into       the       tunnel             and    immediately              realised              the     enormity           of    the

disaster .                I saw             people       trying        to    get       out     c 1 i in>r!uig'~ o v e r b o d 1 e s ,

saw       the     body         of       a    very       small       boy     about/half              way        down      the     tunnel           h is

face       was       blue

He    must        have         been          very       small       ip/stature           because               1 picked          him     up       with

one       hand.,          I gave             him       mo utfoXto      mouth       whilst           he       was     in m y      arms        but

towards           t he        entrance             and       most     people       moved           out       of    the     way    when        they

just       outside             the          entrance,             I placed        the     boy       in       the     ambulance           and       began

cardiac           massage,                  the    ambulance           driver          gave        assistance              with     what

                      screaming               and    shouting             for       us    to    do    something.                    I noticed            large

                      quantities               of    shoes       strewn             all     about        and        also       loose        coins,           1    thought

                      this       very         strange.           1    then          realised          that          some       of    the        coins        were       being

                      thrown          from      above.           I now             became       frightened                for       my    own      life,          1 -fell

                      over       on     several           occasions                and    thought          that       I may          become            trapped,.          1

                      made       my     way     to    a    hole       in       the       fencing         immediately                 behind            the       goalmouth.

                      At       this     point        somebody             kicked          me    in    the       &ack       and       I just            wanted       to    get

couldn't                   believe          what          I was        experiencing                     especially                           with            thousands                   of

people                present,              I then             noticed          a    small          boy        in         the               pile         of          bodies,             he

               I have           today          v i e w ed    a Photographic           print          ( R e f P R 6 / 1A ) (E x h      ) which

               is     a    distant             scene        of   police      and   supporters              carrying        casualties       over

            *The    photograph             is       very    distant           and    I    can    not    be    certain       but    I am

             almost       certain          that       the    Police           officer       is    me    and    that       the   person        being

             carried       would          therefore          be        Thomas       Anthony       HOWARD.

                                                                   /•/

             I    recall    carrying                the    boy/along           the* s i d e      of    the    pitch       and   also    holding

             the    boy    in       the    manner          shown        on    the    photograph,             I was    holding         h im    in m y

             arms    and    the       supporters             had X i C         legs.




             I had    previously                mentioned              only    two       supporters          being    with      me,    because

             thats    all       I    recall,          however           there       could       well    have    been       four.       1 do       not

             recognise          any       of    the       supporters           shown       on    the    photograph          because          it   is

             distant       and       1 doubt          if    I would           recognise          them    anyway.

                                                                                                                      G    BUTLER      SIGNED

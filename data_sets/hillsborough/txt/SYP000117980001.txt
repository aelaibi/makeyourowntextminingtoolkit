              I N C 1DENT HILLS6OROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND

              15 APRIL 1989



              At 9.00 a.m,          on Saturday,    13 April   1989,   I paraded for duty at

              Eccl-es field Police Station, and was subsequently conveyed to

              Hillsborough football             ground for briefing re the Semi-Final.         I

              arrived at the ground together with other officers at approximately

              9,40 a.m.        At this time tliere appeared to be very 1i tt 1e ac ti v i ty

              around the ground apart from that of P o 1ice O f f i c e r s .

              Briefing for the event subsequently took place in the North Stand at

              approximately 10.00 a.m.

              My duties that day were plain clothes foot patrol                 in Middlewood Road,

              together with Temporary Detective Constable O ’Brien,                paying

              particular attention to teams of pick pockets and theft of and from

              motor vehicles.          My supervisory officer being Inspector Scaife.

              At the conclusion of the briefing TDC O ’Brien and myself made our way

              along Penistone Road and into Parkside Road, this would have been

              about   11.00 a.nv.

              I saw that within the last hour there had certainly been an increase

              in pedestrian activity ui;|th large groups of youths wandering around
                                                                                   . PAGE

    aimlessly with a few shouting the usual football                chants.    We both

    made our way along Middlewood Road in the direction of the hospital «

    When nearing the Texaco petrol station we decided to* walk back in the

    ct-ppa’si.te di rection towards Hil lsbiprougf-n shopping centre,                   ?

    At about 1S mitfday as we approiched the junction' of MiddlewoodkRoad

    and .Wadsley Lane , our attention was caught by Pol ice Sergeant                1948

    Miller who was on mtibile Transit             patrol.    He «tated that one of the

    pubs situated further up W&dsley Lar*e was full to capacity and that

    there was a large number of people outside on the frontage and road

    drinking beer.       He appeared concerned that they ittay get Out of hand.

    Also situated at this junction are a number of shops where a large

    number of Liverpool        supporters had gathered for what          can only be

    described as a drinking session.               There were numerous    cans of beer

    and lager being and had been consumed.                  I continued to walk along

    Mi ddl ewood Road and .into the shopping           centre.    Whilst walking along

    this road I again saw         large groups of youths drinking from cans of

    beer and lager.          Those that I did not see drinking I could hear pass

    comments as to "Where        is the nearest       public house?1'

    Once TDC O'Brien and myself had patrolled the precinct, we decided to

    visit Parkside Section House        via       the park grounds.     At about

    •1.00 p.m. - 1.-15       p.m.whilst walking along Parkside Road,            I was

    approached every         five yards by    a   Liverpool    supporter asking for a

    ticket.   On eventually reaching Parkside Section House,                  I saw a

    large number of youths standing behind the Section House and around

    vehicles in the parking bay situated adjacent to the Section House,

    the majority of whom were drunk and w e r e subsequently removed.                   Again

    by the accent    I believe these to be Liverpoo 1 sup po rt ®r s.

    I recall that whilst        inside the box/Section House          I heard footsteps

    on the roof.     On inspecting this I saw about four youths to be

    standing on top of the Police Station Station drinking cans of beer/ *

spoken to and advis#d'-. a cc o rd in gl y.

TDC 0 *Brien and myself thought it best, to inform ground control of

the situation at the Section House,                                                       so that further attention could

be paid to i                          t           '

We were some fifteen minutes at the box before                                                                  resuming patrol                           in

Middlewood Road.

At 2.15 p.m. TDC O ' B ri en and myself                                                   returned to the.Police area at

the rear of the North Stand via the Penistone Road entrance.                                                                                              Whilst

en route we were                           again approached by dozens of Liverpool fans looking

for tickets.                        On     arriving at the gym                                I mealed.

At       about          2.43 p.m.               I resumed patrol together with TDC O'Brien and

together with Police Constables Hiles and Moulding we made our way

along Penistone Road into Mere Road and into Leppings Lane. This was

the first and only time during the day that                                                             I visited this side of

the ground and to be honest,                                                I was taken back by the sight.                                           The

crowd               appeared to be solid f rom the turnstiles .1— 16, to near the

   as a result of such a crowd forming.

   W© continued to.'walk past Leppings Lane and through the car park

   si tuated in Mi 1 lsborbugh Park r ’iritending to go back into the precinct

   in Middlewootl f?oady

   I t ;Was whilst talking           in the park that I decided to listen in on the

   channel used by ground control whilst Police Constable Moulding

   monitored the C.I.D.            thannel.    I retail hearing at about 3i00 p.m. the

   request for an ambulance,              the reports of somebody seriously injured.

   Throughout the following five minutes or so there seemed to be chaos

   and confusion.          The transmissions were            clear,    but everybody seemed to

   be requesting a m b u U n c e s at the same time.              I recall     seeing two or

   three travelling along Penistone Road.                     To be honest, at this time I

   thought somebody was over reaching until                    I heard a voice on the radio

   who I recognised to be Chief Inspector Sumner who stated that there

   were a number of bodies and something about a temporary mortuary.                           On

   hearing this all four of us immediately returned to the gymnasium.

   On my arrival my stomach churned as I saw them bringing                        in the first

   of the bodies on advertising boards, One after the other for some few

   minutes    I was       in shock.       I just stood there saying nothing,           doing

   nothing.    I recall seeing six Liverpool                 supporters carrying a dead

   body into the gym,             three of which were        crying.    As they got to the

   door the body just dropped off the board.                     It was on seeing this that

   I tried to pull myself together.                      I donot know where TDC O'Brien had

   got to or the other officers.

   I grabbed hold of a board and ran                     onto the pitch with   the

   supporters.        again,      I was   in disbelief.       I saw people still     being

   pulled "'out, of the West Stand some unconscious,                   but the majority

  ■appeared dead.         I just did not know what to do.               1 saw people    injured,

  people dead frtd people             in grief.         I at first tried to see to all

   three at once.          I recall most if not all of the injured were be^ng

         seen to by ambulance               crew, Police Officers and St. John's.           I

         resigned myself to removing those who were obviously dead from the

         pitch* 1 recall there were Forest fans still                  chanting obscenities as

        ■bodies'were''being .carried in front of the Spion Kop.                     Thi s. was soon

         to stop.

         1 carried some three or four bodies from the pitch.                       I recall

         thinking I was fortunate to be in plain clothes,                  seeing the abuse and

         bad feelings being directed towards the uniform lads.                       In most        cases

         understandable as a grieving heart sees no barriers.                       Each journey to

         the gym the amount of bodies increased two fold.                     I   recall when I

         brought in my last body,               just standing and looking,        thinking that this

         should not have happened.                  I was upset,   confused and did not know what

         to do next.       At this time I saw that I was not by myself.

         I eventually directed my attention to assisting the uniform Police

         Officers with the searching and identification of the bodies.                          I

         assisted some three or four officers                 in this task.       I cannot say that

         I       can give any descriptions of these bodies.             I merely assisted the

         uniformed officers who completed the reports.

         I was subsequently conveyed to HamnVerton Road Police Station where,

         together with other officers,                 I took missing person reports from

         relatives and friends.               It was only at this stage that I. recalled any

         descriptions of the bodies                 I had handled.   This was disturbing

         knowing that the person they were                 looking for was in fact dead,            but

         still having to complete the report.

         At 1.00 a.m.      that morning,...the temporary enquiry room wa§ closed.                     I

         was subsequently conveyed to Ecclesfield Police Station where                          I

         signed off duty.

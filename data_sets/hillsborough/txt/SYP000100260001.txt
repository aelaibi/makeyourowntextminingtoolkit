PAUL CARL WADSWORTH




Police Constable 2933




At     8.45      a.m.       on    Saturday          15th April      1989 I arrived at Ecclesr'ield Police

Station         and        from there I was conveyed by public service vehicl?                              in company

with       a    large       number      of     uniform      and     CID officers        to Hillsborough         Football

Ground.              Once at the ground I joined Police Sergeant 468 Whitl-.Ti on Serial

No.    17 and proceeded with other members of our serial to the Ncrth Stand to

await          the    briefing.              Once    briefing      was    over    and   after    something       to    eat,

myself and other members of the serial I was on paired ourselves off (I was

with Police Constable                    16 Wilson)           and stood in the area between the rear of

the    West          Stand       and    the    turnstiles          at    Leppings     Lane.      Officers       from    our

serial         paid particular attention                      to the      number of Liverpool         fans that were

arriving at the Leppings                        Lane    turnstiles.            At that time there vere none at

all.

At    11.30a.m.            myself       in    company       with    Police Constable           Wilson,   stood at        the

turnstile             at    Leppings         Lane     nearest      and    adjacent      to a large       blue   coloured

expandable             metal      gate        known    I    believe       as   Gate     'A'.     Myself     and   Police

Constable            Wilson       had    been       stood     at   this    location     for some      time before        the

first Liverpool supporters actually approached the turnstile that we were on

duty at.             Searches of people were made before allowing them to pess through.

We also         checked          tickets       to be    sure       that firstly, people had these in their

possession            and     to make         sure     that    people     were entering         the   correct     part    of

the ground.                Sergeant Whitlam had informed us (after the main briefing) that

people wishing to enter the ground by the turnstile at Leppings Lane should

be    in       possession         of brown          coloured       tickets.       I remember      one or two people

that       approached our               turnstile       at about         1.10 p.m.      had red coloured and blue

coloured tickets.                  These were          told that         they couldn't         get into this part         of
PAUL CARL WADSWORTH



the    ground          and were         given instructions                as to what         part   of the ground they

should go to.                I remember that people who arrived at about between 12.45p.m.

and    up    to 2.10 p.m.               were    of an older age group.                  People       that arrived early

were     aged       about         35   years      up    to    I would        guess     about       55     years,      with     some

accompanying smaller younger children.                                   The atmosphere at this time was very

good     there         was    a     cheerful         banter     between      some      of    these        (if not       the vast

majority)         supporters            and myself.           These people who were                 entering the ground

in     the       very        early      part      were       very       co-operative         and     didn't         mind     being

searched,         none of them smelled of alcohol or any other intoxicants and none

that    I    searched          or      when    I looked         in carrier bags             etc.     had any alcohol             or

tins of anything, nothing at all that was prohibited.

At about         1.45 p.m.          some youths aged about 16 to 19 years were stood near to

the turnstiles and made no move whatsoever with regard to actually entering

the    ground.          They        were      approached        by       a Police      Officer      (I        c anâ€™t    remember

exactly       who)      and were           questioned         as to if they had any tickets.                            From the

answer       they       gave      the      officer       they    were informed          that       they       couldn't       stand

about       or    enter       the      ground        without        a    ticket.       They     took       this     advice      and

walked away.            At some stage whilst Police Constable 16 Wilson was searching a

youth,       it was         found by          the officer        that he (the youth)                had       cannabis in his

possession.             This person was arrested and taken to the Police Room.

With regard to what time this happened exactly I have no clear recollection.

Whilst Police Constable Wilson was dealing with his prisoner, I continued on

my own.          What        I thought strange was                  the fact that at just turned 1.50 p.m.

the    number          of     fans      was     no     more     than      just     a   trickle.           I   was      under    the

impression          that      perhaps         more     Liverpool          fans   had    entered         the ground           than I

thought.          A small number of Liverpool fans, sone 5 to 6 in number were stood

near    to       the    Leppings           Lane      entrance           (still   in    the    roadway          near     to     shops

situated adjacent to Leppings Lane entrance) they had cans of beer and lager
                                                                -    3 -

in     their    hands.          They    were     informed             by Police Officers                that       they could not

drink     it        in    the     ground       and    were           advised        to    put     it    in     bins       which       were

situated at the turnstiles.                          This they did.

By now,        2.15 p.m. more people were beginning to gather in the Leppings Lane

end    but     the majority             of these       were           not    passing       through the             turnstiles but

were     just        stood       about.        These       persons           were       again    advised           by    officers       to

enter the ground.

The next thing I can remember is the number of people suddenly spelling to a

vast    amount,           what    appeared       to me              to be thousands.              I noticed             that    the age

group     of    these        people       was    much       younger              (the    vast    majority           that       is)    than

those which had entered the ground much earlier.                                               I could smell intoxicants

and alcohol on the breath of these people.                                          I couldn't believe that so many

had come        in such a short if not what appeared to be a fraction of time.                                                           I

carried        on    searching          some     people             and    checked       tickets.            Even       now,    at 2.30

p.m.    people           were    still     coming          to       Leppings       Lane    with        the    wrong       ticket       and

again    they        were       informed        as    to    where           to    go.      I    told    people           to    form    two

orderly lines in order to ease the entry through the turnstiles but this was

ignored.        The surge or people was such that I was pushed up against the wall

next    to the           turnstiles.           I pushed my way back and managed to stand with my

back    to     the       turnstile       itself.           This        was       to make       people    form       two lines.           A

surge    of     bodies           from    somewhere          either           at    the     back    of        the    crowd       or    from

somewhere       in the middle pushed people towards                                      the turnstile where I was and

I was pressed against the centre wooden column of the doors which form part

of the       turnstile.            I found it almost                       impossible      to move with the weight of

so many        bodies       pinned        against me.                I managed          to squeeze back             away       from the

turnstile and stood against the wall which was adjacent to gate                                                          'A'. I could

see by now a number of fans had climbed onto a grey coloured metal barrier

wall    which was           to my       left.        I was completely surrounded and hemmed against

the wall.           I remember one fan asking me.                      "What's the time m a t e " - .1 replied

"Quarter to three."                   He said "There's going to be a bloody riot if you don't

open them blue doors and let us in."                            I informed him that I did not have any

authority to open the gates at all and if                                  they queued orderly they would get

in.    Another          Liverpool         supporter      said    tome       "Your    inspector            n,_st like    you

putting       you       with     us    lot   here."       This         group       kept on    surging      and     pushing

forward       causing          people who         were    in    the     crowd       to    momentarily       lose      their

balance.          Two    Liverpool         fans    both male,           aged about 25          to    30 years,        began

fighting as to who was                     at the turnstile first.                  Due to    the number of bodies

in the way I tried to reach them and when this failed shouted them to stop.

The smell of intoxicants was even more evident as fans who were stood right

next    to    me        began shouting        something        like     "Weâ€™re       gonna    win    the    league."      A

woman    aged           about 40      years       squeezed      past       me    and said    as     she   looked      at me

"They    treat          us as though we're            animals."                 I made nocomment.         When I looked

to my     right         I could        see   that    a number         of    fans    had      climbed      or.to the    wall

which    is       situated at          the   bottom of the gardens of the houses on Vere Road.

They were          trying to get past Gate                 'A' which was still                locked via the wall.

A man approached me                   from my right with a young boy aged about 8 - 1 0                                years

and asked if I could get him in without being pushed and crushed against the

wall.        He    asked me if I had a radio                    and couldn't do anything.                     I informed

him that          I did not have a radio but I would try and get him into the ground

as    best    I         could.        I   turned     round with        my       back against        the    crowd    and   by

pushing my              hands against         the wall ,pushed             the crowd back           only a very short

distance,         enough so the man and youth could bend down and walk under my arms

and into          the    ground through the              turnstiles.             The crowd kept on pushing and

shoving without doubt, some people were drunk as their-eyes appeared glazed.

As I stood there at the turnstile a man tried to enter the ground with a can

of lemonade.              I told him that cans                 were    not       allowed and        took it      from him,

placing it on the floor.                     The crowd kept on pushing and shoving.             I   could see

Police Officers on horseback pointing and sho-ting making gestures at people

as to ease back and make space and room.                          Fror. what appeared novrere in this

vast crowd someone                 tugged at my coat.          I turned round and saw a* elderly man

aged about             55 years,      in company with a woman who I can only deiuce was his

wife.        I    have never seen a man as white,                 he had no colour whatsoever in his

complexion and he                  looked    terrified.       He said "Please,      please get me out of

this." The crowd was still pushing and shoving.                             I told the man to hold onto

my coat          and I would try and            push my       way through the crowd so a s to get them

out.    I   told the man             that he must notfall as          I   knew that if he fell he would

be crushed          as people moved            forward shoving etc.           I felt his hand take hold

of my coat and I shoved and pushed my way through the crowd making sure that

they were both stood up.                     I shouted at people to move, make way but they did

absolutely             nothing.          Eventually    after     what     seemed   quite   a   long   time,    I

managed      to get them through and out near to Leppings Lane, the road, itself.

I could see police helmets in the crowd and decided to make my way to one of

them even though I didn't know who it was.                            By the time I'd reached Sergeant

Whitlam h e â€™d either lost his helmet or he'd taken it off.                                I can't remember

which.           What    I   do      know    is that   it     would   have been     impossible      for   me   to

resume miy previous                 position at      the    turnstiles due      to the number of people.

When I reached Sergeant Whitlam I could hear banging and shouting and looked

across       the sea of heads to see that Liverpool fans were trying to pull gate

'Aâ€™ open          by    force.      As    I stood with Sergeant Whitlam someone                came up    to me

and shoved me his ticket which was red in colour and not brown.                                     I directed

him to the correct part of the ground.                          I noticed that Gate        'A' opened and I

saw    the       crowd    rush      and     surge   into    the ground within       seconds    everybody had

gone,       leaving          the     turnstile      area       absolutely deserted.        I   commented       to

Sergeant          Whitlam about           the number of people,           to which he asked me if I was

okay.        I remember one turnstile, the one I'd been stood at was still open as

far    as    I can remember                the other       closed.           Still       one or two        people    arrived.

The   gates        at    Leppings          Lane were       closed ar.d I remained in that area near to

the     turnstiles.                I     remember    I    had    now    been        rejoined        by   Police     Constable

Wilson       who    had       I believe       returned          from the Police room after dealing with

his prisoner.                I saw after only a few minutes Police Officers who were stood

on    Leppings          Lane       run    towards either gate                'B'    or    'C',   I couldn't         see. More

officers went running down. I wondered what was wrong so decided to run down

myself in that direction.                     An ambulance was parked near gate                            'C', I saw that

the    ambulance             man    had    white    coloured          pads    that       he   was    holding      on a man's

chest       (the    rear       doors       were    open).        I knew       then       that    that      man's heart had

stopped          and he was trying to start                     it.     I ran into the West Stand and as I

ran   dowr.       towards          the    tunnel    I could see people                   being carried o u t , some of

these looked conscious, others were not.                                 I ran into the tunnel and into the

stand and I could see bodies laid over the terraces with hardly any clothes

on.     I went          to    get      some of the        bodies       out onto          the pitch       through the gate

which had now been opened in                        the f e n c e .

I'm sure         that as I was stood                on the West Stand trying to move bodies, people

were spitting on officers who were trying to move b o d i e s .                                          I remember taking

hold of one man's                   arms he was an elderly man,                     I think he had a sports coat

or jacket          on,    that's         the only        item of clothing I can remember.                         I remember

his   face        was    blue.         Another     officer      helped me lift the man through the hole

in the       fence.           I then picked up a young girl's body.                                 She was dressed in a

Liverpool          tracksuit with the               word    'Candy' written across the top part of                         the

tracksuit.              I picked up her             legs and shouted to another officer to pull                            her

up so that we could move her onto                            the pitch.             I remember her face and hands

were purple. We moved her through the gate which had been opened.                                                    I turned

round       to    see     a    Liverpool          supporter,          male,        white,     who    was    wearing     yellow

coloured         trainers,       picking         up   money      that    had    been     dropped      er.i putting        it

into his pockets.              The Liverpool            fan shouted and pointed.                    The rtier officer

got to him before I did and the fan was taken off the stand.

An officer         called me off             the stand and onto the pitch.                     Once       c- the pitch I

helped      someone       with       an    advertising board             from    the    side    of    tie ground.          A

group of         us were       instructed to go and stand on                      the    terraces again.            Facing

the supporters we were told that we were not to look angry and that we were

to   be    tactful       in    our        approach.        I     stood    on     the    West    Stand       facing      what

supporters were left who were by now throwing insults at u s .                                             I was told to

go back onto the pitch.                     I consoled and spoke to as many fans vie were upset

as possible, trying to help them if possible. After which we were told to go

to   the    Leppings          Lane    turnstiles          area    and     form    a line       so     as to watch         the

Liverpool        fans out and to help wherever necessary.                                As I stood in the line

some      fans    shouted        "Murderers,            bastards,       yes     you're    alright          here    lads    on

bloody double time for this bloody mess." But the vast majority of fans were

orderly not shouting or anything.

After      the    majority       of       fans    had    left     one    Liverpool       fan came           up to me and

asked me         the    emergency         telephone       number which he could contact.                          He stated

he had relations in the crowd and he didn't know if they were dead or alive.

I told him         to wait       where       he was and I would find out.                       I wen: to Sergeant

Whitlam who informed me what the telephone number was.                                         I wrote it down on a

piece      of paper and handed it to the youth who thanked me.                                      I informed him         of

my hopes that his relations would be safe and well.

After      ail    the    supporters          had left we returned                to the North             Stand where we

were       spoken        to    by         supervisory         officers, after            which        I      returned      to

Ecclesfield.

My   fears       were    for    the       fans    outside       the     ground    at    Leppings          Lane    who   could

have so easily been injured or killed.                                If the gates hadn't have been opened

my feelings are that all the supporters waiting to get in could have turned

against   the     Police      due    to   their     attitude.      My   observations   are    that

thousands of supporters turned up late                 (some even without any tickets) to a

match   they    knew   full   well    wculd    be     a capacity   crowd.    Some   people   being

under the influence of alcoho- contributed to some disruptive behaviour.

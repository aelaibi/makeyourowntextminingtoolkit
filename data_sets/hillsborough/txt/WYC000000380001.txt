Dear Mrs. Chowdharay-Best,

I refer to your letter of 20th March, which I have received today, and our telephone
conversation this morning.

I note your request for a copy of the evidence given at the opening of the inquest into the
death of Anthony Bland and I understand from our conversation that this is required for the
purposes of accuracy when you are considering newspaper reports.

It is not my wish to be obstructive but I am of course bound by the Coroners’ Rules. Rule
57 provides for copies of reports to be made available to persons who in the opinion of the
Coroner are "properly interested persons". The only guidance I have in respect of this
definition occurs in Rule 20, which seems to restrict "properly interested persons" to relatives
of the deceased, those concerned with any insurance, those whose acts or omissions may
have caused or contributed to the death, and so on.

The added difficulty is that, if I accept your organisation as being properly interested in this
respect, that might imply that I admit additional "rights" in respect of the attendance at the
resumed inquest. This would certainly give rise to even more difficult points of law.

Before I decide what is the proper course I should be glad of your further observations,
particularly as to the precise reason for your request and any future intentions in relation
to the inquest itself.

Yours sincerely,




J. A. Turnbull

     Dear Mr. Turnbull,

           We were most grateful for your letter of 23rd March, but until now have
      not known how to reply.

          It   occurs to me now that the enclosed details of our Conference in the
     Moses Room, House of Lords, on 25th May, show that we are indeed "properly
     interested persons".

          We   are not able to send anyone to attend the resumed inquest, but would
     be mostgrateful if we could have a    report of it.

          Also enclosed is a pamphlet by Rita Marker which expresses our; point
     of view.

          Our precise reason for asking for reports is to make sure that we do not
     misrepresent the proceedings of your Court in our publications.




                                              Yours sincerely,

Dear Mrs. Chowdharay-Best,

Thank you for your letter of 23rd May, received today. In fact the inquest into the death
of Tony Bland will not be resumed until after the pending appeal in relation to the
Hillsborough inquest generally. When this will be I cannot say.

Dear Mrs. Chowdharay-Best,

Re: Anthony David Bland, deceased

I refer to our previous correspondence and in particular your letter of the 23rd May 1993.

I think I should say that I cannot accept that Alert and its members are "properly interested
persons" within the provisions of the statute and rules. In any case I note that you are
unable to send anyone to attend the resumed inquest.

However, in view of our correspondence I am writing to you purely as a matter of courtesy
with the information that the inquest will be resumed on Tuesday, 21st December.

Yours sincerely,

 I ^ffach


                   the letter from Ann Adlington, comparing the Coroner with Taylor, which you
            asked me for over the phone this m o rning;

                 transcript of the last day of the contribution hearing, at the High Court in
         Manchester on 5 October 1990, with the evidence of Mr Bume. We discussed the
         significance of this on Friday - Mr Metcalfe said he would send me a copy of Bume’s
         report, but I do not expect to receive that until after Christmas as Metcalfe was
         planning to pick it up from his firm’s store in Bradford today;

                a letter from Mr Dorries, the Coroner, about changes to Kevin Williams’s
         death certificate (with a copy of my letter which he is replying to);

                latest draft of Chapter One of your Report (with some thoughts in bold by
         Sarah Clifford of the Home Office Press Office - the young lady who was with us in
         Liverpool);

                 latest draft of Chapter Two, taking in the points we went though on Friday
         (and a few useful thoughts that Graham has had). On Friday we agreed two format
         changes - going back to your original plan - and I have marked these in pink. I also
         enclose your marked-up copy, so that you can check on all the changes.

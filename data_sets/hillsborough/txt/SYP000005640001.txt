               I am the Store Mana g e r                of Willis S u p e r m a r k a t , C a t c h Bar Lane,

               Hillsb o r o u g h ,       Sheffield.           My home addr

               On S a t u r d a y    15th April          1989     I was working at               the above        store.         I

               started work at              eight      o clock       on that morning.

               At about           half    past   one     in the a f t e r n o o n      I stood just            inside         the main

               entrance           to the shop.          This was         in order        to     prevent      football

               S u p p o rt er s    from entering and to a llow access                           to   regular       customers.

               I was aware           that    the F.A.          Cup semi-final            was     taking      place at

               H i l l s b o r o u g h S ta d u i m and saw that             the     flow of       people      outside         the    shop

               was        s t e adily buiIding         up.

               At about a quarter                to two        I went      outside       on to the          car   park        situated

               at     the    front       of the store.            On m atch days           it    is company         policy       to
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            S3 6 4

charge       people using        the     car     park.     The   cost      of using      the    car    park on

this    o c c asion was       three      pounds.

I saw light          blue new series Rover Motor Car                       pull    up outside         the     front

door    to    the S h o p .

The    front    seat    passenger          got out and        ran over        to me and        tapped me

across my       left    cheek.         I/cannot        remember        his exact words          but    he

called me something              similar        to a “ robbing          swine" and       refused       to     pay

for using       the    car pa. r k .

I could see          in the     b a c k g ro u n d   that four     other men had got             out    of     the

car and were          passing       round a couple of C h a m p a g n e Bottles                 which       they

were    drinking       from.

I cannot       describe       these m en other            than state         that they were all              white

aged    between       their     late twenties            and early       thirties.           They were

casually       dressed.

The ma n who         tapped my face was aged about                      thirty     five?      white,    w ith

short    brown hair w hi ch was                thinning at the           temples.        He was about

five    feet eight          inches     tall.         He had a round          face and a plump           build.

He was wearing a dark                brown s weatshirt and blue                   jeans.       He was

u n s teady on his          feet and a p p e a r e d      drunk.        He spoke with a L i verpool

accent.

I w aved      to two Police          O f f i c e r s who were      standing        on the oppos i t e          side

of the       road.     As    they    came over         the group of me n d i s a p p e a r e d         into the

c rowd w hich wa s near b y .

Two Police Offic e r s            came     over and       I exp l a i n e d what      had h a p p e n e d .

They went away and two different O f f icers                            a r r i v e d at stood outside

the S h o p together wit h myself.                    They    stayed       outside     the S hop until

about    ten to three.

While    the Officers           were     outside       the Sho p       there w e r e / n o    problems.         1

             I did not       see the men from the        car again a l t h o u g h    the      car   remained

             where    it was     parked.    I looked outside at about               half       past four and

             the Rover       had gone .

             I did not make a note          of the R e g i s t r a t i o n Number    of the       car,   I do

             not know the names        or   collar    numbers    of any of the Police O f f i c e r s

            who helped me.

              To:          Chief Superintendent 'D* Division                                  D*®:         15 April 1989



                        / SUBJECT: INCIDENT?- SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL GROUND

So iV                      At 2.55pm, Saturday* 15 April 1989* I was on duty at the Sheffield Wednesday
                W ? Football Ground where a football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest
    T i; ^ s r t U
                           was to take place*
                           At this time I had made my way to Gate A, at the Loppings Lane side of the ground
                           Biere was a Serial of Police Officers at that gate and I saw that the gate was
                           being forcibly moved from the outside*

                           The gate which was of a flding/sliding type- was being forced side to side and
                           inwards at the same time and looked to be in/the process of breaking down*
                           An official gateman was holding onto the b,olts which kept the gate secured*                      j
                           He was having to keep the bolts pushed up. I looked through a glass observation hj
                           hole in the gate and saw a mass of supporters all pushing towards the gate and tbi
                           those that were in direct contact were the culprits attempting to force it tpen* j
                                                             • '                                             t
                           As a result I contacted Ground Control and asked that Mounted Section be directed
                           to this position to ease the melee outside*

                           Whilst this was taking place sup orters were climbing over the wall into the
                           ground at this point* Supporters coming into the ground via the turnstiles
                           were arguing with Officers in this vicinity re the trouble outside and all
                           were saying that someone was going to be killed in the crush*

                           I continued to assist the gateman at the gate and at this point ^Police
    A G r it t y '           Sergeant (not known) stated that Ground Control had ordered the gate to be
          —          * —
                        fff) opened*
                            "                         t   .*   I   •«   _   «___J   _______
                                         gatemen argued that they had no such orders and at first refused
                                                                                                           n i

                                      —    3fcey were over ruled by the Sergeant and at this time 1HKX I
                                                  -


                    qh 7~ advised th°     an to stand near to the wall and that I fould pull open the door
                           as I feared he would be crushed*
                            The gateman then pulled down the bolts Securing the gate and I opened the right
                           hand gate and someone else opened the left sidei the crowd surged into the
                            ground and all I could do was to assist them in keeping on there feet as they
                            moved forward*
                            I stayed in this position until I was ordered onto the pitch*

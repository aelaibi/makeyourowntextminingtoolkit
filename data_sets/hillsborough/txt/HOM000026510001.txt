                Copies of tickets and stand allocation is at A p p e n d i x "C" .

      1.1.1   In the event   of a draw at full time 30 m i n u t e s of extra time
               will be played.

      1-2     F Division will be policing the match itself and the environs
              of Hillsborough. D Division responsibilities are limited to
               the  add it ional demands  placed upon  the  Divis ion   by  the
              arrival    and departure of supporters of both clubs    who  will
              use the city centre. Both have similar r ed/white colours.

      1-3     Traffic Division are assuming responsibility for all match
              traffic which will enter and leave the South Yorkshire Police
              area. To that end each affected Division is supplying a number

               traffic routes and parking areas via the Press Liaison
               Department

         “=   The   major demand on D policing resources will occur   on   15
               April 1S8S, however past experience has shown that problems do
               occur   on  the evenings which precede and   follow the   match
               hence the   long time span of the operation.

      1-5     The  majority of supporters will travel, to    Hillsborough  by
              various      means on 15 April 1989, however it is   likely that
              some will travel to Sheffield on the the previ o u s day and that
              some will remain in the city centre on the evening following
              the m a t c h .
 Certain areas have be e n set aside for coach and car parking
 designed to ma ximise segregation. D1 Control room have naps
 and will be able to advise. Private cars from L i verpo ol will
 be encouraged to p ar k     in the Parson Cross area and those from
 Nottingham in the N e e p s e n d area.

 RAIL TRAVEL

The Liverpool Special Train will arrive and depart from
Wads l e y -Bri dge. The Special Trains from No t t i n g h a m will arrive
and depart from S heff ield Midland. For timings and platforms
see Appendix "D" .

There are 4 Special T rains laid on to transport su pport ers to
and from Nottingham. The combined capacity of the trains is
2,140 in each direction. Addi ti o n a l l y there are a n um ber of
service trains from Nottingham.

-There is 1 Special Train laid on to transport sup p o r t e r s to
and from Liverpool (into Wadsley Bridge) with a c apaci ty of
350. Many Liverpool su pporte rs will travel by scheduled
services into and out of Sheffield Midland.

Liverpool enjoys w i d e s p r e a d support and supporters from
all over the UR can be expected to travel into Sheffie ld
Midland on service trains. The train times from d e st inati ons
where Liverpool are known to have a strong followi ng
are shown at Appendix " D " .

Supporters traveling to and from Sheffield on the N o t t ing ham
Special Trains will be using the North End Gate . All other
visitors will be us i n g the normal ticket barrier gates. See
Appendix "E" for plan of Sheffield Midland. Skill and tact
will be required to hive the Liverpool and Notts sup porters
from the travelling public.

Sheffield United are p l a y ing at Northamp ton on 15 April 1989
and, although there are no special trains, it is p r o b a b l e that
a number will travel to and from Northampton by rail.

The major threat will be from the Liverpool supporters whose
hard core are well known for causing disorder and  committing
crime (especially shoptheft) on such occasions.

PSV ARRANGEMENTS

Supporters arriving at Sheffield Midland will be  transported
to and from the ground on a dedicated fleet of SYT buses. To
maintain  segregation different routes will be used for  each
group as follows;

NOTTINGHAM FANS Depart from North End Gate then board SYT
buses in Sheaf Street. Travel to SWFC via ; SHEAF SQUARE,
POND STREET,FLAT STREET, HIGH STREET, ANGEL STREET, WEST BAR
SHALESM00R, GIBRALTAR STREET, PENISTONE ROAD .
 LIVER POOL FANS Depart from ticket barriers then board SYT
        P * r t ed outside South Luggage Exit and facing CROSS
 liloSS   STREET.     Travel to SWFC via;gates, CROSS TURNER
 STREET, SUFFOLK ROAD, GRANVILLE SQUARE, S.T MARY'S ROAD       ST
 MARY S GAiE, HANOVER WAY, NETHERTHORPE ROAD, MEADOW STREET
 UPPERTHORPE, ALBERT TERRACE R O A D ,MIDDLEWOOD ROAD AND LEPPINGS
 LANE.

 A total of 35 PSVs are available for the day. From 0930 on
 15.4.89  6 will be parked at each exit. The remainder will
 be stacked on East Bank Road and will be called up by the SYT
 Inspector on duty at the Midland Station when required.

 The  fare is 100p return and fans will know of   this before
 arriving   at  Sheffield. They will receive a yellow return
 ticket on ^boarding which will speed the return loading. Each
 vehicle will hold   80 passengers.

 2   officers   will accompany each PSV  and,  once  they   have
 dropped   their passengers,    the  officers  will  return    to
 Sheffield    Midland for another load. Officers arriving at SWFC
         2:45pm will not return but will report to the Gym     at
 SW^C and re form into serials to act as a reserve.

After   the   match    the same procedure  will   be  adopted   to
return   the   fans    to Sheffield  Midland.   The  serials   will
accompany    the same groups as the inward journey.     Once   fans
are   inside   the    station then officers may   be  reouired   to
return on the e m p t y PSVs for return loads.

After the match Liverpool fans will load  in Penistone Road
North  from Wardsend Road North to Leppings Lane  roundabout.
Nottingham fans will load in Pensitone Road North outside the
ground facing city.

Buses returning with Liverpool fans will return via St Mary's
Road,  enter  the one way system and then Fornham   Street.
Serials 1 - 2 will be deployed.-to line the parking area   to
ensure that  no  one cis embarks. The buses will unload   one
at a time. SYT drivers have been briefed.

buses   returning witn Nottingham fans  will  approach  the
She.xield   Midland  froin Shear  Street. Serials 3 - 4 will  be
deployed to line the arrival area to ensure that only one FSV
at a time dis embarks. The fans will enter through the North
End Gate.

It is imperative that buses do not travel in convoy and that
only one bus at a time (the lead bus) either loads or unloads.
This will assist the searching serials at the ground and will
assist with segregation at the Sheffield Midland.

Supporters (mainly from Nottingham ) will be arriving and
departing on service coaches at Pond Street. Serials 17 - 18
will be deployed in the area to instruct b o t h groups to
use the SYT PSV services departing for SWFC from outside
Sheffield Midland.

O p p o s i n g group 's returning PSVs clash at Hoyle Street   and
P eni s t o n e   Road.   Serial 19 will patrol the  area    after  the
match until all PSVs have passed that point.

The bus station is new and the serials d e p l o y e d there will
familiarise themselves with the layout and relevant platforms.

Mounted and dog section officers will be ava i l a b l e  at the
Midland Station for the arrivals and departures . Their
sup erv i s o r s will liaise with A/Supt. King for deployment on
15 April 1989 but will be at the Midland by 0930.

The aim is t o establish separate parking areas fo r police, fire a n d am b u lan c e vehicles. Each
parking area should be located preferab ly off th e ro a d w ay b u t on t h e a p p ro a c h ro u te t o t h e site

parking surfaces with hard core, gravel, grit or tim b er. Since these a rran g e m e n ts m a y ta k e some

Traffic at t h e scene travelling t o and from t h e site an d b etw een th e parking areas, loading points,          X R   2 4 5

etc. should be marshalled to a d o p t ro u tes which cause t h e m in im u m interference with o t h e r
routes. Where rou tes do m e e t it will be necessary t o establish con tro l by a police officer
performing traffic d u ty , although as soon as possible police officers should be replaced by
civilians or by mechanical apparatus. A lth o u g h in th e initial stages traffic rou tes at th e site will
have been o n e of th e p riority tasks of th e police, it is likely t h a t traffic will soon have a d o p t e d a
w orkable flow p attern in and aro u n d t h e site an d th e need fo r police to actively marshall traffic
will diminish. R outes m ay need t o be signed using sign boards, cones, roadlam ps, tap e , rope, etc.

     G E N E R A L PRINCIPLES

     Dealing w ith fatalities is a second priority t o be considered afte r th e p ro te c tio n and preservation                   xr 3
     of th e living. If it is practicable, it is in t h e interests o f p ro p e r investigation and identification t h a t
     dead bodies and parts should be d istu rb ed as little as possible in t h e first stage o f atten d in g to t h e
     incident. This is especially im p o rta n t w hen t h e incident is an air crash. W hatever t h e in cid en t
     m uch tim e and tro u b le can be saved if all m atters relating t o t h e dead are dealt with m e tho d ica lly
     and carefully. HM C o ro n e r and his staff are responsible fo r dealing w ith t h e dead and everything
     possible should be d o n e t o enable th em to carry o u t their tasks as no rm ally as possible, in accor­
     dance with th e usual procedures. T h ey have been asked t o c o n t a c t O p eratio n s R oom should th e y
     require any t y p e of assistance.

  UNDERTAKERS

 It will be t h e responsibility of O peratio n s R oom to arrange fo r u n d e rta k e rs t o assist in th e tran s­    XR 336
 p o rt of bodies from th e site t o m o rtu a r y ac c o m m o d a tio n , should such service be ap p ro p riate. It
 is desirable t h a t bodies should be ac co m p an ied by a police officer, b u t circum stan ces m ay m ak e
 this impossible.

 The C o ro ner m ay request O pe ratio n s R oom t o arrange fo r th e assistance of u n d e r ta k e rs to

 invaluable in dealing w ith an y ty p e of incid ent w h ere th e re are p articular difficulties or th e
 n u m b er of fatalities is large.

 HM Coroners fo r S o u th Y orkshire have agreed t h a t t h e police should call u p o n t h e services of this        XR 338
firm if th e circum stances of t h e incident justify this course. In th e event of such a m ajo r incident
occurring th e officer in charge of O p eratio n s Room , afte r consulting w ith t h e Site C o m m a n d er,
will be responsible fo r asking t h e firm to a tte n d . It m ust be stressed t h a t HM C o ron er or his rep­
resentative m u st be co n sulted before this ac tio n is ta k e n unless u n d u e delay is likely t o be
occasioned. In cases of d o u b t , however, J H K enyon Ltd should be called even w i t h o u t prior c o n ­

T h e person allocating n u m b ers will m aintain a record of every b o d y which is labelled, showing
details of its co nd itio n and position at t h e site and th e place t o which it is tak en . C o n tain ed in
the m ajor incident boxes is a 'B o d y B o o k ' designed fo r this purpose.

B ody labels are co n ta in e d in all m ajor incident boxes and should be fixed as securely as possible
to the b o d y or part. If practicable th e n u m b e r should be m ark ed on t h e b o d y using indelible

The location where th e b o d y lay should be m ark e d w ith a s tak e or o t h e r suitable o b je c t an d th e
stake labelled using th e sam e reference n u m b e r as t h e bo d y .
                                                                                                               SECTION 21

IDENTIFICATION OF T H E REMAINS

Much distress can be caused to relatives by delay in th e identificaiton of th e bodies of                          the   XR 349
victims, particularly w here bodies are badly m u tila te d , and in nearly all cases, even in relatives            are
available to view t h e remains, it is undesirable. However, relatives and friends w h o do travel                   to
the site will be dea lt with very ta c tfu lly by K e n y o n 's field tea m , w h o base t h e ir identification    on

 This is d ea lt with entirely by K e n y o n 's a fte r a meeting with t h e local Coroner.

Before leaving th e scene of operatio n s, K e n y o n 's o b tain possession of all personal effects                          XR351
removed fro m th e bodies, o r salvaged from th e wreckage, w here this is p r o p e rty of a non-
c o n te n tio u s nature. (N o n-co n ten tiou s in t h e sense t h a t m atters related t o HM C u sto m s or
suspected crimes d o n o t arise.) This relieves t h e Police of t h e task of retaining and disposing of
p ro pe rty, and dealing with t h e heavy b o lu m e of c o rres p o n d e n ce in c o n n e c tio n with t h e same.

In th e m a t t e r of identification, K e n y o n 's field tea m q u ite o fte n kn o w t h e pathologists co n c ern e d ,

It is advisable at an early stage to have a m eeting betw e en t h e Police Officer in charge of t h e

From t h e foregoing it will be seen t h a t t h e arrival of t h e C o m p a n y at t h e scene of an air disaster,           XR 352
to act on behalf o f t h e affected Airline, can result in t h e relieving of th e Police fro m m a n y

It is advisable to have a Police Officer of supervisory rank available to liaise with K e n y o n 's

                                        MORTUARY LIAISON OFFICERS

  In th e event o f a Major Incident occurring which justifies t h e es tab lish m en t o f t h e Casualty                     XR 354
  Enquiry Bureau and which involves m a n y dead persons, arran g em en ts have been m ad e with t h e

  receiving bodies and th ere re p o rt t o t h e c o ro n e r's officer. (Separate arran g em en ts have been m ad e
  with regard t o hospital m ortuaries, which will be th e responsibility o f t h e Hospital Liaison
  Officer).

 Kept at each c o ro n e r's office is a reserve o f necessary e q u ip m e n t which includes a wallet c o n ­
 taining casualty record form s, deceased person's p ro p e rty fo rm s a n d a c o p y of this Section of th e
 manual.

 T he M ortuary Liaison Officer will c o n s u lt with t h e C oro n er and C o ro n er's Officer to establish t h e
 n u m b er o f additional police personnel necessary to a tte n d t o carry o u t t h e police tasks a t t h e
 m ortu ary . He will inform Force O p eratio n s R oom , w ho will m ake t h e necessary arran g em en ts fo r
 staff to a tte n d . He should also indicate t o O p e ratio ns R oom an y items of e q u i p m e n t needed and
 t h e y will m ak e t h e necessary arrangem ents.

 It is intended t h a t t h e C oro ner s staff and th e police staff should w o rk to g e th e r dealing with each            XR 355
b o d y in turn. T h e C o ro n er's staff will strip, search and otherw ise deal w ith t h e b o d y . A police
officer will co m p le te a casualty record fo rm in respect of all bodies. This applies t o bodies which
are incom plete, b u t d o es n o t apply t o parts. However, in cases o f d o u b t a casualty record fo rm
should be com p leted . T h e m o rtu a r y staff will be com pleting th e ir own records w hich will
necessarily contain specialist details o f medical or forensic im po rtan ce. T h e casualty record fo rm
should n o t include such details b u t should co ntain in fo rm atio n w hich m ay enable identification
to be established.


Depending on t h e circumstances, it has been f o u n d of great b enefit in previous m ajor incidents to
assisan an individual police officer t o each b o d y . In this case t h e tea m s w ould a t t e n d a t th e
m o rtu ary and an officer w ould be allocated a b o d y t o t r y and establish its identity.

The officer w ould familiarise himself w ith t h e b o d y and an y p r o p e r t y on or with it. He w ould                   XR 356
a cco m pan y th e b o d y th ro ug h th e p o s t m o rte m stage, gathering fu r th e r in fo rm a tio n . T h a t officer
would th en liaise closely with th e Casualty E n qu iry Bureau in an ef fo rt t o c o m p le te identific­
ation.


It is app reciated t h a t it is n o t always practicable to follow this p ro c e d u re and t h e decision to do
so will lie with th e M o rtu ary Liaison Officer is to tra n s m it t h e details from th e c o m p lete d
casualty record form t o th e Casualty E n q u iry Bureau, so th e relatives and friends m a y be enabled
to identify and trace injured and deceased persons as soon as possible. T ’nsi will be d o n e b y tele­

T he second, b u t equally im p o rta n t task is to provide a line of c o m m u n ic a tio n betw e en t h e m o r ­

        im m ediate access is vital:

        (a)      If practicable, officers should walk at t h e side of the line facing th e direction
                 of o nco m in g trains w here k n o w n . If it b eco m es necessary to cross over a line,
                 t h e officer s h o u ld :—

                   i.   avoid crossing a t po in ts and ju n ctio n s ;
                  ii.   m ak e sure t h e lines are clear;
                 iii.   cross quickly avoiding stepping on a n y rails as on som e lines a th ird
                        rail carries an electric current.

                M odern trains can app roach , possibly from eith er direction, at high speed with                            XR 430
                very little noise. Even after brakes are applied, trains m ay travel up to a mile
                before coming t o a halt. A lth ou g h m o s t trains are fitte d with headlights, th ere
                are still some fitte d with dim lights only.

       (b)     Vigilance m ust be m ain tain ed at all times and special care exercised in areas of                           X R   4 3 1

               restricted clearance — eg bridges, cuttings, etc.

      (d)      When it becom es necessary fo r a police officer t o go on to or in close p ro x im ity
               t o railway lines, he should (if necessary) call fo r th e assistance of a police u nit
               carrying a high visibility ta b a rd , in addition t o asking fo r t h e assistance of rail­
               w a y staff.

 8   A police officer m u s t n o t question or distract an y signalman, driver or guard w h o is on d u t y .               X R    4 3 2

     A police officer m ust n o t e n te r any signal b o x e x c e p t in instances of ex tre m e danger as
     disturbances of co n c e n tra tio n m ight lead t o fu r th e r com plications. If it is n o t possible to
     w ait until t h a t person con cern ed has finished d u ty , th e police officer m u s t arrange fo r th e
     person t o be p ro pe rly relieved. At t h e scene of an incident t h e officer m u s t c o n t a c t th e
     senior railway official present or, in o t h e r circum stances, th e British Rail Area Manager
     responsible fo r t h e person concerned.

 9 Following an incident on or adjacent to railway lines, it will ta k e several m in u te s after th e
    request fo r train m o v em en ts t o be s to p p e d and electrical supplies isolated. C utting off th e
    electric tra c tio n po w e r will n o t stop all trains, as som e trains using t h e same line m ay use
    diesel trac tio n . Trains m ay also c o n tin u e t o coast after p o w e r has .been c u t off. T h erefore
    it is essential t h a t ad e q u ate lo o k o u t p ro te c tio n be m ain tain ed and necessary p re cau tio n s
    take n against electro cu tion .

     Before taking fu r th e r action it m ust be assumed t h a t t h e electrical su pply will still be 'live'              X R 4 3 3

     and t h a t train m o vem en ts are likely t o c o n tin u e until assurance is received from t h e n o m i n ­
     ated railway c o n ta c t p o i n t t h a t the c u r re n t is off an d (if necessary) all trains on t h a t section
     o f line have been halted by th e railway authorities.

10   If it is necessary to rescue an injured person on rolling stock close to overhead eiectric
     pow er lines, an officer should n o t allow (because of th e dangers o f arcing) any p a r t of his
     body t o com e within TWO F E E T o f an y live electrical e q u ip m e n t, b ro k e n or displaced
     wires, or foreign m a tte r such as rope t h a t is in c o n t a c t w ith overhead electrical e q u ip m e n t.
     Officers should n o t climb above th e interior flo o r level of locom otives or carriages, or into
     wagons or freight vehicles unless t h e overhead electrical p ow e r lines have been isolated.

11   If trains have been s to p p ed , or electrical trac tio n p o w e r switched off, it is essential t h a t all          XR 434
      parties involved are left in no d o u b t w hen trains are likely t o be moving again or electrical
      p ow e r is to be restored. Before an y police officer sub seq u e ntly tells t h e senior railway
      officer at th e scene, or th e n o m in ated railway c o n t a c t p o i n t (when a railway official is n o t
      present), t h a t trains m a y restart a n d / o r t h e electrical tra c tio n p o w e r be restored, th e police
      officer m u s t ensure t h a t everyone w h o has been involved is clear of th e lines and is to ld t h a t
      norm al w o rk ing is being resumed. If British T ra n s p o rt Police are in a tten d a n ce, t h e senior
      officer p resent of t h a t Force is responsible fo r ensuring t h a t these p roced ures are carried
     o ut. The officer responsible fo r requesting t h e restoration of services m u s t also ensure t h a t
                                                                                                    SECTION 30

                                                                                                            Page 5



     O perations R oom is inform ed t h a t norm al w orking is being re sumed. When electric trac tio n               XR 434
     p ow e r has been switched off, t h e re quest t o restore p o w e r MUST be fro m th e person w h o
     requested it t o be switched off.

      However, if t h e re quest t o switch off t h e electric trac tio n p o w e r cam e fro m a police officer,      X R   4 3 5

     b u t th e p o w e r is unlikely to be restored fo r a lengthy period — eg a serious incident —
     b efore t h a t police officer leaves th e scene f o r an y reason he m u s t re p o rt t o th e police officer
     in charge of th e incident. T h e police officer in charge of t h e incident m u s t th e n liaise with
     t h e senior railway official p re s e n t in o rde r t o allow th e officer to leave t h e scene w i t h o u t
     t h e electric p o w e r having been restored. When a police officer leaves an incident in c irc u m ­
     stances described above he s hould ensure t h a t O peratio ns R o om is advised.

12   Unless there is good reason to suspect t h a t a crim e is involved, a dead b o d y on th e line m u s t          X R 4 3 6

     be m oved as q uick ly as possible in o rd e r to enable rail services t o be resum ed and th u s m in i­

     necessary to p h o to g ra p h a b o d y at t h e scene, it should be m oved clear of th e line and n o t
     left in position, pending t h e arrival of a p h o to g ra p h e r. If crim e is n o t su spected , a police
     officer should n o t require a b o d y t o be left in position on t h e running line.

13   By th e very n atu re of fatal accidents on railway lines, bodies are often d ism em b ere d and
     p arts of th e b o d y spread o u t over considerable distances. When bodies o r limbs are m oved
     clear of th e lines, train will o ften restart and run normally.

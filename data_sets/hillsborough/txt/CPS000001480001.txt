FILE NOTE: - HILLSBOROUGH

31/12/98


Telephone conversation with Peter Metcalf at Hammond Suddards - re: his letter of
30 December 1998.

He indicated he thought the CPS position had changed somewhat in that previous we
have said that consent o f the maker is required. I indicated that we were currently
moving away from that position given the very high public interest in ensuring that a
fair trial takes place in this case.

He considered that that was the right approach and was pleased to see that we were
approaching the same position.

He indicated he had had a substantial letter from HFSG seeking clarification o f many
o f the issues contained in his letter o f 30 December.

He did point out that they have included a materiality test in their conditions, a point
which I noted.

We discussed legal professional/public interest immunity. He doubts whether there is
much in the Hillsborough archive which is likely to attract that sort of material but he
will deal with that on a case by case basis, i.e. if such material is requested. I pointed
out I thought it likely I thought there would be some correspondence between police
and CPS and may even be a copy of things such as counsel opinion, CPS advice etc.
He agrees with me that that would be protected by legal professional privilege and
should not be disclosed.

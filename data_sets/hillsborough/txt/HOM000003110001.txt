I am writing on behalf of Lord Justice Taylor to thank you for all
the arrangements you made for his visit to Anfield last Friday.   He
was very glad to have the opportunity of meeting you and your
colleagues, to express his sympathy for the bereaved and injured,
and to appreciate for himself the effect on the community which the
tragic events at Hillsborough have had.

It was kind of you to go to such trouble to provide generous
hospitality.  May I express my thanks to you for that,  on behalf         of
Lord Justice Taylor and the other members of his team.

end of the ground.                I went        to buy fish an d         chips    from a shop          close at

hand    to the ground and              1 sta y e d about         for another        10 -* 15 minutes

before       making      my way to the stadium.



On arrival         at the entrance              to Hi 1 l s b o roujyn at aro u n d      1430 / 1440 hours

I was    on my own.            The queues         outsidey tfh e     t urnstiles were orderly.

T h e r e was a bit a pushing and                          ng but       nothing    out of the ordinary.

I can    remember         seeing     police       officers at most           roads      in towards       the

ground       but    I cannot      recall        seeing any by the           turnstiles.          I did see

some    stewards         by the    turnstiles,           they were wear i n g         reflective

jackets.           I do not     recall         seeing any fighting           or disorder         of any kind

enroute       to the ground.



I joined onto            one   of the queues            to the    left of the t u rnstiles and

a l t h o u g h there was a bit of               pushing and shoving             I did not feel as

thought       it was a n y t hi ng       out     of the ordinary.            I wa i t e d approx        10

minu t e s   before       going    thro u g h the tur n s t i l e and          into     the ground area.

1 saw no gates            either     being       opened or any gates             near    the turnstiles

open.        I cannot      recall      seeing a n y       police     officers      or stewards          once

inside       the   ground,        a lt h o u g h there may have                  been.      At no time          did       I see

any    illegal       entry       into      the ground by fans                climbing           over    turnstiles          or

the w a l l ed area.             Ha v i n g    e nt e r e d via the tur n s t i l e a n d handed over my

ticket       I looked for           dir e c t i o n    signs and saw that                 they were           clearly

visi b l e    to me stating what                 the     block     number was an d               checking       this with

your    ticket.         I had       no     problem at all             in finding my m atch viewing

position.          B e t w e e n enter i n g       the ground and taking                    up my m a t c h viewing

po s i t i o n at a bo u t       1445         hours    I saw no disorder              or fans          fighting      or

drinking.          It was        g e ne ra l l y a very good atmosphere.                         On taking           up my

seating       position       I was         still      on my own.           I was       to the front            of the

N o r t h stand almost             level       wit h the      18 y ard       line at        the Leppings Lri end

of the ground.              On     looking       over     towards        t h e ^i^ppings Lri end               I noticed

that    the    centre       pens were           e xt re m e l y f u l 1 y g s p e c i a l l y    pen 3 compared to

t he e xt re m i t i e s at either              end ancjf w h i ^ m w ere quite                 empty.        I did       not

see a barrier           break        in       pen 3.It was        far too         dens e l y     packed.             There

was    no exc e s s i v e    crowd            where    I was seated.



At about       1503 h ours           I saw the         crowd      in pty*s 3 and 4 surge                  forward.

This    was    the    first        real       surge    I can    (V jm e trib e   r a l t h o u g h my a t t e n t i o n     had

been drawn to the a r e a for some                        time     due     to the        large amount           of

s u pporters       piling        in all        the time.          I cannot          say where          they all       came

from.        It was    just        packed to          capacity the mi n u t e             I entered the ground

to the extent           it took my a t t e n t i o n awa y from the game                           itself.           At
                                                                                                          /
a r o u n d this     same    time         1' noti c e d fans were            climbing           over the       perimeter

and    side    fencing.            It was at          this    point      1 r e a lised that there were

people       in serious          trouble        in the       pens.       I saw several             fans       run on to

the    side    of the       pitch and a few mome n t s                   later another             fan ran towards

the L i v e rpool      goal       keeper and drew his a t t e n t i o n                   to what was happening

beh i n d the goal.              S ho r t l y a fter      this      I saw a police               Inspector       run onto

the    pitch towards             the      referee who         stop p e d the game and                  led the teams

off.      At    this       point more and more              fans were           climbing      over the front

fence and a few were                 being     pulled up           into the West           stand by fans           in

the    seating          area.        I saw a young          fan w a l k i n g   past the front           of the

North      stand and              it was    quite     obvious from the            state of his arm that

h e'd br o k e n        it.        I saw a no t h e r man on the pitch wit h a broken                        leg and

fans     were       collapsing all around.                  1 saw both football                supporters

toget h e r w i th the            police      pulling at the            perimeter        fencing      in an

a t te m p t   to e x tricate          injured      people      from the terracing.                 By this        time

two a m b ul an ce s          had a r r i v e d and were a s s i s t i n g        with the       injured.          It

was    not until           the arrival         of the fire serv i c e             that things         began to

happen,        they a pp e a r e d        to have all       the     e q uipment with them for

r e s u sc i t at in g     people.         It w o u l d be at a p p r o x i m a t e l y     1525 hours           that    I

r e a lised how serious                the s it ua t i o n had become w hen I saw fans being

s t re t c h e r e d    off    on make      shift     s tretchers and their                faces were        covered

over wit h          coats.        I p er s o n a l l y did not witness an y deaths.                      Neither

did    I assist wit h the                 dead or     i nj u r e d .



At    1600 hours an a n n o u nc em en t              came over         the     loud speaker         requesting

s p e c t at or s      to remain       in situ until          the      e m e r g e n c y services and the

pitch had           cleared.         At    1620 hours       I left       the ground,          as most      of the

people were             leaving      knowing      that     the game was abandoned.



I did not witn e s s              anything which          I would        consider        to be a criminal

offence.            I feel       there was a great            lack of         c o m m u n i c a t i o n to the

spectators             by no a nn ou nc e m e n t s    being made         until      4 pm     (1600),      had an

announcement              been made much earlier                to the fans           it is possible             this

t r ag e d y ma y       not have      occurred.



I also w ou l d           like to ad d that the o r g a n i s a t i o n out                        ~ie ground

prior     to kick          off was        non existent.           I haj£*<gTt ended the            previous year.

             I had my ticket,              checked by        police     long before       I reached the

             turnstiles,            this    did not ha p p e n at         this match.       Once    the full   scale of

             the      t ra g e d y was     realised      it took a long         time     for the    police and

             ambulance         to    react.       It was         not until   the arrival         of the fire service

             that      everyone       became      organised.


                                                                                       jSkaAs*                         55

             from               in L e i c e s t e r s h i r e   were   picked up that       day in Leicester.



             Th e y    both sat toget h e r          on the        coach seated     to my left on the journey

             to S h effield.             On a r r iv in g    in S h e f f i e l d everyone went      their   separate

             ways and        I never        saw Carl        and N i c h o l a s again.

             briefing commenced and my duties were to work the traffic point at

              the junction of Rutland Road with Pennistone Road which is usually

              controlled by automatic psaffic          lights.

             At approxiamtely 9,          am I commenced my traffic:

             approKimately^gT.45 pm I was picked up and^6*flnveyed to Brightside              lane

              commence my meal the Superintendent             in charge ordered us all out to

              participate     in operation support.

Hillsborough footbaj^r' ground.        We were    immediately shephered onto the

pitch and were/then ordered by an inspector to form a cordon facing

the North gtand in order to prevent the supporters            in that stand from

leaving their seats and coming onto the pitch.

As I entered the playing area I saw that there were thousands of

Liverpool supporters al r e a d e r ! the pitch and the re was al r eady a

police    cordon alon^^l>g,,,,1~talfway line preventing the Liverpool

supporters from corning into contact with the Nottingham fans.

I saw numerous Liverpool       fans attempting to get through this           cordon

and shouting abuse aimed at the Nottingham fans.             After approximately

15 minutes    I saw a sergeant approach myself and

the other officers with me and I thought            I heard him say that D

Division officers should report to the g y m .          I was unaware as to

whether he said B or D so I went to the gym behind the North Stand to

check.    On arrival at the gym I saw officers          clearing away the tables

and chairs and I asisted them until the fljy&r of the gym was                c 1 eared

of furniture.

Immediatl^y that this was done I saw bodies Jbeing brought             into the

gym.     I could see that    I was of no further use in the gym and so I

joined a stretcher     crew which was a man short owing to one of their

team having to remain with a c a s u a p f .

We proceeded onto the pitch ajprtf''*helped carry dead bellies from the goal

mouth area to the gym.        A^ter some time at about 4■QQ pm the
                             / ■'
casualties had been removed from the pitch and I returned to the

cordon.

Of the dead I saw several       of them had vomitted and I noticed that at

least three of these,       adult   casualties,   smelled strongly of

intoxicants.

          Police officer stood near to nwr.        This man was    restrained and'

          advised to return to the/lTtandi ng area away from the g>-tfch.           I saw a

          number of Liverpool/f’ans swearing,       shouting abuse/£t both Police and

          Nottingham f a n y 7" Many of these Liverpool     fap    were under the

          influence ajt drink and several were       compl^ja'te ly drunk.   Some were
                   /                               .

          on tiy^ pitch.     The   photographer gained safety by passing       through the

          Police Cordon.      I saw several Lis/erpool fan■§ ^ s i s t i n g with the

          casualties and these       people wgj^riising advertising hoardings to carry

          off the injured and decjjcHT

          At about 4■ 45 om JXlocated the officers who were from the same

          station as myjrielf and who had been brought to the ground m            the same

          van and          these off i cers I walked into the city centre to form a

          public/order patrol as the fans made their way home.

          At §/.00 pm I returned to Attercliffe and reported off duty.

                have submitted my recollections            in respect of the Hillsborough

           tragedy and now wish to clarify certain matters                   in respect of deceased

           persons      I had dealings with.



           As a result of Ope rat io^t S u p p o r t , I entered the ground through

           Peni stone Rd at aboj/t 1520 hr s .Ijrflt iall^ we farmed a cprdgft along

           the track in frola^ of the NorttyrStarfd’    A short while afVer I went to

           assist      in the gymnasium where       I remained for about five to ten
                                                                                                  8svi
           minutes.          I then went back onto the track and could see POL                     JDSON

            (679) and two other Officers,           who I do not know,        carrying an empty

           stretcher back towards Leppings Ln.                    I went to join them,



           We saw a man lying on the pitch near to the edge of the penalty area
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       SH7S6A

                 and in the centre of the goal.            There were several        people with him and

                 one of them w a s a d o c t o r .    He was attempting to resuscitate the man

                 but was unable to do so.            I would describe the deceased person as

T>c\ T o p       being 25-35 yrs,      heavy b u i I d , a b o u t b' tall.    He had short dark hair

      ~          and a roundish f a c e .      He was wearing a grey          'T' shirt,   blue j e a n s , and

                 he had a red and white football           cap,   the sort that goes        round in

             ?   se gme nt s.   * , C-
                                     < 1



                 We placed him on the stretcher and carried him to the g y mn as iu m.                    I

                 placed him on the floor.            A CID man wrote my collar number on the

                 d e ce as ed ’s right hand.    I then went back outside to try and assist

                 f urthe r .



                 Some time later I returned to the gypynasium w ith a view to dealing

                 with my deceased but on arrival           fwund that another Officer,           who    I do

                 not know, was already documenting him and had started the Sudden Death

                 report and had placed all his property into a plastic bag.



                 This Officer had made         it clear that he was willing to deal with it so

                 I left him to it and returned to the pitch.

             Further to my previous statement dated 17th August                         1989             (170889).



             On 16 October           1989 I was shown vi             ootage and photographs of the

             Hillsborough disaster by                           f the West Midlands Po 1 i c e .

              I can identify my s e 1f o n photograph                (Ref No SSSE 1/12)(Ex No

             At this point           I amysngaged in carrying the deceased person No. 38

           / &hr i s t o pne r Eft&flRDS across the pitch on a s t r e t ch e r a s s i s t e d by

              other officers.            I can be seen carrying the front               right            corner of ti

              stretcher.          I recall    that this man was very heavy and having viewed

             the clothing photograph            (Ref No NA38)(Ex N o              ') I am sure that thi*

             was the       clothing he was wearing.              I just came     into contact with

             Christopher EDWARDS in the area of the penalty spot at the Leppings
         Lane end.      Toget he r w 11,h o t he rs I placed him ori/a s t ret che r and

         carried him across the pitch into the gymnasium.               I rernained with hi

         for a short time,     then I returned to the piJtch to search for my seria



         I later returned to the gym to find that another officer had been

         given responsibili'ty for the bo d y »

Football Club pic

The directors present herewith the audited accounts of the company for the year ended 31st May, 1986.

Financial Results and Dividends
The revenue account is set out on page 5. The directors recommend no dividend be paid.

Review of the Year
The principal activity of your company continues to be that of a professional football club.
The year under review was a successful one in that we finished the season in the fifth position of Division One and progressed
through the rounds of the FA Cup to lose in the Semi-Final to Everton at the Aston Villa ground.
Bobby Robson, the England Manager, asked for Howard Wilkinson to be part of the England management squad for
the World Cup Series in Mexico; an honour which reflects well on both our Manager and Club.
Martin Hodge, our goalkeeper, narrowly missed the call to Mexico. He literally was sat with his passport in his hand, and
was only advised shortly'before the deadline expired that he would not be needed.
Financially the Club was strengthened — though shareholders should note our profit was only due to the surplus on
transfer fees.
During the year we spent £340,000 on improving facilities for our spectators, and during that year we were able to finalise
the plans for the project “ Roof the Kop” .
The Board wish to thank, on your behalf, all members of our staff for the Stirling work done during the year to make these
results possible.

The changes in the directors’ interest in the share capital and debentures in the year were a purchase by S. L. Speight
of 2 'A' ordinary shares, a purchase by K. T. Addy of 3 ‘A’ ordinary shares and a purchase by G. K. Hulley of 4 ‘A’
ordinary shares.
The directors who retire by rotation are Messrs. S. L Speight, E. Barron and G. K. Hulley who, being eligible, offer themselves
for re-election.

Charitable Donations
Charitable dqnations amounted to £445 in the year.

Fixed Assets
The changes that occurred in the fixed assets during the year are set out on page 7. In view of the specialised use of
the freehold land and buildings at Hillsborough, the directors are unable to give an indication of the excess of the market
value over book value. The buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard and it is not considered
appropriate to provide depreciation on the freehold stadium.

Auditors
The directors will propose the appointment of Arthur Andersen & Co. as auditors to the members at the .Annual General
Meeting. Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic wish to place on record their appreciation of the long and valued service
received from Pannell Kerr Forster.

12. Fixed Assets—Tangible
   The increase in book value of freehold land and buildings at 9th January, 1975 to £1,000,000 followed a
    professional valuation by Messrs Eadon Lockwood & Riddle on that date of £2,312,000. This valuation was
    made on the basis of depreciated replacement cost, but in view of the specialised nature of the stadium, the
   directors felt it was inappropriate to include the asset in the accounts at that figure. As there is no intention to
   dispose of the property, no provision has been made for an estimated potential tax charge of £123,000 which
   would arise on a sale at book value.

Except for the effects of accounting for depreciation on the freehold stadium in the manner described in the preceding

1986, and of the surplus and source and application of funds, for the year then ended and comply with the Companies
Act 1985.

The directors present their annual report on the affairs of the com pany, together with the accounts and a u ditors’ report,
for the year ended 31st May, 1987.

Principal A ctivity and Business Review
The principal activity of the com pany continues to be that of a professional football club.
After a good start it was somewhat disappointing to finish in thirteenth place in the First Division, but once again we fared
well in the F.A. Cup only to lose at home to the eventual winners Coventry City in the 6th Round.
Nigel W orthington and Siggi Jonsson once again regularly represented their countries. Carl Bradshaw, Tony Gregory,
David Hirst and Kevin Pressman all played for England at Under 19 level as did Scott Cam at Under 17, and this bodes
well for the future of the club.
The highspot of the year however was the opening of the new Kop complete with its magnificent roof, surely the finest
structure of its kind in the Football League, by Her Majesty the Queen on 12th December 1986. A day for all of us to remember.
We wish to take this opportunity, on your behalf, of thanking all members of staff for their valuable work done during the year.

Results and Dividends
Results, dividends and recomm ended transfers to reserves are as follows:
Retained profit at 1st June 1986                                                                        £1,639,289
Profit for the year after taxation                                                                     242,673
Proposed transfer to debenture redemption reserve                                                                        (8,917)

Retained profit at 31st May, 1987                                                                         £1,873,045

The directors recomm end that no dividend is paid.

The directors who retire by rotation are Messrs. H. E. McGee and K. T. Addy who, being eligible, offer themselves for
re-election.

C haritable Donations
Charitable donations am ounted to £1,370 in the year.

Fixed Assets
The changes that occurred in the fixed assets during the year are set out in Note 10 to the accounts. In view of the specialised
use of the freehold land and buildings at Hillsborough, the directors are unable to give an indication of the excess of
the market value over book value. The buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard and it is not
considered appropriate to provide depreciation on the freehold stadium.

Auditors
The directors will place a resolution before the annual general meeting to re-appoint Arthur Andersen & Co. as auditors
for the ensuing year.

Football Club pic                                                       Year Ended 31st May, 1987




1.     Accounting Policies
     The principal accounting policies are:
     (a) Basis o f accounting
         The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings,
     (b) Turnover
         Turnover com prises the value of match receipts and season tickets, less percentage payments to the Football
         League and Football Association, and receipts from the Football League, and other miscellaneous incom e, all
         exclusive of value added tax.
     (c) Transfer fees
         T ransfer fees payable and receivable are w ritten off to the profit and loss account in the year in w hich the transfer
         is completed.
     (d) D onations
         Donations from the developm ent associations are credited to the profit and loss account when receivable.
     (e) Repairs
         Repairs and ground m aintenance are charged against incom e as they are incurred.
     (f) Grants
         The Sports C ouncil grant relating to M iddlewood Road training ground was transferred to deferred incom e upon
         receipt and is being credited to the profit and loss account over the same period as depreciation is provided on
         the asset.
         G rants towards capital expenditure received from the Football Grounds Im provem ent Trust are credited to the
         appropriate asset accounts.
     (g) Taxation
         Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
         Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method to the extent that the directors believe it is likely to become
         payable in the foreseeable future.
     (h) Tangible fixed assets
         Land and buildings are shown at original cost or subsequent valuation. O ther fixed assets are shown at cost.
         Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to w rite off the cost or valuation, less estim ated residual value, of
         each asset on a straight-line basis over its estim ated useful life as follows:
         Leasehold land and buildings — term of the lease
         Plant and m achinery              — 7.5°/o to 25% per annum
         The freehold stadium is not depreciated. The directors do not consider such depreciation to be necessary as the
         buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard,
     (i) Leases
         Assets held under finance leases are initially reported at the fair value of the assets, with an equivalent liability
         categorised as appropriate under creditors due w ithin or a fter one year. The asset is depreciated over the shorter
         o f the lease term and its useful econom ic life. Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period
         o f the lease to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance.
         Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Auditors’ Report to the Members
We have audited the accounts set out on pages 3 to 10 in accordance with approved A uditing Standards.

As explained in Note 1, the company has not com plied w ith Statem ent of Standard Accounting Practice No. 12 in that
no provision has been made for depreciation on the freehold stadium .

Except for the effects of not depreciating the freehold stadium as described in the preceding paragraph, in our opinion,
the accounts, w hich have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of freehold
land and buildings, give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company at 31st May, 1987 and of the profit
and source and application of funds for the year then ended, and com ply with the C om panies Act 1985.

Football Club pic                                                          For the Year ended 31st May, 1988
The directors present their annual report on the affairs of the company, together with the accounts and auditors’ report, for the
year ended 31st May, 1988.
Principal Activity and Business Review
The principal activity of the company continues to be that of a professional football club.
At the end of the season the team held a respectable eleventh place in the First Division. Hard work was required to recover
from a weak start and this was successful in providing some exciting highlights to the year. These included reaching the quarter
final of the Littlewoods Cup and the epic confrontation with Everton in four F,A, cup-ties. On 16th April we were one of the teams
invited to take part in the Football League Festival of Football at Wembley, Winning through to the final we narrowly lost to Nottingham
Forest 1-0 on penalties.
Three of the clubs’ players: Nigel Worthington, Siggi Jonsson and Tony Galvin were regularly called on to represent their countries
at senior level, whilst Mel Sterland was capped by England in a ‘B’ International.
At the Football Association’s request we hosted an excellent F,A, Challenge Cup Semi-Finalbetween Nottingham Forest and
Liverpool in our stadium on 9th April.
During the last season and close season 10 new professionals were recruited to the club: Cranson, Fee, Galvin, Harper, Hodgson,
McCall, Owen, Proctor, Pearson and West, During the same period we said goodbye to: Brannigan, Chapman, Chamberlain,
Hazel, Hayward, Jacobs, Marwood, Morris, Owen, Shelton, Shutt, Smith, Snodin and Walker, We offer our thanks to them for
their services to the Club and wish them well in the future.
The long term strategy for developing the Club’s quality through the encouragement of younger players and concentration on
comprehensive team strength is still on course. Consistent progress in sporting accomplishment and financial stability is envisaged
in the year ahead.
One sign of this success is that the Executive Club has now reached capacity and there is a waiting list of supporters anxious
to enjoy the excellent facilities.
 Increased income and improved conditions for players was a factor in this year's operating loss of £75,568. After bank interest
 and deficit in transfer fees during the same period the overall loss is £448,866.
On your behalf we take this opportunity of thanking our supporters, players, staff and stewards, andeveryone connected with
the Club, for their unstinting support and effort throughout the year.

The directors who retire by rotation are Messrs. M. Sheppard and C. Woodward who, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
Charitable Donations
Charitable donations amounted to £160 in the year.
Fixed Assets
The changes that occurred in the fixed assets during the year are set out in Note 10 to the accounts. In view of the specialised
use of the freehold land and buildings at Hillsborough, the directors are unable to give an indication of the excess of the market
value over book value. The buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard and it is not considered appropriate
to provide depreciation on the freehold stadium.
Auditors
The directors will place a resolution before the annual general meeting to re-appoint Arthur Andersen & Co. as auditors for the
ensuing year.
 By Order of the Board,                                                                            Hillsborough, Sheffield S6 1SW.

1.     Accounting Policies
     The principal accounting policies are:
     (a) Basis o f accounting
         The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings.
     (b) Turnover
         T urnover com prises the value of match receipts and season tickets, less percentage paym ents to the Football
         League and Football Association, and receipts from the Football League, and other m iscellaneous incom e, all
         exclusive of value added tax.
     (c) Transfer fees
         Transfer fees payable and receivable are w ritten off to the profit and loss account in the year in w hich the transfer
         is com pleted.
     (d) Donations
         D onations from the developm ent associations are credited to the profit and loss account when receivable.
     (e) Repairs
         Repairs and ground m aintenance are charged against incom e as they are incurred.
     (f) Grants
         The Sports C ouncil grant relating to Middlewood Road training ground was transferred to accruals and deferred
         incom e upon receipt and is being credited to the profit and loss account over the same period as depreciation
         is provided on the asset.
         Grants towards capital expenditure received from the Football Grounds Improvement Trust are credited to the
         appropriate asset accounts.
     (g) Taxation
         C orporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
         Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method to the extent that the directors believe it is likely to become
         payable in the foreseeable future.
     (h) Tangible fixed assets
         Land and buildings are shown at original cost or subsequent valuation. O ther fixed assets are shown at cost.
         Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to w rite off the cost or valuation, less estim ated residual value, of
         each asset on a straight-line basis over its estim ated useful life as follows:
         Leasehold land and buildings — term of the lease
         Plant and m achinery             — 7.5% to 25% per annum
         The freehold stadium is not depreciated. The directors do not consider such depreciation to be necessary as the
         buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard.
     (i) Investments
         Fixed asset investm ents are shown at cost less am ounts written off. C urrent asset investm ents are stated at the
         lower of cost or m arket value as at the year end.
     (j) Leases
         Assets held under finance leases are initially reported at the fair value of the assets, w ith an equivalent liability
         categorised as appropriate under creditors due within or after one year. The asset is depreciated over the shorter
         of the lease term and its useful econom ic life. Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period
         of the lease to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance.
         Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

      A professional valuation of the freehold stadium was perform ed on 9th January, 1975 by Messrs. Eadon Lockwood
      & Riddle. However, this valuation of £2,312,000 was made on the basis of depreciated replacem ent cost and, in view
      of the specialised nature of the stadium, the directors felt it inappropriate to include the asset in the accounts at that
      figure. C onsequently, the directors reduced the valuation to £1,000,000, for accounts purposes, as of that date.

Auditors’ Report to the Members
We have audited the accounts set out on pages 3 to 10 in accordance with approved A uditing Standards.

As explained in Note 1, the com pany has not com plied with Statem ent of Standard A ccounting Practice No. 12 in that
no provision has been made for depreciation on the freehold stadium.

Except for the effects of not depreciating the freehold stadium as described in the preceding paragraph, in our opinion,
the accounts, w hich have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of freehold
land and buildings, give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the com pany at 31st May, 1988 and of the loss and
source and application of funds for the year then ended, and com ply with the Com panies Act 1985.

    The directors present th e ir annual report on the affairs of the com pany, together w ith the accounts and a ud ito rs’ report,
    for the year ended 31st May, 1989.

    P rin c ip a l A c tiv ity and B u s in e s s R eview
    The principal activity of the com pany continues to be that of a professional football club.
    The review of the year is of course overshadowed by the events of the 15th April 1989. Our hearts go out to those who
    lost loved ones and also to those who were injured here at H illsborough. Investigations are still proceeding into these
    matters and therefore it would be inopportune to speculate on th e ir future outcom e. However, the club is co-operating
    with all relevant authorities, particularly with regard to safety aspects.
    On the playing front, it was a year of changes. Howard W ilkinson left in October to take up the m anager’s position at
    Leeds United. His successor was Peter Eustace, but unfortunately the form of the team slum ped badly. In February the
    Board appointed Ron Atkinson.
    Ron was able to engender great spirit am ongst the players, new signings were made and eventually we escaped from
    trouble finishing in 15th position. The playing staff has been strengthened over the sum m er months.
    Once again the accounts reflect the cost of attracting quality m anagem ent and players to the club. This factor, together
    with the failure to progress adequately in most of the competitions and also the loss of income arising out of the Hillsborough
    tragedy, were the main factors for the loss for the financial year of £53,862.



•
    On you behalf, we take this opportunity of thanking our supporters, players, staff and everyone connected w ith the club
    for th eir unswerving support. The last few months have been very difficult, but adversity has brought out the best in all
    concerned.

    The directors who retire by rotation are Messrs. S. L. Speight and E. Barron.
    Mr. Ernest Barron, who has been a director since 1977, and has the support of all his colleagues, offers himself for re-election.
    Mr. Stanley Speight, aged 68, who has served the company as a director for over 14 years, now considers it an appropriate
    tim e to retire and therefore does not seek re-election.
    The Vice Chairm an, Mr. Matthew Sheppard, who has served as a director for over 18 years, wishes to retire as from
    the Annual General Meeting.
    Resulting from the foregoing, there will be two vacancies on the Board and the Directors have great pleasure and confidence
    in unanimously nominating Mr. R. M. (Bob) Grierson and Mr. D. G. (Dave) Richards for election as directors of the company.




                                                                    2
    Donations
    The directors have provided £20,000 in the accounts to 31st May, 1989 for donation, after year end, to the Hillsborough
    Disaster Fund.
    C haritable donations amounted to £590 in the year.

    Fixed Assets
    The changes that occurred in the fixed assets during the year are set out in Note 10 to the accounts. In view of the specialised
    use of the freehold land and buildings at Hillsborough, the directors are unable to give an indication of the excess of
    the m arket value over book value. The buildings will continue to be maintained to th e ir present standard and it is not
    considered appropriate to provide depreciation on the freehold stadium .

    Auditors
    The directors will place a resolution before the annual general m eeting to re-appoint A rth u r Andersen & Co. as auditors
    for the ensuing year.

    By O rder of the Board,                                                                      Hillsborough, Sheffield S6 1SW.

    Auditors’ Report to the Members
    W e have audited the financial statements on pages 4 to 11 in accordance with A uditing Standards.



•
    As more fully explained in Note 20 to the financial statem ents, the com pany is a party to certain claim s fo r loss or injury
    as a result of events at the F.A. Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April, 1989. Although the directors consider,
    based on professional advice, that the com pany is unlikely to have any material contingent liabilities in respect of this
    matter, it is not possible at this tim e to determ ine w ith reasonable certainty the ultim ate settlem ents, if any, w hich may
    become payable.
    In addition, as explained in Note 1, the com pany has not com plied with Statem ent of Standard A ccounting Practice No.
    12 in that no provision has been made for depreciation on the freehold stadium.

    S ubject to the adjustm ents, if any, that m ight have been necessary if the outcom e of the claim s referred to above had
    been known and except for the effects of not depreciating the freehold stadium , in our opinion, the financial statements
    give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the com pany at 31st May, 1989 and of the loss and source and application
    of funds fo r the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance w ith the C om panies Act 1985.

1.     Accounting Policies
     The principal accounting policies are:
     (a) Basis o f accounting
         The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings.
     (b) Turnover
         Turnover com prises the value of match receipts and season tickets, less percentage paym ents to the Football
         League and Football Association, and receipts from the Football League, and other m iscellaneous incom e, all
         exclusive of value added tax.
     (c) Transfer fees
         Transfer fees payable and receivable are written off to the profit and loss account in the year in w hich the transfer
         is com pleted.
     (d) Donations
         Donations from the developm ent associations are credited to the profit and loss account when receivable.
     (e) Repairs
         Repairs and ground m aintenance are charged against incom e as they are incurred.
     (f) Grants
         The Sports Council grant relating to Middlewood Road training ground was transferred to accruals and deferred
         incom e upon receipt and is being credited to the profit and loss account over the same period as depreciation
         is provided on the asset.
         Grants towards capital expenditure received from the Football Grounds Im provem ent Trust are credited to the
         appropriate asset accounts.
     (g) Taxation
         Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
         Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method to the extent that the directors believe it is likely to become
         payable in the foreseeable future.
     (h) Tangible fixed assets
         Land and buildings are shown at original cost or subsequent valuation. O ther fixed assets are shown at cost.
         Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to w rite off the cost or valuation, less estim ated residual value, of
         each asset on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life as follows:
         Leasehold land and buildings — term of the lease
         Plant and m achinery             — 7.5% to 25% per annum
         The freehold stadium is not depreciated. The directors do not consider such depreciation to be necessary as the
         buildings will continue to be maintained to th e ir present standard.
     (i) Investments
         Fixed asset investm ents are shown at cost less am ounts written off.
     (j) Leases
         Assets held under finance leases are initially reported at the fair value of the assets, with an equivalent liability
         categorised as appropriate under creditors due w ithin or after one year. The asset is depreciated over the shorter
         of the lease term and its useful econom ic life. Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period
         of the lease to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance.
         Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
     (k) Stocks
         Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

      A professional valuation of the freehold stadium was performed on 9th January, 1975 by Messrs. Eadon Lockwood
      & Riddle. However, this valuation of £2,312,000 was made on the basis of depreciated replacem ent cost and, in view
      of the specialised nature of the stadium, the directors felt it inappropriate to include the asset in the accounts at that
      figure. Consequently, the directors reduced the valuation to £1,000,000, for accounts purposes, as of that date.

19.     Guarantees and O ther Financial Com m itm ents
      (a) Capital com m itm ents
      At the end of the year capital com m itm ents were:                               1989                                1988

      (b) Lease com m itm ents
      The com pany has entered into an operating lease in respect of plant and m achinery for w hich the total rent charged
      for the year was £4,976 (1988 — £2,754). The lease, which expires within 2 to 5 years, has a m inim um annual rental
      of £3,672.

20. F.A. Cup Semi-Final
    On or subsequent to 15th April, 1989, when an F.A. Cup Sem i-Final was scheduled to be played at the H illsborough
    Stadium, 95 people tragically died and others were injured in the ground. The events on that day are currently the
    subject of certain investigations including a Government investigation by Lord Justice Taylor, who has issued an interim
    report dated 1st A ugust, 1989.
      The com pany is a party to certain claim s that have been received for loss or injury as a result of the events described
      above. It is not possible to assess the financial effect of the claim s at this tim e. However, the directors consider, based

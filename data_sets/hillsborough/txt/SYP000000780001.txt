Once     I got        onto       the    back    of the      terrace,      there was a gradual                  pus

At    this      time       the    crowd were         frustrated,         people were          s c reaming       and

shouting            for help,          they were      being       crushed and were            shouting        to the

Immedi a t e l y       on my       left were         two    girls    sc r e a m i n g and     crying.

them       because     I could        see     the    gate    to get       out.      By them some              fans    had

response.           Another       lad bent          down and tried          to talk         to him but          there

This       lad grabbed         under      his armpits and             I took      his    legs,      after       picking

                I am a ^Polic^ Constable           in the South Yorkshire Police at present

                stationed at Ecclesfield P o lice Station.

                On Saturday          15 A p r i l (150489)     I was on duty at the FA Cup Semi

                Nottingham Forest and Liverpool

                the     playing area at the Leppings Ln end of the ground I saw people

                climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the playing a r e a .

                place.

             FA CUP SEMI FINAL              SATURDAY   15 APRIL        1989     (150489)

             With    regard to the above event            I have to report that              I reported for

             duty at Eeclesfield Police Station at 9 am                         (0900 hrs) and was

             transported to Sheffield Wednesday Football                        Ground for the match

             between Liverpool            and Nottingham Forest.

             At    10 am    (1OQQ h r s ? all     officers   present were briefed by Senior

            Officers.           I was a member of Serial           19 with POL PC 323 PROCTOR as

             supe rv i s ing offi ce r .        Our duties were outside            the ground at the
                                                  7 which
            Leppings L.n end near to the turnstiles   .   were to be used by the

             Liverpool          fans.   The duty consisted of the               reception of coaches and

             other    forms of transport attending directly at Leppings Lrt and general

             public order duty.

             At ,11 am      (1100 hrs) after        the general        briefing we attended at the rear
                                                                                       PAGE

                                                                       /
    of the West stand where we received a farther briefing from Inspector
                                                                                       S792A


     ATsiei?
    SYKES;y we ensured that all officers were aware of their duties. He

    instructed us to carry out selective             searching of fans outside the

    g round.

    At about    11.10 am      (1110 hrs ) the serial     took up their     positions in

    Leppings Ln outside the turnstiles and the mouth of the road that

    leads to the official         car park at the     rear of the South stand.          On

    leaving the ground         1 saw that there was quite a number of Liverpool

    fans    there waiting to get       into the ground.       These supporters were well

    behaved.     Several     fans enquired of me where they could find a public

    house open.      This was a regular enquiry throughout the day.

    At a b o u t 1,2 noon    (1200 h r s ) t h e turnstiles were opened and fans

    started to enter the ground.            There was still a fair amount of

    supporters outside the ground who had no intention of entering the

    ground.     Many of these fans were drinking al coho                    cans and

    b o t t 1es and you could see them stopping other fans and aski ng if they

    had any s pa re tickets.

    Together with mounted officers at this             1o cati on and other members of

    my serial we were         constantly encouraging      people to enter the ground

    and    if they did not have tickets move them away from the turnstile

    area.     All the time the volume of fans was           increasing.

    At 12.20 pm (1220 hrs)         I saw a large group of fans on the footpath in

    Leppings Ln approximately 50 yrds away from the turnstiles                     in the

    direction of Penistone Rd N.            There was about 30 - 40 people blocking

    the footpath and spilling over onto the             road causing traffic to stop,.

iOn going towards the group I saw a man I now know to be
1         L Z ________
                                              Liver poo 1 .                   I could see

    that    he had a handful      of tickeyf' he was of f e r i ng for s a l e .   On seeing

    me approaching he placed the tickets             in his pocket.      He was arrested
                                                                                    *7^—

                                                                                S792A

of the North stand.      On searching                   found that he had 11

.tickets for the Liverpool      end a nd 7 tickets for the Nottingham F or e st

end together with £701.64.        The tickets were      checked with the Football

Club office and were or i q i n a 1s .   I ascertained that the tickets were

being offered for sale at £33,                   stated that he had obtained

the tickets from the Anfield ticket office.             After    completing the

detention and submitted the file against                        I returned to my

position in Leppings Ln.       The time then was       1.15 pm (1315 h r s ).     The

crowds had grown but there did not seem to be any problems.                From that

point onwards the flow of fans greatly increased and it was noticeable

that many were    carrying    cans and bottles   of alcohol.

These were   prevented from entering the ground.            Leppings Ln was

thronged with supporters and I was         continually moving       people away from

the footpaths and from the middle of the            road.   These fans were

directed to the turnstiles or away if they did not have a ticket.                   Due

to the problem vehicular       traffic was having difficulty negotiating

Leppim^s Ln,    the road was blocked off at both e n d s .         I was made aware

just after 2 pm ( 1400 hrs)      that a s pe c ia^'t ra 1 n had arrived at wads 1 ey

pridqe Station containing Liverpool        fap#"^    On their arrival at

Leppings Ln they greatly       increased the volume of supporters there.                As

time went on it became       clear that the amount of fans without tickets

was growing.

At about 2.30 pm (1430 hrs)       I was aware of an incident that took            place

in Leppings Ln about 50 yrds Catch Bar Ln side of the turnstiles.                   I

had heard the sound of breaking glass and a gap appear               in the fans

approaching me.    I could not see what was happening but went towards
                                     rJ&'W /           N W o      y
this   location where I saw POL PC2120 THORPE and POL PC2333 ENQfeflSH

walking towards me with two youths who were obviously under arrest.                      I

ascertained that there had been a f i qht between the rival fans.                 I was

then approached by three men who showed me tickets they had purchased,
                                                                               PAC5E      '
                                                                               S792A

these tickets were obvioulsy photostat        copies.

I then returned to a position nearer the turnsti ies .            All the time the

crowd was growing and with other officers entered the erowdyto try and

ease the congestion.

I cannot say the exact time but for a short time the tffiuhle exit gates

alongside the turnstiles A were opened and then closed.

Mounted officers were still attempting        to get the fans       in orderly

queues.    X could see fans   climbing   on the walls outside the turnstiles

that allow fans    into the standing area.      These fans were       climbing over

the wall and into the ground.      I became aware       of possible serious

problems   outside these turnstiles due to the sheer volume of fans

present.    With other officers we went      into the crowd in order to close

the   iron gates situated about   13 yards    in front of the turnstiles and

at the head of the road leading to the official           car park.      So that the

crowd could have a more direct access to the turnstiles.                I then saw

a mounted officer alongside these gates having a problem with some

supporters and one appeared     intent on getting to this officer.              I got

hold of this person and pulled him away from the horse,              telling him to

calm down he was still    trying to push forward.         I pulled several

other   people away from trying to push past the horse.            The horse did

not have    room in which to manoeuvre.      While   I was   in the crowd

several    fans who were obviously Nottingham Forest         fans with ty t kets
                                    -                                     fr
for the South Stand w e re a ttempting to reach this stand v^a the road

leading to the official    car park,     I informed them that they could not

reach the stand this way due to a barrier across the road, and

directed them to the correct way to the stand.            They got agitated and

annoyed because they could see a large sign above            the turnstiles.        The

sign showed South Stand and an arrow underneath pointing down the road

to the car park.Due    to the immense     pressure   of supporters around me I

had to physically push my way back out of the           crowd into L e p p i n.qX^L n .
                                                                                    PAGE    5

The    crowed was getting       denser as kick off time approached and the

mood more agitated and aggressive.

The    pressure seemed to ease and I found out             later that a double exit

door had been opened although             I was not aware of that at the time.

Sometime after 3 pm ( 1500)            I received a radio message        requesting that

all    officers attend inside the ground at the Leppings Ln end.                    I ran

through Gate a with other officers,             through the North Stand and onto

the    playing a r e a .    On entering the playing area I saw people on the

pitch    (supporters and Police).           It seemed to me that there had been a

pitch invasion.           Many supporters were climbing over the perijrfeter

.fence and through the gate            in the perimeter    -fence.   A lot of people

after getting out of the terracing             collapsed onto the pitch.           Others

were    directed to enter the pen adjacent to the North Stand that was

fairly empty.        I could see the crowd in the centre pen being crushed

forward and right up to the fencing                he situation worsened and there

seemed to be hundreds          of people and Police around,           I saw some

officers and supporters trying to pull away the fencing from there

supports.        I assisted them and then helped          lift trie bodies and injured

from the terracing on to the pitch.  At this time a St Johns amjsulance
                            —                               ^ --------
had been brought onto the pitch and was adjacent to the terracing.   I

helped lift two bodies          into the ambulance,       they were obviously dead

and were     checked by the attendant.          Two more    people were taken out and

after giving them oxygen they recovered.              I then assisted in carrying

several     bodies to the gymnasium on makeshift stretchers.

One of the bodies that had been taken out of the teerracing was a Paul

at 3.55 pm (1555)          by a Dr HULL    (Royal Hallamshire)       I remained with the

body until       it was    identified by the youths father at          12.15    (1215) am

           Throughout the time             I was on the pitch I was aware of Police,

           ambulance men and supporters giving first aid to people on the pitch.

           In my opinion due to the volume of supporters outside the turnstiles

           in Leppings Ln if the double doors had not been opened to relieve

           pressure there would             certainly have been fatalities and serious

           injuries to the fans t h e r e .

           I have been a Police officer              for 22 years     in the Sheffield area and

           have served in the Division that              covers Sheffield Wednesday Football

 ^         Ground for          17 years.    During   this time     I have been on duty at most of

           the matches that have taken place there                  including   previous semi

           finals.      Over the      last 2 - 3     years   I have   performed duties mainly at

           the Leppings Ln and either on turnstile duty or coach reception.

                                                                                               hi^S)
               In my statement plated 4.7.89.         (040789)         state that 1' s a r d e d a body
              bOD'Y      ^
               into an ambula/ce and remained with X h e           casualty.               fac‘    tayed

               with this person for a short time/and once someone had certified the

               person dead I returned to the p/tch,             leaving the body in the ambulance

               to see     if I could be of furth«       assistance



              My recollection of exactly what happened next is vague.     I know that
                N / 6 0 1 e > O O V If 2~^\ i V 3
              Paul Anthony HEWITSON (Ref 42) ^ a s passed from the terrace to me, by

               unknown persons and that       I pVUaced him down onto the pitch.               I then

               returned to the perimeter fencing and a s s is t ed to get other              persons

               out of the terraces.         I recall    that    I as     sted in carrying at least

               two bodies across the pitch to the gynynasium                   I am unable to give

               any descriptions of these persons.
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     S792C



        I am also sure that             I assisted to carry Paul Anthony HEWITSON into the

        gymnasium.     I originally thought that            I had returned to the Leppings

        Lane end of the ground,            picked HEWdTSON up and then carried him to the

C A T   gymnasium.     Having been shown d number of photographs todays date

vw/ru   *1«2 .9 0 . (0*10290) by WPS 7844 / P P L E T O N of the West Midlands Police
                                                  ----------          eODV
        now think that    I may have           picked HEWITSON up from the Spion Kop end of
        -—                      ' ' '      \

        the ground,   having       been tarried across the pitch by other       persons and

        then I carried him into the gymnasium.



        Once   inside the gymnasium,           which was being used as a temporary

        mortuary,    I remained with Paul Anthony HEWITSON and was            present when

        I wrote my collar number down on Paul ,MEWITS0N’s hand once we were in
                                              ------------------
        the gymnasium,    to assist with cont/i'nuity»            I also recall writing my

        HEWITSON in the gymnasium as /at the time I thought that I was going to

        be responsible for both persons.               I do not know the identification of

        the second body.           Shortly afterwards another officer assumed
  #
        responsibility for this person.

                 one of our mounted officers and myself which occurred at the Leppingi

                Lane       end of the Hillsborough Football Ground Sheffield.

                 I saw that PC                   w^ass leaning towards some supporters and talking to

                 them,        I then noticed thatNone of the supporters a youth in a red

                 cardigan was moving towards                    PC               .n an aggressive manner and I

                 thought he intended to injure PC                                 or his horse in some manner

                 I forced my way through the crowd and got hold of the youth in the
                                                                               PAGE!

                          red cardigan and pulled him away from
                                                            and PC

          He had obviously had a drink,     but was not drunk but was shouting and

          very excited.     I moved him to the side by which time he had calmed

          down and because of the situation I let him go.      PC         was trying

          his best   in the dense   crowd to try and get some control.    M Roberts

Dear Dick,
                                                      Emergency Lighting System

     I have arranged with              of Sandas Batteries to
carry out the first test on the emergency lighting battery set
on Thursday 21 November, starting at 1.30 p.m.
     Unfortunately I am away from the office that afternoon but
Tony Clough will attend in my absence.

                                                               Yours sincerely

Dear Mil,
                         Reft   Baergency Lifting System

Many thanks for your letter dated 22nd October.

Hy thoughts are that we should ask Sandas Batteries to undertake
two tests. One in private to ascertain the current capabilities
of the system and the second with the presence of the Fire Service,
having rectified any anomalies which awy have shown themselves
in 1|j# first test.

Beftore proceeding I would be obliged of your observations at your
earliest convtaidne© particularly in view of the termination of
B.S.T. this weekend.

Dear Dick,
                                            Emergency Lighting System
                                      of Sandas Batteries has been in touch with
us about the capability of the emergency lighting system.
     The 'Green Guide1 suggests that the system should be capable
of maintaining the necessary level of illumination for a period
of three hours. We feel that this is far too onerous and we have
been lead to believe by the Fire Service that they would be
prepared to accept one hour. In fact, if I recall correctly
the period agreed with S.Y.C.C. at the time your Certificate
was prepared was for 40 minutes until the batteries need replacing
after which a longer period would be provided.
     We understand that you   may ask Sandas to run a test                                                      onthe
batteries in which case the Fire Officer                                               has asked that he be
notified of the date so that he may be present during the test.
Perhaps you would keep us informed of progress so that we can
tell Fire Officer              when the test is to be.


                                                                         Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
                             Batteries for Emergency Lighting System
      Thank you for your letter of 5 March with the photo-copy
of the report and quotation from Chloride Security Systems.
      We designed the extensions to the emergency lighting
system which had to be installed at the time the ground received
its first safety certificate and at that time had to assess the
appropriateness of the batteries.   We carried out tests with the
Fire Brigade in attendance on a very dark night to ensure that
the lighting intensity did not fall off within half an hour
of the emergency lights coming into operation.   The batteries
performed better than expected and there was no doubt at all
at that time that they were adequate.   We reported that in view
of their age it was to be expected that within five years or
so, the batteries would be so near to the end of their useful
life that they would have to be either replaced or an alternative
source of power provided.
      It now appears that the batteries are still performing
well and as only two cells (including the present one) have had
to be replaced in five years, I see no reason to consider
replacing the system for the time being.

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




      When the batteries do eventually reach the end of
their lives, we shall almost certainly be recommending that
they be replaced by a diesel generator set. You may recall
that we installed a diesel set at Bramall Lane and the cost
was very much below the cost of a battery set.   Maintenance
costs are also likely to be lower over the years with a diesel
generator. The diesel engine will be run so infrequently
that it should virtually never wear out.
      When the time comes to install the diesel set, you
might consider having an oversized generator to cope with
any other emergency load, either to keep your offices supplied
during a power cut or a strike or even to provide power for
floodlighting.   We can discuss the matter again when the
batteries finally become uneconomic to maintain.


                           Yours sincerely,
                          xxxxxx

                Dear Sirs,

                RE:       AGREEMENT 20907/0001

                Please find attached your battery inspection report for Sheffield
                Wednesday Football Club.

                Our engineer has reported that cell number 21 is faulty and requires
                replacement of which I attach a quotation for its replacement.

                However, I must point out that our engineer has also reported that
                your charging/control gear is of an obsolete design for which replacements
                can no longer be obtained and that your battery is now over 30 years
                old and future life is limited. I have therefore forwarded a copy
                of this report to our Sales Office who will contact you shortly.

                Yours faithfully,
                For and on behalf of,
                CHT.ORTDR SECURITY SYSTEMS.

            Dear         Sirs

            EMERGENCY                 LIGHTING                SYSTEM

            F o llowing the visit of our Service Engineer in January 1985                                                                    and
            the subsequent visit of our Regional Sales Engineer,
                    regarding the above system, we confirm the following
            points

            Although the equipment has been well main t a i n e d for over 30
            years the cells are near the end of their useful life, as severe
            distortion, growth and sealing is evident.

            Direct replacement spares are no longer                                          available for the
            charger and control equipment, although                                          it is o p erating s a t i s f a c t ­
            ory at the moment.

            Accordingly, we have pleasure in enclosing our quotation for
            replacement charger and control gear, and the supply of 20 new
            cells at this stage so that the worst cells can be removed.

            Please note that the prices quoted are valid for 30 days.  The
            prices are likely to increase after this date due to increases
            already announced by the battery manufacturers.  Orders placed
            within the validy period for delivery within the quoted delivery
            period will be at current prices.

            Should you decide to replace the complete system (apart from one
            e xisting cell) we shall be pleased to arrange an additional
            quotation.
            We trust that the above                                         arrangement is satisfactory and should
            you r e q uire any further                                      i n formation, p l ease do not hesitate to
            contact                                                         on                 or this office

             CENTRAL SYSTEM COMPONENT SPECIFICATION
Cubicle                          Fabricated from 1,6mm sheet steel in a range of standard sizes. The
                                 cubicles are finished with acid and alkaline resistant grey textured coating
                                 to BS 318C: Shade 631. Protection is provided to IP22 of BS 5420.

Charger                          Solid state constant voltage type incorporating a self-protecting current
                                 limiting feature for protection against low battery volts and short circuit.
                                 Reverse battery protection is also included.
                                 Standard systems chargers are designed to fully recharge the battery
                                 within 24 hours following a rated discharge.
                                 Charger output voltage is controlled to a tolerance of ±2% irrespective of
                                 AC input variations of ± 10% and load requirements of 0% to 100%.
                                 Constant voltage charging minimises the need for topping up the battery.
                                 Maximum charger ripple of 2% RMS of the DC nominal voltage helps to
                                 protect the battery plates.

Contactors                       Adequately rated for changeover of maximum load output and designed
                                 for a starting surge of up to ten times full load current to cater for tungsten
                                 or 10W voltage fluorescent loads. The control coil supply is interrupted by
                                 a connection link to facilitate the use of remote sub-circuit or phase
                                 monitors or test switch. In order to meet certain legislative requirements
                                 or the need for frequent testing, alternative contactors to comply with BS
                                 764 can be supplied.

Maintained Circuits             The AC maintained output provided by an isolation transformer is
                                engineered to enable a zero to full load regulation of better than 5%.
                                Input to the transformer is interrupted by a connection link to enable
                                night-watchman switching of the maintained lighting without affecting the
                                non-maintained function of the system.
                                Input tappings are provided to optimise output according to local
                                supplies.

Fusing                          HRC fuses protect the AC supply to the charger, contactor coil and
                                maintained transformer.
                                HRC cartridge DC output fuses are matched to load requirements.

Controls and Instrumentation    ON/OFF switch, float and boost charge indicator lamps on front panel
                                with internally mounted float/boost switch.
                                A voltmeter is fitted to all floor standing units to enable monitoring of
                                system condition.

Dear Sir,
         Following the visit of                 of Alcad batteries to inspect
your emergency lighting system, we have been asked to report on his findings and
recommend a course of action.
          The system was found to be very old and in poor condition, and it is
 doubtful that the battery will sustain the emergency lighting load for the
 required duration. A new battery will be required to correct this situation, and
 in view of the age of the charger, and the advance in technogy since its manufacture,
 a complete new system is advised. Oar Quotation for such a system is as follows:-

 1 off      Battery charger unit suitable for a 240v battery on emergency lighting duty
            Input 240v lph 50HZ. Output 268v float,288v or J20v boost (dependant on
            battery) at a current of 20A max. The unit will be fitted with input and
            float / boost switches, input, output, and battery fuses, mains on lamp,
            voltmeter and ammeter, and a BS 764 changeover contactor.
                                                Price ex works            £1668.00

            A suitable battery for the above in long life Plante' cells, similar to
            the existing battery, will be 120 cells type SQL 1 7. This will give a
            57 amp standby supply for a period of 3 hours, and an expected life of
            25 years.
                                                Price per cell________ £106.34
                                                Total price             £ 12 , 760.80
         An alternative battery of 40 low maintenance 6v Monoblocs type 6 FMF 200
         will provide a 53 amp standby supply for a period of 3 hours, and an
         expected life of up to 15 years.

          S6 1SW.

          For the attention of Mr. R.H. Chester.

          Dear Sirs,

               Further to your enquiry of 6th September 1985, to Varta, Limited, and
          their reply of 13th September 1985, we have visited your address and exam­
          ined the present Battery and Charger.

               We can confirm that the battery is well beyond its useful working
          life, and the capacity available in an emergency would be very limited.
          Two cells have previously failed and been replaced. The battery charger
          is of similar age and must be considered to be unreliable. We therefore
          quote for a complete replacement of both battery and charger as follows,
          based on an equivalent battery capacity to that currently installed with
          a 3 hour emergency discharge period, and an automatically self regulating
          battery charger.

               It is brought to your attention however that the type of battery
          originally fitted is obsolescent and has been superceded by "improved
          designs" - which do not have a*equivalent life expectancy. Furthermore
          the "improved designs" are currently experiencing some considerable
          trouble causing cracking of cell cases, after only a few years service.

               With this in mind, we offer a battery of the Varta lead acid type
          with selenium lead alloy, which has a life expectancy of some 15 years,
          with a much reduced maintenance level. Many of these batteries only
          require topping up every 2/3 years when operated with an approved charger
          such as we offer, and the special all shrouded insulator clean top design
          is much safer to maintain and keep clean.

                  Therefore we offer

          ENSURALITE UNIT.               TYPE: 240NM3/13000/Vb.

          This is a Non-Maintained arrangement, where the load is only supplied by
          the battery when the mains input supply to the system fails.

         The battery capacity is sufficient to supply the maximum total rated load
         of 13 KW watts at nominal 240 volts DC for a period of 3 hours to a final
         voltage of 220 volts at the output terminals.

                                                                                   Contd         /I.
ENSURA     SYSTEMS LTD                                               CONTINUATION
                                                                           U



  INPUT.

  The unit is designed to operate from an input of 200/240 volts, 50Hz 1 phase.
  (See Options).

  CHARGER.

  The Charger is of the automatic two rate type, switching automatically from
  normal Trickle Charge to Quick Charge rate as required by battery condition.
  After a rated discharge, the battery would be recharged within the 24 hour
  period required by BS. 5266.

  The automatic control incorporates a boost inhibit circuit to prevent over­
  load of the charger if the battery has been allowed to become exhaustively
  discharged beyond its rated limits. The Charger is designed to minimise
  gas evolution from the battery and thus to prolong the intervals between
  servicing requirements.

  Reftifiers are full wave, bridge connected, amply rated.

  All transformers are continuously rated, double wound vacuum impregnated
  with earth screen between Primary and Secondary windings, and are air
  naturally cooled.

  Fuses are H.R.C. Cartridge type to BS.88.
  Mains input - Single Pole:
  DC output - Double Pole:

  The Charger is housed in the upper portion of the cubicle, and incorporates
  visual colour coded indication of Mains input healthy, and Trickle or Boost
  Charge operating.

  CONTACTOR.

  The changeover contactor will comply with BS. 5424/Part.I.

  BATTERY.

  The battery is of the minimum Maintenance, Flat Plate Lead/Acid type, with
  Antimony free plates, giving a life expectancy of 15 years, and extended
  periods between topping up, of up to three years. Fully shrouded connectors
  ensure freedom from accidental short circuits during maintenance, and minimise
  corrosion of the connectors.

  The battery comprises 120 cells having a rated capacity of 200 ampere-hours
  at the 3 hour rate.

  They would be accommodated on seperate steel stands in a 3 row 2 tier
  arrangement.

  Dimensions:            3600 mm L x 800 mm D x 1300 mm H.

  CUBICLE.

  The free standing cubicle is of substantial gauge sheet steel, purpose
  built in our factory, and with an attractive and highly durable Buttermilk/
  Bitter Chocolate gloss enamel finish.

  Adequate ventilation is incorporated and access is provided to the Charger
  controls by a lockable top hinged door.

    Major components are housed in the lower portion with access via a removable
    front panel. All internal connections and fuses are located at the front
    of the panel for easy connection and 3 x 20 mm cable holes are provided
    at the top rear of each side panel.

    Ample size terminations are provided with outgoing ways fused at 60 amps.

    CUBICLE DIMENSIONS.

    680 mm W x 460 mm D x 1705 mm H.

    GENERAL.

    The complete equipment is designed, manufactured and tested in compliance
    with ICEL 1001/1978 (Industry Standard for the Manufacture of Emergency

Dear Bill,

I note that an additional gate hf$ been installed in the perimeter fence
in front of the Kop by Gleesons.

Could you please advise on cost and confirmation of approval for work to
be commenced. I recollect our discussions regarding the necessity and
urgency, but I do not recollect approval of price.

I have, incidentally, had a visit from Tinsley Wire who have a "new
Proposal" and requested the use of Hillsborough as a showpiece for their
project.

Yours sincerely,



R. H. Chester,
Secretary.

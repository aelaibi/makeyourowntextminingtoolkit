Dear Lord Taylor

     Thank you for your letter of the 19th July about my sermon on the
Hillsborough disaster. Please feel free to quote from it in your
Report.

     I wish you well in what must be an exceedingly difficult task.

                                    Yours sincerely

                                              /

The Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor

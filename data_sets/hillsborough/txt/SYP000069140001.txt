         A       couple       of             bodies            were         then       placed          on    the        sage       of t h &     field          in

         was       wearing                   a    light         grey        suit       was       lying        on    his        back,       he    was       receiving

         heart       massage                      on     the        pitch        from       another           man,        about        the      same       age

         wearing             glasses                   and      a    beige        suit,,          After          what        seemed        ari a g e       he       stopped

         the       heart           massage                   arm     covered           the       mans       face        with       handkerchiefAt

         this       point                I became               very        u p s e t , realising                  that       the     man       had       obviously

         tiled      in       front                of     me.,        1 was        horrified             and        stunned.

         I was        no      longer                   interested                in    the       gama       my     only        concern          was       to    contact

         my      wife       and              inform           her      of    my       well       being.,

         1 eventually                            did     that        and      returned            to    the        stand       and        offered          my

         services             to             a     police           officer            as    I had          been        t r a i n e d in      first        aicu

         Policemen                 were            crying            or     just       sitting          or       standing            in a d a z s , 1 s h o u t e d

           I could          not      believe        that       such      a    disaster         could        happen.            I was      at    tne

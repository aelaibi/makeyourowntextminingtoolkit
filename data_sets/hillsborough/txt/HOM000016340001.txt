I am writing on Lord Justice Taylor's behalf to thank you for
your letter of 3 May with further documents relating to the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.  I will show these to Lord Justice
Taylor straightaway.

As you know, the public hearings begin in Sheffield Town Hall on
15 M a y . Could I suggest that you send any further documents for
Lord Justice Taylor to the London address above.    They will then
be sent on to him in Sheffield.    We can be contacted by telephone
in Sheffield via the Chief Executive's office on 0742 734132 if
any urgent points arise.

Lord Justice Taylor,
c/o Secretary to the Inquiry,
Home Office,
50, Queen Anne's Gate,
London SW1H 9AT




I enclose further documents relating to the Hillsborough disaster
for you consider as part of your Inquiry.

They show that someone was concerned at the use of Hillsborough
for large marches several years ago, and among his comments were
reservations about the policing and marshalling.

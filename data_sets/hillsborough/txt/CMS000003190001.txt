LEAD DEPARTMENT FOR DISASTERS IN SPORTS GROUNDS

Thank you for your further minute of 21 July.

2.   Ms Reynolds' minute of 22 July recorded that Mr Phillips was
now content with what you proposed.       I am likewise content,
subject to the assurances you have given that taking over this
lead responsibility will not result in any additional costs for
the Department.   I confess to some continuing scepticism on this
score, but am happy to accept the assurances from you and Miss
MacLean that we would be able to cope with the manning, etc.
implications of any such disasters using the arrangements we
already have in place and within current resources.

            About 2.40          pm    (1440)       with      complete       unit      (Serial          HO)   to    rear, of

            L e p p i n g s Lane      t u r n s t i l es   I went to t u r n s t i l e s adjacent                 to B gate.

            On    roof of these            t u r n s t i l e s was    Inspector B e n n e t t , he was a s s i s t i n g

            L i v erpool       supporters          climbing        into the         ground from L e p p i n g s          Lane.         PC

            Gee       climbed onto a bunker and helped                          supporters             from the      roof     into the

            ground,           1 looked t hr ou gh one of these                      t u rnstiles         and saw the area

            outside was            •solid"       w ith     people.

            I then went to 'A' gate,                       the sliding          conce r t i n a gates             providing

            access        from L e p p i n g s Lane          to the     rear of the N o r t h Stand.                   Again

            t h r o u g h the      turnstiles          I saw the a rea            in L e p p i n g s L a n e , outs i d e       the

            N o r t h S tand       t u r n s t i l e s was    "solid*       with      people.           Supporters       e n t ering

            the       ground through           these       turnstiles         were         c omplaining       of being        crushed

            whilst        queuing.         Typical         comments       to me and other                officers were

            "It's       r idiculous        £14 for         this."       " S o m e o n e ’s going         to get      k i l l e d out

            there."           I was a p p r o a c h e d by a portly mi d d l e aged w o m a n in a red coat

            who       had just       e n t e r e d thro u g h one       of the N o r t h S tand turnstiles.                       She

            was a ng ry and d e m a n d e d that               gates      be opened allow i n g               supporters        into

            the ground to prevent                    them being         injured.             She a p p r o a c h e d other

            O f f i c e r s and made         similar         comments.

            Some       supporters were             openly abus i v e          to my s e l f      ancj— nt.h« r officers.

The    smell      of    i ntox i cants       pervaded the area around                      the turn s t i l e s

which     bustled w i t h s u p p o r t e r s , having             just        passed t h r o u g h the

turnstlies.

Many supporters              passing       through the t u r n s t i l e s a p p e a r e d           to be

suffering         from the effects               of being       crushed.          They were          out    of breath

some we re doubled              over,      holding        their    ribs and          pausing       before moving

on to the stand              itself.

It a p p e a r e d     to me    there was a real              risk     of serious           or even fatal

injury being            caused      to someone        p a r i t c u l a r l y a child,         in the       crush

outside      the       turnstiles.

S u pp or te rs      outside       the    turnstiles a p p e a r e d           to be pushing against                  the

c o ncert ina gate           it a p p e ar ed    to be being           kicked from the               other      side

and    people a p p e a r e d to be banging on                    it w i t h their          fists,         I recall

seeing     the       bottom of the          gate moving           s l i g h t l y backwards and            forwards,,

I a p p ro ac he d PS        1066 Higg ins and spoke w i t h him about                            open i n g    the

gate    to relieve           crowd pressure.               He told me          he was       trying      to get

perm i s s i o n from        control       to do so.         Most      of my serial            and anot h e r

serial     were a rr a n g e d       in two      lines      bo r d e r i n g   the    path from the gates

into    the stand area.                  I was   on the      tur n s t i l e     side      nearest      the     gate.

PS Higgins           told    the    g a t © m a n , who    1 knew to be Jack Stone,                     to open the

gate.      He a p p ea re d hesitant and seemed to take                              his    time.      Realising

the    potential        s i t u a t io n outside          I m o v e d f o r w a r d to open the gate

myself,, As          I did so S tone          began to open            the      right      side    of the gates.

As viewed wit h ones                back    to the P e n i s t o n e      Road,       the    crowd      pressure

se e m e d to make          the gate difficult              to move        but    I saw hands from

outside      pull      it open and s u pporters                began to surge               through.           The    left

side of the gate was                 opened fully           by s u p p o r t e r s w i t h i n a few seconds.

About 500 s u p p o rt er s          passed t hr o u g h the           gates      into the g r o u n d and

towards      the N or t h S t a n d        in a very short             time after w h i c h the                pressure

a b a te d and the gates             were    closed.         I went       outside w i t h PS H i g g i n s and


                                                                                                  PctziI

the    rest of my serial.                 O utside     this      gate were      now about       15-20

s u pporters       s t a nding     close       together.         I saw a middle a g e d m a n who was

leaning agai n s t             the back of this g ro u p and was                pushing.        I went       to

him and told him to stop pushing.                           He    said:    " I ’m not    pushing."

1 pushed my arm b et w e e n his                 chest and the           person      in front     of him and

p hy s i c a l l y m o v e d    him back away from the               group and saids          "You are

pushi n g ."

He saids          "Yeah        I know    I ’m sorry."

I d i r ected him to one                of the tur n s t i l e     queues.        At this    time      I could

only see a few h un d r e d              people      at the L e p p i n g s Lane t u r n s t i l e s   and all

seemed quiet and orderly.

1 had been outside                the ground         for only a minute or so w h e n               I   heard a

radio message            i n s t r ucting all        available       serials to go to the

perimeter         track.

W i t h my serial         I w ent       into    the gr o u n d    thro u g h   *A*    gate and      ran to the

N o r t h S tand and made my way onto                   the      pitch via the first            gangway        from

the L e p pings Lane             end of that stand.

I saw a number of Liv e r p o o l                s upporters       were    on the      perimeter       track       in

front     of    the West S ta nd terraces.                  I formed       part of a 1 ine of Police

Officers       on the          pitch facing       towards        the West S t a n d , at this          stage       I

had no      reason to believe               this was any other             than a pitch         invasion          or

a Public. Order           situation.            I d i r e c t e d some    of the L i v erpool

s upporters        to the        north    pen of the West S t a n d terraces                 w h i c h had

space a vailable.                Some    of these      fans      compl a i n e d of being       crushed and

were    holdi ng their            ribs.        Supporters        appeared      to be still        coming       onto

the    pitch from the West S ta n d                 in the a r e a of the            goal.

1 went      to the track           to the       right of the         goal and saw a m a n           laid

m ot io nl es s    on his        back    his    face was      purple wit h        colour.       2 or 3

officers       were      in the     terrace making            there way to this man.

S up po rt er s    on that        terrace a p p e a r e d a n g r y , were        s h o uting and      seemed

                                                                                                If c i l t i

aggressive          to the officers.                There were man y other                  o f f icers       in the

immediate a rea and                I returned           to my serial.           Since       the       radio message

directing          serials       onto the track,                 I had not       received any other                  radio

me s s ag es      a l t h ou gh there was a high                 level   of    crowd noise.

After a short while                 I recall        seeing       several       people       laid out          near    the

goal     Police      O f f i c e r s and supporters wer e wit h them.                           About        this time

an a m bulance a rr i v e d along               the      perimeter       track.          I h eard the          sound of

o b j e c t s , probably         coins      hitting       the ambulance.

Still     u naware        of    the serious             nature    of what was taking                  place I

rejoined my serial                w hi ch    had        fallen    back          towards the           halfway        line, I

saw there was             still     intense a c t i v i t y a r o u n d        the goal area.                 it now

became apparent                to me    that    there was a serious                 problem at            the West

Stand,         PS Higg i n s      i n stru cted our          serial      to make         out    over      there      to

a s s is t „

Near     to the goal            1 saw about 9 persons                laid out,           most     on their         backs,

some    had jumpers             pulled up over            their     heads.        M o u t h to m o u t h and

heart m as s a g e was           being given to some                by police         officers          and

supporters.                                                                          )

I went      to one        person who was                laid o u t , a          man was sat           near    to     him/her

the    person was          b r ea th in g and           had a stong             pulse. Some           supporters

a p p e a r e d w ith a t racks i de advert                 board.       We    placed the             person on       it

and they were             carried away by the supporters.                           I recall          PC B i l l i n g s

and    I helped          put several a p p a r e n t l y         dead bodies          on advert           boards      who

were    then       carried awa y          by supporters.             I also       recall        helping        some

injured,          though       c o nscious     s u pporters a w a y from the                perimeter          fence on

the    pitch.        A ga in the smell             of    intoxi c a n t s     pervaded.

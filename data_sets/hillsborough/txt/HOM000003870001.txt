                               S'
               Dear tygtdam,

               ATTENDANCE CENTRES - INQUIRY INTO THE
               HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

               With reference to the proposals for 'Other Possible
               Measures Against Hooligans', I make the following
               observation:

               Enforcing Exclusion Orders by Attendance Centre Orders

               Under the present structures of Attendance Centres this
               proposal is impracticable for the following reasons:

               a) Attendance Centres are not always open on the days when
                  matches are played, particularly the local home matches.

               b) The follow-up enquiries required for non-attendance
                  at the Attendance Centres on a day when there is a local
                  home football match puts an unnecessary burden on an
                  already stretched Police Force.

               c) Mid-week matches and Sunday fixtures could not be
                  covered.


               Yours faithfully,




               Officer in Charge




               Mrs. M. SADLER,
               C1 Division,
               Home Office,
               Queen Anne's Gate,
               London,
               SW1H 9AT.

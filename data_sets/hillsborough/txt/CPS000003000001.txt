       Stuart-Smith’s report is due to be submitted in the week of the 19 January.

2.    It appears there is nothing to suggest that the basis on which the decisions about
       criminal proceedings were taken was inappropriate and that there are no new grounds
       for criminal investigation.

3.    There will need to be liaison with the Press Office and the Home Office and with the
      Legal Secretariat on press lines to take when we have seen the actual report. I shall
      be grateful if M r Croston and Mrs Salisbury could liaise on this.

HILLSBOROUGH


This is to give you advance warning that we expect Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to
submit his report on Hillsborough during the week beginning 19 January, or soon
after.

We understand that his report will be a very substantial document - over 60,000
words plus substantial annexes - covering in considerable detail all the allegations
about ‘new’ evidence which have been put to him during the course of his scrutiny.

In relation to the coroner's proceedings, we understand that he will conclude that
they were properly conducted, and that the submissions which he has received
about medical evidence do not call into question the decision of the coroner in
relation to the 3.15pm cut off point. He will also conclude that he has not seen any
evidence which might suggest that an application under section 13 of the Coroners
Act would stand any chance of success. He will, however, be making some general
comment about the difficulties of carrying out an inquest after a major incident which
has already been subject to an inquiry. He intends to endorse the recommendation
made by the Home Office Working Group on disasters and inquests that the role of
the coroner in such circumstances should be very limited.

In relation to criminal proceedings, we expect him to conclude that he has seen
nothing to suggest that the previous basis on which the DPP took decisions about
criminal proceedings was inappropriate and nothing to suggest any new grounds for
criminal investigation.

The one area in his report which may raise questions about possible further action or
investigation is likely to be the process by which South Yorkshire Police officers’
statements were submitted to the Taylor Inquiry. Over 400 officers’ statements were *


f:\oppu\hou\miscNpp0505pd.doc
vetted by the force's solicitors before submission to the inquiry, and in a significant
number of cases sections of the original statements were deleted before they were
submitted to the inquiry. We understand that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considers
that in most cases the deletions were not inappropriate as they concerned matters of
personal opinion; but in some cases his view is that factual material was
inappropriately removed. We do not yet know to what extent he will make adverse
comment about those within the force who were responsible for this process and
therefore the extent to which any question of disciplinary matters might arise.

I expect that the Home Secretary will wish to publish the report and make an oral
statement reasonably soon after he receives it, and that he will want to agree the
terms of his response with the Attorney. I will ensure that you receive a copy of the
report as soon as we get it. We will then need to discuss its handling.

I am copying this letter to John Ringguth at CPS headquarters and to Robert Clifford
in the Coroners Unit here.

DRAFT:              26 JUNE 1997



DRAFT ORAL STATEMENT FOR THE HOME SECRETARY




With permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


2.        96 people lost their     lives asa result of the Hillsborough disaster which
happened on 15 April 1989. That was more than eight years ago but no one who
saw the news reports on that dreadful Saturday will have forgotten those terrible
events. For those who lost loved members of their family, the pain is ever-present.
Following Hillsborough, members of this House were united in our determination to
do all in our power to prevent anything like that ever happening again.


(i)       Public inquiry


3.        Madam Speaker, following the       Hillsborough disaster a number of inquiries
and investigations took place, looking at aspects of the tragedy. Perhaps the most
thorough and wide-ranging was the Public Inquiry led by Lord Taylor. The terms of
reference of that Inquiry encompassed not only inquiring into the events but also
making recommendations about crowd control and safety at sports events.


4.        Lord Taylor’s inquiry took oral evidence from over 170 witnesses at public
hearings during May and June 1989 and considered many hours of video evidence
from different sources. In his interim report in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that
the disaster had a number of causes. He did not attribute all the blame to a single
cause or person, but in paragraph 278 he made clear that:


           “The main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control"




f:\0ppu\hou\drafts\ppO232pd.doc
' k     k u \                     H f iO f t

5. ^        Lord Taylor made 43 immediate recommendations. His final report in January
1990 made a further 76 recommendations. The developments which have taken
place since then in safety at football grounds and in the policing of football matches
have been based largely on those recommendations. Football in this country has
been transformed since the Taylor Report. To a large extent that is due to his wide-
reaching and soundly based conclusions.


(ii)      Coroner’s Inquest


6.        The deaths which occurred on 15 April 1989 were the subject of inquests
conducted by the Coroner of the western district of South Yorkshire.


7.         Madam Speaker, as hon Members will know, an inquest is a fact-finding
inquiry, conducted by a Coroner in front of a jury, and aimed at establishing the
answers to four important questions, namely:


           The identity of the deceased


           The place of death


           The time and the date of death and


            How the deceased came by his or her death.


8.        The Coroner’s rules require proceedings and evidence to be directed solely at
finding answers to those questions.


9.        The jury at the Coroner’s inquest after examining     the evidence, found in
March 1991 that the cause of death of those who died at Hillsborough was
accidental death.




f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pd.doc
 (>>>)       West Midlands Police Investigation


 10.         A further investigation was         conducted by the West Midlands        Police,
 supervised by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any
 grounds for criminal proceedings and to consider whether any police officer should
 be subject to disciplinary proceedings.


 11.        That investigation involved the taking of over 5000 statements and the
 scrutiny of all thematerial which had previously been               examined by the Taylor
 Inquiry.        After that      investigation the evidence was sent to the Director of Public
 Prosecutions, who               concluded that no person should be subject to criminal
 proceedings.

                                                 Chick
 12.        The Police Complaints Authority (decideJ that the chief superintendent and
superintendent in charge on the day should face disciplinary charges for neglect of
duty. In the event, the chief superintendent retired due to ill health in advance of a
ruling by a disciplinary tribunal. A disciplinary hearing cannot proceed when a police
officer retires before the hearing takes place. The Police Complaints Authority later
decided that disciplinary proceedings against the superintendent should be
withdrawn because the retirement of the chief superintendent meant that what, in
effect, was a joint allegation of neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the
absence of the more senior officer.


(iv)        gfiDtinMed calls for further investigations


13.         Madam Speaker, hon Members will know that some of the families of those
who died were unhappy with the 4«w§et5T the inquest.                   They later applied for
judicial review of the coroner’s proceedings. During the judicial review proceedings
the conduct of the inquest was subjected to close and detailed examination.                In
November 1993 the Divisional Court ruled that none of the matters raised in the
judicial review proceedings justified intervention by the court in the verdict of the
inquest jury.

               the process would Ke vdr\


                14.        The events surrounding the disaster have therefore been subject to
               exceptionally thorough investigation on several occasions.                But concerns have
               remained about whether the full facts have yet emerged. I have met relatives of the
               Hillsborough victims whose suffering is exacerbated by their belief that there are
               unresolved issues which should be investigated further.


               15.         Representations were made to my predecessor and have been made to me,
               to the Attorney General and to the Director of Public Prosecutions.                A Granada
               television programme in December last year dramatised the disaster and raised a
               number of issues which, in the view of the programme makers, represented new
               evidence^ Since then further material has been submitted on behalf of the
               Hillst}0fough Family Support Group.                Those representations have related in
              o^rticular to video evidence of the disaster and medical evidence about the time of
      /       death of the victims.
T k       p o jf z o - o - u ,                  c k h a J ?   d J t

               16.        Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney General and the
              Crown Prosecution Service have considered very carefully all the evidence which
              has been put forward in recent months.


              1 M         I b9veyKbwe\^fxto teJJ/ffite H o u ^ lh a t I tetfeYiot s o ja r identified eyidenpe
              wfeflchlwouk/leaajne to W ic lu d e \H a t a neV^ublic in^trlry s h W fb e W ablK hed.
                               the Director of Public Prosecutions takes the/foview that the material so far
              presented to her would not justify fresh criminal investigations.                The/Attorney
              General also takes the view that, again on the material so far presented to him, any
              application to the High Court for a new inquest would not have any realistic prospect
              of succeeding.


              18.         Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families oj^bffte of those who
              died at Hillsborough and many others are very concerned that unresolved issues



              f:\oppu\hou\drafls\pp0232pd.doc
   remain.           I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure that no matter of
   significance is overlooked and that we do not reach a final conclusion without a full
   and independent examination of the evidence.


   19.         I can therefore tell the Ho^ ^ ^ ^ A J t o r ^ G              e &        he Director of
  Public Prosecutions and I have agreed tha^there should bean independent scrutiny
  to ascertain whether there now exists any new evidence relating to the disaster
  which was not previously available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a
  senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose.                    His full terms of
  reference are:



             To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
             Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


                         (a)     To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


                         (b)     To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General
                                 for the purpose of discharging their respective statutory
                                 responsibilities; or


                        (c)      To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to
                                 police disciplinary matters;


            And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available
            is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for
            the Home Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and
            (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them
            which may be relevant to their respective duties; and to advise whether there
            is any other action which should be taken in the public interest.


I am today placing a copy of these terms of reference in the Library.




f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pddoc
 20.          We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other
 evidence which has been submitted.                     He will also consider any further material
 which interested parties wish to submit.)-o k t f i ,


 21.         Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s task will be twofold. First to advise me whether
 any evidence not previously available is of such significance as to justify a further full
 public inquiry.                  His advice to me will be available to the House and the public.
 Secondly, he will identify for the Attorney General and the Director of Public
 Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence which
 might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.


                                                                                   u A ^ t k e r ^ V o l ''
22.          I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively tfefYio

material evidey ^ g ^ >uf ^ h^ 0gg^se|                          Hillsborough disaster has been
overlooked a n d t a k e action if it has.                 For the families of those who died at
Hillsborough the grief will never end. I hope that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s work
will help to allay some of their grief by removing any remaining doubts about the
circumstances in which their loved ones died so tragically.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWER SUMMARY


Following the Home Secretary’s announcement on Hillsborough given in the House of
Commons on the 1st July 1997, there were a number of members questions which were
answered as summarised below :-


1       Question:   Given the urgency (re families/police) what is the timetable and start
                    date of the enquiry?


        Answer:     Subject to a Court of Appeal case, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will
                    read papers before the end of July and will start the enquiry in
                    September.


        Question:   Will the Home Secretary publish all the evidence which Lord Justice
                    Stuart-Smith’s advice is based?


        Answer:     Will do best to so ensure, but some evidence cannot be published
                    at the same time as the advice.


3       Question:   Re further material, will it be examinable in public and can those
                    affected respond to it before the enquiry results are made known?


        Answer:     A response can be made but Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is to decide
                    procedure.


        Question:   Can Parliamentary Debate take place after Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
                    investigation?


         Answer:    The m atter of a debate will be discussed with the Shadow Home
                    Secretary.




MMS/350.97
Question:   Will all representations be allowed to the enquiry and will there be
            financial assistance for the Hillsborough Family Support Group?


Answer:     The costs of travel of witnesses will be met, the m atter of legal
            representation has not been discussed with the families?


Question:   Will the Home Secretary confirm that the re-opening of police
            disciplinary proceedings is unlikely?


Answer:     That is anticipating Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith’s enquiry, I will not
            do that.


Question:   Will Lord Justice Stuart-Smith consider in detail the lessons to be
            learnt re policing etc.


Answer:     I do not anticipate th at they can be, this is the scrutiny of new
            evidence only, there has been no criticism of the wider issues
            following the Taylor Enquiry.


Question:   The DPP has concluded that there will be no criminal prosecution, is
            Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to make clear what new evidence he is
            considering and why it was not available earlier?


Answer:     The DPP takes the above view, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith may
            come to a different view, this is not to criticise the CPS.


Question:   Will the Enquiry consider the Coroner’s Court Procedures and the
            fresh evidence that should have been seen being made available now?


Answer:     Comment made on the W orking Party Report to Coroner’s Courts
            and that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will look at the new allegations
            that were not before the Inquest, including time of deaths.


Question:   Will the Home Secretary undertake to consider re-examination of the
            Police Disciplinary Code re officers retiring medically unfit and thus
            avoiding disciplinary proceedings?
Answer:     Chief Constables are advised not to permit retirem ent on ill health
            to avoid disciplinary proceedings.


Question:   Assurance required that the Home Secretary will keep in mind the
            deep feelings of the families?


Answer:     Yes, the feelings were considered in coming to the decision
            reference the scrutiny.


Question:   If the matter goes to public enquiry, we are to consider wider issues?


Answer:     Comment made on there being a profound improvement in the fans
            behaviour since the Taylor Enquiry, but cannot estimate future
            term s of reference, this scrutiny concerns new evidence only.


Question:   Will Terms of Reference extend to past/future governmental support
            for families in their grief, and to consider the disgraceful allegations
            made by others?


Answer:     Terms of Reference are only re new evidence and Lord Justice
            Taylor dismissed those allegations made by newspapers, it was the
            failure of the police control that was the m ain reason for the
            incident.


Question:   Will new witnesses come forward?


Answer:     The Home Secretary appeals to these witnesses to come forward.


Question:   Will evidence be given on oath?


Answer:     No, but Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s representations will be
            considered on this point.


Question:   Will the Government pay the cost of the Enquiry and pay the costs of
            others?
        Answer:      The Cost of the Enquiry itself will be paid as well as witnesses
                     travel costs. There has been no call so far concerning Legal Aid.


17      Question:    Will the question of compensation be re-opened?


        Answer:      The m atter of compensation does not arise re this scrutiny.


18      Question:    Will the enquiry look at events after 15.15 hrs.


        Answer:      Yes.


The above is a brief summary only of the question and answer statement, and some questions
which were repetitive have been omitted.

     HILLSBOROUGH

     Although we have not corresponded personally in the past, may I take this opportunity I
     express my deepest sympathy for your tragic loss in the Hillsborough Disaster.

     On 7 January 1997 you wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service, asking that we seriously
     consider setting up a new enquiry into the tragic events at Hillsborough in 1989. The
     question whether there should be a new public enquiry is not one for the CPS but is a matter
     for the Home Secretary. I expect you have now heard the announcement that there is to be
     an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there exists any evidence which was not
     previously available relating to the Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
            Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

                     (a)   To the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

                     (b)   To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                            purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                     (c)   To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                            disciplinary matters;

            And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
            such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
            Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
            attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
            their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
            be taken in the public interest.
It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are
responsible for investigating offences and for deciding whether or not to charge or summons
an offender.

In recent months, senior lawyers within the CPS have examined large quantities of material
arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of considering this material was to
ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to start a criminal prosecution. If the
evidence was sufficient, the CPS would invite the police to conduct a further formal
investigation and prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges against named
individuals.

At this stage, the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far presented
does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute an independent scrutiny, the
CPS will consider the matter again when the outcome of that scrutiny is known. The CPS
will assist the independent scrutiny in whatever way it can and we will carefully examine its
findings before making any further decisions.

I hope that you will be encouraged by the announcement made, given that one of the express
purposes of the independent scrutiny is to consider whether there should be a further public
enquiry.

I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

Dear Mrs. McBrien,

RE:     HILLSBOROUGH

I have been asked by Miss Dru Sharpling to give a substantive response to your letter of the
30th July 1997.

I note that you have written to the Home Secretary with your comments on the Hillsborough
Disaster that took the lives of so many people, both young and old, including your son.

As you are already aware, an independent scrutiny is being set up with a Senior Judge, Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith presiding. He is to consider any new evidence which may have come
to light and was not available to the enquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor or to the
Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General or to South Yorkshire Police.
Following his report and any recommendations that he may make, the Crown Prosecution
Service will review the case again as necessary and consider whether or not there is sufficient
evidence to support a criminal prosecution of any person involved in the management of the
Hillsborough Ground on the 15th April 1989.

For my part, I will ensure that your letter to us, as with other letters received from grieving
relatives and concerned members of the public, will be brought to the attention of Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith.

When the results of the scrutiny are known and we have considered any new material put

MMS/431.97
before the Crown Prosecution Service, I shall write to you again.

In the meantime, if there is any matter which is not clear to you, please write to me at the
above address.



Yours sincerely,




Robin Booth
Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor

                                                    DRAFT



           RE:     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 1989


           Thank you for your recent correspondence and in particular the letter of 4th March 1997 and
           enclosures. I have now received a full report on the latest issues which you raise from the
           Chief Crown Prosecutor, Central Casework.


           You will be aware that there has been some contact between the Crown Prosecution Service,
           the Home Office and the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers. This is because the issues
           which you have raised affect not only the question of criminal liability, which is my
           responsibility, but also whether the enquiry should be re-opened, which is a matter for the
           Home Office, and further whether application should be made to the Divisional Court for the
           re-opening of the Inquest, which is a matter for the Attorney General. I should emphasise
           at the outset that although the three departments have been in contact in order to ensure that
           none of us miss a point which another may have noticed, each has viewed the evidence
           independently from its own point of view. My reply is on behalf of the Crown Prosecution
           Service and is concerned purely with the possibility of criminal offences having been
           committed. You should receive separate replies on behalf of the Home Secretary and the
           Attorney General respectively when each has reached his own independent conclusion on the
           aspect which concerns him.



           MMS/199.97
It may assist if I explain the role of the Crown Prosecution Service.         Usually a file is
submitted by the police and it is reviewed by a Crown Prosecutor. The case is carefully
considered to make sure that it meets the test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutor,
which is issued under Section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. The Crown
Prosecution Service applies to Code so that it can make fair and consistent decisions about
prosecutions.   There are two stages in the decision to prosecute.       The first stage is the
evidential test. The Crown Prosecutor must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to
provide a "realistic prospect of conviction".     He must consider objectively whether the
evidence can be used and is reliable. The Crown Prosecutor must also consider what the
defence case may be and how it is likely to affect the prosecution case. A "realistic prospect
of conviction" means that a jury or bench magistrates, properly directed in accordance with
the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged.


If the case does not pass the evidential test, it must not go ahead, no matter how important
or serious it may be. If the case does pass the evidential test, the Crown Prosecutor must
then consider the second stage test to decide if a prosecution is needed in the public interest.
In cases of any seriousness, the prosecution will usually take place, unless there are public
interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour.
The Crown Prosecution Service will only start or continue a prosecution when the case has
passed both tests.


In this instance, not only do we have the report made by the West Midlands Police following
their original enquiries, but we have also considered the material supplied by you and the
response is supplied to the Home Office as a result of their enquiries following your recent
letters and meetings with officials, which responses they have been good enough to copy to
the Crown Prosecution Service.


You have made allegations of criminal offences against police officers.            The Crown

MMS/199.97
Prosecution Service considers such allegations in the same way as it considers those involving
civilians. Applying the evidential sufficiency and public interest criteria set out in the Code
for Crown Prosecutors.


I regret that I am not able to discuss the evidence in detail. It is not my practice to go
further than to give a broad indication of the reasoning which underlies my decision. This
is a well established practice of successive Directors of Public Prosecutions.        I see no
distinction between a decision not to prosecute and a decision to prosecute. If I were to enter
into a discussion about one I would feel obliged to do so about the other.           This was
appreciated by the Phillips Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure, which recognised that
"the decision to prosecute or not, of its very nature, can involve the interests and reputation
of witnesses, of the victim and of the accused or suspect. Publicly calling into question a
decision not to prosecute could amount to a trial and the suspect would have the safeguards
which criminal proceedings are designed to provide".


However, the evidence made available to the original enquiry and inquest has been reviewed
and I am satisfied that there is no new reliable information contained in the material which
you have supplied. In particular, bearing in mind the wide publicity given to the videos
found in the Archives of Yorkshire Television, I should point out that copies of these tapes
were available to the Taylor enquiry. Even if the enquiry chose to rely upon other video
evidence, there are no grounds for believing that evidence was deliberately suppressed.


The matter having been given very careful consideration, I am satisfied that there is no new
evidence now available which would justify the re-opening of the police enquiry into any
alleged criminal offence.


I realise that you will be very disappointed by this decision. You obviously feel that the case
has never been satisfactorily resolved whether at the enquiry, the inquest, or by the way of

MMS/199.97
criminal proceedings. However, I would be abusing my position were I to ask the police to
make further enquiries and to re-open the case where there is no new material to justify such
a course of action. I am satisfied that there remains no realistic prospect of a conviction of
anyone for any criminal offence arising out of the Hillsborough disaster. Accordingly I have
ndfhad to consider the question of whether such proceedings would be in the public interest.


I have also given consideration to your request for a meeting with my officials. I understand
that you have already met with Home Office officials as previously stated. However, having
regard to the particular responsibilities of the Crown Prosecution Service in reviewing the
evidence, I do not believe that anything you could say in a meeting would assist the Crown
Prosecution Service in its decision making. Accordingly I think it would be unfair to invite
you to a meeting, which from your point of view would achieve nothing.


I have every sympathy with all of you who lost relatives in the disaster. Had it been possible
to offer you some crumb of comfort by suggesting that the matter could be re-opened, I
would have been more than happy to do so. However, on the evidence available that option
is not available to me.

     HILLSBOROUGH

     Although we have not corresponded personally in the past, may I take this opportunity I
     express my deepest sympathy for your tragic loss in the Hillsborough Disaster.

     On 7 January 1997 you wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service, asking that we seriously
     consider setting up a new enquiry into the tragic events at Hillsborough in 1989. The
     question whether there should be a new public enquiry is not one for the CPS but is a matter
     for the Home Secretary. I expect you have now heard the announcement that there is to be
     an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there exists any evidence which was not
     previously available relating to the Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
            Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

                    (a)    To the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

                    (b)    To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                            purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                     (c)   To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                            disciplinary matters;

            And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
            such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
            Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
            attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
            their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
            be taken in the public interest.
It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are
responsible for investigating offences and for deciding whether or not to charge or summons
an offender.

In recent months, senior lawyers within the CPS have examined large quantities of material
arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of considering this material was to
ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to start a criminal prosecution. If the
evidence was sufficient, the CPS would invite the police to conduct a further formal
investigation and prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges against named
individuals.

At this stage, the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far presented
does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute an independent scrutiny, the
CPS will consider the matter again when the outcome of that scrutiny is known. The CPS
will assist the independent scrutiny in whatever way it can and we will carefully examine its
findings before making any further decisions.

I hope that you will be encouraged by the announcement made, given that one of the express
purposes of the independent scrutiny is to consider whether there should be a further public
enquiry.

I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

 HILLSBOROUGH

 Although we have not corresponded personally in the past, may I take this opportunity to
 express my deepest sympathy for your tragic loss in the Hillsborough Disaster.

 On 9 January 1997 you wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills
 QC, enclosing a copy of a letter you had sent to the thea Home Secretary, Mr Howard. In
 the letter to Mr Howard, you asked that the tragic events at Hillsborough in 1989 be re­
 examined because of the many unanswered questions you feel are outstanding.

 As you will know, the Crown Prosecution Service has been considering very carefully papers
 and tapes in relation to the disaster. In addition, we examined material supplied by the
 Hillsborough Family Support Group.

I expect you have heard the announcement by the new Home Secretary that there is to be an
independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any evidence which was not
previously available relating to the Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

                  (a)    To the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

                  (b)    To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                         purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                  (c)    To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                         disciplinary matters;




                         Crown Prosecution Service * Working in the interests of justice
       And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
       such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
       Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
       attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
       their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
       be taken in the public interest.

It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are
responsible for investigating offences and for deciding whether or not to charge or summons
an offender.

In recent months, senior lawyers within the CPS have examined large quantities of material
arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of considering this material was to
ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to start a criminal prosecution. If the
evidence was sufficient, the CPS would invite the police to conduct a further formal
investigation and prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges against named
individuals.

At this stage, the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far presented
does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute an independent scrutiny, the
CPS will consider the matter again when the outcome of that scrutiny is known. The CPS
will assist the independent scrutiny in whatever way it Gan and we will carefully examine its
findings before making any further decisions.

I hope that you will be encouraged by the announcement made, given that one of the express
purposes of the independent scrutiny is to consider whether there should be a further public
enquiry.

I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

  HILLSBOROUGH

  Although we have not corresponded personally in the past, may I take this opportunity
  to express my deepest sympathy for your tragic loss in the Hillsborough Disaster.

  In January this year you wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills
  QC, asking her to seriously consider all aspects of ther Hillsborough inquests together with
  the issues brought to light by the Granada TV programme, to ensure that the truth is known.

  The CPS does not have the power to set up another inquest. As you will be aware, legal
  moves to require another inquest to be held did not succeed.

  The question whether there should be another public enquiry is a matter for the Home
  Secretary and not the Crown Prosecution Service. I expect, however, that you have heard
  the announcement by the Home Secretary that there is to be an independent scrutiny to
  ascertain whether there now exists any evidence which was not previously available relating
  to the Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

          To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough

        Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
        attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
        their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
        be taken in the public interest.

 It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
 help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
 responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
 England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are
 responsible for investigating offences and for deciding whether or not to charge or summons
 an offender.

 In recent months, senior lawyers within the CPS have examined large quantities of material
 arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of considering this material was to
 ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to start a criminal prosecution. If the
 evidence was sufficient, the CPS would invite the police to conduct a further formal
 investigation and prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges against named
 individuals.

 At this stage, the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far presented
 does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

 In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute an independent scrutiny, the
 CPS will consider the matter again when the outcome of that scrutiny is known. The CPS
 will assist the independent scrutiny in whatever way it.can and we will carefully examine its
 findings before making any further decisions.

 I hope that you will be encouraged by the announcement made, given that one of the express
 purposes of the independent scrutiny is to consider whether there should be a further public
 enquiry.

 I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

    HILLSBOROUGH

    Although we have not corresponded personally in the past, may I take the opportunity to
    express my deepest sympathy for your tragic loss in the Hillsborough Disaster.

    I am aware that you have been in contact with my colleague George Croston in York and I
    thought it appropriate to write to you to let you know the up to date position. As you know,
    the Crown Prosecution Service has been considering very carefully papers and tapes in
    relation to the disaster. In addition, we have examined the material supplied by you on behalf
    of the Hillsborough Family Support Group in your letter addressed to the Director of Public
    Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills QC, together with material supplied by Ms Adlington in
    her letter of 4 March 1997.

    I know you have heard the announcement by the Home Secretary that there is to be an
    independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any evidence which was not
    previously available relating to the Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
            Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

                    (a)    To the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

                     (b)   To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                           purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                     (c)   To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                           disciplinary matters;




                           Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests o f justice
       And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
       such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
       Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
       attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
       their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
       be taken in the public interest.

It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are
responsible for investigating offences and for deciding whether or not to charge or summons
an offender.

In recent months, senior lawyers within the CPS have examined large quantities of material
arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of considering this material was to
ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to start a criminal prosecution. If the
evidence was sufficient, the CPS would invite the police to conduct a further formal
investigation and prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges against named
individuals.

At this stage the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far presented
does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute an independent scrutiny, the
CPS will consider the matter again when the outcome of that scrutiny is known. I can assure
you that the CPS will assist the independent scrutiny--in- whatever way it can and we will
carefully examine its findings before making any further decisions.

There are two outstanding issues upon which you await a reply, they are:

       •       the request for a meeting (as mentioned in the opinion of Alun Jones QC dated
               3 March 1997); and

       •       a considered reply to your fax of 8 April 1997, enclosing your comments on
               the statement of South Yorkshire police dated 1 April 1997.

In relation to both of these, the Home Secretary’s announcement means that you can be
assured that there is to be an independent scrutiny to establish whether material not
previously considered might have an impact on decisions to be made, as well as whether
there should be a further public enquiry. I imagine you will be inviting those responsible for
the scrutiny to examine the material referred to by Alun Jones QC as well as your comments
in relation to the South Yorkshire police press statement of 1 April 1997. I think the proper
course would be for these issues to be considered by the independent scrutiny before any
meeting is held with the CPS. I am particularly anxious to avoid any suggestion or
impression that the CPS has in any way pre-judged the outcome of the independent scrutiny.
I am sure you will appreciate the importance of ensuring that everything is done properly and
in the right order. I will write to you again when the outcome of the scrutiny is known.
I have sent a letter similar to this one to Ms Adlington.

I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

  HILLSBOROUGH

  In January 1997 you wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills QC,
  asking that the tragic events at Hillsborough in 1989 be re-examined so that people
  responsible can be brought to justice and to ensure that nothing similar ever happens again.

  Although we have not corresponded personally in the past, may I take this opportunity to
  express my deepest sympathy for your tragic loss in the Hillsborough Disaster.
                                                                  .«*■ m.

  HILLSBOROUGH

  Although we have not corresponded personally in the past, may I take this opportunity to
  express my deepest sympathy for your tragic loss in the Hillsborough Disaster.

     On 16 December 1996 you wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills
     Q C , ask in g that criminal proceedings be commenced 6 n~the grounds that the statement of
     Roger Houldsworth contains allegations that material evidence was destroyed or concealed.

     As you know the Crown Prosecution Service has been considering very carefully papers and
     tapes in relation to the disaster. In addition, we examined some material supplied by the
     Hillsborough Family Support Group.

     I expect you have heard the announcement by the Home Secretary that there is to be an
     independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any evidence which was not
     previously available relating to the Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
            Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

                    (a)    To the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

                     (b)   To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                           purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                     (c)   To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                            disciplinary matters;




                           Crown Prosecution Service * Working in the interests o f justice
       And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
       such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
       Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
       attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
       their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
       be taken in the public interest.

It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are
responsible for investigating offences and for deciding whether or not to charge or summons
an offender.

In recent months, senior lawyers within the CPS have examined large quantities of material
arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of considering this material was to
ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to start a criminal prosecution. If the
evidence was sufficient, the CPS would invite the police to conduct a further formal
investigation and prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges against named
individuals.

At this stage, the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far presented
does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute an independent scrutiny, the
CPS will consider the matter again when the outcome of that scrutiny is known. The CPS
will assist the independent scrutiny in whatever way it ean and we will carefully examine its
findings before making any further decisions.

I hope that you will be encouraged by the announcement made, given that one of the express
purposes of the independent scrutiny is to consider whether there should be a further public
enquiry.

I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

  HILLSBOROUGH

  I am aware that you have been in contact with my colleague George Croston in York and I
  thought it appropriate to write to you to let you know the up to date position. As you know,
  the Crown Prosecution Service has been considering very carefully papers and tapes in
  relation to the disaster. In addition, we have examined the material supplied on behalf of the
  Hillsborough Family Support Group by Mr Hicks in his letter addressed to the Director of
  Public Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills QC, together with the material you supplied in
  your letter of 4 March 1997.

  You will have heard the announcement by the Home Secretary that there is to be an
  independent' scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any evidence which was not
  previously available relating to the Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

           To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
           Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

                    (a)   To the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

                    (b)   To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                          purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                    (c)   To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                           disciplinary matters;

            And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
            such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
            Department of a further Public Inquiry ; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
            attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to




                          Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests o f justice
       their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
       be taken in the public interest.

It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are
responsible for investigating offences and for deciding whether or not to charge or summons
an offender.

In recent months, senior lawyers within the CPS have examined large quantities of material
arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of considering this material was to
ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to start a criminal prosecution. If the
evidence was sufficient, the CPS would invite the police to conduct a further formal
investigation and prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges against named
individuals.

At this stage, the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far presented
does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute an independent scrutiny, the
CPS will consider the matter again when the outcome of that scrutiny is known. The CPS
will assist the independent scrutiny in whatever way it can and we will carefully examine its
findings before making any further decisions.

I am aware that there are several outstanding issues from your perspective:

       •      Your requests for a meeting;

       •      A considered reply to your correspondence, in particular your letters of 4
              March 1997 and 7 April 1997;

       •      An indication of when the Director of Public Prosecutions will announce the
              decision in this matter.

In relation to all of these, the Home Secretary’s announcement means that you can be assured
that there is to be an independent scrutiny to establish whether material not previously
considered might have an impact on decisions to be made, as well as whether there should
be a further public enquiry. I imagine you will be inviting those responsible for the scrutiny
to examine the material referred to by Alun Jones QC as well as your comments in relation
to the South Yorkshire police press statement of 1 April 1997. I think the proper course
would be for these issues to be considered by the independent scrutiny before any meeting
is held with the CPS. I am particularly anxious to avoid any suggestion or impression that
the CPS has in any way pre-judged the outcome of the independent scrutiny. I am sure you
will appreciate the importance of ensuring that everything is done properly and in the right
order. I will write to you again when the outcome of the scrutiny is known.

I have sent a letter similar to this one to Mr Hicks.

I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

  HILLSBOROUGH

  Thank you for your letter of 12 May 1997 addressed to Dame Barbara Mills QC, Director
  of Public prosecutions. You asked her to support your request to re-open the public enquiry.

  The question whether there should be another public enquiry is a matter for the Home
  Secretary and not the Crown Prosecution Service. I expect, however, that you have heard
  the announcement by the Home Secretary that there-4s. to be an independent scrutiny to
  ascertain whether there now exists any evidence which was not previously available relating
  to the Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

                    (c)   To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                          disciplinary matters;

           And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of

HILLSBOROUGH

Although we have not corresponded personally in the past, may I take this opportunity to
express my deepest sympathy for your tragic loss in the Hillsborough Disaster.

On 28 December 1996 you wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills
QC, asking that the enquiry into the tragic events at Hillsborough in 1989 be re-opened to
bring out the truth about what happened on that day.

The question whether there should be another enquiry is a matter for the Home Secretary and
not the Crown Prosecution Service. I expect, however, that you have heard the
announcement by the Home Secretary that there is to be an independent scrutiny to ascertain
whether there now exists any evidence which was not previously available relating to the
Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

                  (a)    To the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

                  (b)    To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                         purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                  (c)    To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                         disciplinary matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry ; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their




                         Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests o f justice
       attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
       their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
       be taken in the public interest.

It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are

 HILLSBOROUGH

 On 10 January 1997 you wrote to the Director of Public prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills
 QC, enclosing a copy of a letter you had sent to the then Home Secretary, Mr Howard. In
 the letter to Mr Howard, you asked that the tragic events at Hillsborough in 1989 be re­
 examined because of new evidence and also because certain questions had been left
 unanswered.                                           .* _

 Although we have not corresponded personally in the past, may I take this opportunity to
 express my deepest sympathy for your tragic loss in the Hillsborough Disaster.

 As you know, the Crown Prosecution Service has been considering very carefully papers and
 tapes in relation to the disaster. In addition, we examined some material supplied by the
 Hillsborough Family Support Group.

 I expect you have heard the announcement made by the new Home Secretary that there is to
 be an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any evidence which was not
 previously available relating to the Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

                  (a)    To the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

                  (b)    To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                         purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                  (c)    To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                         disciplinary matters;




                         Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests o f justice
       And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
       such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
       Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
       attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
       their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
       be taken in the public interest.

It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are
responsible for investigating offences and for deciding whether or not to charge or summons
an offender.

In recent months, senior lawyers within the CPS have examined large quantities of material
arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of considering this material was to
ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to start a criminal prosecution. If the
evidence was sufficient, the CPS would invite the police to conduct a further formal
investigation and prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges against named
individuals.

At this stage, the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far presented
does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute an independent scrutiny, the
CPS will consider the matter again when the outcome of that scrutiny is known. The CPS
will assist the independent scrutiny in whatever way it.can and we will carefully examine its
findings before making any further decisions.

I hope that you will be encouraged by the announcement made, given that one of the express
purposes of the independent scrutiny is to consider whether there should be a further public
enquiry.

I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

 You wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills QC, on 17 January
 1997 with detailed notes explaining your views regarding responsibility for the tragic events
 in 1989.

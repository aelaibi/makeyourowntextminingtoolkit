   SILENCE fell across Liverpool at
  3.06pm yesterday as the city
  remembered the 9 6 victims of
  the Hillsborough disaster exactly
   10 years after they died.
    Thousands who packed a memorial
  service at Liverpool’s Anfield sta­
  dium fell silent when Ray Lewis —
  the referee on the fateful day in 1989
  — blew a whistle.

 ers as the nam e o f each victim was read
 out and a candle lit in their memory. A t
 the end the crowd stood to sing the Liver­
 pool anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone.

 authorities on duty th a t day, | "
 ItfrA this: Kevin was dead by
  a t 3.37 and WPC M artin m istook
  Kevin’s last words for an exhalation
  of a ir from a dead body.
     Three years ago Anne wrote to the
  chief constable of West Midlands
  police, whose force investigated
  the rolfl of the South Yorkshire
  Police.
      She asked why PC JSruder and
  WFC Martixi wore visited by bis offi­
   cers and told to reconsider their evi­
   dence to the inquiry. And why the
   w ritten accounts of their evidence
   differed from the statem ents she had
   since secured fifom them. He never
   replied.
      B ut it's not ju st the tim e of
   Kevin’s death which Anne disputes,
   i t is something far more basic, i t is
   how he died.
       The intylest concluded th a t Kevin
    died
       .
           of -traum       atic asphyxia. T hat
                -k.-4i»i■*» ^IkllAllfAn I\l*t
   is a neat explanation which lies in
   with the 3.18pm cat-off.
       However a leading forensic pathol­
   ogist. Ian West of Guys H ospital,
   studied all the evidence and came
    up with a different conclusion.
       Dr West believes Kevin died
    b e c a u s e bones in his neck were bro­
    ken, causing swelling which pre­
    vented him breathing. A simple
    tracheotomy, in which a tube is
    inserted in a hole in the throat, and
    which m ost ambulance crews ar*
     qualified to perform, would have
     saved his life.
        Is it any wonder Anne, like the
     rest of the families feels th at for ten
     years she has been walking through
     a storm with no one in authority
     prepared to give her shelter?
         A decade down the line you would
                   th a t someone, somewhere
      would have accepted blame for the
      worst disaster in Britisih sporting
      history. And said sorry,
       B UT they haven’t. And thafs
               why it still drags on with pri­
               vate prosecutions this month
      against the two senior police
       officers on duty that day.
          T hat's why Hillsborough is a dis­
       aster th a t won't go away. I fought

QUESTION AND ANSWER

NB. The CPS will not comment in detail on this case at this stage as it is still sub judice.
We must not give any impression one way or the other about our view of the strength of
the evidence.


1.    What test has the CPS applied in deciding whether to take over these proceedings ?
A:    An answer to this question would be bound to lead to a conclusion about our view of the
      strength of the evidence. We can not comment.

2.    Why has the CPS not taken over the attempt to pervert the course erfjustice charge

A:    We have considered each of the charges in the context of the case as a whole and have
      decided that the appropriate course is not to intervene in the prosecution..

3.    Can the CPS take over only part of a case and discontinue it?
A:    We consider that we can, but we do not think it would be appropriate to do so in the
      circumstances of this case.

4.    What happens now?
A:    The case will continue. It will be up to the parties to decide what action to take next.

5:     Is Judicial Review likely?
A:    It is a matter for the parties whether they seek to commence proceedings by way of
       judicial review.

6:    Why won't you take over manslaughter and discontinue when you wouldn't
       prosecute it yourself?
A:    An answer to this question would be bound to lead to a conclusion about our view of the
       strength of the evidence. We can not comment.

7:     Why can't you take it over and run it?
A:     An answer to this question would be bound to lead to a conclusion about our view of the
       strength of the evidence. We can not comment.

8:     Isn't this unfair on the individual who then has to foot the costs?
A:     The right for individuals to bring a private prosecution is established in legislation. We
        have not been asked to take over the case to prosecute it.

9:    How many private prosecutions are there every year?
A:    The CPS is not necessarily made aware of every private prosecution there is, and
       therefore we don't compile any statistics.

10:    How many does CPS take over and run or discontinue in a year?
A:     We do not compile these statistics.

11:    What happens if there is a conviction at the end of the day, does this mean the
       CPS was wrong not to bring it, and will you refund the private prosecutors' costs?
A:     This is hypothetical; but it doesn't mean the CPS was wrong. We can not comment any
       further as to do so would lead to a conclusion about our view of the strength of the
       evidence. Costs will be a matter for the court to determine at the end of the case.

12:    Who made the decision?
A:     The decision was taken by a very senior CPS lawyer (if pushed: Director of Casework
       Evaluation).

13:    Was the new Director involved?
A:     He has been kept informed of key developments.

14:    Why hasn't he made the decision in this case?
A:     Before he became DPP he advised one of the parties. Therefore he has not made any
       decisions in this case.

15:    Why has it taken you so long, the private prosecution started in July 1998?
A:     A thorough review of the case was undertaken. This involved consideration of
       representations made by the private prosecutor and the defendants. Some of these were
       received as recently as October 1998.

16:    Has the Attorney General been involved?
A:     The Attorney General has been informed.

17:    What happens if the case is thrown out at half time (e.g. like the Lawrence case)?
A:     That is a matter for the private prosecutors. However the same rules of court apply in a
       private prosecution e.g. you cannot be tried for the same offence twice.



CPS Line to take on private prosecutions:


The CPS readily acknowledges the importance of the right to bring a private prosecution,
preserved by Section 6 (1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985. The CPS does have the
power to intervene in any private prosecution, either to take the case over and continue it, or to
take it over and discontinue it. The CPS will only intervene, however, in exceptional cases,
where the interests of justice require such an intervention.


If asked what is your policy for private prosecutions ?

It would not be appropriate to discuss the application of CPS policy to this particular case whilst
it is sub judice. Any discussion of the detail of CPS policy could be taken as a comment, one
way or the other, on the strength of the evidence, which could be prejudicial to the private
prosecution.

          THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM DISASTER

Following a lengthy and detailed investigation by the West
Midlands Police and close consideration of Lord Justice Taylor's
report, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Allan Green QC, has
concluded that there is insufficient evidence upon which a
prosecution for manslaughter or any other criminal offence may
be brought against the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club, Messrs Eastwood and Partners or
Sheffield City Council in connection with the disaster at
Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield, on 15th April 1989.
The Director has also concluded that there is insufficient
evidence to justify the institution of proceedings against any
officer in the South Yorkshire Police force or any other person
for any offence.

  Responding to a report injtoday's Daily Mirror, about the                          tragedy, Assistant
■.Chief Constable lan Dainfs said:

/ ‘Reports about this particular video tape continue to add con feion to an already

  in    article published, irrjthe Daiiy Mir rQf today.

          :tape: in question - from a closed circuit television camera sj lowing the disaster
   -arrfbid on -the- Ceppirigs Lane terraces - has never been 'missinf and it was made
    Watiable in full .to bdth Ljord Justice Taylor’s inquiry and to the ironer’s inquest. Its

                            the pictures was indeed in working order, otherwise there would

 ."^ h ia -b e e n              before, the confusion over ‘missing tapes earns lo arise from

 CPS STATEMENT

 HILLSBOROUGH CASE - ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD, ADLINGTON V
 MURRAY


 On XXX, solicitors conducting the private prosecution of XX DUCKENFIELD and XXX                        ^
 MURRAY asked the Crown Prosecution Service to take over and discontinue the proceedings.

 After a re-review of^T of the evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service has decided not to take          ^
 over any of the charges. This means that the private prosecution will continue.

  Before taking over a private prosecution to discontinue it, the CPS must be satisfied that there is             t
'"clearly *no case to answer". The basis of this position is that any prosecution commenced with            «•*==*
  evidence which Hoes5not establish a 'case to answer’ would be an abuse of the right to bring a
  prosecution.

 Clearly there is a distinction between the 'realistic prospect of conviction’ test in the Code for
 Crown Prosecutors which the CPS uses to review cases sent by the Police and the 'no case to
 answer* test mentioned above.

 Accordingly, there will be some cases which do not meet the CPS Code test of 'realistic
 prospect of conviction’ where there is a 'case to answer’ and in which the CPS will not
 intervene.

 To apply the Code tests to private prosecutions would unfairly limit the right of individuals to
 bring their own cases, as established under the 1985 Prosecution of Offences Act.

 Notes to Editors:

 1.      Mr. Duckenfield faces two charges of manslaughter, one of wilful neglect to perform a
         public duty and one of attempting to pervert the course of justice; Mr. Murray faces two
         charges of manslaughter and one of wilful neglect to perform a public duty.

DRAFT QUESTION AND ANSWER                                                        T jo f c       W   r
                                                                  Is
1.   What test has the CPS applied in deciding whether to take over these proceedings ?
A:   The test is in two parts. The first is an evidential test. We considered whether there is
     clearly no case to answer on the evidence available. This is a different test to the usual
      CPS Code for Crown Prosecutors test, which is whether there is enough evidence for a
     realistic prospect of conviction. The second part is the public interest test in the Code,
     ie. whether the public interest factors against prosecution clearly outweigh those in
     favour.

2.   Why has the CPS not taken over the attempt to pervert the course of justice charge
     ?
A:   In comparison to the other charges (manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public
      duty), this is not such a serious charge. We do not consider that it would be appropriate
      to take over only part of a case, especially the part which is less serious.

3.   Can the CPS take over only part of a case and discontinue it ?
A:   We consider that we can, but we do not think it would be appropriate to do so        Jiihu         ,

4.   What happens now ?
A:   The case will continue. It will be up to the parties to decide what action to take next.

5:   Is Judicial Review likely ?
A:   It is a matter for the parties whether they seek to commence proceedings by way of ^
      judicial review.

6:   Why won't you take over manslaughter and discontinue when you wouldn't
     prosecute it yourself ?
A:   The test we use to decide whether to take over a private prosecution and discontinue the
     case is different from the test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The test we used is i\*)a
     whether there is clearly no case to answer. This is a less stringent test than whether
     there is a realistic prospect of conviction (Code test). It means we will let some cases
     continue as private prosecutions when we would not prosecute the case ourselves.

7:   Why can't you take it over and run it ?
A:   On 18.2.98, the CPS reaffirmed its stated view of June 1997, that the material which
     has been presented and considered to date would not justify fresh criminal                     J
     investigations. As far as the CPS is aware at present, there is no new evidence to
     consider.

8:   Isn't this unfair on the individual who then has to foot the costs ?
A:   The right for individuals to bring a private prosecution is established in legislation. We     n
      have explained the nockse to answer' test which we look at, as to whether we take
      over the case or not.

9:   How many private prosecutions are there every year ?
A:   The CPS is not necessarily made aware of every private prosecution there is, and
     therefore we don't compile any statistics.
10:   How many does CPS take over and run ? or discontinue in a year ? —


11:   What happens if there is a conviction at the end of the day, does this mean the CPS
      was wrong not to bring it, and will you refund the private prosecutors' costs ?
A:    No, it doesn't mean the CPS was wrong. We can only make a decision based on the
      evidence we have before us, not as it may emerge at trial. The private prosecutors are ^
      entitled to ask the Court for costs. It will for the Court to decide if and from where
      costs should be awarded.

12:   Who made the decision ?
A:    The decision was taken by Mr Newell, Director of Casework Evaluation.

13:   Was the new Director involved ?                                            ^
A:    He has been kept informed of key developments.

14:   Why hasn't he made the decision in this case ?         ^       ®l
A:    Before he became DPP he acted for the Hillsborough Family Support Group and it was
      perceived that there might be a possible conflict of interest. Therefore he has not made   ^
      any decisions in this case.

15:   Why has it taken you so long, the private prosecution started in July 1998 ?
A:    A thorough review of the case was undertaken. This involved consideration of
      representations made by the private prosecutor and the defendants. Some of these were
      received as recently as October 1998.

16:   Has the Attorney General been involved ?
A:    The Attorney General has been kept informed.

17:   What happens if the case is thrown out at half time (e.g. like the Lawrence case) ?
A:    That is a matter for the private prosecutors. However the same rules of court apply in a
      private prosecution e.g. you cannot be tried for the same offence twice.
STATEMENT

"The Director of Public Prosecutions welcomes Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith's very detailed and thorough report into all aspects
of this tragedy.

"Having considered the report's findings in depth, the DPP
reaffirms her stated view of June 1997, that the material so far
presented to her would not justify fresh criminal proceedings."


Q&A

1. What is the CPS role in the Hillsborough case?

In 1990 the CPS considered whether there was sufficient evidence
to prosecute any one arising out of the disaster. We concluded
there was not.

In 1997, the CPS considered material supplied by or on behalf of
the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG). Allegations were
made that evidence had been suppressed from the Taylor Inquiry
and the inquest. CPS considered whether there were grounds for
asking the police to institute further criminal investigations.
We concluded that there were insufficient grounds, ["material" -
 ie. papers and video tapes].

2. Will the CPS be taking any action following the publication
of the Report ?

No, the report has confirmed that there are no new grounds for
criminal investigation.


3. But what about prosecuting the police for withholding some
video evidence ?

The suggestion that police withheld video evidence has not been
upheld by the Report.   The CPS has reviewed all the available
video evidence in making its decisions.


4. Should police be prosecuted for giving misleading evidence on
whether the cameras were working properly or not at the inquest?

The report found that submissions on this were untenable,
therefore the evidential position remains unchanged.

5. Why will you not take action in relation to the allegations
that police officers altered their statements?

This matter was considered in full by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.
He considered that these amendments in no way affected the
outcome of either the Taylor Inquiry or the Inquest.

6. What about allegations that the police improperly interfered
with witnesses ?
The report concluded that there was no improper pressure put on
witnesses and therefore there are no grounds for instituting
criminal proceedings.

7. What about the new medical evidence provided e.g. that by Dr
Walker ?

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found that the evidence of Dr Walker
and others added nothing to that already given at the inquest.
Therefore the view of the CPS remains the same - that there is
insufficient evidence to institute criminal proceedings.



8. Does the new evidence of the structural engineer which
criticises the safety and structural aspects of the ground mean
that the Club could be criminally liable ?

The report does not suggest that this new evidence implies that
the Club was criminally liable.

9. Will you ask the police to investigate the state of the ground
in the light of the comments of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith?

No. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith made it clear that some evidence
not previously considered about the size of crush barriers and
the capacity of parts of Leppings Lane terraces do not give
grounds for re-opening the Judicial Inquiry or any other
proceedings.

10. Why will you not publish your advices?

CPS advice is subject to legal privilege(?).     This is because
decisions about prosecutions frequently involve the interests and
reputations of witnesses, the victim and the accused or suspect.
Publicly calling into question decisions about prosecution could
amount to a trial of the suspect without the safeguards which
criminal proceedings are designed to provide.

11. Will you meet the relatives ?

We have a publicly stated commitment to meet the relatives of
deceased victims to explain the basis upon which our decisions
are taken. We will, of course, be prepared to meet relatives, if
they think that would be helpful.

12. Surely   it must   be   in the public   interest   to   prosecute
somebody ?

There are two stages in the decision to prosecute.  First, we
must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a
"realistic prospect of conviction". If the case does not pass
this evidential test, it must not go ahead, no matter how
important or serious it may be.     If a case does pass the
evidential test, the Crown Prosecutor must then consider the
second stage test to decide if a prosecution is in the public
interest.   In cases of any seriousness, a prosecution will
usually take place unless there are public interest factors
tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending
in favour.   The Crown Prosecution Service will only start or
continue a prosecution when the case has passed both tests.

13. Has the DPP herself been involved in considering the case?

The DPP has been consulted about the decisions made and of course
been kept informed of key developments.

14. If the relatives bring a private prosecution/ will the CPS
take it over, given that you think there is no merit in bringing
a prosecution ? The Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 allows
individuals to bring a private prosecution. We have not received
any formal notification that a private prosecution has been
commenced and therefore at this stage cannot speculate what our
action, if at all, would be. ????

Guidance: The CPS has some responsibilities in relation to
private prosecutions, which includes a duty to take over
prosecutions and discontinue them where there is insufficient
evidence to proceed.

                             WEDNESDAY, 18 FEBRUARY 1998




With permission Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


2       Few events in recent years have touched the lives of so many people. The
and friends of the 96 Liverpool fans who died on 15 April 1989 have suffered
immeasurably. The whole nation was profoundly disturbed by what occurred that day.
               *s now ^ most I“ne y « » siace that fateful day, many of the kmili« and others
                     "           m i/" '                     •                               ■ .
                evidence was available which would cast new light on these events.’ As Home
Secretary, I was determined to do all I could to establish if that was indeed the case.


3      On coming into office in May I gave this question intense consideration, and on
30 June 1997,1 announced to the House that the Attorney General and I had decided to
appoint Lord Justice Saiart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct
an independent scrutiny of this matter. His terms of reference were:


       To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
       Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


       (a)      to the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


       (b)      to the Director of Public Prosecutions or Attorney General for the purpose
                of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                    (c)     to the Chief Officer of South Yorkshire police in relation to police
                            disciplinary matters;


                            and in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available
                            is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for
                            the Home Department of a farther public inquiry; and in relation to (b)
                            and (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by
                            them which may be relevant to their respective duties;           and to advise
                            whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public
                            interest.


            4      Lord Justice Scuart-Smith has now submined his report, which I am publishing
            today.


            5     His scrutiny is the latest in a series of lengthy and detailed examinations of the
                          M“* case- Tj“ puMic mquiry led by the late Lord Justice Taylor considered
                      causes of the disaster and made wide^rarigicig recommendations about crowd
           control and safety at sports events. These have had a profound effea on both crowd safety
           ai football grounds and on the policing of football matches.


           6      The deaths which occurred were also the subject of inquests which were conducted
           by the Coroner for the Western District of South Yorkshire in two parts in April and May
           1990 and between November 1990 and March 1991. They involved over 80 days of public
           hearing. A further investigation was conducted by ihe West Midlands police, supervised
           by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any grounds for
           criminal or disciplinary proceedings. That’investigation involved the taking of more than
           5000 statements. At a later stage in November 1993, there was a judicial review of the

                 7        The main causes of the disaster hive long been clear. They were identified by
                 Lord Taylor in his interim report in August 1989. He did not attribute all the blame to a
                 single cause or person, but in paragraph 278 he made it dear that “che main reason for the
                 disaster was the failure of police control*. The South Yorkshire police have in rum
                 accepted the main share of responsibility for the disaster. Sheffield Wednesday Football
                 Club and the Local Authority were also criticised by Lord Taylor.


                 8        With any major disaster, it is almost inevitable that over the course of time some
                 new information may become available. But that does not necessarily mean that the
                 outcome of any previous inquiries would have been different had rhis information been
               s available. What is crucial is not just whether the information is new, but also whether it is
                 of such significance - to use the phrase in the terms of reference - as to justify a new
                 inquiry.


                 9        Lord Justice Stuart-Smkh considered in great detail all the evidence which has been
                 put to him. This included all the relevant evidence presented to the earlier inquiries and
                 inquest. He has looked equally rigorously at all the information presented to him, by
                 individuals and official bodies including those representing the families of those who died,
                 and others who have acted in support of them-             He has produced a thorough and
                 comprehensive report. His clear conclusion, however, is that there is no basis on which
                 there should be a further public inquiry. He also finds no basis for a renewed application
                 to quash the verdict of the inquest, or any material which should be put before the
                 Director of Public Prosecutions or the disciplinary authorities which might cause them to
                 reconsider the decisions they have already taken. He concludes that none of the evidence
                 which he was asked to consider added anything significant to the evidence which was
                 available to Lord Taylor's inquiry or to the inquests.


                 10       I, the Attorney General and the DPP have considered Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
                 report   v e ry   carefully. We have no reason to believe that his conclusions are wrong. This
                 will, I know, be deeply disappointing for the families of those who died at Hillsborough
                 and many who have campaigned on their behalf.

 . u           I fully understand that chose w ho lost loved ones at H illsborough m ay feel betrayed

      by those responsible for policing the Hillsborough football ground and for th e state o f the
      ground o n th a t day. I hope and believe that the changes which resulted from th e T aylor
      In q u iry should mean that such a disaster will never be repeated.



      12     B u t th<r' is “ ° ' h' r      »W ch "ha system has failed the H illsborough families.
   As L ord Justice Scuart-Smith says in chapter 7 o f his report,


             ■I understand the dism ay th at they have that no individual has personally been held
             to account either in a crim inal court, disciplinary proceedings, o r even to th e extent
            o f losing cheir job".



  13        There are serious shortcomings in the police disciplinary system.            The Home
  Affairs Committee produced a report earlier this year which makes recommendations for
 change.       1 will be responding hilly to that report soon.          But what happened after
 Hillsborough is a prime example of why we have to improve the current arrangements.


 14        L ord Justice Snurt-Smieh also comments on the coroner’s proceedings after a major
 disaster, which has been subject to a public inquiry. He endorses the recommendation of a
 Home Office Working Group on Disasters and Inquests, published in March 1997, that the
 role of the coroner after such a public inquiry should be limited.


 15        Lord Justice Scum-Smith highlights in his report the exceptionally difficult task
which the coroner had in conducting the main inquest. It placed an unreasonable and, I
think, unnecessary burden on him when the Taylor Report had covered substantially the
same ground. Certainly I am clear that Hillsborough proved that the system in its present
form is unsuitable as a means of dealing with disasters of this kind. If no inquest had been
necessary, the Taylor inquiry, which all have accepted as an excellent report, would then
have remained unchallenged as the last word on the causes of the disaster.

     16        I therefore agree La principle with Lord Justice Scuart-Smith’s recommendations
     that there should rarely be the need for an inquest following a judicial inquiry into a major
,    disaster.



     17        When I established the scrutiny I said that I would do my best to ensure chat the
     evidence considered by Lord Justice Scuart»Smith was published.            Most of the main
    material which he has considered is contained in the Appendices to his report. Much of
    the other evidence which he considered is already in the public domain, consisting of
    transcripts of public hearings or material considered by the Taylor Inquiry. I am arranging
    for other material considered by Lord Justice Scuan-Smith to be placed in the Library of
    the House.


    18         All Honourable Members will have the most profound sympathy with the families
    and friends of chose who died at Hillsborough- We can scarcely begin to comprehend
    .what they have suffered. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says in his report:


          ‘J   * I realise that my report and advice will come as a disappointment to them,
               especially since they have had their hopes raised that something more could be
               done. But I cannot   a llo w   compassion to cloud my judgement. I have had to look
               dispassionately and objectively at what is said to be fresh evidence, in the light of
               the evidence which had previously been considered*.


    19         I, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions must consider
    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report, in the same light. I recognise that it will be difficult and
    painful for the families of those who died to accept the conclusions of this report. But
    having established this rigorous judicial scrutiny I must accept its conclusions.

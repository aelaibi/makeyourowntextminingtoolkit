                                                     MP SAYS HEADS SHOULD ROLL


              SHARI WAHL:
                      The main story this evening, the MP for Southport Ronnie Feam says heads should roll
              over Merseyside Police Authority's behaviour in the appointment of Norman Bettison as the
             new Chief Constable. I t follows admissions by some members of the Police Authority that it
             didn't see & important document from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, That report
             referred to Mr Bettison's involvement with the police inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.
             Councillors Prank Prendergast and Dave Martin are adamant they didn't have that necessary
             information. This evening the Chair of the Police Authority, Councillor Carol Gustafson, has
             issued a statement further confusing the issue. She says Merseyside Police Authority was
             aware of Mr Bettison's operational policing experience at Hillsborough through the assessment
             made by Her Majesty’s Inspector made available at the meeting on September 24th.
                     So what does the MP Ronnie Feam make of all this?
             RONNIE BEARN MP O BI;
                     I'm quite appalled actually that a police authority didn’t read fully the documents that
             were put before them. As a past member of the police Authority I know that the officers were
             very efficient at putting all information to us especially when we were interviewing for new
             positions and jobs.
             S.W:
                    Dij you think members involved in this who have admitted that they didn't read the
             documents put in front of them, Frank Prendergast and Dave Martin* should resign?
            .£ £
                    I’m sure that heads should roll. They probably should resign from the Police Authority
            but not ftom the authorities which they represent otherwise. It is a fact that councillors do get
            very,. w*y busy but when it comes to something very important everybody should read every
            single piece of paper that comes before t e n and in this case the appointment that was made, a

              very important one, everybody should have been well aware of the facts long before. I have
              known councillors waltz into meetings ... (interference at this point) piece of paper then start
              voting on things before they've even read them. That I never do and there are many others like
              me but there are others who get too busy and take on too many jobs outside and who quite
              frankly do not read all the material they get. Yes, heads should roll but it should be another
              independent inquiry which makes that decision and I mean independent, probably outside our
              own authorities,
              S.W:
                      Do yon think the police themselves should be worried about the way appointments
              appear to be carried out and about in fact the behaviour of the Police Authority itself?
             RJF:
                     Well the Police Authority is now a new constituted one and probably hasn't clicked into
             being as yet but certainly it should not be a trio who does appoint a Chief Constable and of that
             trio it should not just be councillors, it should be people from the bench perhaps and an
             independent person from the community. That way this mistake probably would have bee®
             seen. I'm not saying that he wouldn’t have been the best person for the job as ChiefConstable,
             it seems now to jeopardise his position as such because his character has been tainted
             throughout Merseyside and this is probably unfair but nevertheless a rerun should be had and it
            should be an independent body who does that
            S.W:
                     Do you believe the Police Authority as a whole has been incompetent in this situation?
            R.F:
                     Well its members should sit down and take these m em bers over the coals and I think
            they should be explaining to the whole police Authority to the inquiry taking place. I’ve no
            doubt they've tried to do this and in doing so have left themselves wide open to the fact that
            they could be lying if indeed they did have the papers before them.
            S.W:
                     The Southport MP Ronnie Feam. Well Trevor Hicks, the Chairman 0f the
            Hillsborough Families' Support Group, who lost two daughters in the tragedy, has been giving
            his reaction to the ongoing controversy,
            TREVOR HICKS:
                    (Hillsborough Families' Support Group) We now have: a, as I said earlier, we have a
            Police Authority where, if I could use fee words of the old rhyme, we don't know who's doing
            what with what and to whom. On behalf of the Families' Support Group let me say we feel this
            is an insensitive appointment at the least and, you know, it does not help for us to know that

             okay, we've only been insensitive by default, We've all made a total and utter cock up of it and
             so we didn't mean to be insensitive but, you know, the end result is the same. Mr Bettison has
             been less than forthright in laying out his total involvement in Hillsborough, I mean we've all
             been for interviews and we all know how easy it is to bring forward your good points and, if
             you like, 111 use an emotional word, whitewash over the bits that you don't want people to
             probe and the skill of an interviewing panel is to probe the areas that he doesn't want to talk
             about and to leave alone the bits that he's, if yon like, put on paper. Our position is perfectly
             clear, we do not consider Mr Bettison a fit person to head Merseyside Police Force, that is our
             group's position. We feel his appointment is insensitive to the point of insulting and we think
            the Police Authority have been very ham fisted in the way they've dealt with it. To say they're
            unprofessional is an understatement. The plot thickens, the murk gets murkier and the farce
            takes on even greater proportions. I think they should invite Brian Rix to perhaps take the
            chair of the Police Authority because, you know, he's one of the most famous advocates of
            farce,
            S.W:
                     Well they do say that truth is stranger than fiction. At the Police Authority's
            Emergency Meeting earlier this week there seemed to be confusion over what was expected of
            authority members. Well as we've heard, Trevor Hicks has described jt as a farce. Here's
            Lindsay Prosser,..
            LINDSAY PROSSER:
                    Act 1, Scene I, The Clerk to the Police Authority David Henshaw addressed an
            emergency meeting two days ago and explained when the documents had been given to
            members of the Authority.
            DAVID HENSHAW:
                     (Speaking at the emergency meeting) At the Appointments Committee on the 24th of
            September members had already had copies of the application forms for the candidates. At the
            actual meeting,: a few minutes into the meeting we circulated to all nine members present a
            copy o f the Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary’s assessment of each of the candidates.
            That was circulated to members and we did not take any back from members and indeed we are
            aware and members now have got the original document back, somehow have got the original
            documentation back, that those assessments were kept with members for that period between
            the short-listing and final interviews last week.

               authority officers indeed recruiting a chief constable, as per Home Office guidelines.
               L.P:
                      The Leader of Sefton Council, Dave Martin, claims he didn’t have the document and at
               the meeting questioned the way in which David Henshaw said material had been handed out.
               CLLRDAVE MARTIN:
                      (Speaking at the emergency meeting) Would Mr Henshaw agree that the tabling of
               those documents is done at the short-listing and placed on the table in front of members and not
               handed to members?
               D.H:
                      My committee staff went round the room giving a copy of that assessment to each
               member sitting at each place...
               D.M:
                       That wasn't the question, the question was how were they delivered? Were they placed
               on the table in front of the members?
               E li           .
                          They were placed on the table in front of the members.
               D-Mt
                          Or handed to them personally?
               P.H;
                          I couldn’t answer that question specifically.
               DM;
                       Okay- Mr Henshaw makes the point that none were handed back. How does Mr
               Henshaw know none were handed back?
               D.H:
                      We've questioned the staff who were on duty at that meeting. No copies of those
               assessments were givenback to any of the staff, there were none remaining on the tables in the
               room after the meeting.
               L.P:
                      Councillor Frank Prendergast claims he didn't have the document but on Tuesday he
               claimed that during tie Appointments Committee he, questioned whether the authority
               members needed the documents at that stage in the selection process,

                      (Speaking at the emergency meeting} When we asked the question what does it

              information was relevant until w e got to the interviews and whatever and most            (words
              inaudible), I mean I’ve already raised this issue, I asked for the papers to be handed back and
              attached to the papers that I had just happened to be seven pages, one for each of the candidates
              and I’ve made this point before, I have not seen them or commented on any of them seven,
              papers ... (inaudible) the chance of my marking papers for the final day. Now I don’t know
              they got thfre because I certainly did not have (hem on, as far as I remember, when a member
              asked a question about the relevance to the interview, than papers were handed back.
              L.P:
                     There seems to be a twist in the plot Lady Doreen Jones says it was her who raistsd the
             question of whether the documents were needed by the Authority members at the Appointment
             Committee stage.
             JLAPY DOREEN JONES:
                    When we were told the HMI would be, we would have papers circulating, circulating
             from the HMI, I said I did not feel that we should have any recommendations from the HMI
             because he was there to observe, not tell us who we would, point us in thedirection of who we
             were to choose.
             L.P;
                    So how were the papers given out, who said they weren’t necessary and which members
             looked at them? David Henshaw is adamant the reports remained with the. Authority members
             who were all told about their importance.
             D.H:
                    Picking up Councillor Preodergast's point and clearly if he says that he didn't have that
            material, I can only accept what he says. Lady Doreen refers to her comment about fee
             assessments by the HMI, She did, yes, say that she didn’t want those assessments at that point.
            You didn't actually put that to a vote and indeed the assessments were left with members. I
            need to be very clear about that, no actual decision was taken to put those assessments back in.
            Can I also just clarify one point. The HMI; Mr Compton, is here not as an observer, he's hens
            as an adviser. Ha’s your principal adviser on operational policing matters, therefore his
            assessment of the candidates is critical, ie. Ms assessment as HMI, Her Majesty's Inspectorate
            of Constabulary, to give you an assessment of the candidates and their competence and ability
            to command the post of Chief Constable.
            M i
                  Whatever the Authority members now say about the appointment of the new Chief
            Constable, this drama is set fbr a longxun.

                      Well ow reporter Lindsay Prosser reporting. On the line is the Leader of Sefton
              Council Dave Martin, who was in that Appointments Committee and claims he never saw the
              report about Mr Bettison's involvement in the aftermath of Hillsborough bat also Councillor
              Martin, the Authority Chair, Councillor Carol Gustafson, has issued statement today which TO
              read to you;
                      "I’d like to clarify that Merseyside Police Authority was aware of Mr Bettison's
              operational policing experience, including his experience at Hillsborough, thorough an
              assessment by HMI of Constabulary, made available at that meeting,"
                      m m come she knew and you didn't?
             P.M :
                      Good evening- I didn’t actually hear that on your programme, I've just come on the
             phone now so I've not heard your programme but going from what you say there, I thick what
             Carol is doing and I can’t answer for Carol but she's trying to explain the situation that as far as
             the officers were concerned and some members were concerned those papers were somewhere
             around an4 she's just trying to explain that situation but Pm not here to explain for Carol, Pm
             here to explain my position.
             S.W:
                     So you believe that she, now are you saying that she did know about Mr Bettison's
             involvement?
             P.M:
                     No, what I’ve just said to you, you ask Carol Gustafson about that, IVe just tried to
             explain the position, obviously you don't want to accept that. If you want to interview me, ask
             me about my involvement. ..
             S.W:
                     Alright, alright, so in that recording we just heard of your meeting last Monday we

              I did not see the documents, I did not read the documents. When I questioned, and I hope this
              came out in your programme but I must stress I’ve not heard your programme and people may
              assume I have, when I questioned Mr Henshaw at the meeting on Monday last he made it quite
              dear that he accepts my position, Now you can’t have it any fairer than that* Other"people I
              heard on the news this afternoon saying, yon know, the situation is like a Brito Rix position.
              That's their opinion of something they weren't involved its. Now I am stating quite dearly as
              Leader of Selton Council and a member of the Police Authority that on the 24th of September I
              did not see or read those documents and they weren't explained to me on that day.
              S.W:
                       So ydu're saying that Carol Gustafson is wrong when she says that Merseyside Police
              Authority was aware of Mr Bettison's operational policing experience which she has issued in a
              statement tonight?
              DM:
                       I've, I hope you accept the explanation I've given, on my behalf. I can only give you my
             understanding, as I said before, of whatCarol's saying. You mentioned the Merseyside Police
              Authority. Ifs quite obvious from yew programme that the Merseyside Police Authority in
              general and that includes the officer, Mr Henshaw, and the officer from the, from the Home
             Office, they were aware of the documents so therefore it was available at that time for some
             people so her statement may cover that point but you'd best interview her on that It's obvious
             that the document was somewhere around the authority at that time and I concur with everyone
             that's amazed as to why the members didn't have it. l oan only talk on behalf of myself.
             S.W;
                      Right, on behalf of yourself...
             P.M;
                      Yes,
             S.W;
                      ... David Henshaw also released a statement saying the Authority h^giyen, you, that's
             you, the materW and it was m front of you which indicated Mr B ^ o ij^ p a f e w e ...
             P.M:
                     Yes.
             S.W:
                     So why didn't yon read it?

                              Yes, 9,1998.
                PJM:
                              I'm sony, sorry, 1998, that's the document of last Friday, is that the one?
                S.W:
                              Yes, that's Mr Hcnshaw’s statement. Now one of you is wrong, you can't all be right.
                P.Wfi
                        Now hang on, just wait a minute, I’m clarifying what you're talking about. You're
                talking about the press release of last Friday.
                S .W :

                              Yes, when David Henshaw said...
                D.M:
                              Yes, I know what he said...
                S.W;
                              ... at the meeting and he said it, we just heard it and you were listening...
                D.M:
                              Yes.
                S.W:
                        We just heard it at that recording there, he said the material was in front of you. Why
                didn’t you read it?
                D.M:
                       Yes and if you listen to your tape again, obviously the tape of that, that meeting on
               Monday, on Monday I questioned him on that particular fact and on Monday, after Friday,
               that's why I want to establish when that press release went out, that's one of about four by Mr
               Henshaw, I spoke to Mr Henshaw about that, I questioned him on Monday. He now agrees
               after he sent that statement out that he accepts in all good faith that I did not receive those
               documents after that statement so that clarifies that position.
               sm
                              One final question, Ronnie Feam says you should resign. Are yon going to?

                       Well Ronnie Feam wants to tty to do the job which he’s not doing very well at the
                         as being MP for Southport because gome of the things that I am told Rennie Feam
               said in your progratiane and on the news IMS afternoon...
               S.W:
                       "Can you answer the question, are you going to resign, yes or no?

             doesn't know the situation, he picks up things and he’s totally wrong on some of the things he's
             saying, he's making a political point on behalf of his own particular individual political means.

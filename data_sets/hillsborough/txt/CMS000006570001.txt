As promised when we spoke over the telephone the other day I now
attach a contribution on all seating for the briefing you are
preparing for the meeting between Mr Yeo and Mr Jacobs of the
Football Licensing Authority. I would be grateful if you could
let us have a copy of the full final brief when it goes up.

As the meeting is about planning we do not think it is necessary
for anyone from SARD to be present.

            DES/SARD CONTRIBUTION TO BRIEFING FOR MEETING BETWEEN MR YEO AND
            NORMAN JACOBS

            FLA and all seating
            Implementation of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations in his
            final report into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, is a matter
            for which the Home Office has lead responsibility. Lord Ferrers
            has recently reaffirmed the Government's commitment to Taylor
            implementation. However the FLA are aware that both the Secretary
            of State for Education and the Minister for Sport have
            reservations about the need for all seating,particularly in
            Divisions 3 and 4. The Minister of Sport made this clear to the
            new President of the Football League, G o rd o 's McKeag at a recent
            meeting. But since Home Office Ministers are in the lead the next
            step is for DES Ministers to discuss the issue with them. In the
            meantime the timetable stands.
            The deadlines for achieving all-seating are August 1994 for First
            and Second Division clubs of the Football League and August 1999
            for Third and Fourth Division clubs. The Football Licensing
            Authority, set up following the Taylor report and with the
            responsibility inter alia of enforcing this all-seating
            requirement through its licensing powers, has made clear in
            private that there will be flexibility in relation to the
            timetable provided it is convinced that the clubs concerned have
            the necessary plans and financial packages in place but will for
            planning or other reasons narrowly miss the August 1994 and 1999
            deadlines. It would be damaging at this stage, however, to make
            such flexibility publicly known.

            The FLA propose to issue licenses under section 10 of the
            Football Spectators Act 1989 to all Premier League and Football
            League clubs before the start of the 1992-93 football season. As
            part of this process they have circulated to all Football League
            clubs a detailed questionnaire about their plans for all seating.
            The questionnaire is to be returned by 15 April.

            Planning and all seating
            In December last year at the request of the Sport and Recreation
            Division (SARD) of the DES the DOE wrote to all DOE Regional
            Controllers (Planning) about their experiences of clubs wishing
            to re-locate their grounds. In particular Regional Offices were
            asked whether they were aware of any discussions between clubs
            and local planning authorities as suggested in PPG17 and to what
            extent they were involved in any such discussions. Generally the
            responses have been positive. Some Regional Offices have been
            involved in discussions and giving advice while others say they
            are prepared to do so if asked.
            In separate discussions SARD have also suggested to one or two
            Regional Offices that they might encourage county planning
            authorities to set up fora of interested district planning
            authorities, as suggested in the PPGN, where a relocation
            proposal has cross district boundary implications.
                                                                                   1

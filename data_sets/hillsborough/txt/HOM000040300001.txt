                            On Saturday,            15th       April        1989,      I      commenced             d u t y at       Armthorpe             at

                            8.15     am and       then        to     Doncaster         DHQ      for          8.45    am.        We    were      then

                            transported            to    Hillsborough,                where         a    briefing          was       carried          out.         I wa

                            on     serial    No.        3,    with      PS 2627          Ashton          in    charge.           Our       duty was             foot

                             patrol       around        the       roundabout          at      the       junction        of P e n i s t o n e          Road,

                            Leppings        Lane        and       Kerries       Road.          At       this    location             we    were       to    prevent

                             any    trouble        between           rival      fans.

                             After        briefing       we       had   a   packed         meal         at    the     ground         and    t h e n at          about

                             at    the     junction          of    Penistone          Road        and        Herries       Road.           At   this        locatio

                             their        passengers.              They were          then        to     walk       down Leppings               Lane        to     ente

                             the     ground.

                             Even     at    11.00       am    there         was    a steady              stream       of    fans      arriving             by    coach

                             and     private       cars.           While        the    majority              seemed        to    be m a k i n g       their        way

There    did     not       appear           to    be       any     trouble           among          t he      fans       or    between          the

different        factions.               The          majority           of     supporters                 I saw were               the

Liverpool        fans        walking             down       from        Penistone              Road           Although           they were

boisterous           there        did       not       appear        to    be       any     trouble              from      th em .         It w a s

noticed        though        that       a    large           number        that        were         just         sitting         around             or

walking       about        were     all          in      possession             of       cans       of     beer         and     t ha t     those

arriving        in     the    time          leading           up    to     kick          off    were            hastily         trying          to

finish      their       cans       before             they        reached           the    ground.

One    incident         that       was       reported              to    an        officer          in      our      v i c i n i t y was            a

young    lad      reporting             a    theft.               Apparently              he     had       arrived            without           a

ticket,        he w a s      offered              on e      for    sale         but      when       he      handed        over           the

money,      the      seller        ran       off           with    both         ticket         and        money.          This           young          lad

was     taken     to    the       Police              Room    within            the      ground            to      make   a     complaint.

According         to    officers             who           attended           the     semi-final                   last   ye a r ,        they

expected         the    majority                 of    the       crowd        to    be    in        the       ground          just after

2.00     pm.      Last       year        evidently                t he    streets          were            empty        after        2.15       pm

But     this     did    not        appear             to    happen        this        year.           Although                the    coaches

seemed      to    stop       arriving                 after       about         2.00       pm.       It       was       noticed          that

 between       about       2.15         pm a n d           2.30     pm    large          numbers              of    Liverpool

 supporters           started           coming             down     Penistone             Road           in     droves.             We    did       not

 know where           they     were          coming          from        b ut      were     walking                down       in t h e i r

 hundreds        it    seemed.               This          seemed        to     carry          on    until          about        2.50      pm.

 There      appeared          to    be       no       trouble        from          them,        but        there         was     plenty         of
                                                                                                                                                          i

 It w a s     also     during           this          time       that     all         traffic            was       stopped          from

 entering        Leppings           Lane,             I assumed           this        was       due        to      the    number          of

 supporters           on     the    road.                It w a s       also       noticed           that          even       u p to a b o u t

 and    expecting            to    find          parking           places           near       the       ground.              It was           seen

    1age r .
    One    incident           that        happened             was    a    private         hire      car    dropping             off     4

    Liverpool            supporters             at       the    roundabout.                 It w a s      obvious          they       h a d all

    been     drinking           and       one       of    them       had    to    be    supported           by       his    friends.               He

    seemed      incapable               of     walking          on    his       own.        They     were       all    spoken           to a n d

    advised         re    offences             of    trying          to    enter       the     ground       drunk.            Later          that

    afternoon            after       the       tradedy          occurred,             I again        saw    the       one     that       had        tc

     be a s s i s t e d ,      in       the    ground,           near      the       gym,     he   was     being           helped       to a n

     ambulance           with       what       appeared              to   be a       leg    injury.             He    had    obviously

     got     into    the       ground.

     At    about     2.45          pm     it   was       obvious           from      message        we     heard       on    the        radio

     that     there       was        problems            at     the       Leppings         Lane      end    of       the    ground.            The

     messages        were          excited           and       everybody          was       speaking        at       once,       but     it

     seemed       there        was        difficulty             in t he         crowd       entering           the    g r o u n d at         this

      location            Even       at       this       time    there          were    still        large       numbers           of

     Liverpool            supporters                walking          down       towards        the      Leppings           Lane

      turnstiles.               It      was      during         this       period          that    we     heard       on     the      radio

      repeated           requests             for    the       gates       to    be    opened        at    the       Leppings           Lane

      end,     but       we    were       not       aware        for w h a t         reason.

      At     3.00    pm o u r           serial       was        planned         to    walk     down Leppings                 Lane       and
                                                                                                                                             ew of
      there      join a Force                  Coach           for    standby          duty    before           a meal.           In vi

       the    radio       message,             we    made        our      way     straight          away        at    3.00       pm to        the

       Leppings          Lane       turnstiles.                  While       enroute,             I heard        a message              on the

       radio      requesting                 serials           that w ere         mealing          at    Claywheels              to     go

       immediately             to       Leppings           Lane       end    as       there       was     fighting          taking           place

       On arrival             at     the       Leppings          Lane       turnstiles             there        was    o n l y a small

       number        of       supporters             around          the    entrance.              Our     serial          waited with

       other        serials          at       this       location          for       further       instructions.                   At    t h is

        point       we    were       not       sure       what       was    happening.                      ^
A       short         time     later,             only     a matter          of       minutes,            a South Yorkshire

ambulance                arrived             at    the     Leppings          Lane        end.           It w a s       directed                 into          the

ground.                When        it    was       inside          I saw     one        person          being         assisted                 to     it

with          a    leg       injury.              It w a s     at    this      time          that       a    stream          of

supporters                   started          to     leave         the     ground         at      this       location.                    They       were          all

saying                that    it    was        bedlam         in t h e r e ,        that       the      game          had    been          stopped

and           people         were       injured.              We    still         did       not    know what                had       happened,

but           t h e n we      were           ordered        into     the     Lepping              Lanes          terracing                and       onto

the           pitch,         but     I must          admit         I did       no t      know      for       what          purpose.

When           we w e n t       into          the    ground         behind            t h e -West S t a n d ,              there          was        a

    steady            stream       of        people        leaving.            At      the       back       of       the    stand           there             was

    a       small      number           of    people          stood      and      laid        about.             Some       obviously                    in

    distress             but    some          laid       on t h e        ground         quite        still.            I along              with           other

    officers             made       my       way    through          the     crowd          in    the       West       Stand              and       o nt o     the

    pitch          behind          the       goal.         While         going        through           the      crowd,           a       large          amount

    of       verbal          abuse       was       being       directed           at      us.

    As       s o o n as       I got          onto     the      p i tc h ,    I could              not       believe          what          I saw.

    There          was       large       sections             of    t he    crowd         milling            about          and       about           twenty

    people             laid    on       the       ground.           At     this        stage       I saw             a number             of P o l i c e

    Officers             giving          mouth           to m o u t h      resuscitation                    to       people       laid          out           on

    the        ground.             It    was        obvious         at     this        stage       that          a    large       number                 of

        people         had     been          injured.

        I    immediately             assisted             with      some       of      the       injured             but    it w a s           obvious

        that      a    large       number           of     people        laid         out     were      dead.              One    person                 I went

        to    assist         was        blue       in t h e     face        and       his     mouth         was       stuck       wide           open.              It

        was    also      at     this          time       that       I felt        a    huge       hatred             from a           large          number

        of    the L i v e r p o o l           supporters             towards            the      Police          and       the        club

        stewards.              There          was    also       aggression               towards            Notts.          Forest              f a n s at          the

        far       end,    and       a    number          cf    supporters               tried        to      r ac e    to     the          far       e n d to

        confront             them.                                                                                                    3    k
At    this         time       there          was          utter           confusion              in    the    area          between          the     g oa l

and         the    terracing,                    people           wre      spilling              out    and        could         not    help

tripping               over        people            laid         o ut     on    the       grass.             It    was       then      that       the

first         member             of        the    Fire         Service           arrived              with        resuscitation

equipment.                    I directed                    one      of    them       to     a    person           with       breathing

difficulties.
It w a s          obvious              that          the       casualties             would            have       to    be    moved          from    this

 location,              although                 a     large         number       were           dead,        but       there       was       no

 direction               as       to       where          to    take       them.            There           did     not      appear          to    be a n y

 rank        above          Sergeant                 on     the      pitch       and        the        club        stewards            had    no     idea

 where            to    take          them.            I was         aware        the       first           aid     room was            at    t he    other

 end         of    the       ground              near       the      gym        and    by        this       time       supporters             and        police

 officers               were          carrying               casualties               on     makeshift                 stretchers             in t ha t

 direction.                      I assisted                 with          the    carrying              of     one       person         on a m a k e s h i f t

 stretcher                  to     the       gym       area.              It    was    obvious              on     arrival         at       th e    gym    that


 he         was    de a d.
 On         arrival           at       the       gym        area      I stayed              there           assisting            with        casualties

     that     were          still           alive.              A    number       were           placed           in t h e       gym     itself,          but

     some         had also             been          brought          and       just        left        lying          on    the       ground around

     the      gym.          One        young           boy      aged       about           12 y e a r s       had       been       l ef t     lying       on

     his      back          and       had        difficulty                breathing.                  I assisted                him and          directed

     3 in   ambulance                 team        to      him.

     I have            to    state           that          even at             this    stage           and       this        location          and with a

     number            of    higher              ranks         In     the       area       nobody           seemed          to    be    organising              the


     injured.

     By      this       time           a    large           number         of    ambulances                 were        arriving          at       the    ground

     and      the       injured              were           being         loaded       on.             I travelled with                     one a m b u l a n c e

      to     t h e H a l l a m s h i re                to      assist          with    a     badly           injured          person.              On my

      return           to     t he         ground,             all      the     injured               had    been       removed          to       hospital
                I must     state       that         I was            surprised               how    many        of    the    Liverpool             fans

                arrived       so    late          f or    th e       match.              It w a s        obvious       that        there       was     no w a y

                they would          all       get        i nt o      the          ground        before         3.00    pm.         I would         never

                dream      turning           up    so         late       for       a    game     with      an    obvious           capacity          ground.

                It w a s    also      obvious             that           a    large          number       of    those       arriving           after       2.00       Pn

                had    been    drinking.                      You    could             see    the       Liverpool           supporters           walking

                down     trying        to     drink            from          their       cans       as    quickly           as    possible          so   they

                were     not       confiscated                 at    the          ground.           I    remember           when       we   finally        left

                Claywheels           that         evening,               looking             up P e n i s t o n e     Road        towards         Wadsley

                 Bridge     and       seeing             the      walls           covered          with    empty        cans       and      bottles         that

                 had    been       lef t .
                 I would       also       state           that a l th o ug h                 myself       and         other       officers received a

 KENNETH FROST



 Police Constable 2967        «.



 On Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at Armthorpe at 8.15am and

 then to Doncaster DHQ for 8.45am.    We were then transported to

 Hillsborough, where a briefing was carried out.    I was on serial no 3,

 with PS 2627 Ashton in charge.    Our duty was foot patrol around the

 roundabout at the junction of Penistone Road, Leppings Lane and Herries

Road.   At this location we were to prevent any trouble between rival fans

After briefing we had a packed meal at the ground and then at about

 11.00am took up our position as directed.    I was actually situated at the

junction of Penistone Road and Herries Road.     At this location coaches

carrying Notts Forest fans were discharging their passengers on the

Herries Road Bus Garage.     Coaches carrying Liverpool fans were travelling

down Penistone Road from the Ml around the roundabout back on to Penistone

Road and on to Claywheels Lane where they discharged their passengers.

They were then to walk down Leppings Lane to enter the ground.

Even at 11.00am there was a steady stream of fans arriving by coach and

private cars.     While the majority seemed to be making their way directly

down Leppings Lane to the groun, it was also noticeable that a large

number of Liverpool fans were hanging around the area, especially in front

of the garage at'the beginning of Leppings Lane.    There did not appear to

be any trouble among the fans or between the different factions.    The

majority of supporters I saw were the Liverpool fans walking down from

Penistone Road.    Although they were boisterous there did not appear to be

any trouble fr<3m them.   It was noticed though that a large number that

were just sitting around or walking about there were all in possession of
   beer and that those arriving in the time leading up to kick off were

   hastily trying to finish their cans before they reached the ground.

   One incident that was reported to an officer in our vicinity was a young

   lad reporting a theft.    Apparently he had arrived without a ticket, he was

  offered one for sale but when he handed over the money, the seller ran off

  with both ticket and money.     This young lad was taken to the Police Room

  within the ground to make a complaint.     According to officers who attended

  the semi-final last year, they expected the majority of the crowd to be in

  the ground just after 2.00pm.     Last year evidently the streets were empty

  after 2 .15 pm, but this did not appear to happen this year.   Although the

  coaches seemed to stop arriving after about 2.00pm, it was noticed that

  between about 2.15pm and 2.30pm large numbers of Liverpool supporters

  started coming down Penistone Road in droves.     We did not know where they

  were coming from but were walking down in their hundreds it seemed.     This

  seemed to carry on until about 2.50pm.     There appeared to be no trouble

  from them, but there was plenty of shouting and singing.

 It was also during this time that all traffic was stopped from entering

 Leppings Lane, I assumed this was due to the number of supporters on the

 road. It was also noticed that -even up to about 2.45pm private cars with

_ Liverpool supporters were still arriving and expecting to find parking

 places near the ground.     It was seen that a large majority of the

 occupants were drinkihg from cans of beer or lager.

 One incident that happened was a private hire car dropping off 4 Liverpool

 supporters at the roundabout.     It was obvious they had all been drinking

 and one of them had to be supported by his friends. He seemed incapable

 of walking on his own.     They were all spoken to and advised re offences of

 trying to enter the ground drunk.     Later that afternoon after the tragedy

occurred, I again saw the one that had to be assisted, in the ground, near
 the gym, he was being helped to an ambulance with what appeared to be a

 leg injury.   He had obviously got into the ground.
                           *
At about 2.45pm it was obvious from a message we heard on the radio that

 there was problems at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.    The messages

were excited and everybody was speaking at once, but it seemed there was

difficulty in the crowd entering the ground at this location.     Even at

this time there were still large numbers of Liverpool supporters walking

down towards the Leppings Lane turnstiles.    It was during this period that

we heard on the radio repeated requests for the gates to be opened at the

Leppings Lane end, but we were not aware for what reason.

At 3*00pm our serial was planned to walk down Leppings Lane and there join

a Force Coach for standby duty before a meal.    In view of the radio

message, we made our way straight away at 3.00pm to the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.    Whiie en route, I heard a message on the radio requesting

serials that were mealing at Claywheels to go immediately to Leppings Lane

end as there was fighting taking place.   On arrival at the Leppings Lane

turnstiles there was only a small number of supporters around the

entrance.   Our serial waited with others serials at this location for

further instructions.   At this point we were not sure what was happening.

A short time later, only a matter of minutes, a South Yorkshire Ambulance

arrived at the Lepping Lane end.   It was directed into the ground.     When

it was inside I saw one person being assisted to it with a leg injury.         It

was at this time that a stream of supporters started to leave the ground

at this location.   They were all saying that it was bedlam in there, that

the game had been stopped and people were injured.     We still did not know

what had happened, but then we were ordered into the Leppings Lane

terraces and on to the pitch, but I must admit I did not know for what

purpose.
 When we went into the ground behind the West Stand, there was a steady

 stream of people leaving.   At the back of the stand there was a small

 number of people stood and laid about.    Some obviously in distress but

 some laid on the ground quite still.     I along with other officers made my

 way through the crowd in the West Stand and on to the pitch behind the

 goal.   While going through the crowd, a large amount of verbal abuse was

 being directed at us.

 As soon as I got on to the pitch,. I could not believe what I saw.   There

 was large sections of the crowd milling about and about twenty people laid

 on the ground.   At this stage I saw a number of Police Officers giving

 mouth to mouth resuscitation to people laid out on the ground.    It was

 obvious at this stage that a large number of people had been injured.

I immediately assisted with some of the injured but .it was obvious that a

 large number of people laid out were dead.    One person I went to assist

was blue in the face and his mouth was stuck wide open.     It was also at

this time that I felt a huge hatred from a large number of the Liverpool

supporters towards the Police and the club stewards.     There was also

aggression towards Notts Forest fans at the far end, and a number of

supporters tried to race to the far end to confront them.

At this time there was utter confusion in the area between the goal and

the terracing, people were spilling out and could not help tripping over

people laid out on the' grass.   It was then that the first member of the

Fire Service arrived with resuscitation equipment.    I directed one of them

to a person with breathing difficulties.

It was obvious that the casualties would have to be moved from this

location, although a large number were dead, but there was no direction as

to where to take them.   There did not appear to be any rank above Sergeant

on the pitch and the club stewards had no idea where to take them.    I was
aware the first aid room was at the other end of the ground near the gym

and by this time supporters and Police Officers were carrying casualties

on makeshift stretchers in that direction.    I assisted with the carrying

of one person on a makeshift stretcher to the gym area.     It was obvious on

arrival at the gym that he was dead.

On arrival at the gym area I stayed there assisting with casualties that

were still alive.   A number were placed in the gym itself, but some had

also been brought and just left lying on the ground around the gym.       One

young boy aged about 12 years had been left lying on his back and had

difficulty breathing.    I assisted him and directed an ambulance team to

him.

By this time a large number of ambulances were arriving at the ground and

the injured were being loaded on.   I travelled with.one ambulance to the

Hallamshire to assist with a badly injured person.     On my return to the

ground, all the injured had been removed to hospital and the dead to the

gym.

I must state that I was surprised how many of the Liverpool fans arrived

so late for the match.   It was obvious that there was no way they would

all get into the ground before -3*00pm.   I would never dream turning up so

late for a game with an obvious capacity ground.     It was also obvious that

a large number of those arriving after 2.00pm had been drinking.    You

could see the Liverpo&l supporters walking down trying to drink from their

cans as quickly as possible so they were not confiscated at the ground.         I

remember when we finally left Claywheels that evening, looking up

Penistone Road towards Wadsley Bridge and seeing the walls covered with

empty cans and bottles that had been left.

I would also state tliat although myself and other officers received a

torrent of verbal abuse and threats from a large' number of Liverpool
supporters while on the pitch, I never saw any actual violence offered to

the Police.   Later while in the area around the gym, I saw a Liverpool

supporter go up to two clut> stewards and spit in their faces and threaten

them.   This person was then forcibly ejected from the ground by myself and

another Police Officer.

I have attended a number of large matches at Hillsborough and have been on

duty at various locations inside and outside the ground.

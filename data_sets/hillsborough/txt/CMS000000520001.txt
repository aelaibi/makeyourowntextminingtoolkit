            Dear Lord Ferrers                    —
           HILLSBOROUGH : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
           Thank you for your letter of 27 June in which you confirm your stance on the
           cost of the West Midlands Police inquiry as previously explained to us at our
           meeting on 20 June.
            I have discussed your proposal further with members of the Authority and have to
            say that we also are still of the view which we explained at that meeting.
           I now understand that the West Midlands Police inquiry is perhaps being further
           extended in a way that the Police Authority has not previously considered. I
           have asked the Clerk to the Authority to clarify this with Mr Addison and will
           write to you further when we have received this information.
           Yours sincerely




           Sir John Layden JP
           Chairman

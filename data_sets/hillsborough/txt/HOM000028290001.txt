OF COMMONS,   MONDAY 11 DECEMBER 1989

"Community punishments can deprive offenders

of liberty"



In October,   my predecessor Douglas Hurd spoke about

sentencing policy and the need for offenders     to be given

their   'just deserts' .   By this he meant that the most

serious and violent offenders had to be given the

sentences   the public expected them to be given - long

custodial   sentences - both to mark the law-abiding

person's utter disgust with crimes of violence and to

ensure that the public received adequate protection.        I
should like this to be a theme of my tenure as Home

Secretary,      too,   and the announcements   I made on Friday

about parole reflect this by ensuring that in future,

sentences      served will more closely reflect the sentences

meted out by the courts.



But that was only one strand of the            'twin-track

approach'      to sentencing.    The other is that much greater

use should be made of punishment           in the community       for

those   less    serious offenders   for whom prison presents

more    than anything an opportunity to learn how to become

more professional criminals at the taxpayers'             expense.



Punishment      in the community should not be a soft option.

Nobody sentenced to a community punishment should be

able to say they        'got off with it'    or was     'let off' .     A

community penalty,        like a spell    in prison,    can and

should put a curb on an offender's           liberty,    and it can

do so in a variety of w a y s .



A probation order,        for instance,   can restrict an

offender's      freedom to live as he chooses,         for example by

imposing requirements which demand that the offender has

to structure his        life and be accountable    for his time.

And a probation order can be combined with orders                 to
keep the offender away        from opportunities   for crime -

the pub,      for example,   or the football match.     It can

also make      further demands on the offender by obliging

him to attend a day centre        for a period:    a significant

deprivation of liberty which nobody could claim amounted

to   'getting away with it'.



Another example      is the Community Service Order,     under

which the offender is obliged to do between forty and

240 hours of supervised work in the community,           often

over a series of evenings or weekends        if he has a dayÂ­

time   job.     For many this can be tougher than prison:

hard work,      for example clearing waste ground or cleaning

graffiti      from subway walls can be far more demanding

than discussing the finer points of burglary with a

cell-mate.       It obliges the offender to give back to

society    some recompense    for the damage his criminal

activity has done,      and because he can continue to work,

he may also be able to compensate his victims directly.



Community     Service and Probation are separate      sentences

in England and Wales,        although they can be combined in

Scotland.       I would like to see the English courts given

that extra element of flexibility,        too.     For the

persistent property offender a comparatively long period
of work combined with close supervision may be the best

guarantee against repeat offending,           particularly   if he

can be helped to sort out any problems which may have

contributed to his crimes.           Many   thefts and burglaries

are committed       for money    for drugs or drink.



I believe,    too,    that there is a need      for courts    to have

powers   to make curfew orders,        confining offenders       to

their homes at certain times.           Of course,    this should

not be a twenty-four hour house arrest.              They need to

be able to go to work if they have a job,              attend

training courses or probation centres,           or receive

treatment    for alcohol or drug misuse.



But some types of crime - pub brawls,            for example,     or

car theft - could be reduced by curfew orders.                  I very

much hope    that our experiments with electronic

monitoring will enable          it to be extended from defendants

on remand to sentenced offenders,           so as to make a curfew

order property enforceable.



Some would argue that a curfew order,            enforced by means

of an electronic       tag,   represents an infringement of

civil    liberty.     The argument    is a nonsense.     When the

alternative    is the total deprivation of liberty by a
prison sentence,    a curfew order which enables one at

least to stay in one's own home     is a substantial

improvement both    in terms of freedom and comfort.

Nobody who had been to gaol would seek to deploy       that

argument,    I think!



Punishment    in the Community can and should be tough and

demanding.     It should provide some protection for the

public and should help break the offending cycle.       The

combination of measures     I have outlined will enable us

to achieve    those ends.

Dear Sir,

In response to the tragic events at Hillsborough, Liverpool City Council
has formed a Hillsborough Working Party to ensure the submission of proper
evidence to Lord Justice Taylor Inquiry.

Without prejudicing your involvement with the Inquiry - thus entering the
realms of subjudice - could you please furnish to me your comments and
assistance to the following points

    A list of actual attendances for all League, Cup and neutral venue
    games held at Hillsborough from 1980 up to and including March 1989.

-   The date when the Spion Kop capacity was increased, and what effect this
    had on Hillsborough capacity.

    The date(s) when perimeter fencing was fitted to the Hillsborough Stadium.

    A breakdown, section by section, of the attendance for the April, 1988
    semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

Yours s i n c e r e l y ___________

Chair- Hillsborough Working Party.

Dear Sir,

t arc in receipt of ycur letter dated 16th Nay 1989.

Like yourselves, .-c the present tine I .-n enlaced on a full tinebasispreparing
evidence for submission to Lord Justice Baylor's Enquiry, An additional problem
has been that the vast majority of my files have been handed over to tvest
midlands Police.

X have passed    copy of your letter ever to our Solicitors and I trust that
together v;e will be able to furnish the information you require, I would,
however, stress that all of us are working exceedingly long hours at present   and
therefore there nay be a delay in this natter.

I trust you will understand.

You re 'sincerely,

I,     MATTHEW       BHBPPARD,       of   ____
                            I WILL STATE:-


I am a Chartered Accountant by profession and X am Chairman of
my    own    group     of     Companies.         I   am   also   a   Director      and
Vice-Chairman         of    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.              I am     a
life-long          supporter of the Club and have been a Director                  for
some 18 years now, the last 14 years as Vice-Chairman.                        I have
special      responsibility for financial affairs and in general I
would       say that I look at financial and management accounts of
the     Company more critically and speak for the Board on                      those
matters.       We     are     however basically a          non-executive      Board,
although       a     Board whose members take a very             active     interest
indeed in the affairs of the Club.                   The Chairman will take the
majority       of executive decisions required of the Board,                    after
consultation         with other Board members.             If for any reason the
Chairman is away and cannot perform that function I will do it
as Vice-Chairman*


The Company Secretary is Graham Mackrell, and he has executive
responsibility          for all matters connected with the Club                 other
than the playing of football itself.


As     a    member     of the Board X ant aware that the             Club    retains
Eastwood       & Partners as Consulting Engineers whose duty it has
been       for some years now to do inspections, of the stadium, and
they       report to the Club and recommend what work they feel                     is
needed to keep the stadium up to the standard of a first class
socoer       stadium.         They   also    are involved for        the    Club    in
meetings       with     the     Working Party set up         under    the    present
                                                    -     2 -



Sheffield            City        Council        pursuant        to the    Safety       of      Sports
Grounds Act*


in     broad terms I would say that any work to the stadium which
requires             substantial          expenditure is normally                discussed           and
approved             by    the Board before it is done*                    Relatively           small
expenditure               does       not need Board sanction, although there                          is
not     to my knowledge a financial limit set on work that can be
done        without Board approval*                      Even relatively expensive                 work
can     be done without a formal Board meeting to approve it,                                         if
it     is     urgent           - in those circumstances I would                       expect       that
either the Chairman or, in his absence, myself would deal with^
a request to sanction the expenditure and would, i£ necessary,
ring        round         other        Board     members        informally       to     get     their
agreement.


I     have       a        broad        knowledge of the major items               of     work        and
expenditure on the Ground over the years*                                 X can recall as far
back «« the early 195Q's, when cement became readily available
after        the       war        that        one of the first major          jobs       the       Club
carried          out was concreting of the Kop to provide a safer                                    and
better surface for spectators standing there.


In 1961/62 the North Stand was constructed*                                To the be8t of my
knowledge              this       was the first cantilevered stand built                        in     a
sports           stadium          in     this    country, at a then          cost        of     about
£150,000*                 Because of that and the facilities offered b y                             the
stadium           generally             the     Ground    was selected as             one     of     the
Grounds for staging the World                           Cup in England in 1966, and                as a
result           the      West         Stand was then built          to     accommodate            more
seated spectators.


More        recently           the       Kop area       was substantially         extended           and
covered           at       the. coot of approximately film*                   This       work        was
completed              in about 1986*            We have also c^rried:out some major
work        on       the      South       Stand*        As I recall       this    followed           the
Sheffield              City Council taking over as the Licensing Authority

                                                                                                ••t ••

from        the     old     South   Yorks. County         Council,    and     was        also
following           the     fire at Bradford*     We were asked to line                  with
steel         the        base of the South Stand and this            was     done.           It
involved           removing all the seats, putting in the steel                     lining
and     replacing the seats, all at a cost of about £50/000*                                 We
have         also        been asked to reproof the South         Stand        within          a
period        of     5 years expiring in about 1992, and plans                     are       at
present afoot to do that.


I am reminded that in 1985 work was done to the turnstile area
at     Leppings Lane.            I have at present no clear recollection as
to     the        schemes put forward by Eastwood & Partners but                        I    am
certain that in deciding on the scheme to be implemented there
was          no     safety issue      involved.       I    cannot,     for     example,
recollect           any discussion as to whether additional                  turnstiles
were        required at that end of the Ground to avoid any build-up
of     supporters           seeking to get in for a match.            We would           have
adopted the most cost-effective scheme consistent with keeping
up     the standards we have always sought to maintain, of having
a     stadium        with    first class facilities for          members        of          the
public.            In particular I can confirm where matters of                     safety
are     concerned           the Club has never hesitated to implement                       any
neaessary            measures       and   financial       constraints       have        never
prevented the carrying out of such work.


I     was     present on 15th April when the semi-final was                        played.
-£±£1 arrived at the Ground at about mid-day but from then until
just before kick-off I was involved in hosting a reception for
F.A.         officials, also officials of the 2 participating                        Clbbs
and     civic dignitaries of Sheffield, Liverpool and Nottingham,
with        other        guests«     I only went out to my position                in       the
Directors'           box    minutes before the kick-off and                subsequently
when I did notice spectators climbing over the perimeter fence
at     the        Leppings Lane end I at first thought it was \ a                       pitch
invasion           and     did   not realise that a         tragic    situation             had
occurred.            There is nothing that I can add to the information
                                     - 4 -




already     available as to the events which occurred on that day
which would assist the Inquiry.


I   have read this Statement and it is true and correct to    the
best of my knowledge! and belief.

once        they        had       come through the turnstiles, for                 they        would
normally           be       coming through at such a rate that it                    would           be
possible           for        Stewards       to direct them in a           particular           way.
Similarly           the        gate in the dividing wall at the rear                      of        the
west        stand          which      divides the area behind turnstiles A                      -     G
from        the     area covered by turnstiles 1 1 - 1 6 would be                          manned
by      Stewards,              even    though       it   was    open    throughout              that
afternoon,              and       those Stewards would also            direct       spectators
towards           the       standing     area in pens 5, 6 and 7 in                 the        north
west        corner.           I would not expect our Stewards to be                   standing
on     the terraces themselves because it is not an easy task                                       to
ask     a     Steward to stand on the terraces                       surrounded       by       Away
fans for any football match.


In     conclusion I have been asked to comment on two matters                                       in
case it should be felt that they had any bearing on the tragic
events        of 15th April - they relate to the provision of                                  first
aid equipment and loudhailers for Stewards•


In     1988       the        Local Authority           Environmental       Health         Officer
inspected          with specific reference to this item and wanted the
Club     to provide such equipment as was considered necessary by
the St. John's Ambulance Brigade.                         I spoke to Peter Wells, the
Duty     Officer of the St. John's Ambulance, Sheffield area, and
he provided me with an extract from a booklet listing what was
required*              I     gave     that     to                    who     organised           the
purchase          of        the     equipment.         I am    not   aware      whether          the
Environmental                Health Officer came back to check that they had
been purchased.


St.     John's          Ambulance Brigade are responsible                    for     providing
first       aid        cover        at the Ground during matches.                  This     is       a
standard          arrangement           with     the     Football      League       and     as       I
understand             that they undertake to provide adequate first                             aid
cover.        They          will have details of our Fixture List                     for        the
Season       and        a     degree     of local knowledge as             to   the       likely
attendances.                 If there is any variation in that Fixture                         List
                                                 - 21 -




they      are        notified         and    they are also    notified     of    special
occasions such as the holding of an F.A. Cup semi-final at the
Ground.          They        were sent a letter prior to the match on                  15th
April      this year and asked to provide adequate cover and                           they
confirmed they would do so.


Prior to the incident the Club provided no loudhailers for the
use     of Stewards but I was aware that the Police had them                            for
their      own use.          The Tannoy system was in my view the               way     to
deal      with         any announcements that needed to be made                 to     the
crowd      and        the system            is such   that   announcements      can     be
directed         to        particular sections of the Ground including                 out
into the Leppings Lane area to people outside the turnstiles.


The     number of safety stewards we employ is not a factor which
is     raised for discussion at Safety Committee meetings in                            my
experience            of     attending such meetings.          I believe     that      the
Club      would stand comparison with virtually any other Club                          in
the     country in relation to the number that we do employ on                           a
regular        basis, and those numbers can be increased for certain
matches         if     a     large crowd is expected, this          being       done    by
agreement between Doug Lock and the senior stewards.


I     have read this Statement and it is true and correct to                           the
best of my knowledge and belief.

If                         of
SAY AS FOLLOWS


I was born on the 11th February 1933.                               I am employed as



I    started working for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about
24 years ago on a part time basis in the stile room,                                             or gate
room      organising             the       turnstile        operators       and        checking         the
takings.         I   am still responsible for the stile room,                                    and    for
about     the        last       15     to     18    years     I    have     been          referred       to
unofficially as the senior or head steward.


This     title       is     due      in     part    to my     being       one     of      the     longest
serving         stewards,            but     principally          because       of     my       role     in
supervising          the    stile room,             and in recent years                by       assisting
Doug Lock, the Club's Security Officer.


My principal duties are to take charge of the stile room and to
ensure     that       the       established          working       procedures          are      complied
with by turnstile operators.                         I am responsible for the movement
of   money       and       for       League        games    sums     in    excess          of    £35,000
are involved.             It is right to say that I am directly concerned
with the        security implications                  for the       safety          of    this    money
and the staff who are responsible for taking the money.                                                This
is   of paramount            importance with regard to League                             games.         Of
course    for an FA Cup match which is all ticket,                                        no money       is
taken,     but       again        I    am     still        concerned       with        the      security
implications as tickets perhaps to the value of                                      £500,000 have
been     sold    and       I do        have    responsibility             for   those        turnstile
operators        who       take        those       tickets,        and    who     may        encounter
problems.


My role involves the following

1.        Supervision          and    responsibility         for   the    stile      room.      The
          stile room is responsible for issuing floats to turnstile
          operators,       issuing money to the Chief Stewards to enable
          them    to     pay    their     stewards,       checking        the    takings       from
          turnstile operators and from programme sellers, or tickets
          where appropriate.


2.        Preparing the paperwork to record the number of turnstiles
          in use and to be made available for certain areas of the
          ground       based     upon        information       provided         by     the     Club
          administration         and giving instructions to                 those       employed
          in the stile room to prepare the sheets to be issued to
          each turnstile operator.


3*        Inspecting the turnstiles before each match to ensure that
          the correct signs are properly displayed, and to check the
          allocation of turnstiles against the information provided
          by the Club administration.


4.        Carrying       out         further     inspections         of     turnstiles           at
          intervals around the ground, and dealing with any problems
          that may arise.             For example,       suspected forged tickets or
          insufficient   float  money,                  or    where        (on       very      rare
          occasions) a turnstile jams.


5.        Preparing      the     paperwork       to     record     the    expenses       of    the
          referee,     linesmen,        reserve officials,          and paying the same
          (usually the expenses are agreed about                         30 minutes before
          kick off and the officials are paid after the match).


I    am    not    responsible          for     the    stewards     in     the    terraces       or
stands.  Nor am I responsible for the training and recruitment
of stewards.


On   match       days,     I    am    responsible       for    preparing         the    list    of



Signed                                                    Dated

turnstiles,        noting any instructions given by Sharon Lane,                                      the
Administration Manager,                     as to the number to be made available
and      the     type       of    ticket       to     accept      through           a    particular
turnstile.             I    am    not        concerned      with        the    allocation              of
turnstiles        as       I comply with the              instructions        given       to me        by
Sharon Lane.           I understand that the allocation of turnstiles is
a matter        to be agreed between senior                      Club     officials         and       the
Police,        and Sharon Lane simply provides me with instructions.                                    I
normally prepare this list the night before a match.                                      From this
list,     those        working         in    the    stile    room       allocate          turnstile
operators to the turnstiles as and when they arrive and in the
event of a League game, those turnstile operators are provided
with floats.


A turnstile operator is not allocated to a particular turnstile
fit every match and therefore could be deployed at any turnstile
around the ground. However, where there may be difficulties in
taking     money       owing      to    the    variety      of   tickets,           or    different
amounts of cash being handed over, we normally arrange                                       for an
experienced turnstile operator to work that turnstile.                                      Shortly
after    the     kick off, the turnstile operators close                                 down their
turnstiles and then attend the stile room to hand                                        over their
takings.


A   new turnstile operator is normally put with                                an       experienced
turnstile        operator in            that       they   work     side       by        side.     The
turnstile        operator        does        not need direct training as                   it    is    a
very simple matter to operate the turnstile itself.                                      Up to 1985
I was rarely involved with any duties outside the stile room.


In 1985 Doug Lock was appointed as Security Officer.                                        He    has
overall    responsibility              for     security which           of    course       involves
the   financial            implications        of    security       with      regard        to    the
turnstiles,       which is my specific area of responsibility.                                   I do
have a Club radio.               Prior to a match I normally walk around the
ground and pay attention to the turnstiles and deal with                                          any

 P ^ o b l ^ s that might arise*               Doug Lock if he becomes aware of a
 problem          can    contact       me     by   radio     and        direct        me     to   the
 turnstiles.             Other than this, I do not have any responsibility
 for security as Doug Lock is in charge. He is able to keep in
contact       with        the    chief       stewards      by    radio,         and        also   has
 information provided by the computer count and the TV screens
located in the Club's control room.                         However,          if I witnessed a
security problem,               say by spectator violence,                I would of course
contact Doug Lock or any nearby Police.


I now turn to my involvement in the events which took place on
the 15th April 1989.


I    arrived at the ground at 8.30 am.                       I   made an inspection of
the     turnstiles         at    the     ground     shortly        after       my     arrival•      I
started my inspection at the Leppings Lane end.                                I checked that
the    correct          signs   were    displayed       outside         the    turnstiles         and
found that everything was in order.


The ground is signposted A-0 in that above each turnstile there
is a form of entrance lettering, and the entrance letter should
match       the    entrance       letter      referred      to     on    the     ticket.          The
turnstiles are numbered                 1-88 which includes A-G turnstiles at
the Leppings Lane end. ' At the Leppings Lane end turnstiles 1-
16 and A-G are located.                     It was agreed for the match that A-G
turnstiles would be Used for the Leppings Lane end standing,                                       1—
10    for    the North stand seating and 11-16                      for       the     West    stand
seating.  The lettering above the turnstiles was "A" for 1-10,
"C" for 11-16, and "B" for A-G.


I checked the entrance lettering against the instructions given
by Sharon Lane.             It was      important to check that the                        entrance
lettering was correct as 1-8 turnstiles are normally used for
the North stand, but on this occasion 2 extra turnstiles were
provided as 12 turnstiles normally used for the North stand at
the Penistone Road end were not available.

My primary concern was with the                       entrance lettering,                 but there
is also another form of signposting in that                                signs about           10-12
inches square denote that particular area of the ground served
by     a    turnstile.         * At the Leppings Lane              end,      there    were       signs
denoting           the    North    stand.       West        stand,      and     Leppings            Lane
standing.           I do not specifically remember checking this form of
signposting, but these signs were displayed.


I then prepared the turnstile                   operator's sheets by noting down
the turnstiles for each area, and the type of ticket                                       for each
turnstile by reference to the entrance lettering.                                     I    provided
the        lists    to    the    men    working       in    the      stile     room       who       then
proceeded to             allocate       turnstile      operators          to    the       available
turnstiles.


I     regarded       the       signposting      outside           the     turnstiles           to    be
adequate as the ticket clearly shows the entrance letter,                                           and
this       can     be matched up with the              entrance         letter       outside        the
turnstiles.              The    other    type    of     signing         is     also       adequate.
However,         I am aware at the match that in effect the entrance
lettering ran A-C-B.               It would have been preferable to have the
entrance lettering in proper order A-B-C.                            This in fact has now
been put into operation.for the 1989/1990 season.


I made a second inspection of the turnstiles at about 11.30 a m
just       after     the       turnstiles       opened.           The     purpose         of     this
inspection was to ensure that all the turnstiles were open and
working properly.               Whilst outside at the Leppings Lane end the
turnstile operators to turnstiles 8 and 9 drew my attention to
a barrier dividing those turnstiles. The lettering above those
turnstiles          matched      the    tickets,       ie    entrance         letter       "A"      was
displayed.


Those turnstile operators had told me that Stuart Thorpe, Chief
Steward for the West stand,                  had drawn their attention to                           the

barrier.         At     the       back    of    the     Leppings         Lane    turnstiles,           I
noticed the dividing rails behind those turnstiles separated                                           8
and 9 turnstile. It had of course been agreed in advance to use
1-10     turnstiles         for    the    North       stand    and       11-16    for    the     West
stand.       As the gate was- left dividing 8 and 9,                             I radioed Doug
Lock and we agreed that the dividing rail                                should be        unlocked
and with the use of a hand rail to create a barrier                                        between
turnstiles 10 and 11.   Doug Lock also stated that two stewards
be deployed on the barrier.


Stuart       Thorpe     confirmed         to    me      that      two    stewards        would    be
deployed to deter any fan from climbing over the barrier and he
would     also see that the barrier was put in place.                                    I did    in
fact witness the barrier being put in place, and I confirmed to
Doug Lock what had been done.                        The operation was completed in
minutes.        I     noticed      that    the    barrier         was     in     place    from    my
position outside the turnstiles.


Whilst outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles I recall two minor
incidents which occurred at about midday.                               The first involved a
young couple, both Liverpool fans, who were seeking permission
to enter        the Leppings Lane end with tickets purchased for                                 the
Kop end.        The    tickets had         been purchased on the black market.
(Both complained that they had paid in excess of the face value
for the tickets).              The*couple explained that the Police would
not    let     them    go   round    to    the       Kop    end    as    they     were    clearly
dressed as Liverpool               supporters.          I had no authority to allow
the fans to gain entry at the Leppings Lane end, but I asked a
senior    Police       Officer      at the Leppings Lane                  end     if    these    two
fans could go in at that end.                    He was a senior officer and said
that     the    two     fans      could        not be      allowed       entry.         I do     not
remember        what I was told,           save that the reason or one of                        the
reasons given was to control numbers.                              I informed the couple
who then went away.                I accepted and always have accepted that
the Police have the right to say yes or no on such matters.                                        I
was obliged to accept the Police direction as they had control

over fans entering the turnstiles.


The     second          incident    occurred       when    a     Police     Sergeant,         again
outside the turnstiles, showed me some tickets which the Police
suspected were forgeries.                   The Police Sergeant told me that the
tickets           had    been    found     in     the    possession        of     a    Liverpool
supporter.              I do not remember my conversation in                      detail      with
the Police Officer, save that I was informed that the Liverpool
supporter          had     in    his     possession       an    unreasonable          number     of
tickets.           The Police Sergeant said half a dozen.                         The Sergeant
also told me that the Liverpool supporter had been taken to the
Police room.             I was not informed of the background to how this
supporter had been stopped and taken to the Police room.


I was        asked      to identify whether the                 tickets    were       genuine    or
not.     The       tickets were          for     the    North    stand.      I took       two    or
three    to       examine       them.     I could        not    tell   whether        they    were
forgeries or not.                I am of course aware of the type of ticket
that is issued.             They looked genuine, but I thought it right to
refer the matter to Sharon Lane as she was able to check the
water mark which is invisible except under a certain type                                        of
light.        I     decided        to take the tickets to Sharon Lane whom                        I
met    on my way to the main reception area.                              I showed      her     the
tickets       and       she assured       me     that    the     tickets     were       genuine.
I went back to the Police Sergeant at the Leppings Lane end to
inform him what I had been told, and I heard no more about the
matter.


I then returned to the stile room.                         I did not go back to the
Leppings       Lane       end   again     that    day.     Between        about    midday       and
1.30 pm I did try to walk up the lane from the car park area
outside the South stand to the Leppings Lane end on one or two
occasions but was told by the Police that they preferred me not
to    walk    up     the   lane     as    they    were    attempting       to     deter      other
people from doing the same, ie fans, and it would not look good
if    I walked through.             I was of course dressed in a suit.                          The

 purpose of the intended visit was to ensure that the turnstiles
were open and working properly.                       If the turnstile does            jam or
there     is   some    other problem,            it   is    likely to      occur at       some
point     shortly after          the turnstiles            open.    However,     I was     not
too concerned by            not being able to gain access to the Leppings
Lane     end   as   the     Club       has its    own      camera system     which       shows
pictures of the area behind the turnstiles.                          If    there had been
any     problems,      I would     have     been      contacted by         radio by      Doug
Lock.    In carrying out this type of inspection I was responsible
for the South stand and the Leppings Lane end.


In the stile room I had a cup of tea and prepared the paperwork
to pay the referee and other match officials.                          I was in or near
the stile room for about an hour and in this period I had some
lunch.     I left the stile room at about 1.15 pm to 1.30 pm.


Between about 1.30 pm to kick off at 3.00 pm,                          I was positioned
in or near the players tunnel.                    During this period I did go to
the    club    control          room    on perhaps         6 or    7occasions.        Police
Constable      Guest      and   Roger     Houldsworth         are based     in   the     Club
control room.          On some occasions Doug Lock was present in the
room, but I cannot remember who was present on each occasion.


I went to the Club control room to keep myself informed of the
overall numbers entering the ground. It was not something I was
told    to do.      I remember that Roger gave me a figure                       on    those
occasions.     I cannot recall any figures given,                     nor any comments
made on those figures.                 I may have spoken to Doug Lock on one
of those occasions, but cannot remember.


At about 2.15 to 2.30 pm I agreed the expenses with the referee
and    other   match      officials.       I was        in the     referee's     room.      I
took the figures back to the stile room and arranged for one of
the stile men to make up the expenses to provide to the match
officials after the match.

Normally,        at League games             I am preoccupied with                  dealing       with
any problems that may arise in the taking of money by turnstile
operators*            For an FA Cup match where no money is involved and
simply      tickets,         there     is     not    the    same       need    for    me     to     be
positioned near the turnstiles and it is more appropriate                                          for
me to be        located near the Club control room so that                                I can     be
directed at any moment by Doug Lock to a particular turnstile
area.       I     do     not    have    any     specific         duties       in    relation       to
security        other        than     those     mentioned          with       regard        to    the
financial        implications           of    moving       money       in     and    around       the
ground.         Whilst at the pitch end of the tunnel I did notice the
ground filling up but I did not notice any crowd problems.                                        The
players tunnel is of course part of the South stand which is a
seated area.           I was too far away to tell whether there were any
crowd problems on the terraces at the Kop end or the Leppings
Lane end.         I     should add that I am not instructed by Doug Lock
to keep a visual check on whether certain parts of the ground
are filling up.


Between 2.30           and 3.00 pm I had a number of conversations with
Doug Lock.            I must confess that I cannot be certain as to the
timings of these conversations as my memory of events is vague
and I can only explain this by reference to the horrific events
that    took     place       at Hillsborough as            I was       deeply       effected       by
what    happened        at     the    ground,       with    so    many      people        dead    and
injured.        On one of those occasions, I remember discussing with
Doug     Lock     that       the     centre    pens    at        the    Leppings          Lane    end
appeared to be full but there                   was ample room in the wing pens.
I was not concerned as it is quite normal for the centre pens
to   fill   more quickly than the wing pens.                            Many       fans    like    to
stand behind the goal.                  I could not tell how full the centre
pens    were     from my position,             and certainly I did                  not    see    any
signs of distress.


I also remember a further conversation with Doug Lock when he
came up to me and said that he had just received a report that

a   gate        had     been       opened    at     the    Leppings        Lane        end.        This
conversation took place at the pitch end of the tunnel.                                            I do
not remember whether this was before or after the players came
onto the pitch.               Doug Lock said that he was going back to the
Club control            room. We were both very surprised but I                               assumed
that     the     situation was under                Police control*


I   also        remember that on one                of the two       occasions when I did
have     a      conversation with            Doug     Lock    that    he     said there            were
2,000      to      3,000    fans     still    outside,       but     there       was   sufficient
room     in     the wing pens to take them.                    Whilst        I    remember         this
comment         being      made,    I cannot remember whether                    it was       on    the
occasion of the first or the second conversation.


As the game started, I noticed fans climbing onto the perimeter
track.         I pointed out to a Police Sergeant the number of                                    fans
getting         onto the perimeter track, but he                     said that the              Police
at that         end could deal with any problems.                    I made my way to the
Club control room, but met Doug Lock coming towards me                                        in the
tunnel.         I   told     him that people were              coming      over        the      safety
fence.        I next remember the referee leading the players off the
pitch•


More    and      more      fans    were     coming    over     the    safety       fence        and   a
large number were running across the pitch.                                I tried to              keep
the fans out of the tunnel.                    Some wanted to follow the players
down     the     tunnel.          The   Police      initially were           trying        to      keep
people off          the pitch.          There was a certain amount of taunting
from the         Nottingham Forest supporters who                     obviously were                not
aware of what had happened.                       For that matter,         nor was           I aware
of what had happened at the Leppings Lane terraces.


I then received word of mouth reports stating that a number of
people       had    been     injured,        this    was     followed      by     reports          that
there were a number dead.                    I could not believe it. I overheard
requests        for     stretchers        from      fans   on the      pitch.          I     believe

 these requests may have been made to the ground staff who were
 in the tunnel.     I remember               fans     stripping     the     advertising
 hoarding around the pitch.


Although I had the Club radio, there was far too much noise and
it was not possible to hear any message relayed over the radio.
From there the situation got more and more chaotic.                            There were
hundreds       of people on the pitch.              It was total confusion.                   I
witnessed the scene from the player's tunnel.


I was at the pitch end of the tunnel until about 3.20 pm. After
that     I     retreated      to   the   top   of     the     tunnel     and     assisted
spectators as best I could.                For example, many wanted access to
telephones.           I was   also   responsible       for     turning     people       away
from the players room and referees room. Between about 3.20 to
3.45     pm I may well have gone to the Club control                           room   again
although        I    cannot    remember      with     any     certainty.         This     is
important       as I do recall someone saying that a gate had been
broken       down,    but   upon' checking      the    TV     screens     in    the     Club
control room I could not find any gate having been broken down.
I cannot remember who told me this, nor do I remember the time,
but it is likely that this occurred after 3.20 pm.


Doug Lock came up to me at about 3.45 pm and told me that                                 if
the    game    was abandoned we had to ensure that                  the    exit       gates
were    manned       and opened.     Doug sent me to the            South       stand    to
ensure        that the exit gates were all manned and opened.                         Most
of the spectators were             still    inside the ground.            I knew        from
Doug Lock that both the Kop end and the Leppings Lane end exit
gates were open and manned.              The announcement at that stage had
still not been made to abandon the game.


As    I went    off to ensure that those exit gates were opened,                          I
noticed a       fireman behind the Police control room in the                         lane
and    near    the    car park attempting to           administer       some     form    of
resuscitation to someone lying in the road and an ambulance was

 called from the bottom of the car park in the South stand,                                 and
 the injured person was put m                  that ambulance and taken away.                    X
was shocked by the sight of a Liverpool fan who must have been
 taken through the uncovered seated area in the South stand to
 the lane.


The   abandon     message       was announced at 4.10               pm.     It was        still
total     confusion.        I   did    not      really    know      what    had     happened
although I had of course heard reports of fatalities.


I called home to reassure my wife that both myself and my                                  son
were okay.       I walked about in or near the player's tunnel and
stile    room trying to keep fans away from the                           tunnel    and    the
official     areas.       I was also checking to ensure                    the     turnstile
operators     had returned.           I was listening to their                   stories    of
what had happened at the Leppings Lane end.                         Towards the end of
the   afternoon       I   was   detailed         together       with   four       others    to
collect    the    programme        money        which    had    been      stored     in    the
gymnasium.       The      programme        money    is    normally        stored     in    the
gymnasium.       I do not remember who asked me to do this task.                            It
was not a pleasant task as we discovered that the other end of
the   gym was     being     used      as   a    mortuary.       I   believe       that    this
happened    at   about     5.00 pm.            We collected      the      money    from the
head programme        salesman.        The money was in bags and consisted
mostly of coins.          About 20,000 - 30,000 programmes are sold per
match.     I then went back to the stile room and was in the stile
room until about 7.00 pm when I went home.


Doug Lock did tell me on the day that he had received a report
from Police that one turnstile operator was seen taking money.
That was the only incident of this nature to my knowledge.


This statement is given to the best of my knowledge and belief.

 THE POLICE WERE SLOW TO OFFER ANY HELP TO THE SUPPORTERS IN THE CRUSH.         PEOPLE

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD VIA THE PA SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTERS HAD DIED.         I HEARD

♦                   TRANSISTOR RADIO IT WOULD HAVE SAVED ALL THE TROUBLE ON THE

 PITCH.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS WRONG. LIVERPOOL HAVE MUCH LARGER FOLLOWING.

 THEREFORE REQUIRE MORE TICKETS.    LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE HAD THE KOP END OR THE

 GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLAYED AT OLD TRAFFORD.      THERE SHOULD BE MORE MEDICAL

 EQUIPMENT, STRETCHERS AND OXYGEN AND TRAINED MEDICAL S T A F F .

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?
 I THINK LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE HAD A BIGGER ALLOCATION OF THE TICKETS.        THERE

 WERE PEOPLE WHO HAD ATTENDED EVERY MATCH, AND OBVIOUSLY IF THEY DIDN'T GET

 ANY TICKETS,      I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TURNED UP ANYWAY.   I ALSO THINK

 THAT THERE WAS INADEQUATE CONTROL AND DIRECTION OF THE QUEUES OUTSIDE AND

 ALSO AFTER THE GATE WAS OPENED FOR NOT BLOCKING OFF THE CENTRE TUNNEL, BECAUSE

 I COULD SEE FROM WHERE I WAS THAT PENS 2 & 6 WERE NOT FULL.

 Q49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR         IN THE DEATHS,    OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 WHEN WE WENT DOWN I WAS PINNED ON TOP OF ANDREW.          IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE

 WERE PEOPLE UNDERNEATH HIM AS W E L L .      I THINK THAT THERE WAS ABOUT TWO PEOPLE

 ON TOP OF ME.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

             LOOKING FOR IT.   I O ON-T R E M E H B E R S E E I N G A N Y T H I N G .

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED.

 I WENT TO THE REAR OF THE WEST STAND WHERE TWO OR THREE AMBULANCES SEEMED TO

BE WAITING FOR THE INJURED,        BUT THERE WERE PEOPLE RUNNING ABOUT EVERYWHERE.

 I C A N 5T REALLY COMMENT BECAUSE WE WERE STRAIGHT OUT AND TO HOSPITAL.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

^jpICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE THING WHICH UPSET ME MOST WAS THE INSENSITIVE COMMENTS MADE IN SOME AREAS

 OF THE MEDIA.

 WHEN CRITICISED FOR ALLOCATING LIVERPOOL THE LEPPING LN END OF THE GROUND,                   THE

 FA SAID THAT IT WOULD BE TOO DIFFICULT TO ROUTE THE LIVERPOOL FANS TO THE

 OTHER END.     HOWEVER, ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE GAME THE AA HAD SAID THAT THE

 RE-ROUTING OF LIVERPOOL FANS WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITH ONLY SLIGHT ALTERATIONS

 TO EXISTING PLANS    (LIVERPOOL ECHO).

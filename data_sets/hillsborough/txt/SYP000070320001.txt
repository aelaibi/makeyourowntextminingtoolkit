                  I am a           lifelong           Liverpool             supporter          and a Hop           season       ticket        holder,

                 On S at ur d ay             15th A p r i l         1989         (1 5 0 4 S 9 ) I w e n t     to    the F A C u p        semi       final

                  match           between Liverpool                   and        Nottingham           Forest       at ,Hi1 1 s b o r o u g h .       I got

                 my     ticket           from Anfieid.                     The    ticket       was     for L e p p i n g s     Ln     standing.

                  I    travelled             to    the      game       alone        and    by    train.         I left         home     at a b o u t

                  11.00 am              ( 1 100)      and    caught          a t r a i n at          about    11.30 am          (1130)        from Lime

                  St    station            in L i v e r p o o l.            There      were      other       football          supporters           on   the

                 train,            it w a s a f o o t b a l l              special.         There        were      no    problems        on    the

                  journey           and      I arrived            in S h e f f i e l d at            about    1.30       pm.      (1330)         I d o n ’t

                  know       the        n am e   of    the     station,             it w a s     the m a i n       one    in the        city     centre.

                  When       I got         off     the      train          there     were       buses      laid     on    to    t ake    us    to    the

                  ground.               I think        there        were         police     officers          on    the    buses        travelling
                                                                                                                                         PAGE            2
                                                                                                                                         S1458

with    us.         We w e r e          dropped          off       in L e p p i n q s    L n at a b o u t           2.00       orrt.       (1 4 Q 0 )

This    was        just       opposite          the        entrance          to    the       football          ground.              I decided

not    to    go     in s t r a i g h t         away and             so    I walked           past       the    entrance

and    to a        chip       shop       just       up     the      road.         I queued          for       chips a nd            then

stood       outside           the       chip    shop eating                them,        u n t i 1 about          2.20        pm     <1420)

when a        police          off i c e r / o n       horseback            started           ushering          us     towards            the

entrance           to    the       ground.            Whilst          outside       the       ground          I saw       peopie

drinking           aj. cobdl         but      I did        not      see    anyone        who       was     dru nk.

When    I reached              the       entrance             to    the    ground        a    couple          of m i n u t e s          later,

there       were        about        four      mounted             owicers         in the          r oad      telling          people          to

move    into        the       entrance.               There         we re a       lot    of       people       around.              There

Were    no       queues        as       such,       >Cist a m a s s          of    people          standing           together,

almost       b ack       to    the       bluy metal                gates    at     Leppings             Ln.      I have            been       to

Hillsborough              before j /o           I     knew where             the    turnstiles                were.          I went           into

the    crowd and              headed          towards          the       turnstiles.              Once        I was       in the           crowd

I was       virtually              forced       to       go a l o n g      with     them.           It     became         very          cro w d e d ,

but    I am        used       to    these       sgort         of    crow d s      and,       therefore,             w a s n ’t w o r r i e d .

There       was     a    po 1 i ce             i cer standing               at     the       turns/K l e         and      I could             see    a

few more           inside                  ground.             I went       thr&ugh           I^Ke t u r n s t i l e        and         handed

in my       ticket.                                                                 V-/

Once    inside           the       ground       I went             towards        the    tunnel          which        l e ads       to     pens      3

behind       the        goal       so    I went          through          the     tunnel.           There        were        no     p o 1 i ce or

stewards           at    the       entrance           to      the    tunnel.            I walked           through          the         tunnel

which       wa s    clear          of y p e o p l e      at    t his      time     and       at    the     far      end     of      it     I went

front       of     the    pen.          People           kept       falling        forwards             and    then       recovering

again.                This     was      because           of    people          coming         in f r o m       the    back       and

pushing               their       way     through          the       crowd.             This       happened       constantly with

people             squeezing            through           to    find a          position.                I was    by n o w        standing

about          ten feet            from        the    front          of    pen 3.             There       were    two       girls       standing

a       couple         of    feet       in f r o n t       of me.             I noticed             them    because          they       seemed

to       be    the         only    females           in t h a t / a r e a .             Both       appeat/ed to         be    in       their

late          teens         and    had     dark            jr .      I think            one    had/ner          hair    tied       up    on    her

As      the        team      came       out     there          was     a sy/ge           from       behind and          I was          pushed

down          a few steps               against           the     pe o p le        in f r o n t       of me.          ThUTNurge

rest       of    my     mates          a nd      stayed          with       Derrick          RICHARDS.

We    left       t he      ground              and    the       first       houses          we    came            to    after       some          shops

the       people        let      us       use        the    phone,          but       I did       not         use       the    phone.              I then

went       to    the       coach          and        we    all       waited       for       all      the          people       to       arrive.

Everyone             arrived           back          at    the       coach       except          Carl         LEWIS          and    another                lad    I

did       not    know.

Later       I rang           home         from        a Pizza           Bar      in S h e f f i e l d             and    rang       home          to       let

my    parents           know          I was          alright.

After       this        I got          back          into       the     bus      and       it a g a i n           stopped          at    ’T h e

had       not.        After           this       we       got    a    taxi       to    some       shops            near       the       Moorfields

where       we       met     Carl        L E W I S ’S d a d .              When       Carl       was         not       with    us,       he

panicked.               We      all       thought           that        Carl      had       got      a       lift       with       someone             e

At    about          2200       hours,           that       night,          I went          to G a r t *s ho m e               where          we       were

all       worried          because              he    had       not     got      in    touch.                About       midnight             Carl**/

Dad       went       to S h e f f i e l d            with       relatives.                 I went            to    bed       at about

hours,          and     about          1000          hours,          the    morning,             I found               out    that      Carl           was

dead.           I stayed              there          with                        [oj^_ t h e      rest            of    the    day.

when        we    got       out       of    the          cars        Carl       and       myself         started         to    walk         towards

the       ground           and     tried            to    buy        tickets.              1 did         not    see      the     coach          I have

hour       we     tried          to     buy a        ticket           for           me,     b u t c o u l d n ’t       get     one.          The      only

offer          I had        was       a £.IS         seat        ticket             which       the      man    wanted         £30      fo r .

Because           I could             not       get       a    ticket           we     decided           to    get     to     the     turnstile,

a g r e ed       that       Carl       would             get     into          the     ground         and      then      pass        the

I    made        my    way       to     the b l u e           gate      and         waited          for       a while.           I was          being

         cheer       went          u p , and      I saw        the        p e o p 1e     in    the       terrace          j u m p i ng     up       and

         At    about         three        o'clock         C15G0          hours),          just          before       kick       of f,      I saw             my

         terrace          under          the    stand.             It    was       very       crowded          at    this       stage          on       the

see    anyone           else       I knew              in     the      t er r a c e „

1 was        looking             all     around             for     Carl       and      shouting         f or    him       I thought          he

would        be    in the          stand           faut       couId       no t s ee        him„

On    looking           at       the     pitch          I saw          Peter      EjEARDSLEY           hit      the     crash      bar     at       the

far    end        of    the       ground,              the      Kop      End.        As    this       happened          I saw      the     crowd

on    the     terrace             surge          forward            and     I. c o u l d    see       that      people       were       being

crushed           against          the        fence           around        the      pitch.

I also        saw       people           being          passed           over     the      heads       of     the     crowd       over     the

fence        into       the       pitch.               Some       of     these       people       appeared            to    be    getting

injured           as    they       ware          being          passed         over       the    fence.          As     this      stage       I.

was    still           at    the       front           of     the      stand      and      could       see      people       gasping          for

breath        and       their          faces           turning           blue     coloured.              1 pulled           more    people              up

into    the        stand          as     did       a    lot       of     other       people.

I saw        one       s m a 11    ga t s        o pe n a t         t h e f r o n t of          the    terrace         w h 1 ch    led     out

The    fans        saw       this        was       not        big      enough        and    started           pulling        at    the

fencing           around          the       pitch.

The    Police           appeared              to       think        this       was    a    good       idea      and     started         pulling

of    the     terrace                  through              t h i s g a p in    the       fence.         By     now    there       was

hundreds           of       people          on     the        pitch,        some      appeared           dead       and     others       injured.

I saw        an    ambulance                come        into        the     pitch         and    the     fans       started        to    tip

down    boar-ds             to    car ry         pe o p 1 e on .           The N o t t s         fans       made      t h e pr o b 1 e m      wo r s e

by    singing           and       chanting              but       I don't         think         they     knew what           had    happened.

We    thought           about          going           into         the p i t c h     to look         for     Carl      LEWIS      but     we

thought           we m a y         have          been          in the w a y       m o r e so we        stayed         in the       stand.                 I

stayed        in the             stand        until           about       quarter          to    f our      (154-5).         The    terrace

had    been        cleared             by     now       but       I saw        the    man who          had      booked       our    coach,

had        not     seen          Carl      in    the        qround          at     all.           The       last       I saw        Carl        was       when

he     went        through              the     Lappings              Ln    turnstile              into          the    ground.

At     about           five        to    four        (1555)           after        Kenny          Dagliesh             made       an    announcement

we     1eft        the       stand         and       met     Derrick              RICHARDS          at       the       rear       of    the         stand

near         the       tunnel           that     leads          to     the        terraces.                 At    this       point         I lost          t he

rest         of    ;riy niates a nd              stayed           with       Derrick              RICHARDS.

We     left        the       g rou nd         and     the       f i r s t ho u s e s          we     carne        to    after          some         s h a ps

went         to    the       coach        and        we     all       waited        for       all       t he      people          to    arrive.

Everyone               arrived           back        at     the       coac.h e >:c e p t           C a r 1 L E W IS          and       another            lad       I

did        not     know.

Later         I    rang          home      from       a Piz z &            Bar     in S h e f f i e l d           and    rang          home         to    let

After         this          1 got        back        into       the        bus     and       it    again          stopped          at      'T h e

home        and        arrived           at     about        £130          hours        at    the       Church.

At     the        Church          Pa u 1 C AR L IS LE “ s              dad        asked       u.s if         we    had       seen       Paul         but       we

had        not.         After           this     we       got     a    taxi        to    some       shops          near        the      Moorfields

where         we       met       C a r 1 L E W I S vs d a d „               When        Carl       was       not       with       us,      he

panicked.                   We    all     thought            that          Carl     had       got       a    lift       with       someone               else.

At     about           2200       hours,         that        night,          I went           to    parl*s             home       where         we       were

hours,            and       about        1000        hours,           the    morning,              I found             out     that        Carl          was

dead.             I stayed              there        with                          for       the    rest          of    the       d ay .

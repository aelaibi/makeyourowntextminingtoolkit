         HILLSBOROUGH

         You asked for my views on the subject of Hillsborough and I’ve reflected on it further in the
         light o f yesterday’s discussion.

         As the subject has been under such scrutiny in the public eye for so long, I think it is
         important to “lance the boil”. Annearing to limit the scope of the inquiry might even increase
         the pressure, rather than solving the problem - when we need to enable people to feel content
         that they can draw a line under the whole tragic event.

         If you ask a judge to look at all the evidence, he should also invite new evidence and allow
         for the possibility of (public?) hearings in respect of new evidence if appropriate.

    *)   This need not delay the whole review o f coroner’s inquiries and public enquiries which
         Gareth Williams suggested and which I strongly support.

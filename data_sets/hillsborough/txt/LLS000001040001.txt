vjil\ say as follows


On Saturday 15th April           and I and our friends arrived at Sheffield quite

early.     My mate       and I decided to go into the ground at 1.30 pm.        We

went straight in after being searched three times.         Quite a few policeman

were around but only a few people in there at that time.         As time went on

the terrace got more and more full in the middle section.         We were standing

at the front right hand corner.        At 2.15 pm it was getting more and more

full. I       ^nd the rest of them got in at that time.      There were quite a

few policeman there,            said to me that      wanted to stay at the front

because        wouldn't be able to see from anywhere else,          was standing

where the gate was in the middle of the goal.         I went to the back of the

section with my mates.      We were standing right against the wall in the back

in the corner.       At 2.30 pm the section was so full that only a few more

people could get in.       I went out to get a drink and when I got into the

yard I saw quite a few police and when I returned there was a lot more

people in there.       I went to the back and I was getting pushed backwards and

forwards.     At about 10 to 3 people started trying to climb over the walls

into the stands.       People were all trying to get into the stands and I was

just looking, I didn't know what to think, I thought that there were too

many people in there.       Then more and more people started getting up into

the stands.     The game started to be played but no-one was concentrating on
it.   There was lots of singing and people were too hot and were finding it

hard to breath and I knew something was wrong.         I wanted to get out.    |
my mate,    picked me up to see if I could s e e         I couldn't see anything.
I could hear people singing outside.         I could hear singing from the tunnel
which leads into the terracing.         People were moving and more were moving
into the other section.         We all pushed our way into the other section

because I was getting pushed.        There was a gate there and I saw three
policeman around the gate helping to get people out and eight other

policeman just watching.         They were pulling people out onto the pitch.

Then I saw people on the pitch, some were getting their breath back and

others were getting the kiss of life.         I got out on to the pitch.   A
policeman lifted me out.         I looked over at the goal it was circled by
police so that we couldn't see.         Then I saw a bloke going mad saying people
are dying.     I lost my two mates,     I didn't know where they went I was just
with I       Imy other mate.     After that I was just wondering around the pitch
for 15 to 20 minutes.        Then I saw fans getting boards to make stretchers.

Then I met one of my mates in the goal, there were so many people in front

of the fence that we couldn't see.                 I d i d n ’t t h i n k |     ^ would be one of

them.     A bloke came up to me he was sick I held his head, he said help me
and then he died.      I started to cry and then the police started to help me.

I had been on my own for about 20 minutes at this point.


Two policemen came up to me one was a lady who was very nice and a man.

They asked if I was missing anyone and so I said yes my                                 They asked

what        looked like.     They took me to an ambulance down by the Forest end.

1 way feeling very sick and there were lots of bodies a r o u n d .                       Iwo police

officers went to look in the ambulances.                    Then they couldn’t find                 and

so they took me in a police car.              There was a hell of a lot of people

wandering around.      The police were just standing about doing nothing.                            Then

they took me to Holloway police station,                   I think that is what it was

called, they sent me into CID and kept offering me tea and coffee and
trying to phone up.        I was there for 5, 6, 7 hours just sitting.                       They said

a social worker would take care of me in the gym.                             I looked at the clock

and it showed it was quarter to 9.                 I knew            rjas dead.      In the boys club

gym there were lots        of other people.            They kept calling          up the names of

people who had been        found.     I was there for          4 or     5 hours.     There were y

social workers with        me.   Then my mates                   and             came in and I thought

        Aias behind them   but   ^ ^ v a s n ’t.     I asked where's               £nd they said

t h a t ’s who we've been looking for.             They didn't know.              We just sat there.

After that we were there for another 2 to 3 hours.


We were then taken in a bus back to the Hillsborough ground.                             They had one

room which was a sort of gym in which the bodies were and then in another

room they had photographs of all the people who were dead who had been
unidentified.       I went into the photograph room and started looking at the

photos.      I couldn't see anyone I knew and then I s a w                          jnd started

crying.


We were then able to go to a sort of church shop to get some tea or coffee
                     At about 5.30 a. I was taken to a social worker's house
and be                                                   -,              very u p s e t .                                 The next morning two social

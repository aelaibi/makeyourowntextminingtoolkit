HOME OFFICE INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF HILLSBOROUGH
DISASTER



Jack Straw is proposing to start an independent examination of the new evidence
on Hillsborough by a senior legal figure, probably from the bench. [Derry is
looking for someone.] There is no intention it should be another Taylor Report,
but it should examine whether the new evidence warrants a new enquiry (public
or coronerâ€™s) or farther prosecutions. Undoubtedly it is a response to public
pressure, especially locally.


JS does not believe that there is sufficient new evidence for a) a new inquiry, b)
re-opening the inquest or c) prosecution of individuals. However, he believes
that this is not publicly acceptable unless it comes from an independent source.


He recognises that this is an unusual step, and does not intend for it to set a
precedent.


Unless you have strong views on this it will proceed on the above lines.

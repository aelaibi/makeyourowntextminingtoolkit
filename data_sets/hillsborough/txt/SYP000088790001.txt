                4.      It was my day off         on Saturday.          I was at home         in the gard en when

                my wife        came out at about         1530 to say that there              had been a tragedy at

                Hillsborough.           A p p a r en t ly her sister had rung her to see               if     1 was at

                the match.             1 rang Control    and asked       ifthey       wanted any assistance.                 I

                was a sked to go to P a r k w a y .

                        I arr ived at P ar kw ay at about           1550,         The place was    locked and           so I

                decided to           go down to Hills b o r o u g hi r/ my        own car.    I went   down to         the

            Pen is t o n e Rd %/t r a n e e .         I was     not aware that         this was a meeting         point

            or that      the g ymnasium was              the    casualty      clearing    point or mortuary

            This    simply seenieia to be the                  best   route    into the ground.         I a r ri v ed at

            about     1610 to       'v> 13.      Pen is to ne Rd was       -full of supporters        leaving        the

            ground.          I did not have any               radio with me to         contact Control.

            6.     I parked        the    car outside          the P enistone Rd entrance           on the      road.         I

            then went         towards      the    g ym nasium because          that    seemed to be where most

            a c t i v i t y was.     I saw an a mbulance              crossing    the    central    re se rv at io n to

            go up Herries Rd S ou th and he was .hpi nn— hp'i ned— bv— tbs— D M i c e .

            went    to the vehicle             but w i t hin a few s e c / nds                     shouted that           I

            should     instead       crew up with                               who was on his own and had an

            amb ul a n c e    parked on the           road outside       the    gates.     I then went        to trie

            a mb ul an ce     parked on the           road and we were          told to standby.         We did       not

            we saw a policeman who                   di rected us to where            the bodies were,        by a

instructions.                 We were     told to go to the spare              ground beside      the

    FA

    I spoke to I           She thanked me for my fax which she
    had passed past            _ â– who had agreed with our
    approach to the insurers.

    If they were difficult and decided to trv)and shift the
    burden back on the FA to send someone up^the FA would stand
    firm - or at least ask for a share of the costs. We did not
    think it would be necessary to attend.

\   I thought they had got quite a good deal in having the FA
    defend themselves so fully at Hillsborough - a liability
    which the insurers had indicated they were likely to accept.

    Perhaps she could have a word toj         |if the insurers
    got finickity because of his relationship with the brokers.
    He was handling the insurance matter.   I was expecting a
    response from)       tomorrow.

    Engaged 10 minutes including dictation

'Ik e -                    .

Thank you for your letter of 19 July regarding a possible request
for financial assistance to engage legal representatives by
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray at
the discipline proceedings relating to the Hillsborough disaster.
It is clear from the background papers leading to the issue of
Home Office Circular 77/87 Financial Assistance to Police Officers
in Legal Proceedings that discipline proceedings were not intended
to fall within the scope of this circular. Such expenditure would
not therefore rank for police grant.

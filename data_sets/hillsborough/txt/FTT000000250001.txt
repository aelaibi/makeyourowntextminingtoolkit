An apology for absence was received from Mr W B Davidson.

signed by the Chairman as a correct record.

504.   ARISING OUT OF THE MINUTES

With reference to Minute 491 it was reported that Mr Finney had visited
Leeds United and it was now up to the Club to provide all the necessary
documentation to further their claim.

505.   IMPROVEMENTS

Mr Maud reported that there had been claims from 30 English and
13 Scottish Clubs for close season work to be undertaken in 1984.

It was agreed that the percentages for improvement grants be allocated
as follows:   Toilets 7 0 %\ Disabled facilities 70 %-, Covering 50 %;
Seating 502; Catering facilities 5 0 % and Pitches 25 % for major improvements.

Of the claims submitted by English Clubs 10 had been tentatively agreed.
These claims were for toilets and covering and totalled grants of
£223,957. The Clubs involved were Barnsley, Brighton & Hove Albion,
Bristol Rovers, Chelsea, Fulham, Luton Town, Manchester City,
Middlesborough, Newcastle United and Rotherham United.  Grants which
were dependent upon a visit by the Trustees could add another £1,454,675
giving a total of £ 1 ,678,632 in grants.

Claims had been received from Scottish clubs which if grant aided
could arrive at £606,890/1,707,265.  In summary the grants could equal
£2,285,522/3,385,897 but £2m would be nearer the mark.

There were still several claims which required further investigation
but it was agreed that, as soon as Mr Maud and Mr Carter were completely
satisfied as to the basis of the claim and the financial aspects,
then the local Trustees should be consulted.

It was agreed that it was essential to let clubs know how their claims
were progressing.

Mr Carter raised the point that clubs were increasingly combining
improvement and safety work on claim forms and it was decided that
the procedures should be looked at once again.  It might be that two
separate claim forms were no longer necessary. Mr Maud and Mr Carter
were instructed to look into procedures and suggest possible changes
or revisions for the consideration of the Trustees.

The Chairman reported that he had circulated the Leisure Unit report
to various bodies for their observations. The PPA and the Football
Trust had re-iterated that loans should not be considered but were
in general agreement with the report. However, both bodies felt that
Non-Designated Clubs should be helped in some way. The Sports Council
had liked the idea of a longer term policy and the financial discipline
on clubs. The Home Office stressed that the Trustees should have
regard to all clubs which might possibly remove the possibility of
the Third and Fourth Divisions being Designated. The Minister for
Sport had no comments at the present time. Messrs Corderoy & Co had raised
the question of grants being retrospective to 1 January 1984. The
Secretary could make no comment as the report had not been discussed
by the Football League Management Committee.

After considering all the above comments it was unanimously agreed
that Non-Designated Clubs should be helped in some w a y . It was also
agreed that the Trust could not commit themselves to a long term policy
other than the next twelve months.

It was decided as a matter of courtesy to circulate the report to clubs
for their information and ask for their plans for 1985 in order to have
some idea of the possible financial commitment involved.  Clubs would
be asked to respond by the end of October.

It was agreed to write to TRRU saying that their job was now complete
and that the final instalment should be paid. The Trustees would, however,
reserve the right to ask the Unit for any further views if required.



506.   ADMINSTRATION

It was reported that the Football League Management Committee had agreed
to Mr Kelly resigning as Secretary but had requested that he, or his deputy,
be allowed to attend meetings as an observer.

This was agreed by the meeting and Mr Kelly would formally resign after
the meeting.

The Trustees expressed their sincere thanks to Mr Kelly and Miss Firth
for the work they had undertaken on behalf of the Trust over the past
few years.

The Chairman reported that a secretary had been appointed to commence
work on 1 August 1984.

It was agreed that any communications to all clubs would be circulated
via Lytham-St-Annes and Mr Farry of the Scottish Football League would
be asked if the Scottish Football League would render the same service.

It was decided that if, for any reason, a club was not satisfied with
a decision of the Trust then that club would have the opportunity of asking
the Football League Management Committee to consider whether they had
their support. In view of this it was decided that a meeting should be
sought with representatives of the Management Committee to bring them
up to date with all recent decisions.

507-   FINANCE

It was agreed that the accounts of the Trust be moved to London at the
earliest opportunity.

508.   CHESTERFIELD PC

It was reported that the Chairman and Mr S W Taylor were to visit the
club later in the week to pursue the question of a challenged invoice.

509.   ORIENT PC

After considering a letter from Orient in respect of the outstanding loan
it was decided that, until such time as the club felt able to honour the
debt, no claim from the club would be considered by the Trust. The club
Chairman was to be asked to meet our Chairman in Upper Berkeley Street
to discuss the matter.

MeBsrs Cordery & Co were instructed not to pursue any claim or visit the
club in connection with any claim.

510.   OLDHAM ATHLETIC FC

The Trustees decided that,   until such time as the club felt able to honour
the debt in respect of the   £60,000 grant, no claims would be considered
by the Trust and they were   to be advised that they could approach the
Football League Management   Committee to see whether they supported their
case.

Messrs Corderoy & Co were instructed not to pursue any claim or visit the
club in connection with any claim.

It was agreed that the matters relating to Chesterfield, Orient and Oldham
Athletic should be raised at the meeting to be arranged with the Football
League Management Committee.

511.   HOME OFFICE

A letter from the Home Office in respect of the designation of the newly
promoted clubs, Oxford United, Sheffield United and Wimbledon, was received
and noted.

512.   INVITATIONS

The Chairman informed the meeting that Lord Wheatley would be joining the
Trustees for lunch.

It was agreed to extend invitations to Mr Endicott and Mr R Faulkner to

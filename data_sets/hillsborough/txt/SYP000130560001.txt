               April        1989,              (140489),                        I did take                           positive                     steps               to ensure                             that                         I was

               full a c q u a i n t e d w i t h details                                                of that                    b r i efing and any                                       particular

               a r r a n g e m e n t s at H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium.                                                               I am an officer wit h

               c on s i d e r a b l e             experience                           of policing at H i l l s b o r o u g h and am familiar
w ith    policing a r r a ngements.

O n the m o r n i n g of S a t u r d a y      15th April       1989       <150489)        I a t t e n d e d the

formal     briefing       g iven to all         officers on S a t u r d a y            15th April      1989

(150489)        headed    by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t       DUCKENFIELD.

I am unable         to   remember       the    precise      contents         of the briefing           but    I can

particularly         remember         the briefing        because         it was the first            one    I had

a t t e n d e d whi ch had been         conducted by C hief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t            DUCKENFIELD.

The     briefing was        both t h o r o u g h and      c o m p r e h e n s i v e and    I was    impressed by

the qual i t y of the           inform a t i o n whi ch had been               included.         The briefing

c o ntained many         r eferences        to the safety            of memb e r s      of the     public and on

conclusion        I was     left with the           i m p r e s s i o n that    safety had been given a

large r prominence             than othe r b r i efings          I have a t t e n d e d whi ch may have

concent rated mo re on the                problem of        public        disorder.          I can r e c a l 1 that

Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   D U C K E N F I E L D *S final     comment was specif i c and

related to the safety of the public.

On c o n c l u s i o n of the briefing            I was     fully s a t isfied that a most

competent and            professional         task had been a c c o m p l i s h e d .

Shortly      f o llowing       this    briefing,       I had d e t a i l e d di s c u s s i o n s wit h other

p o 1 i ce commande rs who were               involved      in the        p o 1 i c i ng operation.          These

could be        clas s i f i e d as    informal      bri e f i n g s    or tactical          discussions.

I have     been a s k e d      to   comment     in p a rticular           in relation to any briefing

w h i c h may have been g i v e n             concerning         the t ransf e r of          Liver poo 1fans

from the S p i o n Ko p to the L e p p i n g s Lane                  ter r a c e s .

I unde rstand that             the O p e r a t i o n Order     specified          (in a part whi ch deals

wit h the       responsibilities              of a serial         of officers on             the S p i o n Kop)

that     in the event          of Liverpool         supp o r t e r s    gaining        entry     by ticket        to

the S p i o n Kop,       they w o u l d be t r a n s f e r r e d       to the L e p p i n g s Lane       end of

the ground.

I am unable         to   recall       this matter       being        given specific m e n t i o n at any

formal     or    i nf o rmal    brief i ng I a t t e n d e d .         Thi s does not         i ndi cate that          it
was omit t e d from any briefing and                        it is quite            possible        that   it was

ment i o n e d .

In the event of L i verpool                   fans    being on the S p i o n Kop                  consideration

w o u l d have       been g iven to tran s f e r r i n g           them or otherwise.                 This would

dep e n d on the numbers             involved - a very small                       number       could be

accommodated             but   the matter w o u l d have             been      considered very ser i o u s l y

in view of the             potential        for o v e r c r o w d i n g at the L e p p i n g s Lane end of

the stadium.              I believe        that,     irr e s p e c t i v e    of what      the O p e r a t i o n Order

specifies,           an e v a l u a t i o n w o u l d have been given to the s i t u a t i o n to see

if such transfer was               feasible?          it    is quite          likely that an operational

d e c i s i o n w o u l d have    been made          for    those      s u pporters        to     remain on the

S p i o n Ko p and        to have been given a t t e n t i o n by a serial                         of police

officers.

I have also           been a s k e d to clarify the briefing                         I was given as to the

monitoring           of supp o r t e r s    in the L e p p i n g s Lane            terraces.

Again      I am unable          to specify what             i n f o r m a t i o n was     given at the

briefings          but    I was   left      in no doubt          that        the   usual    arrangements would

be f o l l o w e d and that         the density of the                 crowds w o u l d be m o n i t o r e d

c 1o s ely by police            officers.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y   12 noon      <1200)      on S a t u r d a y     15th April          1989   <150489)    I

a t t e n d e d at    the P o l i c e Control         Room.        I there had a con v e r s a t i o n with

Superintendent             MURRAY.         We di s c u s s e d and       confirmed the             previously

a g r e e d m e t h o d w h i c h was to be used for the filling                           of the     pens sited on

the L e p p i n g s Lane        terraces.

As a     result       of this d i s c u s s i o n     I made a r r a n g e m e n t s       to ensure       that    there

was    no policy of firs t l y filling a particular                                pen,    then another        one and

so on.        The     fans w o u l d be permitted to fill                      the    pens to a comfortable

level and this w o u l d be                closely m o n i t o r e d         by the     police.       This

procedure        had been used             previously at football                    matc h e s    involving a

large     number         of s p e c t a t o r s and had been successful.

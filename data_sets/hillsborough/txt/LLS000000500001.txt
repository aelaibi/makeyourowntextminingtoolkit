f      I   was born on the
                                                 and am not at present

      employed.       I am in receipt of invalidity benefit following
      a



      On Saturday the     15th April 1989 I travelled to Sheffield Wednesday*

      g round at Hillsborough to watch L i v e r p o o l â€™s semi-final with

      Nottingham Forest.       I travelled by car with three friends

                                        and                    We arrived at

      the ground at approximately 2.40pm and I ha d a ground ticket

      for the Leppings Lane end of the ground.          There were long queues

      of people back from the turnstiles and policemen on horseback

     did not appear to be particularly organised.            Normally supporters

     are marshalled into defined lines for the turnstile but this

     was not hap p e ni n g at the ground.     One pol i ce m a n on horseback

     beckoned us forward and through a gate into the ground rather

     than through the turnstile.       I did not have     to hand in my

     ticket and there were no stewards on duty at this point.               Once

     into the ground we were confronted almost immediately by a

     tunnel and this seemed ti be the only way into the ground

     from this point.      The tunnel appeared to be 20 yards long.           As

     I reached the end of the tunnel I noticed a mass of people at

     the end and I realised that something was wrong.            I could not

     however turn back as I was being forced forward by the mass of

    people behind me.        The crush carried me forward.       It would

    be about 2.55pm at this stage as I recall the teams being

    announced on the loudspeakers.        I was being pushed against

people who were trapped against a barrier.               I could not breathe

or move.         I was aware of the game starting from the roar of the

crowd but I was only concerned with trying to ease the pressure
     I   and being able to breathe.   By this time I was halfway down

     , the terrace.    The Police facing the crowd seemed totally unaware
 r




i        of the problems in the crowd and were shouting to the crowd to

     get back.      Although the gate to the pitch was opened at

     a pproximately 3pm it was already too late for many people.               By

     the time the game was called off at 3.06pm I was still being

     crushed,     halfway down the terrace still unable to move.

     Even t ua l l y as time passed I ma n a ge d to climb over into the

     next pen on my right as it appeared to be less congested.             I

     saw that there were people on the ground being given resuscitation

     and bodies were being carried off.       A part of the fence was

     dragged down to pallow fans to pass bodies through onto the

     pitch.     Before we reached the fence there was a three feet

     high wall to get over.     When I reached the p i t c h I could scarcely

     breathe and wandered around and knelt down to try and get my

     breathe.     I can recall speaking to a Policeman on the pitch

     who seemed unaware of the tragedy and thought that the problem

     was being caused by fans who were fighting.       It was very hot in

     the crowd that afternoon but I was mainly concerned with

     being unable to breathe.     It was impossible to move or even

     lift m y arms to help people who were clearly in distress.

     On several occasions I can remember screaming with pain from

     the crush.     I eventually left the ground by the same tunnel.

     One of my friends had stayed with me and I me t up with the

     other two at the car.     I telephoned home from a bicycle shop

     and we then used a car telephone on another car to telephone

     to tell home that the others were safe.       I h a d a sore chest

    for a couple of days.      I had originally intended going to the

hospital but it ha d eased by the time I reached Liverpool.

    The whole of the upper trunk of my body was sore the next day.

    I only had about one hours sleep the first ni gh t and have

had disturbed sleep since then.           I am still ve r y disturbed

about the scenes at the match.           I do not think that the Police
    the ground were sufficiently organised and were not co-ordinated

enough to releave the terraces by allowing fans to come onto the

p it c h when   it was clear there was a problem.        I can recall seeing

one person      who   appeared to be dead before    the kick o f f .    I only

saw one person outside the ground asking for a ticket.                 I was

n o t aware of drink being a problem as the tragedy was caused

by there being too many people in the Leppings Lane end of

the ground      and   it should have been clear to both the Police

and the ground        officials that there was go in g   to be a problem.

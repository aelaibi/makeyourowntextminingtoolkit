      Private Prosecutions of David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray re Hillsborough
      Disaster

      Thank you for your letter of 30 June. As you point out, the private prosecutions were
      commenced in Bootle which is in CPS Mersey, under the Chief Crown Prosecutor Graham
      Brown. I have spoken to him and he tells me that he will have no part in dealing with the
      matter which, as you also know, is in fact being handled by George Croston in Special
      Casework at York. No doubt Croston will be advising the Director in due course and she
      will take the final decision as to what action is appropriate. I do not anticipate that I shall
      be involved in any way.

      Of course I understand your desire to be given an early intimation of the Director’s decision
      and I have, therefore, copied your letter and my reply to Croston so that he can let you know
      as soon as a decision is made. I am sure that he will need to look at the evidence available
      to the private prosecutors, and in particular that whether or not there is anything that amounts
      to substantial new evidence additional to that already considered by the Crown Prosecution
      Service. I imagine that process will take some considerable time.

      If you think I can help in any other way please let me know.

     Dear Donald
                Dr^cpi'LiHnns o f David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray Re Hillsborough

     Disaster
     I w rite to ask you to find out the intentions of the DPP in relation to a topic that has a
     significant bearing on South Yorkshire Police

     n n 15 ADril 1989 95 people died in the Hillsborough Stadium on the occasion of a F °0*bal[
     A ssociation Cup semi final (the 96th victim died some years later). C hief Supenntenden
     □a v id D uckenfield was in charge of the policing operations and Superintendent Bernard
                « hie rtenutv In 1990 the DPP ruled that there should be no prosecutions In
     S          K          Lo?d Justice S u irT s m ith , an Appeal Court Judge reported .ha, ,he DPP's
     decision w as properly based and there was no reason to change it.

     o n 76 June 1998 Ann Adlington, solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group, laid
     ^ fo rm a tio n b ^ o re Bootle M a g n a te s against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray Each ,s
     alleged to have unlaw fully Killed two named persons and each is also alleged to have
     neofected to perform a public duty. Both offences are desenbed as c o n tra ^ to common
     law. Mr D uckenfield is also alleged to have attem pted to pervert the course of justice by
      falsely reporting that Gate C had been forced.

      I have no idea w hat evidence was put before the M agistrates nor what evidence is held by
      Ms A dlington. South Yorkshire Police holds a large archive of m aterial about the disaste r
      Mr D uckenfield and Mr M urray have applied to the South Yorkshire Police Authority
      financial assistance to meet their legal costs. T h e ir applications have been granted

      I have to pay regard to the possible costs of their legal representation and the possible
      im pact of requests from our archive of material. In both cases, the impact will be small if
      the prosecutions fail at an early stage, whereas the impact would be greater if the cases go
      to Crown Court on a contested basis.

           Thp n p p can take over the prosecutions and either continue them or discontinue them
                 the “ pp's intenTons have a bearing upon how we In South Yorksh,re Pol.ce prepare
           our position.

           G eorge CROSTON, Special Casework Branch of CPS, tel I                         IS already
           planning to look into this matter.

           I would be obliged for any help you can offer ,n reaching an early decision on how the DPP
           w ill react on this issue.

           Yours sincerely

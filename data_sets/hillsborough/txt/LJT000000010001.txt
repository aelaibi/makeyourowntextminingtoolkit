Sir Peter

On Bob's return to the office next week, we shall want to discuss
the itinerary for the coming months, including visits to
fixtures/sites.   Thought will need to be given to locations
abroad:  Utrecht and Nimes are stadia which the Inquiry ought
probably to visit.   The former is a purpose-built stadium
described, by those involved, as a "customer-defined multi­
purpose building complex combining sports accommodation with
commercial facilities" while the latter has a system of advanced
electronically-controlled fencing.   Brian has, additionally,
mentioned American 'super-stadia', although     is less convinced
of the benefits such a visit might bring.

As a preliminary, I have begun to collate details of fixtures and
venues, and expect to receive information on the majority of
domestic events by the end of this week.  Both Len and Brian are,
understandably, keen to finalise a timetable and Len has provided
me with details of his other commitments.  Sufficient information
should therefore be available next week as a basis for
discussion.

In the meantime, the Sixth Test takes place at the Oval from 24-
29 August (assuming the match lasts that long!).  I have spoken
to the Club Secretary and his assistant, Ms Shereen Price, who
will arrange for the necessary passes and an escort.  Although
play begins each day at 11 am, the gates open at 9 am, which
they suggest would be the best time to see crowd control and
entry arrangements in operation.  Alternatively, and Ernie tells
me this is likely to be a more spirited event, the Nat-West
Trophy Final takes place at Lords the following Saturday,
2 September.  Again arrangements are in hand for you to visit
should you wish.



                                1
 If you let me know (on 01-273 2370) what you would like to do, I
 shall finalise the details.

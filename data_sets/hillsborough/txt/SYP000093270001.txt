gantry        directly above                 myself.             I looked            up a n d       could       s ee    on e     or      two

There      were       corrugated             sheets         placed a long               most        af the         length        of      this

This      space       w as      approx       £     ~ 4 feet wide.                    l saw several                 officers make

their      way      to     the       bottom       of      the    ramp,        and     I believed               them     to     be

other      officers             regarding           instructions               and      information.

A    lot of        these Li verpool                 supporters               were     shouting            and        pushing

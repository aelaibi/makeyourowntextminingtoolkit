        I am a Police Inspector in South Yorkshire Police at present stationed in

        the force Operations Boom Snig Hill,Sheffield.

        On Sunday 12 April 1987 I worked duties in connection                                                                  with the F A Cup Semi

        Final Football match between Leeds United and Coventry which was played

        at Hillsborough football ground,Sheffield.

        I was in charge of sectors 31 and 32 on the Football Match Order and our

        duties were to police the whole of Leppings ^ane between Penistone Road and

        the Leppings Lane turnstiles* We were to ensure that barriers were placed

        across Bickerton Road,Fielding Hoad,Leake Road,Farndale Road,ihenstone Road

        and Eskdale Road all at their junction with Leppings Lane to prevent all

        persons entering other than residents in vehicles or on foot.

        At the conclusion of the morning briefing the officers under my command

        placed metal barriers across all the streets listed above* I instructed at

        least one officer to man each barrier at all times and other officers were

        to patrol Leppings Lane on Public Order patrol.

        At no time during that day were an£ barriers placed across                                                                     LeppingsLane

        as a means of containing football fans whilst their tickets were cheeked.

        A number of fans were checked for tickets on an ad hoc basis between

        commencing duty and the kick off but these were not organised checks by means

        of passing through a barrier.

        No incidents were reported on my sector although a number of Street Traders

        were continually moved on and a number ofpersons were spoken to regarding

        urinating in passageways and on a garage site.

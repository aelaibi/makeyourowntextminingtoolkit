I   am- the    Northern   Area    Manager,   Home   Office,   Directorate    of
Telecommunications.      My    responsibilities   include   the   installation,
commissioning and maintenance of radio equipment for the emergency services.
South Yorkshire Police is one of the forces for which I am responsible.

I am the holder of a full City and Guilds Technological Certificate in
Telecommunications. I have 30 years experience of radio communications with
the Royal Air Force and the Home Office. I have been with the Directorate of
Telecommunications since 1971 from a position of Technician and have been
through various grades to my present level of Grade 7 (Principal).

In connection with the incidents at Hillsborough Football ground on 15th April
1989 my technical staff were responsible for the initial installation and
subsequent maintenance of the fixed radio communications equipment at the
ground. The equipment consists of a Pye Westminster Mobile radio which has
been adapted as a fixed base station. It is referred to as a-W15U. The
scheme operates off an aerial installation on one of the floodlight gantries
inside the ground. It is a UHF radio scheme. The radio system is capable of
being used in either 'talk-thro' or 'non talk-thro' mode.   When operated in
the 'talk-thro' mode the operator's access to the scheme will be overridden by
the operation of a personal radio.

I have been made aware that during the afternoon of 15th April 1989 the radio
equipment did not appear to operate satisfactorily. My information is that
messages from the control position were broken. I am also advised that the
scheme was being operated on 'talk-thro' and that the control position was
using the 'tulip' microphone for transmissions.

Following the problems encountered with the permanent installations I am aware
that a stand-by set of a similar kind was substituted and that this was also
operated on 'talk-thro' but using a personal radio to gain access to the
scheme rather than the base station microphone.

On Friday 5th May 1989 one of my technicians from the Directorate Workshop at
Sheffield was able to carry out tests on both the fixed and stand-by equipment
at the ground including the aerial installation and some scheme coverage. I
am aware that the equipment met the technical specification and worked
satisfactorily.
I am unable to give any explanation why the difficulties arose with the
equipment on the 15th April 1989. Using the scheme in ’talk-thro' mode for a
continuous period should not make the equipment more vulnerable to technical
failure. It has been suggested that prolonged use of equipment could lead to
overheating which may relate to the type of problem encountered on the day. I
consider this to be very unlikely. The equipment can be used in more extreme
environments than those at the ground, without detriment. In its original
specification the W15U was designed for use in police vehicle sand is carried
in the confines of the boot, where it can be subjected to extreme changes of
temperature throughout the year.

A method of overcoming the disadvantages of 'talk-thro' on the W15U, when the
operator loses the control facility by being overridden is to install the type
of fixed UHF base station which in general use for normal Sub-Divisional
policing.    With this arrangement 'talk-thro' can be permanently on but when
the operator selects the transmit mode        this   automatically   overrides
'talk-thro1 and the controller retains priority. This would allow advantages
of 'talk-thro' for information flow whilst retaining the command position.

From enquiries within the Directorate of Telecommunications I am aware that in
the Greater Manchester Police area this type of fixed base station arrangement
is in use. However, I am also advised that in other parts of the country,
including Merseyside Police area, the W15U arrangement is utilised. In both
police areas mentioned I am also told that permanent 'talk-thro' is not used.

I am not aware of .any Directorate of Telecommunications recommendation
relating to the number of personal radios to be used on one base station
scheme. It is clearly a police operational judgement.

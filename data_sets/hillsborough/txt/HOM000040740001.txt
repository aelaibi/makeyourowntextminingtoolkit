EDM 1372 - COOK REPORT ON HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER




As I understand it, the concern of the programme related to the
time of death fixed by the coroner and to allegations that some
witness statements were altered under police pressure to conform
to the agreed time of death.


Coroners are independent judicial officers and neither the Home
Secretary nor any other Minister has the power to interfere in
their decisions.


Complaints about police behaviour should be made in the first
instance to the Chief Officer under Part IX of the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984.




BACKGROUND


The Cook Report alleged that the Coroner responsible for the
inquest into the deaths in the Hillsborough disaster fixed the
time of death in the face of evidence to the contrary, at least
as far as some victims are concerned. It was also alleged that
West Midlands Police put pressure on some witnesses to alter
their statements to conform to the time of death set by the
Coroner.    The Hillsborough disaster has been extensively
investigated and reviewed. New evidence of police misdemeanours
would have to be reported to the Chief Officer in the first
instance.

shop       and    I bought           four      cans       of     lager

                                   and                    who        both      had               ets     parted         company with

myself       and

Myself       and                                         approached              a    lot     of    people            outside          the

ground       and asked             them       whether          they        had       any    spare        tickets         we       di d    t hi s

We    then made             our w a y        towards          the     Leppings             Lane     entrance,            I saw a

                 I saw a           number         of    supporters             climbing          over        the     walls         and        fencing         above

                 clambering              into      r'fie g r o u n d ,         I saw       two       policemen              in a     car       o ne     of    which

                 using       a     loudspeaker               telling         these       supporters             to      stop        pushing.

                 I sa t      watching             the    situation             in L e p p i n g s      Lane        entranee              for     between

                 five       and     ten minutes.

                 As    a    result          of    what                                        said     1 ls^feed t o w a r d s                 the a r e a         to

                 turnstiles              appeared            free      of    supporters.                I then          suggested              to

                 that       we     try and         pay at          the      turnstiles           in a t t e m p t           to     get    in,       he was

                 wary       of     this.

                 I then went                in e i t h e r      the      end    or     second         from      the         e nd    turnstile            nearest

                 the       exit     gate         that    had       previously            been        opened        .        1 observed              that      there

                 were       only       four       turnstiles             leading         to    the     standing              terraces.                 The

                 particular              turnstile            1 entered           w as     double        doored             but     divided            into    two

                 by a       brick        wall,         I entered            by the       right        hand      side.The             turnstile

                 operator           was      to m y          right,         he wa s      behind        a wire           mesh       screen,             there       w as

                 a    small        hatch where               you      pay.      I could          see     a     policeman             inside            the

                 ground          facing          the    turnstile.              Because          of    this        1 turned              sidewards            to m y

                 right       and       placed my             l ef t    elbow      on     the     counter,              so    to     have       my      back

                 towards           the      policeman           so     he    couldn't          see     the      turnstile                hatch where               I

                  then       passed/some              money       under       the       hatch and           he    too w a s       clocked

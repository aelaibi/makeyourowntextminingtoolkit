%                    Mr. Hardy: To ask the Secretary o f State for the Home
                  Department what is his present estimate o f the cost o f the
                 Hillsborough inquiry which will be borne by the police
                 authority o f South Yorkshire; and what is his estimate of
                 the amount per head which this will involve.
                    Mr. Hurd: It is not clear at this stage what the total
                 additional costs o f the Hillsborough police inquiry will be.
                 South Yorkshire police authority has made representa­
                 tions which my noble Friend Earl Ferrers, the Minister of
                 State, will be discussing with the authority shortly.

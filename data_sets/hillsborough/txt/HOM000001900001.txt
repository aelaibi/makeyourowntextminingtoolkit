 xpected       to a r r i v e a little e a r l i e r               but w e r e d e l a y e d     through heavy

traf f i c    between Stockport                   and Sheff i e l d .        We p a r k e d a b o u t       50 y ards

mi l e a way     from the ground.                   We a r r i v e d at         the pub at a b o u t          1310 pm

and     left at a r o u n d        1410     pm.       During       that     time we c o n s u m e d a f e w p ints

each,      c e r t a i n l y no mor e       than      three we d r a n k          in the bar            and my       son

he knows.          The bar         are a    of      the pub       is fairly         large and           I would       say

there w e r e      a couple          of h u n d r e d     Liv e r p o o l   supporters          in there.             I d i d n ’t

see a n y b o d y who was w o r s t               for wear        t h r o u g h drink,      e v e r y b o d y was      in a

good mood,          there was          a little          chanting         but    c e r t a i n l y no    trouble.

W h e n we     left     the pub at           1410 pm we w a l k e d             into and along             Leppmgs          icine

towards        the e n t r a n c e     to the ground.                  T h e r e was   a lot of pe o p l e

walking        in the same direction.

We a r r i v e d    at the e n t r a n c e          to the g r o u n d at about              1425 p m I saw a

 solid m ass        of h u n d r e d s      of pe o p l e        across     the entire e n t r a n c e          spreading

 bac k     from the       turnstiles.               Be f o r e    joining       the mass       to q u e u e     I asked a

 policeman         on foot         for d i r e c t i o n s       towards     T u r n s t i l e B.       I had

 purchased my            ticket       fro m Anfield.               It was       for T u r n s t i l e     B Wes t     Stand,

 Gangway        Z, Row 23 seat              137 and cost              £12.00.        Once we        joined       the crowd

 as we all         had    tickets          to go t h r o u g h T u r n s t i l e 3 we i n t e n d e d            to stay

 together.            Howe v e r     be f o r e    too    long        I found myself          in the m i d d l e           of the

 crowd b e i n g       jostled about,                I had no p r o p e r         control      over m y m o v e m e n t s

 and was        split up from all                  of my f r i e n d s      except

  tried ha r d e r       to stay w i t h                     as a l t h o u g h we each had               tickets          for

  turnstile        B we w e r e        the only          two w i t h      tickets      for the s e a t i n g          area       in

  the W e s t      Stand above pens                 3 & 4.        My    son and my other                frie n d s    did not

  intend       to use pens           3 s. 4 as         they e x p e c t e d      them to be over              crowded.

  Th e y     intended u sing pens                 1 & 2.         As             I*»d I w * s b e i n g        jostled        a

Police     H o r s e came b e t w e e n us.            I asked           the P o l i c e m a n w h e r e    to go to

 get    to the s e a t i n g are a and he d i r e c t e d me                  to go the o p p o s i t e side              of

 a large blue           iron gate w h i c h was              open.        As I m o v e d    off m a k i n g my w a y

 to this gate           the Pol i c e H o r s e s t o o d on m y          left    foot w h i c h was

 e x t r e m e l y painful.          I managed       to pus h my w a y thro u g h             the c r o w d       to the

 b lue gate.           As   I reac h e d      the gate        I was     immediately pinned                 to    it by

 the mas s     of p e o p l e b e h i n d me.          At. this        time    I had no        idea where

 was.      I was       being    severely pushed against                     tne gate       and wa s        urus n e d

 for about       five m i n u t e s       I thought          I wa s not g o i n g to m a k e          it,       it was

 e x t r e m e l y painful       and    I fell      all      of my b r e a t h     being     taken away.               The

 c rowd    se e m e d to m o v e       awa y and ease a little and                    I pulled myself                 along

 the gate bar by bar and wen t                      around       it    towards       the   turnstiles            to

 where     I had been directed.

 Whilst     I was b e i n g         crus h e d   there was          a large crowd          of other

  supporters        being      s e v e r e l y c r u s h e d and      I s a w one young youth,                  a mal e

  c l i m b i n g up a wal l        adjacent       to the t urnstiles.                He a p p e a r e d    to be

  h o l d i n g a ticket       and he was          obviously          trying      to escape        the crusn.

  During     that      time     I s a w two m o u n t e d po l i c e         and about       five      other

  officers      on the edge.                This was q u i t e        o b v i o u s l y not e n o u g h b e a r i n g     in

  mind    the s e v e r i t y of       the s i t u a t i o n o u t s i d e    the ground and               the numbers

  i n v olved I did hear              the m o u n t e d P o l i c e    officer who d i r e c t e d me shout

  into his       radio       "For God        sake get mor e me n out h e r e . ”

  That was at a bout                1445 pm.

  O nce   I had gone           thro u g h    the gate         the c r o w d was      considerably            less       than

  I h a d e x p e r i e n c e d and      I was abl e          to m a k e m y w a y     to t u r n s t i l e B.          There

  was a steward at              the t u r n s t i l e who        took one half           of my     ticket

  a l l o w i n g me    through.         The other           half    I r e t a i n e d and p r o d u c e     as evidence

   (Exh No                     ) (Ref BW/1).              Once      through      the tur n s t i l e       I made my

  way     to the foot          of    the s t a i r c a s e    leading up         into the s e a t i n g area.

tore    the      top right         h a n d corner.             I then w a l k e d up             the stairs       and

after u s i n g        the    toilet        took m y        seat.         The     time n o w w o u l d be about             1455

p m and       the s e a t i n g    area was            al m o s t     completely occupied               as was       the

rest of        the ground.              The      football m a t c h k i c k e d            off on time at            1500

pm.     Until         that    time       I had not          n o t i c e d a n y t h i n g out      of    the o r d i n a r y     I

c o u l d n ’t see any         trouble,           although            I c o u l d not      see    the pens b e l o w

fro m w h e r e       I was     seated.            I c ould s e e          the    top of     the p e r i m e t e r    tenee

and    the goal           touch    line.          At about            1505    pm I n o t i c e d a few pe o p l e

climbing           over      the fence          onto     the pitch.              I saw a p o l i c e m a n c hase          one

of    these m e n acr o s s            the p inch          and as m o r e         and more came            over   the      fence

I saw the po l i c e            reach          and go      to the         fencing.         The refe r e e      stopped         the

game and           the p l a y e r s     left      the     field.          At    this    time there were m any

pe o p l e    on    the p i t c h and           I s a w a lot            of these people            lying on the

floor.         In p a r t i c u l a r      I    noticed        the       actions      of    two poiicernen and one

p o l i c e w o m a n who w e r e          gi v i n g some          of these people              a rtificial

respiration             on    the field.            I also          saw that of          those supporters,

s om e were         assisting           in arti f i c i a l          r e s p i r a t i o n and ot h e r s were       taking

the a d v e r t i s i n g b o a r d s          from a r o u n d       the p i t c h and were            u s i n g these     to

c a r r y a way the           injured.          However        I       could not help but n o t i c e the

actions         of other         police         officers.              H u n d r e d s had a p p e a r e d and w h i l s t

 s ome a d m i n i s t e r e d     first aid others                    s tood    round bemused.             There w ere

 behind        the goal.           I also         sa w that          the po l i c e     formed a solid            line

 across        the m i d d l e     of     the field.                This a p p e a r e d w a s t e f u l   as p e o p l e

   opposite       the W e s t        S tand T u n n e l l        had been           op e n e d since       I last past

   them.

   When     I a r r i v e d at        the car         at about         1650 pm my son                           and my

   three     frie n d s wer e w a i t i n g             for me.         On    the way home we               related      to

   e a c h other        our    experiences              and m ade        the f o l l o w i n g    coments.

   (1)     W h y did       the       FA   insist        on this g r o u n d ?            Inst e a d of Old T r a r t o r a

   where      there       is a       lot more          r oom and w h e r e          the Police         are v a s t l y more

   experienced            in d e a l i n g w i t h        crowds.

    (2)     W h y did      they give          thousands             fewer      tickets        to Liverpool

   Supporters when               they have             a following           of s u p p o r t e r s w h i c h     ib

    t h o u s a n d s greater.

    (3)     W h y were         all    tickets          issued        to L i v erpool        marked Turnstile               B.

    This    left        turnstiles A & C redundant                         while        they could h a v e eased

    p r e s s u r e at B.

    (4 )    why was           there no p i c k e t           of p o l i c e p r e v e n t i n g p e o p l e without

    tickets       f rom r e a c h i n g      the ground.                I do not w i s h         to i mply that

    there wer e po o p i e w h o did not have                           tickets but            last yea r         police

    officers were present                    and        chec k e d    if peopel          had     tickets       befoe     they

    got    to the ground.

     5)    W h y were         there so few Police                    outside         the ground         i n i t i a l l y to

     cope w i t h       the huge          crowds w h e n         there w e r e         over    300     inside doing

     nothing      before         1500 pm.

     (6)     Wh y was         everything             so d i s o r g a n i s e d .      We ag r e e d    that      the Police

            xad no option to open the gates             to prev e n t m a n y deaths   outside the

            turnstiles.

            As   regards my      injury I a t t ended the A r r o w e Park Hosptial      at

            m y doct o r s    instructions.      I have s u s t a i n e d a fractured toe and have

            lost m y toe nail.           This has caused me c o n s i derable discomfort,

            I will       add that during     these event3 never did I see the supporters

            m i s b e h a v e and I did not witness any criminal         offences.

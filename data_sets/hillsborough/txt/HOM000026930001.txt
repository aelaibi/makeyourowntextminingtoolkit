Dear Sir,

FA CHALLENGE CUP FINAL     ALLOCATION OF TICKETS
                                                                               ViI
I write further to my letter dated 21st November 1989 which included copies of my two
reports into the allocation of tickets.

I now understand that the Football Association have decided to limit the allocation of
tickets to competing finalists this year to 21,000 each. The Football Association have
presented the allocation as an increase from 51% to 53.7% of the reduced capacity of
Wembley Stadium (80,000).

However, the reality is that 14,000 fewer fans of the finalists will receive tickets than
last year, and 4,000 fewer than 1983. This severely increases the problems associated
with large numbers of ticketless fans travelling to the Cup Final and recreates the
problems with segregation arrangements failing due to tickets changing hands via the
touts.

The FA has announced they may consider the ratio of the split between the two finalists
should a poorly supported club, such as Wimbledon in 1988, reach the Cup Final.

It is-^a matter of great concern to the City Council that the F A ’s decision in respect of
the 1990 Cu"> Final will very possibly put the safety of fans in jeopardy.

I hope the inquiry will consider this matter in addition to the information previously
submitted.


Yours sincerely,




Chief Trading Standards Officer

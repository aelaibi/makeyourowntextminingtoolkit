Notes" from, a conversation with Hampshire Social Services
re: Chapham Junction Disaster.

Information was Faxed to Leicestershire Social Services on the day of the
Kegworth Disaster.       Hampshire were careful about intervening in peoples
lives.   The feedback to their approach has been quite good.         The extent
to which they should be pro-active or non-intrusive was also carefully
considered.    A brief letter was hand-delivered by Social Workers to the
bereaved.     This was adaptable so that it could be used for the injured.          It
made clear that the social worker who bore the letter was available to

help immediately if required.


This letter was not delivered for 72 hours,to avoid "jumping in too early".
Also it took a while for accurate figures to arrive.          Emphasis was given
to the self-help aspect.


Identification of the victims was very difficult and made more so because

some victims had 2 addresses.


One point made was making it known to Social Workers that they had the
ability to do this 'Counselling1, which in the view of Mr. Humphreys
was a usual part of the service provided by Social Workers.           Publicity
included posters on railway stations.         Reached 400-600 addresses.


The Memorial Service takes place at Winchester Cathedral.           So far
contacted 60-70 families.                     Groups of people still meeting -
self help group aspect (Community of Commuters).          Joint operation
with Surrey & Dorset Social Services.         Contact with 20/25 people.
Attending one group or another.        Hampshire have circulated G.P.'s
with a letter so that the injured can be counselled.           People have
been made aware that they are not on their own, there are ways of
helping including mutual and self-help.           Hampshire have liaised with
the Department of Psychotherapy.        There are two hospitals in
Hampshire who have dealt with Falklands Victims.          Dorset used private
consultant Stewart.       (Crisis Help) .   Mr.                colleagues will be
making comments about the counselling service before the Memorial Service -
lpm 20.1.89.     -    Radio 4.


Mr.                  ill send a pamphlet to us and fax some more information

to us.

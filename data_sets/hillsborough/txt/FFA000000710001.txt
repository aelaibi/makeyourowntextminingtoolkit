    many stated that due to the level of violence they had often refrained from attending
    matches, expressing a high level of frustration at this fact.

    suggestions as to how the problem is to be solved.

    at the match, the remainder drawing their impressions from the media portrayal of the
    events.

                                                                            P.T.O;

               FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM

               The suggestions forwarded come under three headings , plausible, extreme or
               ridiculous. Perhaps with the publicity it has received of late, the introduction
               of identification cards was seen by many as a simple cure all.
               Coming through with abundant clarity was the extent to which the letter writers
               expressed their love for the game.

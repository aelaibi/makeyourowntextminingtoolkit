 We have a considerable number of outstanding persons who have either telephoned
 or written to us about the disaster.

 Ail of those who are potentially material witnesses will bd seen not least of
 all as part of the Coroner’s Inquiry.

  However, there are many who clearly were not at the game and others who were
  nowhere near the centre of activity.  In amongst this number are the inevitable
  "cranks".  I would propose not to arrange personal interviews with these people
  but issue the attached letter which I have had prepared in draft.

 Your views would be appreciated.

   SUBMISSION ON PART ONE OF THE


       HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY




           ON BEHALF OF




SOOTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE


                AND


      CIVIL DEFENCE AUTHORITY
                    THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE FIRE SERVICE ON
                       15TH APRIL, 1985, AT HILLSBOROUGH




l.(a)      It is not suggested in the light of the evidence                                           tendered

           at     the     Inquiry          that        the        earlier summoning of the Fire

           Service would have resulted in the saving of lives or                                              the

           prevention           of     injuries.             Nevertheless           it is regrettable

           that     notwithstanding                the           obvious        need          for      cutting

           equipment,           once       it     became           apparent        that        persons were

           trapped behind the perimeter fence in pens                                     3     and     4,     no

           request        for        the    Fire        Service           to attend was made until

           15.13.45.        Every appliance carries cutting equipment which                                         Hornsby
                                                                                                                    20.73.F
           could        have          speedily              removed         the     perimeter           fence.

           Emergency tenders also carry heavier duty portable cutting

           equipment        which          could,           if     necessary, have been used to                     20.75.C

           remove the radial fences.




     (b)   Chief Superintendent Duckinfield accepted that by 15.04 it                                               Duckinfield
                                                                                                                    8.107* E-F
           was     apparent to him that people were trying to get out of

           the pens and that               they         were           having     difficulty          getting

           through        the    gates.          Although he accepted that an obvious

           solution would be to cut some of the fence down, he stated

           that     the     thought          did        not        immediately pass through his

           mind.     It is noted however that at 15.07                               a     request           from   S.A.I.
                                                                                                                    P. 11
           ground control for a fleet of ambulances was made.



2.         Calling the Fire Service

     (a)   Following        a    request for bolt cutters made at about 15.12

           by radio from the area                      of        the    perimeter         fence       to     the

           ground         control          box          at        Hillsborough,           Sgt.      Goddard,        Goddard
                                                                                                                    18.89.B-H
           immediately telephoned the                            police     garage        at     Claywheels
                                                   -    1    -
      Lane     asking     for      cutting             equipment.          They     replied that

      they     had   none       available              and    Sgt.     Goddard           therefore       Goddard
                                                                                                         18.97.F-H
      signalled to PC Bichard who was also in the control box to

      radio Police        Control         at       Snig       Hill     to     call       the    Fire

      Service.




(b)   PC Bichard passed the following message on the VHF channel                                         S.A.l
                                                                                                         P. 16
      to Force Control at 1513.




             "Hillsborough ground control                      could        you     contact        the

             Fire Service, we want some hydraulic cutting equipment

             to the ground to cut some of the metal                               fences.        Fire

             Service urgently required Leppings Lane end."




      A   police     operator, PC Jones,in the incident room at Snig
                                                                                                         Waugh
      Hill Force      Control         acknowledged             the     message           with      the   31.113.G

      words:



                                                                                                         S.A.l
             "Roger Fire Brigade urgent up to Leppings Lane Roger"                                       P. 16



(c)   This    request        was     overheard by Chief Inspector Edmundson                              Edmundson's
                                                                                                         additional
      and he went       to     the     adjacent              operations           room    to    give     statement

      instructions to one of the operators.




(d)   Meanwhile,         in    the     operations              room        Julie     Webster,        a
                                                                                                         Webster's
      temporary control            room        assistant,            was     dealing        with     a   statement

      telephone      call       from      Fire Control Operator Davies at the

      South Yorkshire          Fire       Service            central        control       room      in

      Wellington        Street reporting a house fire in Gatty Road in

           which it was thought people were trapped and                        lives     might

           therefore be at risk.




     (e)   Chief Inspector Edmundson. interrupted Miss Webster's call
                                                                                                 Edmundson's

           equipment was wanted at Hillsborough.




     (f)   The conversation between Miss Webster and Miss                        Davies    is

           recorded     in     the   transcript of the Fire Service tape and

           the part relating to Hillsborough took                      from    15.13.45     to

           15.14.58, a total of 1 minute 13 seconds.




3.         Comments

     (a)   It    is   to be noted that although the message passed by PC

           Bichard to Force Control complied with the requirements of

           the    emergency procedure in that the precise location that

           the Fire Service were to attend and the type of                        equipment

           required     were    specified,            Miss Webster who spoke to Miss

           Davies made no mention of Leppings Lane or                      the    need     for

           hydraulic     cutting       equipment.         This    procedure       had     been

           agreed upon at       a    meeting          between    the    three     emergency      Core
                                                                                                 478
           services on the 9th August, 1988.




     (b)   Inspector     Sewell      accepted         that the necessity to provide

           such information to the Fire Service was obvious and                           that   Sewell
                                                                                                 31.32.A-F
           the Fire Service was entitled                to expect such details from

           the police.       By contrast, such            detailed      information       was

           provided     by    police     force        control     at    Snig Hill to the         Clarke
                                                                                                 24.75.E-F
           Ambulance Service.

(c)   Miss Davies whose call had been interrupted, had                                             to    make

      sure that she had satisfactorily dealt with the Gatty Road

      fire whilst at the same                      time          trying    to     deal            with    the

      police request for assistance at Hillsborough.



(d)   She     needed       to        know the address of Hillsborough Football

      Ground to make              sure       the       appliances          were            sent     to    the   Davies
                                                                                                                20.40.C-D
      correct     place and as quickly as possible from the nearest

      fire stations.              She was, in our                  submission,              entitled       to

      expect     that           police        force          control would know the place

      where     the        Fire       Service          were        required           as     they        were

      presumably already in attendance. If more detail as to the

      location could in fact have been provided , it                                         could       have

      caused     an unnecessary delay,if she had mobilised the Fire

      Service to the district of Hillsborough. This                                          would       have

      been     the appropriate alternative procedure in the absence

      o f s u c h information.



(e)   She asked for the                road        three          times    whilst            typing       the

      information           into       her        computer          and    the         first        enquiry

      produced        an     answer          unrelated             to     the     question.               The

      address,        Penistone             Road,          was     finally        provided by Miss

      Davies' supervisor, Mrs Moody.




(f)   If the police at Snig Hill had relayed                                    the        message       from

      ground     control             that     the          Fire     Service           was required at           Davies
                                                                                                                20.46.B-C
      Leppings Lane, that information would have been typed into

      the     computer          by     Miss        Davies          and produced an immediate

      'special risk' response.




                                              _    4   -
     (g)   Miss Davies needed to know the nature of the                                    incident       at

           which     the        Fire        Service was required to attend so that a

           decision could be made as                         to   what     type      and    number        of

           appliances           should        be        sent.       In    the      circumstances the

           statement that there had been a                           major      accident         was     not

           helpful        and     it        is unfortunate that PC Bichard's request

           for hydraulic cutting equipment which would have indicated

           the     need     for        emergency             tenders was not relayed to Miss

           Davies.




     (h)   Although         'Sheffield                  Wednesday          Football        Club'         was

           programmed            into       the         computer,         'Hillsborough          Football

           Ground' was not.                 This omission has now been remedied.

           police officers on .duty were unaware that the Fire Service-
                                                                                                               20.64.G-H

the     primary        authority       for   means       of     escape        and     fire   Core 27

alarms, means of escape, emergency                   lighting           and     stadium

barriers        was       likely           to be less than the maximum and

would        therefore       produce                an     even      more        favourable

evacuation time.



The     Club     and/or the police                       would be able to control

the numbers of spectators entering the pens.

(c) Such       capacity        would       provide          for reasonable ease of

       movement.




      Even with the maximum holding                       capacity        permitted          by

       the   Green       Guide,     the        density        of spectator packing

      would permit ease of movement through the pen                                   and     it

       is most unlikely that a serious crushing problem would

      occur.       The      Fire    Service          video          and     photographs

       demonstrate            the      maximum             density         of         packing

       contemplated by the Green Guide.




The gates in the perimeter fence and in the radial fences

in the west terrace.




These were never intended by the Fire Service to cater for

the     numbers      which      were admitted to pens 3 and 4 on 15th

April, 1989.         When the perimeter gate to pen 3 was opened,

many     persons       were     already lying across the mouth of the

gate and it is, in our submission, highly                             unlikely,             even

if     the    gate     had     been       1.1 metres wide, that evacuation

could have been conducted at such a rate as to                                  save        life

or           prevent            serious                   injury.            That             is

                                       -   9   -
not to say that the gates would not have been adequate for

the    kind of emergency which could reasonably be envisaged

if the appropriate holding capacity had been adhered to.




Perimeter Fence Gates




(a) Paragraph 18.3 of the 1976 Green Guide                               requires        that
                                                                                                  1986 Green Guide
      access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as                                      Paragraph 209

      possible in normal circumstances whilst providing                                   the

      police      with       proper access to                  the terraces for crowd

      control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event

      of     a     serious           emergency.            Paragraph       7.9.1       which

      requires that such fences be provided with                               gates      for

      use    in    an emergency does not stipulate the frequency

      or minimum width of such gates.




(b)   Paragraph 215 of the 1986 Green                           Guide    provides that

      perimeter         gates        should         have       a minimum width of 1.1

      metres subject            to        paragraph        6    which    accepts       that

      deviation         from     individual            guidelines        are     possible

      without necessarily detracting from the overall safety

      of    the    ground        and        paragraph 8 which states that it

      should be borne in mind that, when using the Guide                                   to

      assess       whether                existing         circumstances           provide

      adequately for the safety of spectators, the criterion

      to    be    aimed        for        is    that of a reasonable degree of

      safety.

                 clearance       width    of     0.77m was installed prior to the

                 application for a Safety Certificate.




             (d) None of the perimeter gates in the west                                 terrace           were
                                                                                                                  Seaman's statement

                 evacuated       in the event of an emergency which required

                 total evacuation.            The gates were intended for use                                in

                 the    event of local emergency to permit the evacuation

                 of a relatively small            number              of     spectators              and     to

                perimeter fence          gates    would               be     likely           to     attract

                spectators       away     from the preferred route and lead to

                an exacerbation of any existing crushing problems.




            (g) Prior to       15th   April,          1989,           the    Fire         Service           had    Calvert

                inspector appointed by the                      Football          Association , who

                was    well aware of the need for such gates and able to

                compare them with             similar           gates       at      other           football

   width         of        the gates.         Indeed, a complaint was made to

    the police at the time that too                     many   spectators       had

   been allowed to escape rather than too few.




(h) It     is     a        requirement of paragraph 7.9.2 of the Green                (1986 Green Guide)
                                                                                      Paragraph 215
   Guide 1976 that perimeter gates should be                       controlled,

   so      that        immediate         access    to the pitch or perimeter

   track can be ensured in the event of an emergency.                            It

   follows            in    our    submission that if they are to be an

   effective safety measure:




    (i)         There must be an awareness by those controlling

                the        packing       of the pens of the possibility of

                crushing among the spectators.




    (ii)        There must be constant vigilance to ensure that

                any difficulty or problem               within   the     pen     is

                noted.




   (iii)        Prompt action must be taken to open the gate or

                gates         if   the        need arises. In relation to the
                                                                                       Core 140
                1981 incident, the Chief               Constable     said      that

                                     -   12    -
           his     only        criticism of his senior officers was

           for not opening the gates earlier.




(i) However:

           eventualities, particularly crushing,                          was     not

           referred to.




           Thus on or before 15th April, 1989 the officers

           on the ground do not appear to have                          been    made

           aware     of        the dangers of crushing in the pens,

           particularly if they became overcrowded.

           police    were         aware        of   holding capacities for              Mole 7.13C

           and     1,200        respectively.            This does not appear

        the   spectators                in     the    west        terrace to find

        their own level was adopted.                         There was also             a    Duckinfield

        of    the    colour             camera on zoom) did not show a

        clear picture of                 what        was     happening       in    the

        pens.




(iv)    On    15th April, 1989, the police in the control                                    Bradley 1.95.A-B

        evidence that after the gates to pens 3                                  and    4    Lowe 3-91-B

(j) If     it        had    been    appreciated           that        the   number          of

    spectators              entering    pens     3        and 4 exceeded even the

   maximum holding capacity i.e. 54 persons per 10 square

    metres and steps had immediately been taken to prevent

    further spectators from entering the                              centre    pens        by

    closing          the tunnel and the radial gates, any crushing

   problem that arose could have been safely resolved                                       by

    evacuating an appropriate number of spectators through

   the perimeter fence gates.                    These would have permitted

    evacuation at a rate of at least 60 persons per minute

   per pen (attributing to each gate only one unit width,

    namely 0.55 metres.)


                                                                                                  Pen 3       Pen 4

Radial Fence Gates




(a) The primary and preferred exit route from pens 3 and 4

    was the central tunnel                   under        the    west       stand.          The    Health &. Safety

    Health            and     Safety    Executive           have       calculated           the    paragraph 6.3

   unit     widths        at    the tunnel for pen 4 provide an exit

   time of 5 minutes 45 seconds for 1,036 spectators.




(b) In compliance with paragraph 6.13 of                        the     1976           Green

   Guide an alternative exit route was provided, although

   its possible use in an emergency was regarded                                 by        the

   Fire     Service        as   extremely         remote.        The alternative

   routes were through the radial gates each of which are

   of     two    unit     widths.          Thus pen 3 could be evacuated

   through the gate into pens 1 and 2                      in     8    minutes               27

   seconds and pen 4 could be evacuated through the gates

   into pens 6 and 7 in 8              minutes        38     seconds.                 It     ic

   submitted           that      if   an     announcement             was    made            to

   evacuate the whole of              the    west      terrace,             spectators            Seaman 23.59.G-60B

   would naturally move towards the exits round the south                                         Calvert 30.47.C

   and north ends of the west                 stand        creating          a        vacuum

   into     which       the     spectators        from     pens 3 and 4 could

   readily be absorbed.

   prevent pens 3 and 4 being overcrowded by migration of

   spectators from the outer pens.                     However,             paragraph

   50     of the 1986 Green Guide states that a smooth, free

   flow through an exit route                to     the     outside              is        best
    achieved by controlling the crowd flow at the entrance

   to the      exit      route.         The       provision    of     a    wider     or

    additional gate in the radial fence would be likely to

   hinder the free           flow           through    the    alternative          exit

   route      via     the north and south ends of the west stand

    in that spectators would be entering                       the       outer     pens

    from the centre pens at a greater rate than they would

   be leaving them.




(d) It would have been                undesirable       to    mark       the     radial   Eastwood
                                                                                          27.76.D
   gates or exit routes since that would                           in an emergency

   be likely to deflect spectators from the preferred and

   speedier        exit route even when the tunnel was open and

   available. Furthermore, the gates served not merely as                                 Seaman
                                                                                          23.4.C-E
   emergency        exit    routes              but were also there to enable

   safe distribution of the spectators to take place.




(e) When the radial fences were approved                       by    the        Officer

   Working      Party        on 11th September, 1981,it                   was made a      Core
                                                                                          153
   condition that           the new gates in the radial                   fences     at

   the   rear       of      the terrace should                be    under       police

   control.         It      was clearly            understood       by     the     Fire
                                                                                          Seaman's statement
   Service      that       such        control       would be effected by the             2.11.(ii)

   gates being constantly manned. It was a matter for the

   police     to     decide           how many officers were deployed to

   carry out that function.




(f) Paragraph 7.9.2 of the 1976 Green Guide required                               that

   access     points       through a pitch perimeter fence should

   be "controlled so that immediate access to                             the     pitch

   can   be     ensured       in       the event of an emergency” .                 The

                                  -    17   -
    condition       imposed         in     relation           to    the radial fence

    gates should have been read in this context.




(g) According to Superintendent Stuart, the requirement of                                      Stuart
                                                                                                31.108.D-H
   the     Working        Party      that           the     radial gates should be

   under police control was interpreted by the police                                      as

   a     conditional        control            in     the     sense that the gates

   would only        be    manned          when           segregation    was        taking

   place.      There       is       no     evidence          that     this     was ever

   discussed or given approval by the Working Party.




(h) In our submission, in order to control the numbers                                     in

   pens 3 and 4 it was essential to man the radial gates.                                       Evans
                                                                                                26.25.D-E
   If further entry into pens 3 and 4 was to be prevented                                       26.26.B-E

   by    closing      the central tunnel, it would be necessary

   to prevent or at least control                          movement     through          the

   radial     gates.       A police officer or officers stationed

   at the back of the terrace could have                            supervised           the

   packing     of     pens      3        and     4, directed spectators, and

   notified police control when the                          pens     were        reaching

   their      appropriate                capacity.           Furthermore,           in     an
                                                                                                Eastwood
   emergency when the tunnel could not be used the police                                       27.75.E-76B

   officer     would       be       immediately             available        to     direct

   spectators to the presence of the gate and                                assist        in

   the      passage        of        spectators             through     it.        In     our
                                                                                                Sewell
   submission,        a    police          officer          or      officers            could   31.31.E-G

   properly     carry        out         these        functions       without           being

   "swamped"        providing        the        maximum          possible          holding

   capacity         envisaged             by     the       Green    Guide      was        not

   exceeded.




                                -    18    -
(i) It     appears that on 15th April,                   1989      spectators          did

    not     leave    pens       3      and 4       by way of the radial gates

    after serious difficulties had arisen within the pens.

    The     Fire     Service          anticipated that were the gates in                     Seaman
                                                                                             22.151.EKE
    the radial fences to be                     used   for     this        purpose,     an

    announcement          on    the        public      address        system to that

    effect would be made.                  If    there       had   been       a     police

    officer on duty at the gate he would have been able to

   make spectators aware of the existence                             of     the     gates

    and    assist        in    keeping          the    gangway clear.              Had the

    number of spectators in each pen                       been    kept        even     to

   their     maximum          possible holding capacities, permitted

   by the Guide, relatively                     free   movement        towards         and

   through the radial gates would have been possible.




(j) However,       the         apparent          failure of spectators to make
                                                                                             Sykes

                                           IN SUMMARY




     (1)   There       is no justifiable criticism that can be made of the

           Fire Service as to the manner in which they                                  responded     to

           the     call     for     assistance             at 15.13.45.           The request came

            from South Yorkshire Police                       Headquarters         Force       Control.

           The     Fire     Service        in       the       interests      of     a    prompt      and

           appropriate response were entitled to proceed on the basis

           that     the     police    would           be       able     to   provide details of

           precisely where their                appliances were to                attend and         the

           precise        purpose     forwhich                 they     were required.           On the

           basis of the information that had been                            passed       to     Police

           Force Control, all such information was in fact available.




     (2)   In    any    event,      even        if any criticism can justifiably be

           made against the Fire                Service on this score,                   in view     of

           the     times    involved,           it    had       no causal connection                with

           deaths and injuries sustained in the disaster.




     (3)   In so far as there was any delay in the                           updating          of   the

           Safety Certificate, that was neither caused by, nor was it

           the responsibility of the Fire Service.




     (4)   As regards the pens on the west terrace, and in particular

           the     perimeter      fence         gates          and     radial      gates, the       Fire

           Service, in giving          advice             to     the    Working         Party,      were




                                                -    20   -
    entitled       to     proceed      on the basis that the Club and           the
«
    police would control the numbers in, and the safe                       packing

    of,     the    pens.        Even    if the numbers in the pens were as

    high as the maximum possible holding capacity permitted by

    the     Green Guide, it is submitted that the perimeter fence

    gates and       the     radial     gates     would     have   performed     the

    functions       for     which      they    were intended.      The perimeter

    fence gates would have permitted the                   safe   evacuation     of

    sufficient          numbers to resolve any local crushing problems

    that could reasonably have been anticipated as                    likely     to

    occur     in    those       circumstances.       The     radial gates, with

    appropriate          directions,     would     have    provided     a      safe

    alternative         means     of    escape from the centre pens if for

    some reason, which was regarded as                   highly   unlikely,    the

    tunnel was to become blocked.

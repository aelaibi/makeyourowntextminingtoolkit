           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S IHQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

           I have now been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord JustlceTaylor
           fro, a selected number of police officers therrecollections, in writing,
           of what happened at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. The reason for my
           request, is that I understand that a number of your officers performed y
           on a mutual aid basis. Counsel are keen to obtain a cross section o
           accounts as soon as possible.

           I would like to make          arrangements as soon as convenient, through a
           Officer whom you may          care to appoint, to receive these written *ubmisslo
           as soon as possible.           There will be no need for my officers to ®ee yours
           personally, although          a proof of continuity will be n e c e s s a r y , but I would
           hope that this could          easily be achieved through your Liaison Officer.

            The invitation to submit written recollections is based on criteria that I
            have already adopted with South Yorkshire Police officers. That is,
            there will be no interviews just simple requests to which the o f f i c e r !
            be free to decide what he or she wishes to say. When supplying any w ^ t t n
            submission the officer will be free to keep a copy. I have a l s o been asked
            by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, if a < copy
            any submission can be made available; I have no objections nor have
            appointed by Lord Justice Taylor.

            In this respect copies of any written submissions can be forwarded direct
            by you to Mr Wright at his Sheffield Police Headquarters.

            It would be helpful if I could arrange for one of my senior officers to
            contact your Liaison Officer in the next few days.

            Attached to this letter is the list of officers who I understand were
            seconded from your force.

                 MUTUAL AID - HORSES

                 Further to a recent telephone conversation between a member of your mounted
                 staff and my Inspector Hand-Davis, I wish to confirm my mutual aid request
                 on behalf of the Chief Constable in connection with the above event:

                 Mounted Officers                       12

                 The kick-off time is 1500 hours and the officers should report to Niagara
                 Police Stables at 10 am. Meals will be provided.

                 Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.

                 Yours faithfully

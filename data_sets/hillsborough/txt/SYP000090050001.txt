           Major Incident - Hillsborough Football Ground

           15th April     1989 (150489).



           On Saturday,      15th April,   1989 (150489), at approximately 1525 (1525)           I

           was contacted at home by Brigade Control who informed of an incident

           at Hillsborough Football Ground involving a suspected stand collapse

           with casualties.

           I responded and,      on arriving at Leppings Lane,         followed a Stocksbridge

           pump to the entrance of the                     I left my car and contacted

           Station Officer SWAIN w                         which stand was involved.       I

           then returned to my car to reposition it in. a better             place   (behind the

           Control Unit which was just arriving),

           I then took my camera equipment and proceeded down the internal                road
                                                                                                 PAGE      2
                                                                                                 S 3 431

               (after first handing         in my tally to Stat ion Officer SWAIN at the

               control    point)    to try and gain access to the pitch.             As I proceeded

               down the road I saw a number of casualties being tended to and

               ambulances were also         in attendance along this roadway.

               As I was reachi ng the South Stand Corner,                I saw &CQ yH&^NSBY arr iv ing

               by car so told him all the information I knew.                  He tnen instructed me

               to accompany him.         We went further along the roadway then tnrough the

               South Stand Tunnel        onto the pitch,        crossing the pitch to mal^e our way

               to the gymnasium.         Whilst    running across the pitch I still         could not

               see what had happened on the West Terracing as there was a j f f a lice



   •                                       a                                            •

               On arriving at the g^fri ori'Uct was made with AD jo                        - I had a

               quick look in the g y trr and s a w S r 'f m m b e r of casualties.     Ambulances we r e

               also   in attendance outside t h e         gymnasium.

               I then accompanied AGO Hornsby to the nearby Police                  room, and w h i 1st

               ACO HORNSBY tried to use the ph one , I spoke with a WPC who had

               initially been near the terrace.               She informed me there had not been a

               collapse but that many people had been crushed.

               From the Police room we ran back across the pitch, along the road to

               the Control U r t jA    on Leppi ngs L a n e .    From there we then went to the

               Police Obsety^a/iyn ^Ttflasr a n d , on finding the ground was about to be

               ill personnel       to remain on their a pal ianaer whilst the g round emptied,

               When the crowds had subsided I thers accompanied ACO HORNSBY to the

               West Terracing where DO LOCKWOOD wajCs contacted.                From there I went to

               the gymnasium where ACO HORNSBY reqji&sted I take a few general

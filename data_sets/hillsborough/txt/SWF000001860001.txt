Dear Sir,

FA CHALLENGE CUP COMPETITION
SEASON 1987-88
SEMI-FINAL TIES
SATURDAY 9TH APRIL 1988

As is customary this time of the Season, I am writing to
enquire whether your Club would be interested in staging
an FA Challenge Cup Semi-Final Tie on Saturday 9th April
1988 or a Replay during the following mid-week.

I would inform you that you may charge 10% of all gross
gate receipts, less V.A.T., for the hire of the ground.
I would also like to take this^opportunity of clarifying
the position with regard to Executive Boxes. For Boxes
leased out for the Season we would require a payment equal
to the number of seats at top ticket price, while in the
case of Boxes hired out on the one-off basis for the match,
your Club will be entitled to retain 50% with the rest
being paid into match receipts. These amounts, however,
should not .be included in the gross gate receipts when
calculating the fee for the hire of the ground.

In the event of your Club playing in a Semi-Final Tie,
would you still be prepared to take the other Semi-Final
Tie on your ground the same day, bearing in mind the
administrative cost involved?


continued....




                         Registered Office: 16 Lancaster Gate, London W2 3LW
                         Incorporated in London     Registration Number 77797
Please indicate if your Club has the necessary insurance cover
for matches of this nature. Clubs should also note the new
requirements of Challenge Cup Rule 26(b) whereby the two
competing Clubs shall be entitled to 50% of the tickets for
sale. The Association in its absolute discretion may vary these
allocations.

Details of spectator segregation should be provided together
with details of the present ground capacity, number of seats
and standing places also indicating if safety fencing is
provided around the pitch.

Clubs should also note that any special areas such as
Executive, Vice-President, family or any similar seated or
standing area cannot be retained by the staging Club. All
parts of the ground must be allocated entirely for the two
competing Clubs with the exception of Directors Box, which
will be controlled by this Office.

An early reply would be appreciated.

Yours faithful 1v.___

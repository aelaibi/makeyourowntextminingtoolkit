When we spoke in Blackpool a few weeks ago, you raised the issue of the funding by
South Yorkshire Police Authority of the defence costs of former Chief Superintendent
David Duckenfield and former Superintendent Bernard Murray in the private
prosecution brought against them.

There is discretion for a police authority to provide financial assistance to police
officers and former officers who face legal proceedings, which may include criminal
proceedings, arising out of their service with the force. The decision whether to agree
to individual requests for funding is entirely one for the police authority concerned,
and I regret it is not a matter on which it would be appropriate for me to comment, or
intervene.

       Dear Sir

       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

       Mr Gareth Williams and Mr Peter Birts are retained by the
       Crown Prosecution Service to advise in respect of the above
       matter.

       I enclose a copy of a letter dated 30 October 1989 which I
       have r e v i v e d from Solicitors who represent the South
       Yorkshire*Police in the current civil proceedings.

       I would respectfully refer Counsel to the copy advice which
       they had kindly prepared and I should be grateful to hear
       Counsels' comments on condition three which is referred to in
       the fourth paragraph of the enclosed letter.  Mr Williams and
       Mr Birts will recall discussing this matter briefly during our
       return journey from a visit to the Hillsborough Stadium on
       Friday, 10 November 1989.

       I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

       Yours faithfully

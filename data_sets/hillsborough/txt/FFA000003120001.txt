                                        HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

      I am writing to thank you for your letter and to ask you to
 forgive me for not replying to you in detail.  As I am sure you will
 appreciate, a very large number of letters have been received.

     All the letters have expressed sadness and, in some cases,
disbelief at the awful events at Hillsborough.  We join with you
in sympathising with all those personally affected, in whatever
way, by the tragedy.

     Many of the letters have made suggesions concerning perimeter
fending at ground, often with helpful diagrams, and we are studying
these most carefully.

      Others have made their views known on whether this season's
F. A. Challenge Cup Competition should proceed or be abandoned.
Either way it is a very difficult decision for The Football
Association to have to make.   We recognise that it is a very
sensitive situation.

     Thank you once again for your interest and support at this
difficult time for football.

                                                         Yours sincerely,




                                                         Chief Executive

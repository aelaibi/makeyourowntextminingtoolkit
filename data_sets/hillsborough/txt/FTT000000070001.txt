270.    POLICY           i




      The Chairman and Mr, Hardaker reported on various discussions with the
Pool Promoters' Association, A separate Trust was to be established with
very wide terms of reference.   The Trust Deed of the F.G.I.T, would be revised
by deleting object D, leaving it to continue to cover purposes A, B and C.
The new major Trust would contain representative? of the I\A., Scottish F.A, ,
and P.F.A, as well as of the League, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman being
appointed by the Pool Promoters' Association,   The Chairman said he had been
invited by the P P A , to become Vice-Chairman of the new Trust, He had
decided to accept in the interest of securing an agreed settlement. This would
involve him giving up the Chairmanship of the F . G I . T , , which he greatly
regretted. Mr. Hardaker said he understood that the Pool Promoters' Association
would raise the contribution from Spotting the Ball to 20% which would be paid
to the new Trust which would pass 3/5ths to the existing Trust. The existing
Trust would be re-constltuted under a new deed.

      In view of these developments, it was decided not to pursue yet the
question of improvements policy, nor to ask for an early meeting with the
Pool Promoters' Association as previously decided.  It was felt also that It would
be inappropriate under the circumstances to hold a meeting with the Football
League Management Committee at the present time.

      A letter from Bolton Wanderers requesting a loan could also not be
considered in any great detail until future policy was determined.

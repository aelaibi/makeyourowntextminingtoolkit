Dear A.C.C. Jones,


Re: SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 19 75 (As Amended)


On looking through my papers I see I have a letter from the
Administration & Legal Department addressed to Mr. Mackrell
regarding this incident, I enclose the same for your information.

I am not sure whether any of the interviews have actually taken
place, I certainly havn't received any copy statements as yet.

It is only right that I should say that this matter was mentioned
to me and I felt that if the Local Authority had a statutory
duty regarding the licencing and continuing licencing of the
ground that they had to be in a position to satisfy themselves
regarding the position with regard to the ground.




Yours j^incerely.

           Mr. G. Mackrell,
           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
           Hillsborough,
           Sheffield,
           S6 1SW.

            Dear Graham,

            Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (As Amended)

            I refer to your conversations with myself and other Officers which took
            place on Sunday, 16th April, 1989.  I now write to confirm that the
            terracing at the Leppings Lane end of the Football Ground must not be used
            for the admission of spectators until such time as steps have been taken to
            examine in detail the safety of that whole area. The steps are in the
            pipeline now and hopefully further clarification of this issue can be
            arrived at shortly.

            I understand that the next football match is planned for Hillsborough on
            29th April, 1989, and prior to that date a full inspection of the stadium
            will be held. I will make arrangements for this inspection as soon as
            possible.

            In addition to the usual annual inspection the Council will expect to'be
            thoroughly briefed in connection with the proposed stewarding of the ground
            at the next and subsequent matches.

            Following discussions with H. M. Coroner I wish to arrange to interview
            staff employed by the Club in connection with their duties relating to crowd
            safety.  These interviews will relate to both the present and the proposed
            crowd control measures.  Copies of the interview records will be passed onto
            H. M. Coroner.

            This letter simply serves to set out the existing position in relation to
            the stadium. Obviously more detailed discussions will take place on a
            regular basis from now on.

            Yours sincerely,




            Acting Head

Dated                      170589                                                            S ig r t e d


            At about 8.30 am on Saturday,           13th April   1989,    I commenced an ent ra

             tour of duty at Hackenthorpe Police Station,               during which I was to be

             employed in crowd control          duty at Hillsborough football      ground?

            Sheffield,        -for the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, FC

            as part of serial          16 under the supervision of Police Sergeant          1288

            Payne.

            Following the arrival          of   all officers at the ground we ware briefed

             in the North Stand by senior          officers.

            At about        11,15 am Serial     16, which consisted of PS 1288     P a y n e , PC *s

            607 T a y l o r , 2980’'Wright,     115 Huckstepp,   3066       Huckstepp, 1713 Best,

            620 Yates,        963 Evans,   Duffy and Cerrone and myself,       commenced duty at

            the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground.                   Myself,

            £980,     115 and 607 were supervising turnstiles ABC.

             Initially the flow of fans through this turnstile was slow and

            orderly,        consisting of mainly families or singles or pairs of

             predominantly males        in their early twenties.         The mood of these fans

            was very good natured and from talking to a number of these fans it

            became apparent that they had had not trouble                in travelling to

            Sheffield or reaching the ground.            It was also apparent that while a

             number of these fans had been drinking alcohol               none were drunk and
                                                                                                                          PAGE        ;
                                                                                                                          R430

their      behaviour was                   jovial      but   socially         acceptable.

H o w e v e r , I was a p p r o a c h e d           numerous         times      toy Nott ingahm               For e s t    fans

who    had k n o w i n g l y         pur c h a s e d    tickets        for    the L e p p i n g s Lane           (Liverpool)

Due     to the         c a p acity         crowd e x p e c t e d all         were a d v i s e d        that    they would

be a ll o w e d e nt r y to the                  section of the gr o u n d to whi ch the tickets

a p p 1 ie d .

At    this       time       I also         saw    large numbers            of youths            g a t hering     beyond the

bounds       of the ground,                  consuming         drinks        from tins           prior     to entering

the     ground.

At    this       time most           fans        entering      the     g r o u n d were s e a r c h e d for           pohibited

only      small        numbers         of fans were            searched,          and at         this    time      I noticed

that a far             greater         p r o p o rt io n of these            fans had           consumed alcohol                and

that as a result                    some were a d v i s e d          regarding          their         behaviour.           On

three       s e p arate        o c ca si on s      I heard abuse             shou t e d        by fans at myself and

other       officers           at    times w hen s e a r c h i n g was              being        carried       out.        On

none      of these            o cc as i o n s     was    1 able to           identify          the offender.              It was

a p p a re nt        that     once at         the t ur n s t i l e s      the    fans were now             impatient            to

enter       the ground.               The        fans were also            by now more vociferous,

At about           S .38   pm   ( -1 4 S 8 >    I resumed from the               police      room and while

w al k i n g along         the w a l k w a y to the            rear and below the West                   Stand     I saw

numerous           (thirty      plus)          males   uri n a t i n g against         the     fence w h i c h    runs

a l o n g s id e    the w a l k w a y to the            stand side-             The   penises      of many       of the

males and the stre a m s                   of urine          on the      floor were       clearly visible              to

all    of the         p e d e s tr ia n traffic          trave l l i n g along          that walkway.

Due    to the         large     number          of off e n d e r s an arrest was               not the

a p p r o p r i a t e action,          but on r em on st r a t i n g w i t h these m ales                some     became

abusive,           shouting       o b s ce ni ti e s     such as:

"This       is your        fuckers         fault".           "You sh o u l d     be fucking        over there

            ’re w a n t e d ,
where y o u 1                            not     pissing about            here doing nothing. "

A ft e r    clearing        the are a of o f f enders                 I continued to the              turnstiles,

a r r i v in g     there    at about 3.0 2              pm (15QE).          At this       time     the   t u rnstile

are a was          occupied       sol e l y by u n i f o r m e d Police Officers,                    there   being

about       five,      a l 1 fram serial               16.

We    remained at that                 place a w a i t i n g       late    comers       or further       instruction

as    to deployment,              but after about                four minu t e s        1 heard a police           radio

my    colleagues           I e nt er ed the            pitch via a w a l k w a y w h i c h         runs around, the

the N a r t h S t a n d .         On e n t ering             the   pitch area          I bad a clea r v i e w o f

Pe n 3.          I could see Police Officers,                         scaling and at the              top of the

sa f e t y fence,           Fans were            in a similar            position       to the     rear of       the

fence.           I could also            see bodies           lying      in all       places    to a depth of

about 7 '          being     forced agai n s t                the fence and           concrete     barrier       by the

pressure           of s up p o r t e r s       behind         some were o b v i o u s l y dead.

O f f i c er s     were    trying        to pull        fans over         the    fence,      while    others      were

e nc ou r a g i n g     fans w hi ch           remained       standing      to move       back up the        stand, to

I m o v ed    i m m ed ia te ly to the gate           of Pen 3, w h i c h        I could, see to be

open.        Officers     were       trying    to pull       the    dead and       injured out        through

this gate,       and a ss i s t e d a fan w hose             leg was        trapped      betw e e n the     crush

of bodies and the           concrete          gate    step.        His ankle was o b v i o u s l y

broke.       I also     p r ev en te d fans whi ch were              falling      thro u g h the     uppe r

half    of the gate from falling                    onto    him by kneeling ac r o s s him               and

allowing       'them to    land on my back an d               roll       off.

A f t e r about S m i nu te s         the    pressure       from the        fans above was          eased and

I pulled him f rom the                gate and       laid him on the            pitch.      He was        thus     in

no danger       and     1’ r e t urned to the         pen to assist.

Due    to a number        of bodies having             been       cleared from the area              of    the

gate    I climbed        t hr o u g h the gate and where                 nec e s s a r y by walk i n g     on the

b o d i e s , I moved     to the       rear of       the    pen from there          1 assisted        in the

removal       of a number        of bodies,,         ini t i a l l y to the       rear    of the     pen,      and

finally,       w hen    clear    e n o ug h to the         gate    to pen 3 and a vent              in the

fence    between the         pen an d the           pitch.

I can    remember a number              of bodies w h i ch          1 handleds

1.             A youth,       approx.         S3 years,       who       X carried w i t h a n o t h e r     fan

                to the      rear      of the    pen.        I felt       no heartbeat and detected

                no     responses.       I rendered          cardiac massage and              this alone

                a p p e a r e d to    revive the youth,             who     1 later      saw being assisted

                away.

S.             A girl,      about      16     years    old,       who    I helped     carry to the gate

                She was      clearly w ea r i n g          only a shirt         to her     upper     body,

                but    I h eard no          comments made          to myself       or the     other       officers

                r e g arding     this       fact.     I b e l i e v e d she was dead.

3,             A youth,       approx,         20 years,       who       I lifted by his upper              body

                to remove        from the       crush.        His       head was hanging           to one      side

                and     I believe       him to have          had a broken          neck.      As    I 1 ifted

                him anot h e r       male     fan,    of    the    same age,       who was     standing

                    facing me          from the other             side      of the    body,       lifted    his fists

                    to chest          height and shouted:                "You bastards,            y o u fucking

                    b as ta rd s. "      I said s o m e t h i n g        to the fan then            ignored him,

                    moving       the    body to the gate               of    pen 3.

4.                  A fat male,          approx.       25 years,            wear i n g a tee shirt and jeans

                    who    I assisted          to move to the               gate.     As    the body was          being

                    iti'3no &u v r sd through the gate                  I fell      in the g a t e w a y onto my

                    left    side and          the s t om ac h a r e a of the man fell                    onto my face

                    This was          only very brief as the                  other       officers       pulled    the

                    body off and             clear.

Whilst        in the       pen and on the             pitch       1 can remember            that    I assisted

w i t h other        bodies       taut I can remember                  no details         of them.

Du r i n g    the entire          o pe ra t i o n    I was aware            of fans to the          rear    of the

pen and        in the       s tand above            s h o uting abuse         such as       "Fucking murderers.

At the        same     time      I was a s s i st ed        by other         fans    in removing          bodies.

These        fans    did as they were                told w i th ou t        complaint       or    comment.

S ho r t l y a fter        entering          the    pen    I had seen a small               group of youths,

from the         rear of the            pen throw what             I r e cognised to be the upper                   bar

of a h a r r i e r .        The       p roje ctile        hit   the     top of the fence and officers

on tIte fence an d               be 1 ow were        caused       to    rai se the i r arms         i n prote ct i o n »

I did not see w h e r e                the    barrier       landed and         I could see          no    reason for-

throwing        the bar          other       than to       injure       officers.

At about 3 .40             pm     (1540)       1 left       the    pen to join a line for m e d by

officers across                 the    pitch.       As one we w a l k e d first              towards       the Notts.

F orest       s u p p o r t e r s , in doing         so r e d i r e c t i n g Liverpool           fans    back    to the

e n closu res a l l o c a t e d         to them.          We    encountered          no    resistance       from fans

on the        pitch.

At about 4.00              pm    (1600)       1 was       further       d i r ected to assist            in the

superv i s i n g       of a       number       of bodies w h i c h had been laid to the rear of

barriers         near      the L e p p i n g s Lane         entrance,         on the       service road next             to

            the      river.     I had not h an d l e d any of these   bodies     on the    pitch or   in

            the      pen.

            Following         the   removal   of the bodies wit h other    officers       I went   to the

            N or th S ta n d where we were        debriefed.   We were    then    released    from duty.

    Dear Sir

    HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY -                                  WRITTEN EVIDENCE

    I refer to your letter dated 1 June 1989 in connection with the Lord
    Justice Taylor Judicial enquiry in to the events at Hillsborough and
    outline the following information in respect of the football grounds within
    the West Midlands and the problems encountered.

    1.      LATE ARRIVALS/DRUNKENESS

            Experience within the West Midlands area from all grounds reflects that
            spectators on the whole arrive to the ground within the last 20 minutes
            before kick off time.  This has the effect of producing what can be
            described as 'tidal flow' upon the turnstiles.  The spectators then
            become difficult when their access to the ground is not at such a
            expedient level as demanded.  We have also experienced fans actually
            arriving in the area well before a kick off time examples are as
            follows:

            ASTON VILLA -V- SHREWSBURY

            45 away supporters arrived early by coach and forced access into a
            local licensed premises where violence took place resulting in the
            licensee receiving wounds.  Quick police action resulted in all 45
            being arrested for Assault and Public Order offences.

            W.B.A. -V- READING

            Reading supporters were stopped under pre-planned policing operations
            and alcohol found in the coach in which they were travelling.




t h e o f f ic e r d e a l in g w it h t h e c o r r e s p o n d e n c e   is   Chief Inspector Morris                      EXTENSION        2283
W.B.A. -V- CRYSTAL PALACE

Crystal Palace fans arrived early and licensed premises within the City
of Birmingham some 5 miles away experienced capacity customers.

This action is repeated most Saturdays within the Birmingham City
Centre licensed premises.

COVENTRY CITY -V- ASTON VILLA FC

Aston Villa fans were able to visit Coventry City well before kick-off
due to local trains running on schedule service every 30 minutes.
Supporters were able to visit licensed premises and consumed alcohol,
arriving at the football ground only some minutes before kick-off.

BIRMINGHAM CITY -V- NOTTS FORREST FA CUP 5TH ROUND

Intelligence was gleaned following a number of supporters arriving
intoxicated at the ground that the coach firms had made a detour to the
prescribed route to enable supporters to consume alcohol well outside
of Contingency plans in this case some 25 miles away.

During the 1988/89 season within this Police area 373 arrests inside
football stadia and 324 outside have been alcohol related mainly of
drunkeness offences.

SPECTATORS WITHOUT TICKETS

In any all ticket game where the demand outstrips the availability
spectators without tickets can be expected to travel in the hope of
obtaining a ticket from 'Touts' or the host club who may have tickets
for sale on the day. Efforts to curb the touts are made but the
legislation concerning this matter is totally unsatisfactory. Despite
press announcements of all ticket games with no tickets available on
the day experience shows that there will undoubtedly be fans arriving
"on the chance".  This was highlighted at a recent game Coventry -v-
Aston Villa where at one point some 300 supporters arrived without
tickets and actively pursued any opportunity to enter the ground by
whatever means thought appropriate.

The 'Tout' problem is also raised whereby tickets are sold which are
usually for the home supporters enclosure but are sold to away fans, no
matter how thorough the police planning this does present potential
flash points to public disorders.

ATTENDANCE RESTRICTIONS

Attendance restrictions placed on clubs do not entirely deter
supporters without tickets travelling.  Usually they travel in private
vehicles where there can be no prior check and upon arrival can
purchase tickets from touts or use the turnstile facilities to gain
entrance where quite frankly no check can ever be 100% efficient and
ever more so where the turnstile operator is dishonest.
4.   PROBLEMS AT TURNSTILES

     Problems at turnstiles are a source of irritation for Police and
     spectator alike. Where crowds of spectators build up at turnstiles
     they quickly become frustrated fearing that capacity will not allow
     them entrance.  This leads to spectators jumping turnstiles, or
     attempting to crawl under a turnstile whilst another spectator enters
     legally, this occurred at the FA Cup Semi-Final on 15 April 1989 with
     Everton supporters arriving late and by sheer volumes jumping
     turnstiles to gain access to the ground.   However, by far the most
     serious problem is the question of turnstile operator fraud.   In most
     cases these operators are paid a small gratuity, by the club for these
     duties which lends itself to operators finding ways of making extra
     money by allowing uncounted supporters into the ground. There is no
     doubt that this is a common practise as most operators work for several
     clubs within the area.  Indeed two weeks following the Hillsborough
     tragedy a turnstile operator was arrested at the Aston Villa -v-
     Middlesborough match for taking cash from supporters at an all ticket
     fixture and allowed spectators to climb over his turnstile it was
     estimated that some 20 plus supporters were allowed access this way.
     During cup ties there is no doubt supporters apply pressure on
     operators for this practise to be applied.

     FORGED TICKETS

     Our experience is that because of moves in the use of heat sensitive
     paper and computer controlled tickets that incorporate intricate
     designs the availability of forged tickets is not a problem.




     VIDEO EVIDENCE AVAILABLE

     Evidence by video has been utilised on occasions during 1988/89 to
     support prosecutions of alcohol consumption in private boxes during the
     game at Aston Villa.

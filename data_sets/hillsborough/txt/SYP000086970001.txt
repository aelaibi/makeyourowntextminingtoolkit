Neither        myself             or     the    Anaesthetist               were       wearing             any    identifying

lines,        we    omitted              to    pack..        Because         of      this,       there          was     an       element           of

delay     in t r y i n g           to a s k      where        any      further            seriously             ill     patients              were,.

I think        if we          had        been    i d e n t i f i a b l e > we         could          have       been        directed              by

I went        around          a number           of       patients         who       were       lying       on     the          pi t c h .        It

was     difficult             to       tell     at    a    glance,         the       nature          of    the    majority               of

injuries           whether             people        were     seriously              hurt       or    not.        After            attending

perhaps        another             15 or 2 0          individuals,                I found            no    one w h o            was    in     need

of     urgent       medical              attention,               I wa s     not      able       to       tell     where           tne       crush

ha d    been       and       at    this        point,        I went        to     one      of    the       Senior           Police

Officers           on    the       pitch,        and       explaining             who      I was,          asked        if       he    could

tell     me    where          any        of    the    serious          casualties               were       and    he        directed              me

through        to       the       Sports        Hall.

some     15    casualties                 requiring           attention,              it was          obvious           that          almost

                There     were          a     lot      of    people          down      on     the       ground       who,          whilst       not

                requiring              immediate             resuscitation,                   appeared          quite           dazed and            confused,,

                Seeing     as          there        wa s     no w      a    plentiful          supply          of     Doctors having                    a       good

                supply        of       equipment,              I decided              that     I would           be       b e t t e r off       back            in the

                Casualty           Department.                    Ambulances             now a p p e a r e d         to       be     going      to      the

                Hallamshire                 and     I approached                 one     of    the       Senior          Police Off ficers                       who

                arranged           a    lift        back       to      the      Department              for    me.




                I would        estimate                that       I arrived            back        at    the    casualty Department                               at     the

                that    each           patient          had       at       least      two D o c t o r s        attending              them      and         I

                reported           back        to Mr.          WARDRGPE            who       directed          me    to       go     back     to     the          main

   to     direct          them     to     the      Physiotherapy               Department              at    the H o s p i t a l         where          i

   suffered           a degree            of    asphyxiation.                  It    is    difficult              to    remember

   individual              cases.            The    majority           of     them       were     in a d e g r e e           of    discomfort

   on     inspiration.                  A significant                 number        of    them       appeared           to    be    under          tne

   influence              of a l c o h o l ?       though        I could           only    say       I,sat one          or    two       of    them

   were       i ntox i cated.

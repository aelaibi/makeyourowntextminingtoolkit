           At 8 am (0800)       on Saturday,   15             1989   (150489),      I commenced duty

            as MB 2-1     in companv with POL PC 906 BAGNALL. in a marked patrol                      car

           D5390WE.      At a briefing held at Woodall Services,                  we were djesignated

            to cover the S bound e xit slip road, at Junction 36, Tankers ley.

           At 9 am (0900) we took up position on the grass verge at the very top

            of the slip road,      observing traffic and stayed in that position until

           approximately 2.55 pm (1455),            except for a break of half an hour to

            examine a vehicle      in Barnlsey about          10.30 am (1030).         The traffic flow

            from the motorway was moderate until              11.15 am   (1115) when it started

            to become heavy with private cars and coaches,                 a lot of which were

            easily identified as f o o t b al 1 supporters.          We stopped several            buses

            which were displaying      ’Motts F o r e s t ’ signs     in the window,         but which

           were   conveying Liverpool      supporters,        and requested that the signs be

removed to avoid confusion later.

Traffic: was never that heavy that a back             log down the slip road was

caused, and after        12 midday    (1200)    it became quiet again with a normal

Saturday traffic fow.         About    1.30 pm (1330)    traffic became

exceptionally light,        and I cannot       remember any coaches    coming   past

after that time,       this was something that surprised both POL. PC BAGNALL.

and myself.

At 2.30 pm (1430)        traffic: was so Jrlght that     it was suggested over the

radio that an early meal         be 'Ufken, but this was decided against.

At 2.55 pm (1455) we        1e^ ty Q u .nction 36 to travel     to Woolley Services

f or meal.      S h o r 1 1y af terwards the? *operat iona 1 support ” rnessage was

passed for vehicles to attend at the Hillsborough g r o u n d , and directed

to Gate       *0* Leppings Ln.    About 3.15 pm (1515) as I drove down fcjal ifax

Rd towards Leppings Ln,          I saw groups of people walking towards          the

g r ou n d.   0 nc:e onto Leppi ngs Ln we e n c ountered c rowds of peopi e wai k i ng

away from the ground,        many spat at the patrol       car, and were shouting

and swearing at us.         1 parked the patrol      car and we walked     into the

ground at Gate 0.         I saw injured peopIe being brought away from the

stands, and numerous others           laid on the ground alongside a side wall,

and opposite, alongside a fencing by the              river.    Some of these    people

were obviously d e a d .

At this time supporters were coming out from the stands,                 many were

obviously the worse for alcohol,           these were swearing and threatening

police officers who were forming a cordon to protect the injured and

first aiders.

I went to a side entrance between Leppings Ln /£nd Penistone Rd,                  below

the Police      control b o x , and gave assistance/Co         injured people brought

f rom the stands , and then i n company wi^h/^ Q L PC BAGNALL. and two

Doncaster Traffic Officers,           attempted to keep the rear access         road

c'iear   for emergency traffic.         At 5 pm (1700) we left the ground and

              began to walk back to 'the patrol     car, again we were subjected to

              verbal abuse, and spat at,      some Liverpool supporters       came right up to

              us swearing and pushing.       I could smell stale beer on their breath,

              because of the circumstances      neither POL PC BAGNALL o r I took any

             action against these     people,   but got into the patrol   car and left the

              scene to patrol    the A&16 road to F louche   (Pertistone) .

        A **-
      H ILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - QUESTION OF W H E T H E R ANY
      UNDERTAKING WAS GIVEN TO THE EFFECT THAT EVIDENCE GIVEN
      BY WITNESSES WOULD NOT BE USED IN SUBSEQUENT CRIMINAL
      PROCEEDINGS                              --------------------------

      I have just spoken to Peter Whitehurst about this. Our joint recollection is that the
      then Attorney General did not give any undertaking of "qualified/limited immunity’1
      for the purposes of the Hillsborough Inquiry. This would seem to be borne out by the
      Pre-Inquiry Statement which Lord Justice Taylor (as he then was) gave at the
      Preliminary Hearing in Sheffield on 28 April 1989.

      If an undertaking of this kind had been given, we believe that it would have been
      included in Taylor L.J.'s Pre-Inquiry Statement. You will see from the attached
      transcript of the 28 April 1989 Hearing that there is no reference to any such
      undertaking.

      I trust that this is sufficient for your purposes.

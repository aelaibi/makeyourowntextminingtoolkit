A SURVIVORS ACCOUNT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

INTRO D UCTIO N                             December      1989

When I reached the age five my father decided I was old enough to learn the religion
of our great city; he took me to a football match. My father being a true Evertonian,
took me to Goodison. I think from that day on I was hooked on the atmosphere created
at football grounds. However, the responsibility of being a five year old Evertonian
supporter was quite traumjatic and although I was innocent, I wasn’t stupid and
decided to opt for the more rewarding role of a five year old Liverpool supporter.

When I was old enough I went to Anfield with my friends, we sat on the crush barriers,
which is how all the little lads did their apprenticeship on the Kop. I was soon to learn
that the Kop was the best classroom I had for my education about life. I was taught how
to compete with loyalty, passion and scouse spirit, but at all times with fair play and
respect for others. The Kop and Liverpool Football Club was the easiest place to fall in
love with.

At the age of nineteen I gained entrance to North East London Polytechnic to study a
biology course. It was a sad time when I couldn’t renew my Kop season ticket.

However, living away from Liverpool, people made going to see the reds play that
extra bit special to me. I’d been to an F.A. Cup semi-final in 1986 at White Hart Lane
and the atmosphere at that match had been electric. This year I’d managed to get a
ticket for the semi-final at Hillsborough; it was on April 15th, the last day of my Easter
hoJidays.

The excitement I had was intolerable, to be part of the atmosphere of Liverpool football
supporters on the day before I had to return to London, meant the world to me.
                                           (2)

                                       April 15th

My friend and I left Priory Road, Liverpool on a Barnes Travel Coach No. 54 at
approximately 11.30 am. Our coach was one of the last to leave and was consequently
only half full, the atmosphere was quiet. When we reached somewhere around
Manchester most of the football coaches were turning onto a motorway, but our coach
along with one other coach chose a different route, I don’t know the name of the route
but eventually it proceeded across narrow roads over the Pennines, the coaches got
caught behind a tractor for a length of the journey, but other than this we were in no
traffic jams or hold ups.

The coach parked in Sheffield at 2.00 pm. My friend and I joined the crowds walking
to Hillsborough football stadium down Leppings Lane. Some supporters were
drinking from cans, but I did not see any drunkenness. As I got closer to the ground I
saw a policeman stopping football coaches that were arriving in Sheffield, I presume
this would be to search for alcohol and supporters without tickets. However, I did not
see policemen having problems with any drunken supporters. We reached the
football ground at approximately 2.20 pm, I thought we had reached the ground in
ample time as my ticket for the Leppings Lane terracing reccomended that I took up a
position 15 minutes before kick off.

There were two sets of turnstiles separated by an iron fence on the left hand side of
Leppings Lane as I approached the ground. There was a steward positioned at the
entrance to the nearest set of turnstiles, he was surrounded by a large group of
supporters all asking him how to enter the ground with their tickets.

I’d never been to Hillsborough before, so I decided to do the same. When the steward
got round to me, he looked at my ticket and told me that because my ticket had blue
print on it I was to use the entrance on the other side of the iron fence. This entrance I
was to use was entrance B. Positioned outside the blue gates to entrance B were a
few policemen on horseback talking to each other, however they were making no
filtration of the supporters walking into the entrance. I saw no other stewards
marshalling supporters with their tickets and amongst the supporters on the street
there seemed to be much confusion of exactly how to enter the ground. I passed
through the gates to entrance B and was immediately faced with a solid mass of
supporters infront of the turnstiles. There were two policemen on horseback at the front
of the crowd; they were surrounded by supporters.

I couldn’t understand the system South Yorkshire police were using. At Anfield and
other away grounds I’d often been to matches that had capacity crowds but I’d never
seen a solid mass of supporters infront of a number of turnstiles. I was used to seeing
a large presence of mounted police at turnstiles; forming the supporters into orderly
queues, and moving their horses up and down, inbetween the queues to stop them
merging into one solid mass of bodies. So I was quite taken aback by the situation that
                                          (3)
had been allowed to develop. However, the atmosphere was what I had expected for
a Liverpool semi-final, good humoured, joyous and pre-match singing. Supporters
were obviously eager to get into the ground but despite the lack of organisation by the
authorities, the crowd was well behaved. My friend and I joined the back of the crowd.

The mass of supporters infront of me did not seem to be moving very quickly and
supporters were gathering behind me at a greater pace. Before long I started to feel
pressure on rtiy body, the pressure continued to build up and I was carried forward
slightly towards the turnstiles. The numbers infrbnt of me were not being greatly
reduced and a crush started to develop. I became more uneasy about the situation as I
was unable to push back against the crowd to relieve the pressure from my body. Men
and women started to shout for help, some supporters were able to climb up onto the
iron fence to my left, out of the crush and walk along to the top of the turnstiles. Some
men were joining arms to try and push out from women and children they were
surrounding. I found myself unable to move my arms, trapped at my sides. Supporters
joining the back of the crowd were unaware of the potentially dangerous situation
arising closer to the front, and their pre-match singing continued.

I was slowly carried forward towards the turnstiles deeper into the crowd, I started to
become very frightened as it was becoming more difficult to breath. I tried with all my
strength to push my arms out away from my rib cage so that my lungs had room to
move. Men who were previously protecting women and children found themselves
fighting for their own breath. Everyone around me was screaming to the two policemen
on horseback to open the gate. I looked up at the policemen to my left hand side. I can
remember his face clearly as I had never seen a policeman with panic on his face
before. He was shouting to the crowd to push back but the supporters close enough to
hear him were unable to move, he then started to move his horse to the back of the
crowd but the pressure at the front continuecl to increase. I then saw a policeman
standing on the roof to the right of the turnstiles, he was shouting and signalling for
something but I didn’t understand whatever he was trying to communicate. I wondered
why he, or someone else wasn’t using the loud speaker system to communicate to the
crowd; a simple message to the back of Liverpool supporters to take a few steps
backwards would have relieved the desperate situation at the front. As it was, we were
trapped, there was no way out of the crush unless we were lucky enough to be forced
against the face of a turnstile, or if the policemen opened the gate, obviously many
supporters were shouting for the gate to be opened.

As I got very close to the front of the crowd I could see peoples heads were being
forced sideways against the wall inbetween the turnstiles, they were screaming for
help. I felt very out of breath and was desperately trying to avoid being forced against
the wall myself. I was pushed up against a man who was on the wall, my elbow was
digging into his back and he was in much pain, but I was unable to move. I eventually
managed to jam myself inbetween a line of men who were being carried into a
turnstile, the pressure on my body in this line was so powerful I was unable to gasp
                                            (4)
any breath at all, it took about another minute to be carried through the turnstile.

When I came out the other side of the turnstiles it was a huge relief to walk into the
open space, I was sweating and shaking at the same time. In the crush I had beep
separated from my friend and he was waiting for me inside the ground. Other
supporters coming through the turnstiles were shouting at policemen inside the
ground to do something about the crush outside. Sortie supporters were being helped
down from the turnstile roof to my left by policemen, these supporters had managed to
climb the iron fence to escape the crush. The screams outside were still audible inside
the ground. My friend and I took a few minutes to breath easy, he asked me did I think it
would be that bad on the terracing, I told him not to be stupid it would just be like
Anfield on the Kop. We went to the gents toilet and as we came out I saw a set of steps
to my left, there were two stewards standing at the base of the steps, we went up to the
stewards and I asked them could I enter the terracing via the steps, they both looked at
my ticket and one of them told me the steps would lead to the stand only and I should
enter the terracing through the tunnel and pointed to a tunnel behind me. This was
less than just five minutes before the players came onto the pitch.

As I looked down the tunnel I could see the pitch, it was such an obvious entrance to
the ground I wondered how I’d walked past it to the stewards. The terracing at the end
of the tunnel was split in two by a fence. My friend went to the right of the fence onto
the terrace,, I stood at the end of the tunnel and held back for a moment as I saw
supporters being pushed over and trying to find their feet, I wasn’t sure of the situation,
then I realised there was just a lot of turbulence in the crowd as the terrace seemed full
even though supporters were still entering to take up their positions. I followed my
friend into pen 3, when I reached him I told him to make his way over to the far right of
the terrace, as we forced our way through the crowd we reached a radial fence across
the terrace , although our side of the fence was packed out and very uncomfortable
the other side looked quite empty and there was large patches of concrete visible.
There were no visible entrances through the fence and so naturally we thought our
tickets weren’t allocated for that area, even though some supporters were climbing
over the fence. We moved a bit further back from the fence and stood infront of a
barrier (which was later the barrier to break).

The players came out onto the pitch and there was a huge roar from the crowd,
followed by pre-match singing. An old man with white hair aged 50-60 who stood next
to me asked what I thought of Alan Hansen being picked for the team, I told him I just
hoped he was fully fit again. Where I was standing I had a good view of the pitch and
the atmosphere around the ground was loud, which is all that normally concerns me
just before kick off, but at this ground I was still very shaken from the crush outside and
felt more nervous at the thought of all the supporters outside the turnstiles still to come
in, then I felt excited about the match. However I tried to keep telling myself that the
supporters outside must all have tickets for the empty pen next to me and surely
stewards would direct them to the entrance of that pen wherever it happened to be. I
                                           (5)
looked up at the Kop end of Forest supporters, it was massive and there seemed to be
now crowd turbulence, where as by this time (Approx. 1- 2 minutes before kick off) the
pressure around my body was starting to Ipuild up again but unlike outside I was
unable to stand still. I was being pushed around in the crowd. My friend asked me did
I want to climb the radial fence, I said yes and we forced our way over to the fence and
climbed onto it via a barrier, other supporters were doing the same thing but the
numbers able to do this were limited by the number of barriers directly next to the
fence in our pen.

When we jumped down into pen 2 there was room to walk freely up and down the
terrace. We walked approximately 5 metres from the fence and stood infront of the
closest crush barriers to the pitch. Another huge roar came from the crowd as the
match kicked off, I remember glancing back at the fence and seeing people were in
distress but I thought a surge had just occurred with kick-off that would ease in a
moment. I looked back towards the pitch to watdh the match, I then heard high pitched
screaming from children at the front of pen 3, they were screaming and crying at the
same time, supporters were spilling onto the pitch and some were trying to get the
attention of Bruce Grobilaar. I looked to the radial fence, the old man I had earlier been
talking to had been pushed over the the fence and had his face pressed against the
bars, he was staring straight at me and was shouting out with pain. I didn’t know what
to do, I hoped with the supporters escaping over the front perimeter fence the crush
would ease and the pressure come off the man. 6ut policemen were signalling to fans
trying to climb the perimeter fence to get back into the crowd.

There was another roar from around the ground, I glanced back at the pitch and saw
Peter Beardsley hit the crossbar, as the roar from around the ground lessened the
noise level remained deafening but only with the loudest, most frightening screams
from supporters everywhere in pen 3. I looked back at the radial fence, the old man’s
skull was being forced into the metal blue bars, his face was full of fear and pain, he
was trymg to take gasps of air inbetween his screams but the bars were making a
deep impression on his chest. Supporters in pen 2 were jumping onto the available
crush barriers to try and pull trapped supporters in pen 3 out, many were trying to pull
the old man out, but it was difficult to see whidh arms and legs belonged to which
supporters faces as the crowd was a tangled mass of bodies. When supporters could
reach someone arms it was almost impossible to pull them out. With the huge pressure
all the trapped supporters bodies were jammed together. There seemed to be more
effective action at the back of the crush were many supporters were being pulled up
into the stands.

I looked up at the pitch,, the match had been halted, many supporters who had
escaped the crush over the perimeter fence were having heated arguments with
policemen on the touchline. One policeman was standing on the perimeter fence
signalling to the crowd to move back a supporter who was crying and screaming at the
policeman that his brother was in the crush dying. Some policemen were trying to
                                          (6)

stop escaping supporters from walking onto the pitch.

A policeman then opened the gate in my pen {gate 2) and ran over to the radial fence
to join supporters in trying to pull people out. Many supporters then climbed out of this
gate and ran down the touchline to the perimeter fence infront of pen 3 to pull
supporters out. Some supporters ran out onto the pitch to give first-aid. A press
photographer ran across the pitch jumping over bodies on the touchline and started
taking photographs of the screaming supporters behind the bars. A supporter who was
crying next ^o the goalpost limped over to the press photographer and put his hand out
infront of the camera lens crying ‘no,’ the photographer ran around the supporter
closer to the screaming supporters. The crying supporter then punched the
photographer and ottier supporters on the touchline proceeded in punching the
photographer. Police ran over and pulled the photographer out of the supporters. Two
policeman then griabbed the initial crying supporter, he pointed to a body next to the
goalpost and told them it was his best friend and he didn’t know how to tell his wife
and children he was dead; the supporter broke down on the floor crying and the
policemen tried to console him.

Supporters were starting to be pulled out over the radial fence, carried past me
through gate 2. Supporters were still screaming as they were being carried past. O re
man was about 6ft, he wasn’t screaming, one supporter had hold of his shoulders
another held his legs, but the rest of his body inbetween had collapsed and the
supporter had difficulty trying to keep hold of him.

I looked back at the radial fence, many supporters had surrounded the old man trying
to pull him out so I Couldn’t see him. I looked along the fence, hundreds of grown men
were forced up against the metal blue bars screaming for their lives. Inbetween the
men I saw a young woman with blonde hair, her face was becoming distorted with the
pressure from bodies, because of the pressure on her head, it lOoked as though her
eyes were being forced out, the pain in her eyes captivated and stunned me. I looked
down her body on the bars, it was in a horrible, tangled, twisted shape. Occasionally
the crowd of bodies would move and her body would change shape, whenever her
body changed shape she would give the most horrifying scream or cry. I felt frozen,
unable to move or help anyone. No words can possibly come close to describing the
feelings I had watching other supporters being tortured to death. I stood there
watching a supporter go through hell on the otherside of the fence, knowing that
although we were both alive experiencing this nightmare, within minutes I would still
be alive and the other person would die, then I’d watch it happen to someone else,
again and again, everywhere on the fence.

The old man’s body was pulled up by supporters above the fence and he fell into the
group of supporters and was carried out of gate 2 onto the pitch. I never saw him
again. Many more supporters were starting to be pulled out of the crush ovei" the radial
fence and carried out through my pen, but a lot the red and frightened faces had
                                             (7)
turned white and blue. The pitch was starting to become flooded with bodies, many
supporters were giving mouth to mouth resuscitation and pressing up and down on the
chests of the unconscious. Supporters started to rip advertisement boards down on the
pitch to use as stretchers. An ambulance was driving slowly past the goalmouth along
the touchline, there was a man’s head lying in the path of the ambulance but the driver
couldn’t see him. Fans were screaming at the driver to stop. A supporter who was
ripping down advertisement boards ran over and pulled the man’s body out of the way,
the supporter then continued to rip down the advertisement boards but started to throw
them backwards over his head, he then broke down crying and two policemen
consoled him. There were various announcements over loud speakers throughout the
disaster but none were loud enough to understand.

One supporter was trying to lift a man’s body through the gate in my pen but was
struggling as the gate was quite high off the floor. The man’s sweat shirt had been
pulled over his head. I and a few other supporters ran down the the gate to help him.
As I lifted the body it felt freezing cold, I could feel the man’s rib’s were in pieces, his
body was covered in blue patches, wherever someone had their hands his body
would give in, nowhere looked firm. Two supporters on the touchline pulled the body
through the gate, the' man’s sweat-shirt fell off his head, his eyes were still open, his
face was a greyish white colour and his lips were dark purple, his mouth was open.
More bodies came from the radial fence to the gate and I lifted a few more, I felt like
breaking down but knew I couldn’t as some of the bodes were still live people, some
were even conscious crying names or words but nothing made sense to me. I qouldn’t
look back at the radial fence as I knew I’d knew I’d have to watch the people die who I
was lifting out. I don’t know how long I was at gate 2 for, I think it was minutes but if felt
like hours, I lost all sense of time.

I moved along the perimeter fence away from the gate and rested my head on it. It felt
difficult to stand up and I couldn’t feel my own body so I just held onto the fence, I
looked out across the pitch, I know I didn’t see ‘drunken soddin’ supporters
pickpocketing the dead. I saw Liverpool football supporters making heroic life saving
attempts, many of them had just watched their best friends or loved ones crushed to a
horrible death, many were frantically searching the pitch for lost friends or relatives.
Some supporters had just broken down into tears next to motionless blue and white
bodies. No one was urinating on the dead.

Two St. John’s Ambulance people had an oxygen tank and mask in the penalty area. I
had only ever seen an oxygen masked used on the television before and the injured
person had always come round. On the pitch I didn’t see one person come around
who had the mask on their faces.

I saw Kenny Dalglish climbing the steps of the control tower to the applause of some
supporters, he then gave an announcement over the loud speaker system. This
announcement was considerably louder than any of the other announcements,
                                           (8)

previously and I could understand every word he said. However by this time I was in
too much shock for the massage to mean anything to me.

I heard banging on the wall behind me so I looked around, a few supporters in the
stand were trying to rip the advertisement boards off the wall to be sent down as
stretchers. A policeman went up to the supporters and stopped them from doing this,
but as he did supporters everywhere along the front row of the stand started to rip the
advertisement boards off the wall and the policeman walked away. I ran back towards
the wall with the majority of the crowd in pen 2 to take the advertisement boards above
our heads down to the pitch and lift them over the perimeter fence. Supporters on the
touchline took the advertisement boards off us and started to stretcher the injured and
dead off. When the advertisement boards were initially ripped off Forest supporters in
the Kop end started to chant “No Scousers in Europe “. As I looked around the Kop
end a few Liverpool supporters were running down towards them, but they stopped
before they got there. When the Liverpool supporters were stretchering the dead and
injured off the pitch, onto the advertisement boards, it became apparent to the Forest
supporters what was happening and they applauded every stretcher off the pitch.

I saw a friend I knew on the pitch, I shouted him over, he told me there was a little boy
on the pitch who couldn’t let go of a dead man’s body and he was crying that it was his
dad. He told me he thought about thirty people were dead, I told bim I’d seen more
than thirty dead bodies carried past me.

People were no longer crushed in pen 3, the only bodies lifted out now were dead.
The painful screams had stopped but supporters were shouting to each other from the
stands, to the pitch as they were searching for their lost friends. Names of people were
being called out everywhere. One supporter was walking along the touchline with a
bucket of water and a plastic cup for supporters on the terracing to drink from. A
woman supporter was walking up and down the touchline crying, she was being
consoled by a policewoman who was also crying, they were looking along the
terracing for someone.

On the pitch, life saving attempts continued predominantly by the supporters. There
were a few St. John’s Ambulance people. Although, initially slow to recognise the
crush, many policemen and women also worked hard that day to save lives- However
the majority of the extra police draughted in, formed a line across the pitch which
served no apparent purpose.

Directly infront of me on the pitch was a pile of white bodies. Some I’d lifted over, fans
and policeman were giving last attempts to bring people round; but I already knew
they were dead. One by one they put pieces of clothes over peoples heads and they
were stretchered off. All I could feel now was that I wanted to go home and hold my
girlfriend.
                                            (9)
There was another loud speaker announcement. It asked supporters to remain in the
grourid a little longer so that the emergency services could exit the injured to hospital,
everyone applauded. The announcement then asked supporters to keep hold of their
ticket stubs for the replay, I remember thinking if everything I saw that day was real, the
announcement must have been a dream.

My friend and I stayed in pen 2 until most supporters had left, then we saw a gap at the
back of the racial fence, we walked upto and through it. Then we both stood staring at
the broken crush barrier we had earlier been standing infront of, in pen 3. I couldn’t
comprehend what I’d just seen happen there. We left the ground through the tunnel
and walked back up Leppings Lane. Local residents were kindly letting supporters use
their telephones. Every supporter I looked at was either crying or too shoqked tp
express an emotion. Every public phone box up Leppings Lane had lengthy ques., of
supporters, I didn’t know how I was going to phone home. We reached a Gateway
store with a small queue of mainly young supporters waiting outside the front door to
use the phone. My friend and I joined the queue, the assistant manager was allowing
two supporters at a time into the store to use the phone. When we got to the front, the
manageress came to the door and said she was sick of us and she was going to shut
up the shop, someone spat in her face and everyone walked off.

My friend and I got on our coach without phoning home, it was on the radio that police
said supporters without tickets kicked down the gate to enter the ground. Some
supporters on the coach still had their full tickets and said the police had opened the
gate. We waited in Sheffield a further three quarters of an hour because two young
lads were still missing but in the end the coach had to leave without them. The death
toll on the radio kept rising, all I could think was please don’t take anymore. Phone-
boxes for miles outside Sheffield had lengthy queues of supporters at them, when Vve
reached a phone without a queue, everyone got off the coach to phone home, the
house was engaged so I phoned a neighbour, it wasB.45 pm. when my family heard I
was still alive.

When we reached Liverpool, Priory Road, I said goodbye to my friend and t walked
home. I wouldn’t get a bus or a taxi, I felt too frightened to talk to ainyone about what I’d
seen. When I got home, my next door neighbour was standing at the gate, crying ,with
his girlfriend. He had been in the North Stand, he came up and gaVe me a hug, I
couldn’t say anything. I walked into our house, my mum gave me a hug and started
crying, my four year old sister asked me if Liverpool had won again. I phoned up my
girlfriend and she came down. When I held my girlfriend it was one of best feelings I’ve
ever had, holding someone who was warm, alive and breathing, feeling safe again.
3rd DECEMBER. SEVEN MONTHS ON.

At the age of twenty I have experienced the Hillsborough Disaster. In one day my
whole life was changed. I stayed in Liverpool the week following the disaster and went
to Anfield ^he following Saturday. On the bus going to Anfield a bus conductor got on,
for some reason I felt like the world was going to end. I started shaking, my heart was
pounding and I had strong shooting pains in my arms and legs, I didn’t know what was
happening to me. Then I realised I could hear voices on the conductor’s ‘walkie talkie,’
just like the voices on the policemen’s ‘walkie talkies’ on the Saturday before when
supporters were dying. This was the first panic attack I’d ever had in my life. I now get
them regularly. I returned to London the next day and suffered two days of constant
nightmares, everytime I woke up I saw peoples crushed faces and bodies around my
bedroom. Unlike other nightmares when I woke up, the feelings didn’t leave me
because I couldn’t tell myself that the nightmare wasn’t true. I still get these
nightmares. I left my course in London and felt like I was a total failure.

I couldn’t go to the Vernon Sangster Centre where the social workers were situated, as
the thought of talking about what I’d seen made me feel sick. In July my mother drove
me to the Vernon Sangster but I was too frightened to get out of the car. A social
worker came out to the c&r to talk to me, we hardly spoke about Hillsborough, he
referred me to a social worker on the newly appointed Hillsborough team, who I then
saw weekly and still do. With the help and support from my social worker I started
Liverpool Polytechnic in October, I now study psychology. I felt unable to return to
studying biology or any subject involving the human body; the person alive behind the
body matters so much to me now, Academically I enjoy the course, although,
sometimes it can be very difficult to concentrate. However, I am unable to attend
seminars, as involvement in groups, (or crowds), or performing a task infront of a
group (or crowd), provokes very strong panic attacks. I hope with time and support I
can overcome this fear.

I still suffer bouts of depression and have lost a lot of my self confidence, before
Hillsborough I felt quite self confident. When I am able to enjoy something, it is
normally only a distraction from Hillsborough for a few minutes or hours, it is difficult to
do something simple like watch a film or the new without something bringing a
flashback of Hillsborough.

I returned to Hillsborough six months after the disaster, I walked up to the gate I’d
passed bodies through and put 3 red roses in it. This was the first time I was able to cry
since April 15th. I feel like crying all the time but for some reason I am unable to break
down and cry.

One of the few places I’m not frightened of being in a crowd , is at Anfield. I still believe
the Kop and Liverpool Football Club is the easiest place to fall in love with. I’m most
grateful for the support I’ve had from my girlfriend, other survivors, and my social
worker, although I will never be the same person I was before the disaster, I’m
determined not to let Hillsborough beat me.

The account I’ve given is a very personal one and although I feel reluctant to share it
with many people, as a survivor of the disaster I feel I have a responsibility to tell what
really happened that day for the 95 supporters who can’t. To the old man I spoke to
and all those who suffered, REST IN PEACE.

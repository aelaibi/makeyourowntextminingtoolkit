         Dear Sirs,

         THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL TRAGEDY
         I write in acknowledgment of your letter of 7 February 1995
         suggesting that the Daily Telegraph may be in contempt of court
         as the result of the reporting, in particular the editorial,
         carried on 3 February 1995.

         The Attorney General has asked that some background enquiries be
         made.   I will write to you again as soon as possible.

         Yours faithfully,

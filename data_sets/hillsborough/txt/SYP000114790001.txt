                        At     this    time    I rushed ac r o s s          to the         perimeter       fence and       began    to help

                         people       down from       it.     Look i n g       into     the      crowd    I could see about          three

                        or four        people    laid out           on the t e r r a c e s        being    t r a mpled under       foot.

began 'to pull          with    them,      the fence         by now began to buckle and                      pull

away      from the      supports,         a gap a p p e a r e d and         i mmediately       people        began

to     climb through.            We a s s i s t e d    pulling        them out.          I then m oved            out

onto      the    pitch,    people      had begun kicking               down the a d v e r t i s i n g        boards,

they were         putting      the    injured upon           them.      I ran over         to two people

who were         struggling      to    carry a person on one                  of those make            shift

stretchers.           This     person a p p e a r e d       to be dead.           I took     hold of the

front      of    it and    then all        three      of us       began to      run across           the    pitch

towards         the Ko p end of the ground.                   We    then went t h r o u g h the

g r o u n d s m a n ’s entrance,       towards        the    gymnasium.          We then       took        the

person      into     the g y m n a s i u m where we were met                 by amb u l a n c e      staff and

first aid         people     they     i n structed us         to    put this        person     on the floor

in the middle           s e c t i o n of the gym.            We did this          then made          our way       out

onto      the    pitch again.          1 then       rushed to the assis t a n c e              of two bobbles

to be dead.            Again    1 took         hold of      one    end of the        board and we all

began to         run to the      g y m n a s i u m again.          Again we were          inst r u c t e d to        put

the      body on the       floor.         After    doing      so we all         began to       run out along

the      pitch,     on about     the      half way         line where        two a m b u l a n c e    men were

            I am a single woman and I live at the above address with my family.                                        I

            am employed full time as a                               at                 , and for the past

            two years       I have been a Special Constg&M'e in the South Yorkshi re

            Police based at Hammett on Rd Police Station.



            On Saturday the 15th of April                1989 (150489),        the day of the FA Cup

            Semi Final       between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest,,                  I was on duty

            commencing at 0900 ho u r s .          I          posted to Traffic duty in N e e p s e n d ,

            with Section Officer



            We took up that post at 1045 hours.                      There were other Officers            in that

            area.     Our particular     res pon si bi 1 ity was to direct the fans who came

            in via Neepsend Ln to park in a nearby industrial                         estate.
                                                                         PAGE         2
                                                                         S2 1 3 8



I had this same posting for the Semi Final        last year and this year

there seemed to be more fans        coming into town via this route than I

remember    last year.



When we took up our position in Neepsend,        there were fans arriving

already.     They cont i nued to arrive until we left the area just before

kick off.     We had been instructed at the briefing to make our        way to

the ground at this time and then make a general           patrol of the area

around the ground.        The fans that were arriving in Neepsend Ln were

mainly Nottingham Forest fans.



At about    1450 ho u r s , I recall following a group o f eight fans w ho were

rowdy and d r u n k .   They were kicking the plastic No Waiting     cones

about.     We followed them into a side road off Penistone Rd, where they

began to bang on the doors of a Pub there because the landlord had

closed his doors because the pub was full.

I d o n ’t know the name of the Pub,      but i t ’s near the Rose Inn. We

radioed for a transit van to come         to the scene, which it did, but the

youths had left the scene before        it arrived.



I don't know which team these youths supported.



We   continued to make our way to the ground together with hundreds of

supporters who were also going to the groui



At 1455 hours,     outside the Crown Pufyjtric House,   on Penistone R d ;

Ejection Officer                      XT
                               reported a Li
                                          Liverpool: fan for urinating       in the

Street.     The f a n ’s name was                               of
                                                                                           PAGE     3
                                                                                           SSI 38



             At   1505 hours, we received a radio message to go into the Hillsborough

             ground and go onto the pitch.           Once in the ground an Inspector told us

             to line up in front of the Spion Hop and face the fans and not let any

             of them onto the pitch.



             At   1510 hours,   I saw a youth run from the other end of the pitch,

             stand in front of the Nottingham Forest supporters and w a va his fists
                                                  -•
             at them.     I saw Se ct i on Officer            and Special Constable

^ ,rfLafe^ ^ r'qo onto the pitch to remove this mar?              ert ran off        as
        V>*'
               arrested by another Offi c e r .



             At about    1515 hours,   I saw that some supportr^ were       running from the
   A*9
er^'
             other end of the pitch carrying injured people           on advertising boards

         ,   that they had torn down.      These     injured people   were being   put down on

             the pitch and people were gathering around them, administering first

             aid.     I can't describe any of the       injured that were brought up to our

             end of the pitch.



             A Policewoman then asked rne to go to the gym situated behind the North

             Stand to get some first aid airways.          This was at 1520 hours,        just

             after the first ambulance arrived.



             When I got to the gym I saw people,         fans and Police,   bringing dead and

             injured people     into the gym.    There was a Policeman at the entrance

             asking   if the person was dead or injured and then directing them to

             different   parts of the gym.



             Most of them were being taken to the area alloted for the dead.
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            S2138

At that time I saw about fifteen bodies           laid out with their faces

covered.       After   I asked a Policewoman in the gym for the ai rways and

she told me that there w e r e n ’t a ny,     I couldn't    leave the gym because

they were bringing        in still more dead and injured.



When I was      in the gym I was trying to comfort a Policewoman in there

who was distressed and as         I was doing so they put a young      lad, about

14 or 15 years of age,         down in front of us.    His father was with him

and I heard the Sergeant tell him that he was dead and he covered his

face up.



This    lad was skinny with fair hair,        but I can't    recall what he was

wear in g .



Before this      lad was brought    in I saw a young woman,      about 23 years of

age, who was also dead.          The Sergeant was searching her for some mean

of identification.          She had fair hair,   small build,    she was wearing

jeans and black boots and I saw that the Sergeant was searching

through a green waxed cotton barber jacket which belonged to her.



These were the only two bodies that were near to me when I was              in the

gym.



At about      1530 hours,    I returned to the pitch and informed the other

Officers      that there w e r e n ’t any airways available.    The situation on

the pitch at this time was         chaotic.   Other ambulances had arrived and

I saw firemen on the pitch.          They were   rushing    injured people out of

the ground.       I remained on the pitch towards the Spion Kop end until

about   1715 hours, when we were told to go and sit            in the North Stand.

All the fans had left by this time.

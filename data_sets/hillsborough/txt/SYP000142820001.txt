                           NO

        NO




Q 13«   IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO SAY ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THE

        15 APRIL 1989?



        IN MY OPINION THE EVENTS THAT LEAD UP TO THE DISASTER WAS CAUSED

        BY LARGE GROUPS OF LIVERPOOL FANS TURNING UP LATE MOST OF WHOM

        HAD NO TICKETS FOR THE MATCH.               THEY WERE BLOCKING UP THE

        TURNSTILES THUS CAUSING THE FANS WITH TICKETS DIFFICULTY IN

        GAINING ACCESS TO THE GROUND.               THE FANS WITHOUT TICKETS WERE

        CLIMBING OVER THE WALLS AND TURNSTILES AND THEY WERE DETERMINED

        10 GET IN.

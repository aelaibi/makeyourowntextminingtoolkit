Mr R M Whalley
S e c r ^ ^ r y to Lord Justice Taylor




Reference Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry yesterday about whether there was
any video evidence to support the systematic filling of the pens at the
Leppings Lane End at the semi-final in 1988, I have viewed the videos and
have the following to say;-

The videos for 1988 are not terribly helpful in this regard. However, from
what I have seen, which is all that is available, there does not appear to
be any such filling of the pens as was suggested by the witness Bain.

I trust this is of assistance.

The    four     of us       in our       group walked            down    to the ground,              stopping          on

the way        for    something          to eat     in a fish and              chip shop.            The    pavements

were     crowded on a p p r o a c h i n g         the ground,            ma i n l y    by Mot tingham Forrest

any trouble,               We a r r i v e d at    the ground at about                   1.45    pm    (1345),           We '

wa l k e d   through        the main entrance                of w orth Road and made                  our way to

the main entrance                 of the     south stand.               We were        held up by the arrival

of the N o t t i n g h a m Forrest P l a y e r s " C oach and stood and

watched        the    players       get off       the       coach and enter             the ground.We             entered

the ground via gate marked                       ’E ' =      They were         no queues at           this gate.

Wa made        our way to our             seats     via gangway            18.        My seat    number       was 23

row NN „        There were          stewards        inside       the South Stand and

every t h i n g      was    running       smoothly and            in an orderly fashion.We                    sat

together        in the       four    seats       next to one another.                    At    this    'Lime it would

      about     1.50 pm          (1350).      1 had been to the                  same semi.--fynal m atch                   last

year and had also                 gone   to the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y vs Liverpool                   match

at Hi 13. sbo r ough earlier' this                  season.          On that          occasion,       had    stood on

tne    te rracing at the Leppings                      Ln e n d .

When     I sat       down     I noticed       straight away              that     the     centre      se ct i o n oi^/

tne    terracing           behind the        goal      at    the (....eppings Ln end was               very full .

I   could see         that       there was       spaces       on the       terracing          on the       side    section

nearest        to where      I was      sat,,     I spoke       to POL DC MADDOX          about      this and

we then        not iced that p e o p l e ,        ma i n l y youngsters,         were    climbing        over

the    dividing        fence-        om the      side    section    nearest       to us       into the

centre      section,         I think        this was      because most          of the singing           for

Liverpool        was     corning from        lads      in the    centre      section.         We then

n oticed       that    two   lads     in the      centre       section were       climbing       up either

onto     people's        shoulders       or the        barriers    and then diving             backwards

into     the    crowd.       This     was   being       done    in a good humoured way,                or

appeared        so from where we were                  sat.     I noticed       that    the    police

observation           post     was   just    to my left and slightly                  backwards      from

where     I was       sat,     1 saw the        post was manned,,              I then saw a young lad

about     twelve       to thirteen years,               carrying what a p p e a r e d         to be a

carrier        bag,    being    chased      by the       police around          the    perimeter area

from    the d i rection of the West Stand.                        The    lab    climbed over         the wall

Io o a r left and d i sa p p e a r e d f r o m view,,

The Police           Officers      stood on the          perimeter area          below us and were              ^

t r//1 n g t o c a m m u n i ca t e with        the    police    observation          post with a

personal        radio with         no success.           we assu m e d    the    laa had       climbed over

the wall        or stolen something.

A P o l i c e m a n and P o l i c e w o m a n    then climbed onto             a dividing wall           at the

end of the South               S tand and. edged their way              up     to the    o b s e r v a t i o n bo;-;

and    ranged        on the w i n d o w and       shouted       to the    officers       inside.        POL DC

MADDOX      arm myself         talked about           this and     the    fact that       the    radios may

not    have     been working          in that         part of the       ground.

The    two teams        then    earne out        for a warm out          period on the          pitch.         The

c e n t r e sect!o n was        getting more            and more    crowded and          I commented           on >

this    to POL DC MADDOX and we were                      continually          looking    into     that area

trying      to see      the other        four members           of our    party,,

The    players        left the       pitch at aoout 2.45            pm    (1441;}) .

                         had not mana g e d to get                   in.     I then saw K a r e n LOCKETT                         making    her way

                         from the fence                  of the    centre        section,        a gain         towards          the South Stand.

                         Her arm was              bandaged and           it appea r e d         she       had    received some             form of

                         I think          several        minutes      before       the match              started,          there was a rush of

           the amount              of    people wish i n g          to see      the      game.       Although         it was           the

           same       game as           last year,          no account        appears         to have       oeen made             to     La

           account           of    the    success       both       teams     have      had    this      season,           The     people

           on the          terrac ing were             unable       to move         forw a r d    because       of the          f/fncing,,

           It appears              the Police          at    the    fencing         were     unaware      of w q a t y w a s

           happening,               When there was               a rush of          people       onto    tne    terraces           there

           appeared           to be no-one             controlling            the    e n trances        that    l could see.

           There was              no one     trying         to   prevent       fans      climbing        over       from    the        side

           s ections              into the     centre        sect i o n      before      the game        started,           The

               fences       between 'the side          section and the          centre    section     prevented     fans

               moving       to the      sides as    the    crowds      built    up,,   When a large       number    of

               injured and dead fans w s r y o n               tne     pitch    there was     very    little   first

               amb u l a n c e a p p eared    on the      pitch where        it was    needed m o s t .

               I believe         from    photographs       seen    in tne      press   that   the young      girl   I

       The Chief Constable
       South Yorkshire Police
       Snig Hill
       Sheffield SI


       18th April 1989



       Dear Sir,

                        RE:      HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND DISASTER:

       I feel I must write and express my concern regarding certain matters
       relating to the above incident. As an Emergency organisation, albeit
       voluntary, with a uniformed and disciplined membership trained and equipped
       in Communications, First Aid and specialised ground rescue, I find it
       inconceivable that our services were not requested.

       Ironically, some of our First Aid staff were on duty only a short distance
       away at the Sheffield Ski Village and heard the request for doctors to
       attend the incident via Radio Sheffield. Also at this location for a
       standard training session was our mobile Communications Control unit. All
       staff at that location came to immediate readiness at 15:20hrs and awaited
       further instructions. Other staff around the city made radio contact to our
       main control. In short, some 15 trained personnel could have attended the
       incident with stretchers and much   needed equipment by 15:30hrs. Others
       would have followed by 5 to 10 minutes depending on any traffic problems.

       I feel I must also mention that we have been made aware of other
       organisations which were not requested but took it upon themselves to
       attend the incident in any event. We too felt this way inclined but
       disciplined ourselves to receive instructions via the Emergency Disaster
       Plan. In fact, no such call was received and it was inqsossible to contact
       the Incident Room at Snig Hill by telephone.

       I am sure you will understand our   frustrations and                                          to be blunt, angerand
       also the need for some answers as to why a trained                                            and well equipped
       organisation was not called upon to help.


       Yours faithfully,




       Director.

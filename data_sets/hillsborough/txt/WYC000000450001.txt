Dear Jim,
Thank you very much for your kind letter of 9th November. I
think some of the papers may have overstated what the judge said
but even if the reference of impeccable referred to only a part
of the summing up it was nice to hear that said.
I agree that it would be good if we could meet again fairly soon.
Can you perhaps let me know when it would be convenient for you
and we will see if we cannot arrange something in the near
future.


Yours sincerely,
Dr. S. L. Popper,                                                   My ref: JAT/AP/11K

Dear

I think the outcome of the Appeal last Friday was well anticipated but I wanted to say how
pleased I was that the High Court gave you the credit to which you are due by stating that
your handling of the inquest and your summing up was "impeccable". Those who know best
always knew that it was, but it is nice to have it confirmed to the public at large.

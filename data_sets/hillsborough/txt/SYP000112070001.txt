M y seri a l s yere            in position shortly            before    ll.OOarfi th^.t day.

A lt h o u g h not m an y fans were              building      up    in these areas at this             time,

g athering m a i n l y a r o u nd the            chip shops arid s a ndwich s h o p s .w h ic h were

open    in the area.               E ven at this      time     .1 saw fans      drinking, from booties

w hi c h a p p e ar e d to be of beer or              cider and many were              seen to be

drinking       from and          carrying     cans    of bear and lager..              During    the     course

of the day          I was a sk ed by several              ^ng^yj^c^^ns            'to nearby      public.,

housjgs 'whi Ch were             open and     in particular The F ox Public House,

Poxhill      Road,        w hich    received       p ublicity       last year     in relation to the

amount      of alcohol           consumed     by the      fans.

One    incident          springs     to mind regardiri The Bee Hive Public House,

Dykes     Hall      Read.        I recall.; one. .message being             passed early        in the day-

relating       to    fans       congregating         outside        these   licensed    premises

demanding access                w hich was refused by the              licensee    as   I believe         he

was    closed for          the day.       However,        a short      time    later    I was a pp ro a ch e d

by 4 youths          from       Liverpool who a sked d irections to The Bee Hive

Public House.              X    told them not       to bother as he was            closed but         I 'was

told they were             friends     of the       licensee and were           e xp ec te d there       by him.

The build up of fans                 in the L e pp in gs       Lane    area obv io us ly      increased as

the kick       off       time a p pr o a c h e d and numerous          persons were       seen    in

poss e s s i o n    of alcohol        mainly       cans   of beer and         lager«     R eq ue st s    for

d i rections        to    public, houses         continued during           the afternoon,

f recaLJf^that at the                pre-match briefing we were                 told that       the     train

that    day.        H o w e v e r , it did    in fact arrive about              1Q m in ut es    early

of alcohol           the banter          be tween myself and the fans was                          f ri en dly and

goojr h um ou re d an d           I saw none                 the: obvious         signs     of .'drunkenness*.

were    still        fans watt in g and' running *al o'ng;'Leppi.ngs Lane                              to the

  revious year w hen the                     same     two teams        played at H i l l s b o r o u g h          I saw

giving      tickets         away      to the fans.              This year          I also       saw numerous               fans

ask i n g   Other      fans       if they had any spare                     tickets.        On each o cc asion

the .answer was             no.                                   -

As t h e    kick      off    approached              I was     not    near    Che    Leppings        Lane

          lying          by the      railings                    g uarding      the    river and          protected      from    public

          vi ew         by a line            of    police              officers.

          A l t h ou g h a m bu l an c es                  were wanting           to get          into the area        behind     the West

          S t an d this was                  impossib le as the                   crowds          in that area w ou ld not

          disperse,              Feel in g             among st          several       fans were          running     high and        I was

          ve rb al ly a bu se d on several                               occasions        as were         other    officers w it h in my

          hearing.              B e ca us e        of the feeling                 of the          crowd    in that a re a       I was

          fearful             of a seri ou s                   public     order       s it u at i on arising         th ou gh thank fu ll y

          this, did not              happen.                    During     the    course          of events       I did not handle

          an y         bodies.

          So me ti me after 4 . 0 0 p m                          the    crowds    began to           leave    the ground m an y            in a

IAN SELWOOD INSPECTOR. WOODSEATS POLICE STATION« SHEFFIELD* »B» GROUP.


At 8.^5am on Saturday, 15th. April, 1989, I commenced duty at Woodseats Police Station,
Sheffield, from where myself and other officers were taken by a hired PSV to the Sheffield
Wednesday, Football Stadium for a 10.0am briefing.
I was in charge of k serials, 26 to 29 inclusive, these comprising of 4 sergeants and 32
constables, all from A1 Sub-Division, none of whem were known to me either by name or sight.
We were responsible to Superintendent Marshall who was in charge of the Liverpool end of
the ground. The duties of my serials were as follows:
Patrolling Parkside Road and Catchbar Lane;
manning barriers placed across the mouths of:
Penistone Road North/Vere Road;
Penistone Road North/Fielding Road;
Leppings Lane/Vere Road;
Leppings Lane/Fiedling Road;
Penistone Road North/Bickerton Road;
Leppings Lane/Bickerton Road;
Leppings Lane/Leake Road;
Leppings Lane/Farndale Road;
Leppings Lane/Shenstone Road;
Leppings Lane/Eskdale Road.
My serials were in position shortly before 11.0am that day.
Although not many fains were building upin these areas at thistime,   gatheringmainly around
the chip shops and sandwich shops which were open in the area.   Even at this time I saw fans
drinking from bottles which appeared tobe of beer or eider and many were seen to be drinking
from and carrying can# of beer and lager. During the course of the day I was asked by several
fans directions to nearby public houses which were open and in particular the Fox P.H.
Foxhill Road, which received publicity last year in relation to the amouht of alcohol
consumed by the fans.
One incident springs to mind regarding the Bee Hive P.H. Dykes Hall Road. I recall one
 message' being passed early in the day relating to fans congregating ouside these licensed
premises demandinf access which was refused by the licensee as I believe he was closed for
the day. However, a short time later I was approached by 4 youths from Liverpool who asked
directions to the Bee Hive P.H. I told them not to bother as he was closed but I was told
they were friends of the licensee and were expected there by him.
The build UP °f fans in the Leppings Lanearea obviously increased as the kick-off time ;
approached and numerous persons were seen in possession of alcohol mainly cams of beer and
lager. Request® for directions to public houses continued during the afternoon,
I recstll that at the pre-match briefing we were told that the train from Liverpool was due
to arrive at Wadsley Bridge Station at 2.02pm that day, However, it did in fact arrive
about 10 minutes early. Leppings Lane then became blocked by the .masses of fans making
their way to the ground amd although many were Brinking and carrying cams of alcohol the
banter between myslef amd the fans was friendly amd good humoured stnd I saw none of the
obvious signs of drunkenness.
Although towards kick-off time the masses thinned considerably there were still fans walking
and running along Leppings Lane to the ground. I believe that at sometime after 2.0pm
am instruction was given, though I do not know by whom, to close Leppings Lane to vehicular
traffic.
During the afternoon I was asked by possibly 7 or 8 fams if I knew the location of amy
ticket touts for them to buy tickets. I was not aware of any in the area. This seem strange
in-so-much as the previous year when the same two teams played at Hillsborough Isaw numerous
ticket touts, who as the kick-off approached were almost giving tickets away to the fams#
This year I also saw numerous fans asking other fams if they had amy spare tickets* On each
occasion the answer was no.
As the kick-off approached I was not gear the leppings        lane turnstiles which weweretold
at the briefing would be opened at 12.00noon*
                                    -   2-                                         £1
Once the fains had cleared in Leppings Lane I began making my way to Claywheels Lane for a
meal, when I was deviated to go the the Leppings Lane turn stiles. This would be shortly
after 3»0pm that day.
On my arrival at that location a short time later, I saw numerous officers in that area but
few fams. I found radio transmissions at that time from ground control almost unreadable
due to the noise being made by the spectators. In addition to this, constables were not
issBsd with radios and had to rely on supervisory officers to pass on messages to them.
A short time after this I was told to go to to the rear of the West stamd. I do not re-call
whether this instruction came from ground control or amother officer in Leppings Lane.
On my arrivstl in the area behind the West stand I saw numerous persons in the area generally
milling about. I saw some were distressed, gasping for breath, others either sitting or lying
on the floor injured amd until I heard of a fatality the serioasness of the situation did
not become apparant to me.
I saw officers assisting with casualties amd giving mouth-to-mouth resusitation to persons
on the floor. I asisted other officers with the removal of the injured to outside the
ground amd into the area behind the West stand which joins Leppings Lane amd Penistone Road
North. Myslef and other officers gave comfort amd what other assistamce we could until
a fleet of ambulances began arriving at the scene. I recall doctors, nurses and first aiders
arriving in the area to assist. I hejjped with the placing of the injured into the ambulances.
During the course of events I saw about 10 dead bodies lying by the railings guarding the
river amd protected from public view by a line of police officers.
Although ambulamces were wanting to get into the area behind the West stamd this was
impossible as the growds in that area would not disperse. Feeling amorjpt several fams were
running high and I was verbally abused on serval occasions as were other officers within my
hearing. Because of the feeling of the crowd in that area I was fearful of a seriuos public
order situation arising though thankfully this did not happen. During the course of events
I did not handle amy bodies.
Sometime   after ^.Opm the crowds begam to leave the ground many in a sombre mood, many
verbally   abusing the police. Once they had cleared I went onto the terrace at the
Leppings   Lane end of the ground amd assisted in the reaoval of a small number of spectators
who were   still remaining. This was to facilitate the talking of photographs of the area.
I have policed two other semi-finals in recent years. In 1988, when the same two teams took
part. On this occasion I spent much of my time before the kick-off in the area of the
Leppings Lane turn stiles. I do not recall any serious public order situation on this
occasion; at lthat^locatioa. I re-call several ticket touts being in the area who were almost
giving tickets away as the kick-off approached. Myself and other officers were also handed
tickets by fans to pass on to others wishing access to the game.
In 1 9 8 7 , I wa* on duty at the semi-final between Leeds and Coventry. I was policing the
area behind the South stamd between Leppings Lane amd Penistone Road North. Again, on this
occasion I do not recall amy problems.

            On arrival          at the       g r o u n d we wer e         briefed         in the N o r t h Stand,               after

            briefing         we m ade       our w a y       to L e p p i n g s     Lane,      w here      our     se r i a l   was     to

            perform         crowd     control         duty.        I was        s i t u a t e d at   the      junction         of

            Leppings         Lane a n d E s k d a l e Road,             where         b a r riers     had     been     placeu        to

            prevent         parking        by f o o tball         fans,     this       duty    c o m m e n c e d at      1 0.45 a.m.

            From      the     start    of    our d u t y         the   fans      began arriving               in a s t e a d y       steam,

             I w as    working with Police Constables                              P u n t o n and S e v e r n ,       as      I have

            stated         there was        a s t e a d y s t r e a m of fans w h i c h g r e w as                    time     went       on

            all      the    fans a p p e a r e d      to    be    in g o o d humour,           as     time      went     by     it became

            evident         that    pe o p l e who         had    passed        on their way              to the      g r o u n d were

            again      passing        us    in the         opposite       d i r e c t i o n as       though       t h e y w ere

             looking        for s o m e t h i n g .        Later       in the      day some          of    t hese     fans      were

            asking         others m a k i n g      their w ay          to the         ground     if they h a d an y              spare

             tickets.         I saw several             tick e t s      changing         hands       in the       street        in front

of me,       one      I saw a n d            heard          being    sold for           twenty         five    pounds.

During       my d u t y        I was         app^Q^tfrv^db tfy                                     asking        for    the

location         of      the    following               two       pubs,     ’The S p o r t s m a n ’ a n d           ’The    Beehive’

As    time w e n t        by    I remember                  saying    to P o l i c e      Constable            Punton           that       if

the    stadium's            capacity             was 5 4 , 0 0 0      there were               mor e    fans     than       that       from

Liverpool          alone.

As    kick off        time       drew         nearer         it became          evident          that     large numb e r s             of

fans     w ere w a l k i n g           past        d r i n k i n g cans a n d       bott l e s     of         beer, the y were

also     carrying           four        packs          of    beer.

At    2.56     p.m.       a g r o u p of           fans       came    runn i n g        up the         road    as     they       got

At 3     p.m.       (kick       off         time)       there       w ere    still       fans      walking           past       our

point     in the          direction               of    the       ground.      By      this     time     I could        see       that a

large      crowd         had    g a t h e r e d at           the L e p p i n g s       L ane    end of        the     ground.          I

could     see       several            mounted          officers          in the        crowd.         I also        saw a       person

in w h a t     appeared           to        be a P o l i c e        uniform         standing           on the        to p of a wall

near     the       entrance            to    the       ground,       this       person appeared                 to    be help i n g

people       onto        the    top         of    the wall,          but     I didn't           k n o w why.          I could also

see    that        the    Police            horses appea red                to be       doing      a    lot     of m o v i n g        about

At    3.10     p.m.       Police            Constable             Coulson,       a member          of our        serial,          came

to P o l i c e      Constable               Pu nto n and myself                 a nd    tol d us        to go w i t h him to

the Le ppings             Lane         end of          the    g r o u n d as     t h e r e was         some     trouble.              As we

a r r i v e d at      the      ground            there w e r e a l r e a d y           people      standing           a r o u n d and

others       leaving           the      ground,             some    of t h e m w e r e         saying,         ’Get     in there

appeared           in a n a g g r e s s i v e           m o o d , others         appeared          numbed and            had blank

faces,       some        were      in tears.                 At    this     time       I was      unaware        of wha t was

happening           inside         the       ground.

I then         moved    thro u g h    a side     gat e     to    the   e n t rance    which       leads    to    the

back      of    the    South   Stand,        there    adjacent         to the       fence    at    the    side    of

the      river    I saw     seve r a l      bodies    with       their      faces    covered       up    there    were

al s o    a large       number       of pe o p l e   sat    a bout     on the       ground.        I c ould      see

that      they    w ere    dazed      and    i n j ured.        From   that    time    on u ntil         the    de­

al s o    assisting       with       the    evacuation          of   fans    from    the    ground.

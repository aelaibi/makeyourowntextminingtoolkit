Mr Tomlinson of the West Midlands Police Authority has been in
touch to arrange a meeting with Lord Ferrers to discuss the costs
of inquiries into the Hillsborough disaster by the West Midlands
Police. We have agreed that Thursday 18 May at 10.30 am would be a
convenient time.

I would be grateful therefore if you would provide written briefing
by close of play on the night before and to be available for oral
briefing at 10.00 am on the 18th.

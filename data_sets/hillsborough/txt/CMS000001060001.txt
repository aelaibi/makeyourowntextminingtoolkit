I enclose part of a letter from S L Popper, HM Coroner who
recently carried out the inquests into the deaths at the
Hillsborough Disaster.   At the conclusion of the inquests he
indicated that there were a number of issues which he intended
to raise with the Home Secretary.       His letter contains 3
schedules, schedule B being concerned with the police's role at
football matches.  Could I have a contribution to our reply as
soon as possible please. Thanks.

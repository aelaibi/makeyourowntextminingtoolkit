 [       I(__   VI    o«ura also          see a number               of fans        c l i mbing    up the       railings         and onto the

                 parapit        wall      leading        to the         turnstiles.            1 can only           imagine       that     they

                 were     trying       to get        into        the    ground w i t h o u t       passing         through       the

                 t urnstiles.             I saw this             hap p e n i n g    on several          occasions        up until

                 about     3 pm at w h i c h          time        there was          still     a large        number       of    fans

                 outs i d e .

                 At    this     time      I went       to                                                      for a short         time',

                 a fter    which       I r e t urned           to my     premises.            I heard         reports      on the

                 television           that    there         were       problems        inside      the ground and a short                     time

                 a fter    this       I saw       people         leaving       the ground.              Several      people       came     to my

                                                                                                                       S760

              house a n d a s k e d      to use       the    telephone,         which      1 let them do.           I do not

              k n o w who     these     people were          but    under     the    circumstances          I let    them use

              my    telephone         if they wished.

              Whilst        I was     outside my       house       I could hear           groups    of youths       shouting

              a b u s e at any Pol i c e O f f i c e r        they     could       see.     Dur i n g all   this abuse all

              Officers        that     I could       see    took    no a c t i o n a g a i n s t   them and    kept    control

              of    themselves.

               I w ou l d     like to say that             in the    twenty        three years       I have    lived at

              this a d d r e s s and the         number       of Semi        Final    matches       I have witnessed,          it

               is the       first     time    that    the    entrance        to L e p p i n g   Rd stand and gate        have

              not     been nearly        clear       by about 2.45           pm.

              O n this       occasion        there    was    still     a a    large       crowd outside at 3 pm.

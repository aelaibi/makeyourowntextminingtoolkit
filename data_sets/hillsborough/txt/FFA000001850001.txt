                           Dear Mr Clark

                           Further to your letter dated 24 February 1989, may I confirm that
                           we would be delighted to be considered for the staging of an F A
                           Cup Semi-Final replay during week commencing 17 April 1989.

                           Due to our home fixture versus Brighton and Hove Albion in the
                           Barclays League, we could not consider staging a semi-final tie on
                           Saturday 15 April 1989.
                           Please find the enclosed plan of the Elland Road Stadium, giving
                           full details of the segregation plans which have been agreed with
                           our local police.

                           May I confirm that pitch perimeter fencing is in position all
                           around the Stadium. Furthermore insurance cover is available for
                           the staging of this type of event.

                           I would also confirm that all 23 Executive Boxes in the South Stand
                           and the 100 places in our Centre-Line facility, are taken for
                           the current season and, therefore, an amount equivalent to 284 times
                           the price of the best seats would be credited to the match account.

                           I trust you will find the foregoing information to be of interest
                           but should you require further information, please do not hesitate
                           to contact me.

                           Yours sincerely

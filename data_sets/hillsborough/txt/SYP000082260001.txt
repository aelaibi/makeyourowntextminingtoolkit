my s e l f and    Inspector ROES 1NISON visij^ero trie L a n d l o r d                        in the Lounge Bar

had     retained the           servicesof            “a big        lad" as       doorman.           He also         said

I...iver&oo I s u p poj^X e r s .       At    this       time      there were a few               locals      drinking

in the       pub ^ n d    about      two     "families"            of Liv e r p o o l       supporters        wit h

y oung    children.            These    supp o r t e r s were          q u i e t l y minding         their      own

business.         The mana g e r was a d v i s e d               that we w o u l d be           patrolling           the

are a and      calling         by r e gularly and that we should                             be contacted            in the

event     of any     need for assistance.



We    then    resumed      patrol,         checking            v i s ually    other      pubs     in the area.

Host were        either        quiet   or     closed.            However,        during       this     time m any

supporters        began to flood              into       the side        streets         in this a rea an d             park

their     private        cars an d vans.



At    11„30 h r s we a g a i n         checked         the Fox        public       house.         It was      starting

to fill       up wit h     crowds      of LFS          cans standing             outside        drinking        in the

sunshine.         The     surrounding            streets         in Foxhill         and      up towards G r e n o s i d

that     it made m a n e u v e r i n g       of our           shortwheel        base     transit       van very

difficult.         We then o b s e r v e d          that        traffic       flowing        freely down Hali f a x

and     hire minibuses.              These       vehicles were               turning        off into     the Foxhill

At    ~12. 10 w e a gain        during       our    patrols         checked the             Fox pub.        The      car

    in peoples          front   gardens.         At    the    scene we       liaised wit h PCs              stationed

    at the      bottom of the          road who        stated that 5-6 Liverpool                     fans    had

    passed them being abus i v e                and throwing          down beer        cans.         Some    of this

    team were        o b s erved to go up Wilcox Rd and                    urinate       in gardens.            We      saw

    this     group of youths w a l k i n g            up that    road and         stopped and          spoke       to

    them.      All      had been d r i nking           heavily and were             in a very b o isterous

    mood.      They were a d v i s e d and            pointed    in the       d i r e c t i o n of    the    ground.

    We    f o l l o w e d them down     the     hill    and    near the bo t t o m they all                 boar d e d a

    alcohol       purchased from'The             Fox.        I would estimate            the    number       in the

    car    park and walls         alone       to be     in the       region     of about 300           to 400.

    W ith a further 200           standing           on the    pavement and          pull      in on

    the    opposite        pavement.          There was        in there       number a large            drunken,

than apparent              by the        noise and          complaints            coming            from the            cells when

they were            detained)           then they were going                     to attempt                 to gain entry by

some means.               This    is a g a i n       corroborated            by the             fact       that       they had

turned up on spec with o u t m o n e y but w i t h                               the knowledge                   that       people         had

    t h e r e 11.     I released the y o u t h           to the    custody of friends and                returned

    to the mai n gates.



    I. had no         personal      radio    so    I was     unaware      of the     ci r turnstanc.es of the

    incident          however    I assumed         there     had been some         sort    of    crush,       perhaps

    a wall          collapse.       A mass    of    people were          pouring     out of the gates at

    L a p p i n g s Ln.      Most    of    them did not know what                had h a p p e n e d either         and

    s eemed m o s t l y      c o ncerned wit h the fact             that    they had not           gained entry

    or wis h e d       to know      if the m a t c h was abandoned.



However,             quite a few of their                number    informed me          that    some    s upporters

    had been          crushed because         of a mass i v e       surge    or that a gate             had been

    opened      by the       police       or stewards.           I was    on my own now so             I tried to

move        fans      out    of the       path of oncoming          emergency        vehicles;         the    progress

    of w h i c h     they were      hampering.            I sensed that          something       very

di s a s t e r o u s       had h a p pened    from the mood and tears                   of fans.        I c o ntinued

    to try to           clear    the      roadway but        the m ood of some fans            was   very

aggressive              fuelled by the            fact    that    they were heav jj'y under              the

    i nfluence        of    intoxicants.           1 was    jostled and a b u V e d by these                 drunken

    fans and whilst             attempting         to move a large          c o n g r e g a t i o n from the        path

    of a fire         engine,       I was    punched on the             r ighy shoulder         by an u n k n o w n

a s s a i l a n t and jeered and             insulted by the             / e st of   the group.              Some

still         had       beer     cans     in their       hands.     /



The       s i t u a t i o n had become        potentially          very violent          with all       the

    v iolence        and abuse a p p a r e n t l y       direc t e d at    the    police.        I was       still       in

the dark about                the    incident       or    requi renients as        I was       on my own with o u t

a personal              radio.      After     the task        of keeping         fans    off the       road became

fruitless             and dan g e r o u s    to my       personal       safety,    I looked further             down

Le p p i n g s Ln and saw my serial                          in their    transit       van.    PS 2 g Q Z > 6 H A W      saw

me and got me back                     into      the van.        Crowds    of LFC       fans    i^rsd      and         rocked,

the       van as they              passed.        Several       police m o t o r c y t y ^ s     parked across

from us became                   very vulne r a b l e        to attack     by fans and after             a few          close

calls           had to move          on.        The   fans     shouted    " M u r d e r e r s ” to us and other

o f f i cers as               they w a I k e d    by„



The Sgt             in the       van had a personal              radio    but    the    reception and

c o m m u n i c a t i o n was        very bad.           Inspector R O B I N S O N got out of the                van to

go to Police Control                       to find out what a s s i s t a n c e          we    could   render           or   if

our vehicle                  could be of any use.                We heard       over a domestic          pocket

Inspector/ ROBINSON                     returned and stated               that    our    van was^fieeded as an.

arnbu la/fce and that we were                         needed to assist at              the ^rdrtuary area,

stua/led in the gym.                       We    left    the    driver    with           van and walk :ed
      /                                                                          s'

I was           d e t a i l e d by the        Inspector        to go to the       gym to ask        if any more

numbers were                  needed    inside.          Luckily a Sergeant             on the    door    stated

that        there was            enough       help but a s k e d that we          keep fans       looking        for

lost        family/friends              as well         as   s ightseers    away.        Our   serJ^St-l along           with

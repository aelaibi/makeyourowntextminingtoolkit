                At the time of the d is as te r                   I was a mem be r             of the      "D" I           on Crime       &

                them onto buses              to tr an sp or t       them to the           ground.

               At     1.45pm      (1345)       the S qu ad       resumed      patrol       ar ou nd        the city -- paying

               were      the worse         for    drink.         These    fans were            loaded on to buses and

                t aken to the gr ou nd a nd were                    supervised           by officers         from the       squad who

At 3 . 0 5 p m      (1505)       the C& V a t t e n d e d       outside        the H i l l s b o r o u g h ground to

pick     up the o ff icers             from the          unit who        had been e scorting               fans.     I

parked the units                 crew bus        on P e n i s t o n e    R o a d , outside      the       entrance       to

the    g y m n a s i u m w h i l s t w a it in g        for    these     officers.

It was at this              time     I saw a great man y                 officers       running       into the

gro un d and my first a s s u m p t i o n was                     that    there was       fighting          in the

g ro u n d . O n    the    i n s t ru ct io ns    of the        u n i t ’s Inspector we          left       the vehicle

and went           into    the    ground w h er e we were                told to wait          near       to the Gym.

At this       time        rumours were           passing a r o u n d       that      several     fans       had been

i njured a nd         perhaps        one    had died.             These    figures       increased to          13 dead

before       the unit was            o r d er ed onto the            pitch to form a cordon                  in front

of the N o rt h Stand,               supposedly           to    prevent more          fans     invading       the

pitch.It was wh il st                s ta nding at this              point      I saw the       com mo ti on at          the

front      of the L e p p i n g s Lane            stand.          Fans were          carrying    the bodies          of

o b v i o u s l y dead      people        from the        pitch to the Gym.               I was       d is mayed     that

we s ho u ld be s ta nd in g              doing     nothing whilst memb er s                 of the        public

t ended to the             dead and        injured.

A ft er a short            time     the    unit was           r et urned to the         gym,    to    ’stand-by".

It was at           this    point      I joined          in and a s s i s t e d      the fans        to    carry the

dead     into the gym,              where       they were         laid out.

There      s eemed to be a never                  ending        flow     of bodies       coming       from the

pitch.         I helped other              to    carry about            4 or 5 bodies          into the gym until

I saw several              fans     s tr ug g l i n g    to carry        the    body of a large man.

I first       saw this ma n            being      carried         in the are a outside               the gym and

went     to their aid.               I could find no               pulse       on the man and             judged    from

his    colouring           that     he was a l r e a d y        dead.      I accompanied             the    body    into

the gym and there                 st ay ed w it h        it.      The    body was a ss i g n e d number             49.
                                                                                 3

              The    body was    c e r t if ie d as dead by Dr.      B UL L at 4- QQ pm   (1600).

              I s tayed w i t h the     body of Hr T H O M P S O N   in the   gyrnnasiurn until 4 .30am

to    pick up the            o ff icers    from the        unit who had been e s c o rt in g              fans.        I

pa rk ed the u nits             crew bus on P e n i s t o n e Road,          outside       the entrance           to

the g y m n a s i u m w hi l s t w a it in g        for    these    officers.

It was at this               time    I saw a great m any o ff icers               running       into the

g r ou n d a nd my first a s s u m p t i o n was             that     there was fighting              in the

g round.

On the       i ns t ru ct io ns      of the u n i t ’s Inspector we             left the vehicle and

w ent    into the g r ou n d w he re we were                  told to wait jne^ar to the Gym.                     At

this     time        rumours w ere        passing a r o u n d      thaj^lfeveral       fans had been

i njured a nd          perhaps       one had died.           T h^se    figures      increased to           13 dead

b ef or e the unit was               orde re d onto Jtme pitch to form a cordon                        in f r o n t

of the N o r t h Stand,              supposedly/to          prevent more        fans     invading         the    pitch,

It was w hi l st            s ta nding at ttxi s point             I saw the    commotion at           the front

of the L e p p i n g s Lane            stand.       Fans were        carrying     tfse bodies        of

o b v i o u s l y d ead      people     from the      pitch to the G^ffi.            I was      d is ma ye d that

we    s ho ul d be standi ng do i ng nothing w h i I s ^ / m e m b e r s               of the        public

t en d e d to the dead and                injured.

A ft er a short             time    the unit was          r et ur ne d to the gym,         to   ’stand-by.

It was at this               point     I joined      in/and a s s i s t e d the      fans to         carry the

dead     into the           gym w here     they y e r e     laid out.        There se em ed to be a

never      ending          flow of bodies        coming       from the      pitch.       I helped others               to

carry a bout 4 or 5 bodies                    into the gym until             I saw several           fans

s tr u g g l i n g    to    carry the      body of a        large man.

I first       saw this man being                carried       in the area out side              the gym and

w ent    to their aid.               I could find no           pulse on the man and judged from

his     c olouring         that he was a l r e a d y        dead.      I a c c o m p a n i e d the   body       into

the gym a nd there                 st ay ed wit h    it.     The    bodyyrfas a s s i g n e d number            49.

He was       i d en t i f i e d to me by a Mr.             J o s e p h JPflOMFSQN - brother          of the

          HILLSBOROUGH: Q & A BRIEFING FROM THE ATTORNEY
          GENERAL’S OFFICE: LETTER FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY
          SUPPORT GROUP

          Further to Paul Pugh’s submission of 26 June covering the draft announcement and Q
          & A briefing, I attach the Q & A material from the Attorney General’s office received
          today.


          2.     I also attach a copy of a letter from the Hillsborough Family Support Group
          covering a summary o f the matters which the families feel ought to be considered in
          any new inquiry, which I undertook to bring to your attention. The reference to an
          inquiry is speculation on their part as we have not given them any details of what will
          be contained in the announcement on Monday.

          3.     There is nothing new in the concerns set out in the attached summary from the
          families. Although they will be disappointed that you are not, at this stage,
          establishing a new public enquiry, they should at least be reassured that there will be
          an independent scrutiny by a senior judicial figure.


                                                                                        —
                                                                  PETER EDMUNDSON

  HILLSBOROUGH: INQUEST - (ATTORNEY GENERAL INTEREST/ROLE)

 Line to taka

 It is not open to the Attorney General to order a fresh inquest. By statute his consent
 is pre-requisite to an application to the High Court for an order directing a fresh
 mquest. He has considered several applications relating to the Hillsborough inquest in
 accordance with the relevant legal criteria. In no case did he consider that an
 application to the High Court would be likely to succeed.




 Q.      W hat is the criteria by which the Attorney General considers applications
         under Section 13 Coroners Act 1988.


 A.     The criteria remains that set out by the then Attorney General in a Written
        Answer on 2 May 1989 (Col 39): ie whether an application to the High Court
        would have a reasonable prospect o f establishing that it is necessary or
        desirable in the interests of justice for a fresh inquest to be held.


 Q.     W hat does the Attorney General take into account in considering w hether
        the criteria is met.


A.      He considers the factors set out in Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 (eg
        whether there was irregularity or insufficiency of inquiry) in the context o f the
        statutory purposes of an inquest to which I have referred.


Q.     Did the Attorney General not understand the need for a wide-ranging
       inquiry.

A.     An inquest serves very specific purposes. Many of the concerns of the
       relatives o f the deceased were not matters for an inquest.


Q.     W as not the inquest was full of irregularities?

A.     The main planks of the applications under Section 13 of the Coroners Act
       1988 were the ‘mini inquest’ procedure adopted by the coroner and his
       decision not to leave ‘lack of care’ to the jury as a possible verdict. Both
       issues were in fact considered by the Divisional Court (in unsuccessful judicial
       review proceedings) and rejected.


F:\OPPU\COMPLNTS\SHORTSUB\PEOO21MA.DOC
 Q.     There was also fresh evidence in some cases.

 A.     I understand that the then Attorney General took the view that it did not affect
        the issues for consideration by the inquest.


 Q.     Has the refusal of the Section 13 applications been considered since the
        ITV documentary?

 A.     I understand that no further formal application under the Coroners Act has
         been made to the Attorney General (before or after election) since the
         documentary. The previous Attorney General explained in correspondence to
         some Hon Members that the ITV documentary did not o f itself constitute
         evidence. He promised to consider any fresh evidence placed before him as
         the result of the research undertaken. No such material was supplied to him

        The material supplied to the Home Office by the Hillsborough Family Support
        Group was made available to the then Attorney General in March but he
        concluded that nothing in it had any bearing on the issues raised in the
        applications which had previously been made and considered. Nothing has
        occurred to alter or cast doubt upon the validity o f that decision.

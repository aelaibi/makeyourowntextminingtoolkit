                  Mr Moynihan has asked me to thank you for your letter of 16
                  April in which you make a number of suggestions concerning safety
                  at football grounds.

                  Responsibility within Government for safety at sports grounds
                  lies with the Home Office and I have passed a copy of your letter
                  to officials there.   They have explained that since the points
                  you raise will fall to be considered by Lord Justice Taylor's
                  Inquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy it would be inappropriate
                  for any comment to be made on the views you have expressed at
                  this stage.    Your letter has however been forwarded to Lord
                  Justice Taylor so that he may take your view into account during
                  his Inquiry.

                  With regard to the future of football in this country, the Home
                  Secretary said to the House of Commons on 17 April that the
                  Government believes that this lies in the application of a national
                  membership scheme for supporters at designated grounds and also
                  in the provision of all-seated accommodation at major stadia.
                  The Football Spectators Bill which is before Parliament establishes
                  the framework for the membership scheme and may provide an oppor­
                  tunity to enact legislation rapidly on all-seater stadia.

                  Mr Moynihan has noted your intention to arrange a Football Seminar
                  for October 5.     The Minister will be on holiday at that time
                  but has asked me to pass on his hope that the seminar goes well.

SHEFFIELD SEMI PINAL TRAGEDY


I write in my capacity as a a safety consultant for a number of
football grounds, as the former stadium manager of the other semi final
ground (Aston Villa) and as the sports and leisure consultant of Ove
Arup & Partners. In sharing the deep shock and grief concerning
yesterday's tragedy,k I feel that there are positive steps that could be
considered to limit the chance of such an event ever occurring again. T
thus set out below a few short observations that may be of assistance
to you. I am aware of course that Football has a bad record for solving
its own problems and that The Government has had to get involved as a
result. As someone who was involved in the game for some 6 years, I
share what I perceive is your determination to tackle the problems head
on eg Identity Cards.

The Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975

I have acted for some 14 Clubs concerning safety of stadia and Ove Arup
have a long track record in the design of new facilities. One thing is
continually apparent during my visits to grounds and that is the
variance between the standards adopted by the Local Authorities.

Whilst the Green Guide is used as the rule book, the interpretive
nature of many clauses allows for differing standards to be applied. A
Local Athority with many designated clubs in its area may be well
organised, whilst the Authority with only one or two clubs to handle
might set its own standards without outside consultation.

I have seen exit doors and barrier situations that are seemingly
acceptable that quite rightly are not allowed at most other grounds.'
                SHOULD NOT THE INSPECTION OF GROUNDS BE CARRIED OUT
                BY A CENTRAL INSPECTORATE.

Barriers

The Code suggests that a flat 4” deep steel barrier rail is ideal
whilst allowing a continuance of the old 2" circular tube barriers if
they reach the strength requirement. The Sheffield type barriers were
acceptable on the face of it, yet their geometry appeared to contribute
to the injuries yesterday. In addition the testing procedure, which is
well defined in the safety green guide, is not to my certain knowledge

witnessed thoroughly by all Authorities, and is often looked upon as a
chore by many clubs.

                SHOULD NOT THE GUIDE BE AMENDED TO OUTLAW THE SMALL
                CIRCULAR BARRIER RAILS. ALSO SHOULD A CENTRAL
                INSPECTORATE WITNESS TESTS.


Pitch Perimeter Fences
                       l
                       i
There appears to be little doubt that the front fence contributed to
the tragedy yesterday. The Sheffield ground had less front gates than
many other grounds, although I know of approved grounds with no gates
whatsoever.

I am a believer in less fences rather than more, but if we have to have
them then let us design them to allow for easy opening in the event of
an emergency. I know from some research at Ove Arup that it is possible
to design front fences that can withstand the pressure yet can be
opened quickly from the pitch side in an emergency. Surely there is
merit in refining this design.

Again I draw attention to the differing standards applied at clubs to
the opening gates situation and I hope for some universal standard.

                SHOULD NOT FENCES HAVE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF OPENINGS
                OR IDEALLY SHOULD NOT ALL FRONT FENCES BE REMOVED.

The Way Ahead for Football

I firmly believe that the way ahead is for Clubs to improve their out
of date stadia, and to thus attract a family audience for the first
time. Football has never been a family game and it would do well to
become one.

After England had won the 1966 World Cup attendances rocketed for a
while, then fell back sharply. I believe that it was families, and
mainly women, who had been force fed a daily diet of successful
football on TV and who had been tempted to try the live variety of
football, that formed the core of this attendance rise. The truth is
that these brave souls turned up and were appalled at the conditions
that they were expected to endure in dirty out of date uncomfortable
stadia, and they thus went away never to return.

If only Football would get the message learned throughoutthe USA that
the customer matters, and provide proper facilities and front of house
service. The first person one meets at a football match is a Turnstile
Operator, who is probably there for a free ticket, and who is little
concerned in reality with either service or safety.
                  SHOULD NOT FOOTBALL BE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE DOWN THEIR
                  FRONT FENCES, PUT IN MORE SAFER SEATS AND TO IMPROVE
                  THE STADIA FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF SUPPORTERS. LET
                  US START A NEW FEELING OF CONSTRUCTIVE THINKING SO
                  THAT THE COUNTRY CAN GET THE MESSAGE THAT SOME GOOD
                  THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN FOOTBALL AT LAST.


In summary I believe that a universal applied standard is called for
with regard to safety and that football should be encouraged to improve
their grounds rather than to erect yet more fences. Perhaps the
Football Trust and FGIT could direct their funds in this direction.
I know from many dealings with' Lord Aberdare that he and his excellent
trustees emit this caring attitude to the development of brighter safer
stadia.

Finally, If Ove Arup can assist in any way possible, please do not
hesitate to contact me. Arups are the largest UK firm of consulting
engineers with some 4000 staff and apart from our world wide operation,
we have some 14 UK offices. If you require expert opinion at the
highest level from our structural experts, or if you feel that our
knowledge gained can be of service then we would be delighted to
respond. I am unsure whether Norman Palmer is still your Head of Sport
and Recreation, or whether Brian Burnett is still in your department
but both know me from my work in the early 1980's. I also attach some
copy correspondence to illustrate my continuing interest in helping
wherever possible.

As one final thought, Ove Arup are committed to organising a Football
Seminar, entitled "Football beyond 2000" on October 5 1989. In view of
the events of yesterday, Ove Arup would be happy to offer you, or The
Home Secretary, and indeed the Football Governing Bodies the platform
to discuss the future of football. Ove Arup & Partners are strongly
committed to helping in any way possible.

Once again if we can be of any help, even as part of the independent
Inquiro) into this tragic event, then please contact me and I will put
you i/n /touch with the appropriate Board Member.



Yowrs sincerely

            Mr Moynihan has asked me to thank you for your letter of
  16 April       in which you make a number of suggestions concerning
  safety at football grounds.


            Responsibility       within   Government         for   safety        at    sports
  grounds lies &Z2&CMcr&r with the Home Office and I have passed a
  copy of your letter to officials there.                   They have explained that
  since     the   points   you    raise     will     fall     to   be     considered             by
  Lord Justice Taylor's          Inquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy it
  would be inappropriate for any comment to be made on the views
  you have expressed at this stage.                Your letter has however been
  forwarded to Lord Justice Taylor so that he may take vour view
  into account during his Inquiry.
                                                                     (     (-o          ?-Igvjoajg. e A       rvrw”
            With regard to the future of football in this country, the
  Government      believes   that    this    lies      in    the   application              of    a
  national membership scheme for supporters at designated grounds
          odSo
  and now a.t scorns in the provision of all-seated accommodation at
  major stadia.       The Football Spectators BillUR©w'Jbefore Parliament
  establishes      the   framework    for    the     membership         scheme        and    may
  provide an opportunity to enact legislation rapidly on all-seater
  stadia.


            Mr Moynihan has noted your intention to arrange a Football
  Seminar for October 5.           The Minster will be on holiday at that
  time but has asked me to pass on his hope that the seminar goes
  well.

         London
         SW1P 3EB


         Dear Minister,                                                                                       p**t£E!
         SHEFFIELD SEMI FINAL TRAi


         I write in my capacity as a a safety consultant for a number of
         football grounds, as the former stadium manager of the other semi final
         ground (Aston Villa) and as the sports and leisure consultant of Ove
         Arup & Partners. In sharing the deep shock and grief concerning
         yesterday's tragedy, I feel that there are positive steps that could be
         considered to limit the chance of such an event ever occurring again. I
         thus set out below a few short observations that may be of assistance
         to you. I am aware of course that Football has a bad record for solving
         its own problems and that The Government has had to get involved as a
         result. As someone who was involved in the game for some 6 years, I
         share what I perceive is your determination to tackle the problems head
         on eg Identity Cards.

         The Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975

         I have acted for some 14 Clubs concerning safety of stadia and Ove Arup
         have a long track record in the design of new facilities. One thing is
         continually apparent during my visits to grounds and that is the
         variance between the standards adopted by the Local Authorities.

         Whilst the Green Guide is used as the rule book, the interpretive
         nature of many clauses allows for differing standards to be applied. A
         Local Athority with many designated clubs in its area may be well
         organised, whilst the Authority with only one or two clubs to handle
         might set its own standards without outside consultation.

         I have seen exit doors and barrier situations that are seemingly
         acceptable that quite rightly are not allowed at most other grounds.
                         SHOULD NOT THE INSPECTION OF GROUNDS BE CARRIED OUT
                         BY A CENTRAL INSPECTORATE.

Barriers

The Code suggests that a flat 4" deep steel barrier rail is ideal
whilst allowing a continuance of the old 2" circular tube barriers if
they reach the strength requirement. The Sheffield type barriers were
acceptable on the face of it, yet their geometry appeared to contribute
to the injuries yesterday. In addition the testing procedure, which is
well defined in the safety green guide, is not to my certain knowledge

witnessed thoroughly by all Authorities, and is often looked upon as a
chore by many clubs.

                SHOULD NOT THE GUIDE BE AMENDED TO OUTLAW THE SMALL
                CIRCULAR BARRIER RAILS. ALSO SHOULD A CENTRAL
                INSPECTORATE WITNESS TESTS.


Pitch Perimeter Fences

There appears to be little doubt that the front fence contributed to
the tragedy yesterday. The Sheffield ground had less front gates than
many other grounds, although I know of approved grounds with no gates
whatsoever.

I am a believer in less fences rather than more, but if we have to have
them then let us design them to allow for easy opening in the event of
an emergency. I know from some research at Ove Arup that it is possible
to design front fences that can withstand the pressure yet can be
opened quickly from the pitch side in an emergency. Surely there is
merit in refining this design.

Again I draw attention to the differing standards applied at clubs to
the opening gates situation and I hope for some universal standard.

                SHOULD NOT FENCES HAVE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF OPENINGS
                OR IDEALLY SHOULD NOT ALL FRONT FENCES BE REMOVED.

The Way Ahead for Football

I firmly believe that the way ahead is for Clubs to improve their out
of date stadia, and to thus attract a family audience for the first
time. Football has never been a family game and it would do well to
become one.

After England had won the 1966 World Cup attendances rocketed for a
while, then fell back sharply. I believe that it was families, and
mainly women, who had been force fed a daily diet of successful
football on TV and who had been tempted to try the live variety of
football, that formed the core of this attendance rise. The truth is
that these brave souls turned up and were appalled at the conditions
that they were expected to endure in dirty out of date uncomfortable
stadia, and they thus went away never to return.

If only Football would get the message learned throughoutthe USA that
the customer matters, and provide proper facilities and front of house
service. The first person one meets at a football match is a Turnstile
Operator, who is probably there for a free ticket, and who is little
concerned in reality with either service or safety.
                  SHOULD NOT FOOTBALL BE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE DOWN THEIR
                  FRONT FENCES, PUT IN MORE SAFER SEATS AND TO IMPROVE
                  THE STADIA FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF SUPPORTERS. LET
                  US START A NEW FEELING OF CONSTRUCTIVE THINKING SO
                  THAT THE COUNTRY CAN GET THE MESSAGE THAT SOME GOOD
                  THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN FOOTBALL AT LAST.


In summary I believe that a universal applied standard is called for
with regard to safety and that football should be encouraged to improve
their grounds rather than to erect yet more fences. Perhaps the
Football Trust and FGIT could direct their funds in this direction.
I know from many dealings with Lord Aberdare that he and his excellent
trustees emit this caring attitude to the development of brighter safer
stadia.

Finally, If Ove Arup can assist in any way possible, please do not
hesitate to contact me. Arups are the largest UK firm of consulting
engineers with some 4000 staff and apart from our world wide operation,
we have some 14 UK offices. If you require expert opinion at the
highest level from our structural experts, or if you feel that our
knowledge gained can be of service then we would be delighted to
respond. I am unsure whether Norman Palmer is still your Head of Sport
and Recreation, or whether Brian Burnett is still in your department
but both know me from my work in the early 1980's. I also attach some
copy correspondence to illustrate my continuing interest in helping
wherever possible.

As one final thought, Ove Arup are committed to organising a Football
Seminar, entitled "Football beyond 2000" on October 5 1989. In view of
the events of yesterday, Ove Arup would be happy to offer you, or The
Home Secretary, and indeed the Football Governing Bodies the platform
to discuss the future of football. Ove Arup & Partners are strongly
committed to helping in any way possible.

Once again if we can be of any help, even as part of the independent
Inqui/y^ into this tragic event, then please contact me and I will put
you    /touch with the appropriate Board Member.



      sincerely

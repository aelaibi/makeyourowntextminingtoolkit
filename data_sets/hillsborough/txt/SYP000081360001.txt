              On S a t u r d a y   15 April       19S9,       I went       to the football          m atch at

              Hi 11s b o r o u g h .

              I am a Liverpool              supporter.             I got my ticket          from a friend who                    is a

              s eason ticket            holder at Anfield,               who wasn't        going      to the game.                It wa;

              a £12 ticket             for the West S t a n d .                                                     /

                                                                        in the    car were                                       a^ci h i s

                                                                                        Merseyside.                                      he

              lives     in Formby,         but    I do not know his address.

              We drove          from Liverpool             to Sheffield.          On the      way we stopped at                   Black

              Barnsley,         just     outside Sheffield,                for a drink        and something         to           eat.

              The     traffic was         heavy,          but we were       not delayed.

              We got      to S h ef fi el d at about               14.20 hours          (1420).    We parked        in           a side

              street about a mile                or       less from the ground.
                                                                                                        PAGE        I

On the way to the ground we saw Police Offic er s                               on all    the side       roads,

stopping        people    going       in these       roads to park.            I did not see anyone

d rinking       on the way to the ground or any disorder                          or drunkeness.

We a r r i v e d at the ground at about                  14.4Q hours          (1440).     There were       no

queues    just a mass           of    people.        I saw a P o l ice Officer           closing t h e

outer    gates.      I got through             these gates        by ducking       under       his arm.        At

this    time     I was with                               we had lost the other 2.                 Once

through the        first       gate the       crush was      not as bad,         there were       no queues

just a lot of        people          trying    to get     in.     I looked behind me before                I

went    through the turnstile and                    I saw that      the g_ate was wide           open

again.         I also saw a number of fans c l i m b j j i q over the wall by the
                                        __<r
turnstiles.         There was a Police Offi c e / on top he 1 pi no t hem u p .   I

only saw one Police Officer                    by/the ^ u r n s t i l e s .    He was on a horse and

was    trying     to get       people to fo^ij/queues.               No one was taking any               notice

of him because           the    crowd was too big.

As    I went    through the turnstiles                 I held my hands against                 the wall    to

let a young        lad in.           Then when       I followed him the           people       behind

pushing made me squash the                    lad against        the turnstile.           The    steward

w ou l d not     release       the    turnstile      until      I had given my ticket             in,    even

t ho u g h this    lad was       getting       squashed.         I handed my ticket             in and the

turnstile was        released and the                lad fell     forward and was          picked up by a

Policewoman.         I said to her             that his dad was about 3 people                    behind and

w o u l d be there       in a minute.

I was    talking     to               just    inside    the ground arr an gi ng where              to meet

after    the match,        as we were          going    to different          seats.      As    I was

talk i n g ;         said look at that.                 I looked ar ou nd and            I saw there was

an opening and a mass                 of    people    coming     towards me.        I realised that

if I did not move              quick       1 w ould be caught        up with them,         so    I and

ran up the stairs              to the seating.            I then     left           at the top of the

•>tairs because my seat was at the other                          end of the stand to his.                 I

                                                                                                      S2562
was      in the    part    near the S ou th S t an d and              I was    in the very back          row.

As    I got    to my seat         the m atch had just            started.

I was watching            the m at ch when        I sudde nl y        saw   a youth,     of about     18 or
                                                                                                      o7
19 years,         run o n to the        pitch.     fie ran/dnd got hold of Alan HANSEN^s

ariti.     I was anno y e d at this.              m P o jA ce    Offi c e r    came and grab be d him

and      tried to pull          him off.        I was hoping          he would get off the          pitch

and not       distrupl      the game.           Another Officer             came to help and the youth

sat down.          I then saw other             people app ea ri ng         on the   pitch.       I could

not see       exactly where            they were       coming from.           I first   thought     it was a

pitch      invasion.        The       game was    stopped and the             players went       off and

there were still            people       coming    on to the          pitch.     About 5 or       10 minutes

later      1 saw the a d v e rt is in g         boards    being       taken down and       people were

being given heart massage                     on the    pitch.        I knew that       it was    not a

pitch      invasion,       as    I had origi n al ly thought.                 I heard 2 men saying

they thought         it was worse             than Heysel       and    people were dead.           I was

a n n o y e d at them and         I left and went          to the       toilet.      While    I was

there      I looked out of the wi nd ow and saw 2 Police Officers                                carry

someone       out on an ad v e r t i si ng        hoarding,       he had a jacket          over his head.

The y     put him down on the             road by the       river.          They took the a d ve rt is in g

hoarding and         ran back.           The    person did not move and              I knew he was

dead.       I then went          down and sat down by the turnstile.                       I had a rr an g ed

to meet              there.           I was    shocked and       I was      there for an hour,           I

have     been told.         Some       people who knew me took me back to the                      car.

W hen     I got to the          car              was    there.        It was about       1630— 1640 hours

We sat and         listened to the             radio.     Someone       in the    car next to us had

a car      ’phone and       let us all          ’phone home.           We then left to drive             home

at about       1700 hours.

I think that         the    rush through the gateway                   could have been a

c ontributing        factor       to the deaths or          injuries.

F r o m where      1 was sat          I could see an am bu la nc e            come down Herri es Rd,            it

                                                                                                      S2562
         ‘ then   came      into the       ground and down by the goal.            I also saw Police

           vans   come down the same                road and then a large     number   of Police

           O ff icers      came    into the ground and stood by the North Stand facing                     the

           spectators.

           T hen event u a ll y they were            p ositioned across     the   pitch.   Some,    if not

           all,   of these Officers            could have been used at the West S tand end of

           the ground.

           1' did hear an ann ou nc em en t           saying    the game   had been called off and for

           people     to    leave orderly.           Then there was anot he r ann ou nc em en t a while

           later asking           people    not to go as the e m er ge nc y services were          not able

           to get     through because of the              people   leaving.

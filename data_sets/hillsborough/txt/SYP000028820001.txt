Dear Sir,


     Thank you for your letter dated the 19th April, 1989,

     Your comments regarding spectators behaviour have been noted,
and will be communicated to the appropriate authorities.

     I am sure that the enquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy

you have raised.


                        Yours faithfully.

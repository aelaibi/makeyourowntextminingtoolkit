                 I am     a Police             Constable           in      the      South        Yorkshire            Police,             presently

                 stationed           at    Doncaster              Sub      Division,                On     Saturday,         9th          April,         19SS

                 (090488)           I was       stationed             at     Rotherham              Sub     Division         and          at   8.30am

                 (0830)       that        same      day      together            with       other          Police      officers                I attended

                 Hillsborough              Football             Ground        for        the     FA      Semi       Final    between             Liverpool

                 and    N o 11 i n g h a m      Forest.

                 After       the     briefing           in      the     North         Stand         our     serial         was    engaged            on    the

                 outside        of       the    turnstiles              on    the        West       Stand       Leppings          Lane..            We    were

                 paired       up     outside         each         turnstile              and     searched            the    Liverpool

                 supporters              for    cans       and     sticks           which        could         be    used    as       missiles.

                 A    second        serial        was      inside          the      turnstiles              doing      exactly             the      same

                 search       as     our       serial        in    order         to      double          check       the    supporters.

                 We    took    up        our    positions             at     t he     turnstiles               at    11. OOarn        (1100)         and

                 everything              was    working           well       and      we    took         possession          of       a    large         number

                 of    beer    and        pop     cans       which         were       placed          in   a    large       plastic            bin       liner

                and     later        together           with       the       sticks         and       banners         were       taken         to    the

                 gymnasium           which        was      being        used        as     the      Property          Store,

                At     1 . 3 0 pm    a    number        of      fans       arrived          and       some      were       the    worse          for      drink,

                 one    of    which        was

                               Liverpool.                  He     was      staggering               about       and    had       to       be   spoken        to

                                                                                                                                                           R530

  on    two    occasions                by       myself          and       Police             Constable                1 '144 R e y n o l d s , w h i c h

  resulted          in       the       man       being          arrested             for          'Attempting                   to    Enter          a Ground

 Whilst       Drunk’.                  He    was       taken          to       the       Police             Room       and       on       my    return          to

  the    turnstiles                the       mass          of    supporters                   had       increased                and       it    became

  very    congested                around             the       area       of       Leppings                Lane.            However,            a    third

  serial       was       engaged             on       the       highway             directing                the       supporters                to       the

  relevant          turnstiles.                       There          was       quite          a    considerable                      amount          of

  pushing          as    it       neared          the       start          of       the       game,          however,                no    one       was

  injured          to    my       knowledge.                    The       majority                of    the       supporters                   had    entered

  the    ground          before             the       start          of    the       game.

  At    about       3 . 15pm           (1515)          our       serial             went          to    the       gymnasium                where          we    had

  our    meal.           W h i 1 st         we    were          in    that          position                two       officers             from

  Nottingham             Police             said       there          was       a    disturbance                      on     the      Kop.           As    a

  result       we       attended             the       rear          of    the       Kop          near       to       th e      slipway          leading

  to    the    pitch          area          at    the       side          of    the       North             Stand,           the      only       trouble             we

  could       see       was       pushing             from       the       back          of       the       crowd          as    they          tried       to    get

  a    better       view          of    the       game.              No    one       was          injured             and       there          were       no

  arrests.              We    re t u r n e d          to    t h e g y m n a s i urn u n t i l                    the       ha 1 f t im e w h i s 1 1 e ,

  after       where          we    went          to    the       Leppings                Lane          Stand.              All       the       pens       were

  full    and       as       normal          there          was       quite          a    bit          of    pushing             forward             as    the

  supporters             followed                the       match,          but       everything                   appeared                in    order          and

  good    nature.

  At    4.3Qpm          we    left          the       ground          and       stood             on    Leppings                Lane       on    the       bridge

  on    the    opposite                side       of       the       road.           On       the       final          whistle             the

  supporters             came          out       of    the       ground             and       left          in    a    noisily             and       orderly

  manner       towards             the       Railway             Station             at       Wadsley             Bridge.                 Prior       to       the

  start       of    the       game          at    no       time       did       I see             any       of    the        supporters               being

  allowed          access          by       the       large          gates          at    the          rear       of       Leppings             Lane       Stand.

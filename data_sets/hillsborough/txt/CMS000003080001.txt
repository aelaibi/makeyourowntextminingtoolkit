Thank you for your further letter of 12 March about the
implementation of the Taylor Report.

While it would be wrong for me to attempt to anticipate the
outcome of the General Election, I can say that the present
Government's policy on all-seated football grounds remains
unchanged; namely that standing accommodation at Football
League First (Premier League) and Second Division grounds
should be eliminated by August 1994 and for those in the Third
and Fourth Divisions by August 1999.
We have consulted the Minister for Sport's office and
understand that the report in the Sunday Times of 1 March to
which you refer was not based on any press interview given by
the Minister.

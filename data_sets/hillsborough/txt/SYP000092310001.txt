         not his full address

         The    person                  drove       us to the m atch and          picked me up from my house

         at about         10.30 am       (1030)       on the day of the match,

         also    picked up the            car at my address             the     others were a l re a d y        in the

         car.      We stopped           once    on the way to S h e f f ie l d just outside S tockport

         to go to the            toilet and get some              cans of drink and some                food.     We did

         not suffer any serious                     traffic    delay and arri ve d            in S he f fi e ld at about

         12.30     (1230)        -- 12.45      pm    (1245).                        .

         I have        been to H i l l s b o r o u g h    three      times    before     so    1 knew where       I was

         going.         We went      to a Pub about            two rniLes from the ground                1 cannot

         remember         the    name    of the       pub,    this    is where we        parked our       car.     The

         five    of us went          into      the Pub to see          if they did food we              had one drink

         and    left because            they were        not doing      food.      There were          no supporters

         in this        pub just half a              dozen    locals.

         We    left     the     pub about a          quarter    past    o r \ 4 (13155   and        started   to walk

         down a hill            towards     the      ground.      Weythe n stopped a taxi               and   he took us

         to another           pub near      to Hammer to n^Vxoad Boys Club.                    I did not know       it

         was a boys           club at this          time but      I found out after             the match.

         We went        into this        pub    I don't       know the name and stayed                 till about a

         quarter        past two        (1415)      w hen we    left.        We were walking           towards    the

         ground when we            passed a Fish and C hip Shop                               and         got    some

         chips.         We got     to the Leppings L>ane end of the ground at about a

         quarter        to three        (1445).       W hsm we got       there     it was just a mass of
5 o.£_
         people all           trying     to get       i/nto the ground.           There was also a lot of

         people standing aro un d A s k i n g                 for spare       tickets.

         Be c au s e    I had a N or th Stand             ticket      I. went    to the       left hand side

         turnstiles           and as the others              had L ep pings Lane         terrace       tickets    they

         went    to the         right    hand side.           This was the        last    I saw of them until

         after     the game.

         1 was     being        pushed around          in the     crowd crush and got                pushed over    to
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        S3657

the   left hand        corner       exit gate away from the                 turnstiles.         I was    pushei

up against       the gate         in w hich there was a small window and                        looking

through this         I could see            eight    stewards and one or two             p olicemen just

standing       talking as         if they didn't            know what       to do.   People were

banging       on the gates          because     zp    the    crush., and      I started to        panic

because       of the     crush which ^yes getting worse,                      A w oman age d about 40

yrs   fainted behind me and / h e                   fell    to the ground,       a man    I think        it was

her   husband      picked her             up and he    pushed his way back awa y from the

gates with her,            I did not see her again.

I was    up against          this gate        for/about       five minutes and was              pushed away

from the small           win do w so        I cafuld not      see    inside.     S ud de n ly    the gate

opened and       I was       pushed th/ough and up against a metal                       post which

s up p o r t e d the North '31ana/             I went a r ou n d this metal           post and was

pushed further           into     the ground.          1 saw stewards and Police                 standing

along    the side        of a wall          on my    left    they were       not doing a ny thing         there

was   nothing      they      could do because              of the    crowd rushing through.               At

first when the gate was                   o pened two       stewards    tried to      push      people    back

but   they     could na-t stop the             crowd       rushing    in.

I was       pushed a/ong        by the       crowd and even          if I had wan te d       to turn back

I could not tfecause of the                   crowd    pushing       from behind.        I got     into the

North Stand but            it was         packed and my seat was             row 33 and      in the

eighties.        There was          no way     1 could       reach my seat       because of the

people standing            in the aisles            on the steps.           No one had    checked my

ticket at all.

I know that        two of my friends were                   near    the front    of the stand,           so     I

made my way down Lo them,                    there was       two e t*rpty seats      by them and         I sat

had agreed to meet after             the m atch but there was no one there.                                I then

went to a telephone             to try and       ring    home     but    it was engaged           I then

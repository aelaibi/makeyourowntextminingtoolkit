 Thank you for sending Lord Justice Stuart-Smith a copy of your recent letter to the Home
 Secretary. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has asked me to reply.

 We discussed the terms of reference for Lord Justice Stuart-Smithâ€™s scrutiny during the
 meeting which we had with you in Liverpool, and I do not think we can add anything to what
 we said then. The other points which you raise in your letter are not for Lord Justice Stuart-
 Smith to comment upon.

Secretary to the Scrutiny

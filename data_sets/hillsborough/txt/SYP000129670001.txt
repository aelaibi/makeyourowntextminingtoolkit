      Specification of Works for use in connection with

                      Various Structural Repairs

1.0   Excavation

      1.01    The Contractor must take every precaution to
               ensure the safety of persons and property at
               all times. The Contractor1s attention is
               drawn to the fact that the services to existing
               buildings and plant must be uninterrupted
               throughout the Contract.

      1.02    The Contractor is to remove from the site and
               dispose of all surplus excavated material
               unless otherwise expressly required.
      1.03    The Contractor shall excavate for the
               foundations to the minimum widths
               and depths shown on the Drawings, or as
               directed by the Engineer, to an approved
               solid bottom.

      1-4     The Contractor shall level, well ram and con­
               solidate the ground surface and bottoms of all
               excavations to receive foundation bases and
               slabs.

      1.05    Should any excavation be made to a greater
               depth than required by the Drawings or by the
               Engineer, the Contractor shall, at his own
              expense, fill up such excess excavation with
              concrete as specified in section 2.

      1.06    The Contractor shall make his own arrangements
               for the temporary storage of spoil and include
              for all costs incurred in haulage and double
              handling.

      1.07    The edges of all excavations shall be adequately
              protected by barricades or fencing to prevent
              accidents.

2.0   Concrete Work

      2.01    All workmanship and materials shall conform
              with B.S. Code of Practice CP.110.
      2.02    All concrete shall consist of four parts of
              coarse aggregate 20mm graded, two parts of
              fine aggregate and one part of cement all
              measured by weight and shall have a guaranteed
              compressive strength of 30 N/mm2 at 28 days.
2.03   Coarse aggregate shall consist of Derbyshire
       limestone graded to the limits given in Table
       1 of BS.882.   Fine aggregate shall consist
       of clean hard coarse naturally occurring sand
       within the limits of grading M given in Table
       5 of BS.882.   Cement shall be Ordinary Portland
       Cement and shall comply in all respects with -
       the requirements of BS.12.
2.04   The slump of the concrete shall be 50mm ± 25mm
       measured as the pouring of the batch commences
       and at a time not more than 20 minutes after
       the commencement of mixing.
2.05   Ready-mixed concrete from an approved supplier
       shall be used.   Each delivery of concrete must
       be accompanied by a delivery note stating the
       exact weights of materials and water content,
       and the time at which water was added to the mix.
2.06   The concrete shall be transported from the
       batching plant and be in its final position
       within 45 minutes after mixing commenced.
2.07   All concrete shall be protected during trans­
       portation and when in its final position against
       sun, wind, rain and extremes of temperature,
       by suitable covering.   No concrete shall be
       placed when the air temperature is below 2°C
       and the concrete shall be prevented from falling
       below this temperature for a period of seven days.
2.08   All concrete shall be thoroughly vibrated using
       an emersion type poker to ensure maximum density.
2.09   Before placing concrete the excavations are to
       be cleaned out to remove all loose materials or
       debris and the bottom well rammed to give a
       firm surface.   Concrete shall be placed in a
       single operation to the full depth of the bases.
2.10   All concrete surfaces, except those covered by
       formwork, shall be cured by either keeping wet
       for seven days or using a proprietory curing
       agent. Curing shall commence at the earliest
       possible time following placing of the concrete.
2.11   The reinforcement shall be British manufactured/
       hot rolled, or cold worked in accordance with
       BS.444 9 or BS.4461 as appropriate.
       All reinforcement shall be free from loose rust,
       paint, oil, grease or any other contaminents.
       Reinforcement shall be cut and bent accurately to
       the shapes shown on the Bar Schedules and be
       placed exactly in accordance with the information
       on the Drawings.
                  The reinforcement shall be supported by precast
                  concrete blocks or other approved means
                  and shall be securely tied in place with 16 gauge
                  steel tying wire.
                  Immediately before concreting, the reinforcement
                  shall be checked for position by the Contractor
                  and the Engineer.   The reinforcement must
                  remain in its correct position during the placing
                  of the concrete.

      2.12        Shattering shall be ply or soft wood and be
                  removed gently so as not to damage the concrete
                  surface.   Any concrete which is in the opinion
                  of the Engineer insufficiently dense, out of
                  line, of unsightly finish shall be cut out and
                  made good at the Contractor's expense. Render­
                  ing over any surface shall not be permitted.

      2.13    Horizontal surfaces shall be accurately screeded
              to levels which match the existing terrace steps
              or slabs. The concrete shall be trowelled
               smooth followed by brushing over with a stiff
              brush.
              Vertical surfaces shall be as struck from the
              shuttering. The risers shall line through
              exactly with the vertical edge of the existing
              terrace step.    A chamfer or arrise shall be
              formed on the nose of the step to match the
              existing.
      2.14    The props to the slab over the exit from
               Spion Kop may be removed after eight days
              after casting the concrete providing the surface
              temperature of the concrete is kept above 7°C.
              A set of three concrete test cubes shall be made
              and tested in accordance with BS.1881.     One
               shall be tested after three days and two after
               seven days.

                  document shall apply as the minimum standard
                  of acceptance.
3 .02   The principal dimensions for setting out the
        work shall be those shown on the Drawings,
        which are to be read in conjunction with all
        further drawings issued by the Engineer.
        The Contractor shall allow in his tender for

      4.03       All paints shall be thoroughly mixed before
                 use unless there is a specific instruction to
                  the contrary on the container.   They shall be
                  stored so as to minimise exposure to extremes
                 of temperature.    All painting is to be
                 carried out strictly in accordance with the
                 manufacturer1s instructions.
      4.04       After blast cleaning all surfaces of the
                  steelwork shall receive one coat of a high
                 build zinc phosphate primer,applied no later
                  than two hours after being cleaned.   Care is
                  to be taken to ensure that all edges of the
                 members are fully covered.
      4.05     Primed or undercoated metalwork shall not be
               left in an exposed or unsuitable situation
               for an undue period before completing the

               one Alkyd undercoat shall be applied followed
               by one Alkyd gloss coat after the undercoat
               has dried.
      4.07     The steelwork is to be delivered to site fully
               painted but not until the final coat has
               hardened. After installation all blemishes,
               erection damage and welds are to be wire
               brushed and cleaned. The surfaces are then
               to be primed and overcoated as described above.

               Clean all exposed reinforcing bars with a wire
               brush to remove all rust.
               Paint the cleaned bars with Nitozinc in accordance
               with the manufacturer instructions.
               After the Nitozinc has dried apply a priming
               coat of Nitoprime S to all the surfaces.
               Prepare sufficient surfaces of concrete to
               accept a full pack of mixed Nitomortar HB, to
               reduce waste. Mix the Nitomortar HB as directed
               by the manufacturer and apply the mortar with a
               trowel in layers of up to 50mm thick just as the
               second coat of primer begins to gell.
               The Nitozinc, Nitoprime.S and Nitomortar
               are all manufactured by CBP U.K. Ltd. Vimy Road,

6.0   Fixings

      6.01      Where shown on the Drawings drill holes to the
                recommended depth and diameter in the brickwork
                for 16 mm diameter style 3 bolts. The bolts,
                nuts and washers are to be electro-galvanised.

                Where shown on the Drawings drill holes 150 mm
                deep to the recommended diameter in the concrete
                slab for 10 mm diameter reinforcing bar.

                Clean the holes thoroughly to remove all dust.

                Insert the appropriate number of Selfix capsules,
                individually to the extremity of the hole.

                Attach the bolt to a drill, insert into the hole
                and spin the bolt progressively through the
                capsule until the bottom of the hole is reached.
                Rotate the drill for a final two seconds and
                detach the bolt from the drill. Leave the bolt
                undisturbed until the resin has cured.

                When fixing the 10 mm reinforcing bars inject
                Resifix 3P into the holes using a mastic cartridge
                gun.  Insert the bars into the hole squeezing out
                some of the resin grout.

                Resifix 3P grout may be used for fixing the bolts
                instead of the Selfix capsules.

                The style 3 bolts, Selfix capsules and Resifix 3P
                grout are all manufactured by Celtile (Selfix) Ltd.,
                P.O. Box 7, Alfreton, Derby. DE5 7RE (0977 604131).

For the attention of Hr. R. Chester


Dear
                         Certificate of Ground Safety
                             Work During 1983
       We have pleasure in enclosing three fee accounts for work
done in connection with the Certificate of Ground Safety.     As
usual we have separated the cost of testing the barriers from the
remainder of the work, but in addition we have also prepared a
separate account for testing the handrails and sail along the ramp
at the back of Spion Kop.     During construction of the toilets and
other amentJkies at the back of Spion Kop the bank side moved
sideways a few inches.     This put some doubt on the safety of the wall
and handrails and it was requested by South Yorkshire County Council
that they be load tested to prove that they could still withstand
the crowd loading.
       We see no reason why you should not pass the account for
         onto the contractor,                   Ltd.


                                    Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. 1. Cheater



Dear
          Maintenance Work 1983 - 84
     During the annual inspection there were a few items of
maintenance work noted which it was decided could not be
undertaken by your ground staff. These were items requiring
specialist skills such as welding and a knowledge of
reinforced concrete work.
     We purposely delayed the issue of tenders for this work
because we hoped to incorporate it into the contract for the
supporting structures for the proposed signs along Penistone
Hoad. We understand that the decision to go ahead with the
signs has been deferred for the ti*e being but to satisfy
the S.Y.C.C. OfficerWorking party we believe that some action
should be taken to do the structural repairs on the aaintenance
list.
     A copy of the tender document for the repairs is enclosed.
We have chosen February to do the work because it may be easier
to fit round the possible fixtures. We will write again when
we have received tenders.
     Best wishes for Christmas and R u t Tear.
                       fours sincerely,

      Specification of Works for use In connection with

                      Various Structural Repairs


1.0   Excavation
      1.01    The Contractor must take every precaution to
               ensure the safety of persons and property at
               all times. The Contractor's attention is
              drawn to the fact that the services to existing
              buildings and plant must be uninterrupted
              throughout the Contract.

      1.02    The Contractor is to remove from the site and
              dispose of all surplus excavated material
              unless otherwise expressly required.

      1.03    The Contractor shall excavate for the
              foundations to the minimum widths
              and depths shown on the Drawings, or as
              directed by the Engineer, to an approved
              solid bottom.

      1.4     The Contractor shall level, well ram and con­
              solidate the ground surface and bottoms of all
              excavations to receive foundation bases and
              slabs.
      1.05    Should any excavation be made to a greater
              depth than required by the Drawings or by the
              Engineer, the Contractor shall, at his own
              expense, fill up such excess excavation with
              concrete as specified in section 2.

      1.06    The Contractor shall make his own arrangements
              for the temporary storage of spoil and include
              for all costs incurred in haulage and double
              handling.

      1.07    The edges of all excavations shall be adequately
              protected by barricades or fencing to prevent
              accidents.


2.0   Concrete Work
      2.01    All workmanship and materials shall conform
              with B.S. Code of Practice CP.110.

      2.02     All concrete shall consist of four parts of
               coarse aggregate 20mm graded, two parts of
               fine aggregate and one part of cement all
               measured by weight and shall have a guaranteed
               compressive strength of 30 N/mm2 at 28 days.




                             1 .
2.03   Coarse aggregate shall consist of Derbyshire
        limestone graded to the limits given in Table
        1 of BS.882.   Fine aggregate shall consist
       of clean hard coarse naturally occurring sand
       within the limits of grading M given in Table
        5 of BS.882.   Cement shall be Ordinary Portland
       Cement and shall comply in all respects with
       the requirements of BS.12.
2.04   The slump of the concrete shall be 50mm ± 25mm
       measured as the pouring of the batch commences
       and at a time not more than 20 minutes after
       the commencement of mixing.

2.05   Ready-mixed concrete from an approved supplier
       shall be used.    Each delivery of concrete must
       be accompanied by a delivery note stating the
       exact weights of materials and water content,
       and the time at which water was added to the mix.

2.06   The concrete shall be transported from the
       batching plant and be in its final position
       within 45 minutes after mixing commenced.

2.07   All concrete shall be protected during trans­
       portation and when in its final position against
       sun, wind, rain and extremes of temperature,
       by suitable covering.   No concrete shall be
       placed when the air temperature is below 2°C
       and the concrete shall be prevented from falling
       below this temperature for a period of seven days.

2.08   All concrete shall be thoroughly vibrated using
       an emersion type poker to ensure maximum density.

2.09   Before placing concrete the excavations are to
       be cleaned out to remove all loose materials or
       debris and the bottom well rammed to give a
       firm surface.   Concrete shall be placed in a
       single operation to the full depth of the bases.
2.10   All concrete surfaces, except those covered by
       formwork, shall be cured by either keeping wet
       for seven days or using a proprietory curing
       agent. Curing shall commence at the earliest
       possible time following placing of the concrete.

       hot rolled, or cold worked in accordance with
       BS.'4-449. or .BS.4461 as appropriate.
       All reinforcement shall be free from loose rust,
       paint, oil, grease or any other contaminents.
       Reinforcement shall be cut and bent accurately to
       the shapes shown on the Bar Schedules and be
       placed exactly in accordance with the information
       on the Drawings.




                      2.
            The reinforcement shall be supported by precast
            concrete blocks or other approved means
            and shall be securely tied in place with 16 gauge
            steel tying wire.
            Immediately before concreting, the reinforcement
            shall be checked for position by the Contractor
            and the Engineer.   The reinforcement must
            remain in its correct position during the placing
            of the concrete.
2.12    Shuttering shall be ply or soft wood and be
        removed gently so as not to damage the concrete
        surface.   Any concrete which is in the opinion
        of the Engineer insufficiently dense, out of
        line, of unsightly finish shall be cut out and
        made good at the Contractor's expense. Render­
        ing over any surface shall not be permitted.

2.13    Horizontal surfaces shall be accurately screeded
        to levels which match the existing terrace steps
        or slabs. The concrete shall be trowelled
        smooth followed by brushing over with a stiff
        brush.
        Vertical surfaces shall be as struck from the
        shuttering. The risers shall line through
        exactly with the vertical edge of the existing
        terrace step.   A chamfer or arrise shall be
        formed on the nose of the step to match the
        existing.
2.14    The props to the slab over the exit from
        Spion Kop may be removed after eight days
        after casting the concrete providing the surface
        temperature of the concrete is kept above 7°C.
        A set of three concrete test cubes shall be made
        and tested in accordance with BS.1881.    One
        shall be tested after three days and two after
        seven days.

       paint, rust, oil and any other deleterious
       matter or contaminants. No site welding shall
       be carried out when rain is falling or in
       conditions of high wind. No welding shall be
       done if the surfaces of the work are wet.
       Electrodes compatible with the grade of material
       being welded shall be used throughout and shall
       be stored and used in accordance with the
       manufacturer's recommendations. Damp or damaged
       electrodes shall not be used.
                 All slag and spatter shall be cleaned off every

                 BS.5289, if in the opinion of the Engineer, the
                 quality or strength of any weld is in question
                 this weld is to be completely removed and the
                 piece re-welded. No payment will be made in
                 respect of time lost for carrying out any
                 remedial work.

         After the Nitozinc has dried apply a priming
         coat of Nitoprime S to all the surfaces.
         Prepare sufficient surfaces of concrete to
         accept a full pack of mixed Nitomortar HB, to
         reduce waste. Mix the Nitomortar HB as directed
         by the manufacturer and apply the mortar with a
         trowel in layers of up to 50mm thick just as the
         second coat of primer begins to gell.
         The Nitozinc, Nitoprime,S and Nitomortar
         are all manufactured by CBP U.K. Ltd. Vimy Road,
         Off Leighton Road, Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire,
         LU7 7ER. Telephone 0525 375646.
6.0   Fixings
      6 .01     Where shown on the Drawings drill holes to the
                recommended depth and diameter in the brickwork
                for 16 mm diameter style 3 bolts. The bolts,
                nuts and washers are to be electro-galvanised.

                Where shown on the Drawings drill holes 150 mm
                deep to the recommended diameter in the concrete
                slab for 10 mm diameter reinforcing bar.

                Clean the holes thoroughly to remove all dust.

                Insert the appropriate number of Selfix capsules,
                individually to the extremity of the hole.
                Attach the bolt to a drill, insert into the hole
                and spin the bolt progressively through the
                capsule until the bottom of the hole is reached.
                Rotate the drill for a final two seconds and
                detach the bolt from the drill. Leave the bolt
                undisturbed until the resin has cured.

                When fixing the 10 mm reinforcing bars inject
                Resifix 3P into the holes using a mastic cartridge
                gun. Insert the bars into the hole squeezing out
                some of the resin grout.

                Resifix 3P grout may be used for fixing the bolts
                instead of the Selfix capsules.
                The style 3 bolts, Selfix capsules and Resifix 3P
                grout are all manufactured by Celtile (Selfix) Ltd.,
                P.O. Box 7, Alfreton, Derby. DE5 7RE (0977 604131).

     For the attention of Mr,




      Dear Mr.
             Sheffield Wednesday rootball Club pic
Load Tests on Wall and Handrails along Ramp behind Spion Kop
           You will recall that during the construction of the
      new toilets and facilities behind Spion Kop the raap
      was disturbed by movement of the embankment. Following
      the inspection made by S.Y.C.C. Officer Party on
      11 August it was decided to test the handrail and wall
      along the ramp. The tests were carried out on 25 and
      26 August in accordance with the procedure laid down in
      the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds. A few handrail
      po&ts were also tested to show that these would still
      safe|y resist the applied loads. The rails, walls and
      posts which were tested are indicated on our drawing
      4644/1, a print of which is enclosed.
           You will see that the walls between the posts were
      tested in two halves. This is because the wall lengths
      are so long t h a t the test rig can only apply load over
      about half the length. We consider that this is a reason­
      able approach because the wall appears to be acting as. a
cantilever rather than span horizontally.
     In all but one case the wall, handrails and posts
sustained the test load. The only failure was the post
at the very top of the raap, on span 1. The post
continued to deflect during the application of the load
until the jacks reached their full extension. Although
the post recovered by abott 80% there was a lot of
cracking round the base and in accordance with clause 6
of Appendix C it has been decided to strengthen or
replace the post. This work will be carried out shortly.

Dear Eric,

              Certificate of Ground Safety > 1983

     Following the barrier tests at the Loppings Lane end, my
visit to the ground on 25 July,, .the inspection made by the
SYCC Officer Working Party and the subsequent tests on the
hand rail and wall along the ramp at the back of Spion Kop.
I have pleasure in enclosing wf annual certificate and
accompanying list of remedial work.   Items lc, 6g, 7a and 8b
will probably need to be done by a contractor because they
involve specialist skills.   With your agreement we will
prepare some sketches for the work and engage a contractor on
your behalf, we we have done in the past. The work can be
   ’                       ' •        -
fitted round the fixtures without difficulty.




                                         Yours sincerely,
                                                  WE/JAS/PB/4644

  Annual Inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium as required
               by the Certificate of Ground Safety
                                '*




     On 25 July, 1983 I made an inspection of the ground after
having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
tested by members of my staff under my control.

     At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 121, 122, 123,
124A, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,
136 (part), 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144 (part), 1 4 5
(part), 146 (part), 147, 148, 149 (part), 150, 151, 152, 153
and 154 (part), all at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
were tested in accordance with the procedures laid down in the
Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.

     In all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
although in two cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
deformed.    These clips were on barrier 136 between spans 6-7
and 8-9.    New clips have been fitted.

     The only failure was the centre support of barrier 141
where the angle leg parted where it was badly corroded.     The
angle has been plated and new bolts inserted.

   » I am now able to certify that all the barriers tested
have a satisfactory strength.

     Various minor items of remedial work to concrete walls
at the back of the North stand, steps and terracing on Spion
Kop and protection of the North side gable stanchion in the
West stand have been completed as part of the maintenance
programme.

     Certain other items of maintenance work which it is
suggested should be carried out in the near future have been
recommended to the Club.   A list is attached.

     New toilets and turnstiles have recently been constructed
behind Spion Kop.   During these operations the ramp dwwn the
back of Spion Kop was disturbed by movement of the embankment.
In particular the hand rail and concrete wall guarding the
edge of the gangway moved sideways.   The hand rail and wall
have now been tested in accordance with the requirements of
the Code of Practice and in all but one case, where there was
excessive deflection of a hand rail post, successfully
resisted the test load.

     Following these inspections and tests, I certify that in
my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
satisfactory condition and are appropriate for the stadium to
be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
Ground Safety.                           ■

Remedial Wsrk recommended to be done during the next malntenanee period

1.     Spion Ko p
       a)   Make good a few spalied gangway and terrace steps.
       b)   Fill with concrete or sand/cement mortar the gaps that
             have opened betw«teia the top perimeter gangways and
             terracing. Two areas are affected, one on the left hand
             aide, looking from the pitch, near the top, the other
             behind the Hillsborough Suite.
      c)    On the tunnel exit at the North side cut hack the
             ■palling concrete soffit at the front and re«cast the
             concrete incorporating a new upstand beam if necessary.
            Also, hack off any othfr loose concrete around corroding
             reinforcement, clean the exposed bars and make good with
             an epoxy or polyeater mortar.
       d)   On the lower exit at the South side, alongaide the South
             stand, the coping stones on top of the right hand side
            wall are loose or missing. These s&ould be replaced
            or removed altogether and the brickwork pointing. The
             opposite side wall also needs attention to the coping
             stones and the cracked and spalied concrete making good.

2.   ■ North Stand                                                   . ■
       a)   Treat, as described in lc) above, the ramps including
             the back faces of the concrete walls. Some of the
             patching"':dons earlier this pear needs replacing where
      It is cracked.
b)   The half joint over the corbel next to entrance R
      needs repointlng.
c)   The pointing needs replacing, in the seated area,
      between the ends of the precast terrace units.
      This is most noticeable near the front and up the
      gangways.                            ,

North West Corner
a)   The loose joint filler between the Vest stand gable
      and terrace ought to be renoved.
b)   The sheeting at the back of the terracing is beginning
      to corrode and some of the joints have been damaged
      and prised apart by spectators. Sharp edges and
      lifting corners should be attended to.
c)   Make good a few spalied terrace steps.

Area behind West Stand
a)   Perhaps some thought could be given to the future plans
      for the old brick built store which Is in poor repair.
      if the building is to remain ttten the llntol should be
      propped or replaced and the walls and roof repaired.
b)    Re-bed the loose coping stones and make good the
      spalied concrete oyer gates 1 - 17.

West Stand
a)    Make good the cracked and spalled concrete on the
      slab and step on tfce North side emergency exit.
b)    Make good the bit of spalled concrete round the base
      of the front stanchion on the south gable.
c)    Paint the bottoms of the gable stanchions.
d)    Back off all loose concrete rendering, especially
      on South gable and make good where necessary.

                        of the stand especially around gates G & H the
                        players entrance and the East gable.

                   b)   Similar treatment is needed to the beam and slab
                         soffit In the ground floor toilets at Spion Kop

                         the column in the corner of the toilets at the
                        bottom of gangway No. 2, the column in the toilets
                         outside gangway No. 8, some sections of the beam at the
                        back of the seated area (behind the timber boxing
                         in the West half), the first row column going through
                         gate G at ground floor, the gable beam adjacent to

                   d)   The broken panes of glass in the roof lights over the
                         various toilet blocks need replacing.

                   e)   The   flashing over thf raking beams on both gables
                         needs attention, possibly replacing in some places.

                   f)   The   smell of gas on the 1st floor, around the bars
                         adjacent to gangways 6 and 8 needs investigation.

                   g)   The   vertical posts and diagonal stays are corroded
                         on the exit between gates K & S.      These should be
                   ,    strengthened by welding on plates as was done on the
                         posts adjacent to gate 0 on Penistone Road.

                   h)   The   gutter needs repairing.    There is a leak around
                         the 7th truss from the gable and some of the rotten
                         timber should be cut out and replaced.

Dear Mr. Vaughan,

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

     You will no doubt have been informed by M r .              that
the hand rail and wall alongside the ramp at the back of Spion
Kop successfuly withstood the test load, except in one case
where there was excessive deflection of a hand rail post at
the very top of the ramp.

     Accordingly, I have now been able to issue to the Club ray
certificate concerning the structures in the ground.      A copy
is enclosed.

Dear Mr.
      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd..
             Ground Safety Work 1983
     Last week, Eric England passed on the message that
you wish to have the vail down the raap at the back of
Spion Sop tested before any remedial work is carried
out. This is fine, but before we deliver the teat rig
could you instruct the Contractor to remove all the
timber and forawork on the raap and also to renove the
steel stay,s bolted to the floor and posts. If you let
us know when this has been done we will test the wall,
probably the next day.

                      Yours sincerely,

                           Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                                  Sheffield on 11th August, 1983

                PRESENT: Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

                            Dr. W. Eastwood (Eastwood & Partners)
                            E. England (Secretary)

                            Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

                             M s. J. Barker (South Yorkshire Police)
                             C. W. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
                             J. Miles (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                                         (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
                                         (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
                            TT.I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

                1.        Purpose of Meeting

                The purpose of the meeting was primarily to carry out the
                inspection of the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
                visits to Football League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate
                Officer Working Party.

                In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to see the position with
                regard to the effect of the carrying out of the improvements at the
                Penistone Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working Party
                on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
                a letter to the Club dated 29th June). Reports being received from the
                Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
                material, apparently of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
                adjacent access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

                2.        Ground Inspection

                A.        Electronic Score and Message Board

                It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
                of the Stadium on 21st February, 1983, the electronic score and message
                board had been erected between the South and West Stands. Evidently, it
                was proving to be a most welcome feature.

                B.        West Stand and Terrace

                The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
                at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as a
                store) were again discussed in view of its condition.          17

                The condition of the crack in the brickwork at the rear corner of the Stand .
                (nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

                Dr. Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
                completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium. One had
                failed and been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -
(i)     That, if the Club intend-   to continueto use the former A.R.P. building
adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would requiie attention
in particular, as would the general maintenance of the building.
(ii)   That the condition of the crack in the non load bearing brickwork at
the rear corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.
(iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
loose concrete rendering apparent in p lac^s                                       ^^
C.      North West Terrace           ^     *
As the Terrace and the West Standwere separate structures, the Club were of
the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
caused by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if not
impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the seepage of
water between the two.
IT WAS AGREED that this was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
continue to monitor the position.
D.     North Stand                                                             ™
The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" requested at the last meeting was in hand
as a matter of maintenance.
E.      Spion Kop
As requested at the last meeting, the Club had investigated the spalled concrete
and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the
North Stand end). Action would be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
worst affected) portion of the roof, which would also have the effect of
increasing the headroom.     ~T?TKa_ —                                    <sc
Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
stabalise the banking at the rear of the Spion Kop following digging out
to provide new refreshment and toilet facilities, the Officer Working Party
were of the firm opinion that further work was essential. Measurements had
shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
movement. Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
former retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and                ^
consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
of the existing barrier rails. The Club would have to look to the contractor
(or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.
As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new facilities (as they were not load bearing). Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
out in the letter of 29th June).
IT WAS AGREED
(i)     That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
principle.
 (ii)    That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
 match on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
 rails must be stabilised (possibly by drilling holes at intervals and
 inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success nr ni-hprw.lsj>
 of the measures tested by test loading the? barrier rails(or a representative / J
 sample) to the Green Guide requirements.                             ~       v //       •& P ’
f— ------- ——------------------ -------------
(iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
be taken (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures                 -C ^
where these are capable of being generated.

(iv)    That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so as not to reduce the
support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall externally
in places must also not be overlooked.

F.      "Stands" Club

It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
beams underneath the "Stands" club. It was understood that the premises
were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection in the brick
built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if
pressure was applied to the top of the wall.

IT WAS AGREED

(i)     That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel beams
under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(ii)    That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets     r
should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.    '^T2/vu_ — 1 ca ^ a A

G.      South Stand                                                          -

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed,
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
steel supports tothe sides of the concertina-type exit gate from the
Stand (nearest tothe Spion Kop).

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i) That the Club     would remove the remaining coping stones and arrange
for the remainder ofthe pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
undertaken as a matter of maintenance.

(ii)    That the Club would shortly consider a scheme tobeprepared by
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for(/fe]>lacementN)of bothsteelsupports to
the exit gate from the Stand (nearest- toy the Spion Kop).

H.      Ground Fitness Certificate

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate. However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, las required byNthe General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penis tone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificate
to the County Council, excluding the Penistorie Road end of the Stadium at
the present time. -

Dear Eric,

                Barrier Testing and Safety Work 1983

      As related to you by John Strange last Friday we write
to confirm that we have completed the testing of the barriers
along the front of the West Stand including those in the
south-west corner. Only one barrier failed the test but this
can be repaired without having to install a new supporting
post. Unfortunately two clips retaining horizontal rails
deformed during testing and we recommend that these are replaced
with new ones. Also, one of the rails needs welding to its
retaining clip.
      As agreed last Friday we have spoken to George Shaw
Engineering (Sheffield) Ltd. and using their prices, offered
last year for similar work, as a basis have accepted , on
your behalf a cost of £ 9 3 . 0 0 f or the complete repairs,

including priming.
      They should be doing the work within the next few days.
      X shall probably be making my inspection next month
prior to the visit by the SYCC Officer Working Party in
August. If there is any maintenance work to be done other
than that listed after their last visit in February I will
let you know.
                                  Yours sincerely,
                                                WE/JAS/PB/4644

 For the attention of Mr* D. Vaughan


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                   Note of Meeting held on 21 February 1983
          Thank you for sending me a copy of your notes of the
 meeting.      I was sorry that I could not be present myself
 but I was giving evidence in a very protracted court case
 that day.'
          The one matter which needs comment is the suggested
 measurement of deflections of the roof trusses in the South
 stand.      I am surprised that this matter has been raised
 again because you will recall that I put forward what I think
 is a correct explanation as to why the trusses lean.      It is
 associated with the use of timber purlins which shrank
 as they dried out after the roof was covered.       This pulled
 the trusses out of line by successively larger amounts until
 the matter was corrected by presumably longer purlins being
•introduced.
          During the winter of 1981/82 there was an unusually heaVfy,
 snowfall following which a careful inspection was made which
revealed no signs of damage.       The bottom boom member of the
sixth truss has always been displaced and I do not think there
 is any change in its condition.
                                                                    2   .




       It has not been possible to devise a simple and
cheap way to measure any change in the deflection.     Because
of the seating and the sloping terrace below access is
difficult and really heeds scaffolding on each occasion when
any measurements are made.     This would be             m   as
to be unreasonable.
       It has to be kept in mind that the only times
when the roof might conceivably be in structural danger
would Lte under even more intense snow loading than in 1982
or alternatively under jeomore intense gale than has been
experienced in recent years.     In either of these circumstances
it is quite inconceivable that the general public would be
in the ground.
       With all this as background I have advised the Club
that it is not feasible to carry out measurements in a
cost effective way but we shall of course continue to
inspect the roof from the ground whenever extremes of
snowfall or wind have been experienced.
       The various other items raised in your note will be
the subject of discussion with the Club and action where
necessary for safety reasons during the summer closed season.


                                 Yours sincerely,




c.c.   E. England

               -JL-    Purpose of Meeting

               The visit was the usual winter inspection carried out of the Football
               League grounds in South Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
               Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981), as well as to
               discuss and comment on the Club's proposal to erect a new score and
               message board (referred to in the letter and plans from Messrs. Eastwood
               & Partners dated 7th February, 1983).                                          *

                2.     New Score and Message Board

               The new board was to be erected in the south west corner of the ground
               between the South and the West Stands at a height of some 7 metres above
               the terrace level. The siting and construction of the supporting pillars
               were such that there would be no appreciable effect on the number of
               spectators who could be accommodated on the terrace.

               The Building Authority regarded the detailed drawings and calculations as
               satisfactory, and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners outlined the steps taken to
               take effect of wind and ice-loadings on the structure. The South Yorkshire
               Police were satisfied with the assurances given that the structure would,
               for all practical purposes, be climb proof. The South Yorkshire County
               Fire Service saw no objection to the proposal.

               IT WAS AGREED That the Officer Working Party saw no objection to the
               proposal, and that Mr. D. Vaughan would reply to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners
               to this effect.

               3.     Ground Inspection

               A.     West Stand

               It was noted that, whilst the foot of the steel supporting pillar had been
               cleared of light surface corrosion and its gusset plate had been covered
               by a concrete haunch (as agreed at the summer inspection on 24th August,
               1982), it still required to be painted.
                       It was also noted that the crack in the concrete adjacent to stand entrances *
                       "W" and "X" had been made good.

                       The Club had also been requested at the summer inspection on 24th August,
                       1982, to consider whether any useful purpose would be served by retaining
                       the store shed at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall.
                       This point was repeated, and the South Yorkshire Police added that at
                       some time in the future they hoped the Club would be able to provide some
                       form of segregation, as well as separate bar and toilet facilities, to
                       separate home and visiting supporters at the rear of the Stand.

                       IT WAS AGREED that the new expansion crack in the brickwork at the rear
                       corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should be
                       monitored to ensure its condition did not worsen.

                       B.      North   West Terrace

                       It was noted that the seepage of water between the North West Terrace and
                       the West Stand in heavy rain (also raised at the summer inspection) apparently
                       continued to occur.

                       IT WAS AGREED that, whilst not being a matter of safety, the Club should
                       be recommended to replace the bituman impregnated fibre board as a matter
. cA                   of maintenance to overcome the seepage problem.

^                    > C.      North Stand

                       The crack at the Expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" (which the
                       Club had been requested to investigate and make good at the summer
                       inspection) had received some attention but could not be regarded as
                    /* satisfactory.
    vMr't" a
     ^ o &vj2          XT WAS AGREED that    theClub   would givefurther attention   to the crack.

                       D.     Spion Kop

                       All of the crush barriers had been tested since certification, the main
                       problem having been rusting of some of the clips over the top tubes on
                       certain barriers.

                       IT WAS AGREED that the Club would investigate and make good the spalled
                       concrete and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop
                       (at the North Stand end).

                       E.     South Stand

                       In view of recent adverseweather conditions, the agreement tovisually
                       inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection after exceptional gale
                       or snow loading was recalled. It was noted that the sixth roof truss from
                       the East Gable (including the Gable) particularly appeared to have deflected
                       since the summer visit.

                       IT WAS AGREED -

                        (i)'   That some form of measuring the evident deflection in the roof
      v* \             trusses was desirable, and the Club were requested to consider whether some
                r      formof quick and/or economic method of doing so could be devised.

             itJU'Wo   (ii)     That the Chief Fire Officer be requested to consider the suitability
     . ,               from   a fire resistance point of view of the cladding in the first floor

    ft*
                             enclosed link bridge from the Stand to the Restaurant.   -
                                                                                                          *
                             F.     Police and First Aid Facilities

                             The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand had been
                             welcomed by the users and were proving to be most useful.

                             G.     Maintenance

                             It was noted that certain items of maintenance throughout the ground
                             required attention.
I
                             IT WAS AGREED that under this general heading the Club would look particularly
                             into the loose wiring at both ends of the South Stand, at the pointing and

                             Whilst the electrical contractor's staff obviously had to climb the flood­
                             lighting pylons from time to time, it appeared that no regular inspection
                             of the pylons took place from a structural safety point of view.

  kio o-c                  IT WAS AGREED that a regular    inspection of the floodlighting pylons from
  c&it/*'{■ s Z            a structural safety point of    view was desirable, say, every, two or three
 .         '               years, and that to establish    the present position, an inspection of one of
                        feUthe pylons should be carried    to see what was revealed.

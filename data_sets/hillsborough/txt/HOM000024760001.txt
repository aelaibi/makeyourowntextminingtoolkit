Our Ref: PAW/TC.                              26th October, 1989.

Dear Mr. Svreet,

Thank you for your tine yesterday when I visited the Heme Office.   I hope
you found the 'transfer multiplier' example useful.

As regards ticketing and Synchro Systems involvement in Fbotball, I
promised to elaborate further on these matters.

Synchro Systems are a cranputer software and management company of ten
years standing. Since April 1988 they have been part of the Tbttenham
Hotspur pic group of companies. This has enabled Synchro to gain the
working capital and viability necessary to continue as market leaders in
this field. Synchro has developed a number of products and services in
several computer related spheres. Specialist software has been developed
for both membership purposes and access control; these are used at many
Football Clubs and Synchro produces over 150,000 rards per annum.

 Bsrhaps of most interest at the present time are the ticketing and
                     SYStenB ^ idh Synch™ has developed.     The 'Arenar'
 ocmputerxsed stadium management system produces the tickets I showed you          ■ ■ ■
 yesterday. The system works as follows:-

           The software has programmed into it the layout and seating
           plan of the stadium.
                                                                     ^

           The mini-printer attached to the computer then prints
           instantaneously the ticket as requested.
           The seat sold cannot then be double-booked (nor can seats taken by
           season ticket holders be sold by accident).                             | f }

           Ihe software also provides the d u b with accountancy facilities
           credit card orders, and an instant update on the state of ticket

           The back of the ticket is printed with a map.
           The front of the ticket can have information over-printed on it
           such as:
                 The name of the supporter.
                 Suggested arrival time.
                 Details of pre-match events.
                 Which entry to the ground is correct.

           The tickets are very secure indeed the metallic tickets have never
           been forged.
           The computer retains the information regarding who has purchased
           which seat (e.g. so that the Doctor can be contacted).

for the 1990 Wbrld Cup in Italy.

I hope this is of interest. Ihe system can best be understood if it is
seenin action: do contact ms if you would like to see a demonstration or
have any further questions.

Yours sincerely,

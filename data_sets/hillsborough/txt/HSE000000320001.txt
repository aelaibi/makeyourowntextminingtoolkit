HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

Please see the attached minute from          on the importance of
recording HSE's costs in supporting the Hillsborough Inquiry.

I am assuming that your Divisions will be asked to offer
assistance to the Inquiry/ and therefore ask that you arrange for
any of your colleagues who do become involved to record costs, and
get anyone else they deal with on this, to record them too.

If there are any problems with costings,             1RPD B2, has
kindly offered to give advice. He can be contacted on ext. 6485,
Baynards House.

        THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUIRY.

        Following our telephone conversation on 19 April, I am writing to
        offer Lord Justice Taylor the assistance of the HSE's Research and
        Laboratory Services Division in the forensic work which will
        presumably precede or form part of the Inquiry.

        Our Research Division, which operates in support of the Executive's
        Inspection and Policy function^ has three major laboratories, -
        occupational medicine and hygiene at Cricklewood, the Explosiw® and
        Flame Laboratory (which assisted with the Kings Cross Inquiry) and
        Piper Alpha) at Buxton and the Safety Engineering Laboratory at
        Sheffield. The Safety Engineering Laboratory, which is situated
        only about a mile from Hillsborough not only has extensive
        facilities but also considerable experience of forensic
        investigation, including that in connection with danger to the
        public.

        As a matter of fact we had already offered our support to the Local
        Authority immediately after the disaster and scientists from the
        laboratory have already visited the site to assess what assistance
        they might give, although they would not of course do anything to
        disturb the evidence without the assent of the Coronerfe Officer.

        You told me that Lord Justice Taylor had it in mind to appoint an
        engineering assessor and it may be that he will wish, in due
        course, to indicate particular areas of concern to him.

        Meanwhile if you wish to discuss this offer of assistance or make
        any practicable arrangements may I suggest that you get in touch
        direct with Dr A E Jones, Director of the Safety Engineering
        Laboratory, Health and Safety Executive, Broad Lane. Sheffield.
        S3 7HQ. Telephone No. 0742 768141, Fax No. 0742 700313

The HSE is both willing and anxious to be of assistance to Lord
Justice Taylor in whatever way he wishes.




Yours sincerely




J D G Hammer.

Sometime          during          t hi s    time       the       turnstiles                9 and       10 w e r e         barriered            off

As    the    t i me     progressed               I became          g r a du-arrTy~~aware of a bui 1 d - u p                             of

supporters             outside          the      ground.           Th o u g h my             view      of       the    proceedings              was

limited          to w h a t       I could         see       through             the       turnstile.              As      the     c ro w d s

built       up    I became           conscious              of    people             having        difficulty               in e n t e r i n g

through          the    turnstile.                The       crush       outside             was       such       that       the

turnstiles,,            on    occasions,               were       unable             to    f un c t «rf5TT~p r o pe r 1 y , a n d

people were             being        injured           in the          turiisTiTe               pa s s a g e .        More      than      one

man     emerged         from       the      turnstyl^J^eiTT^double                              and    I saw          one    man

physically             sick.

Prom     t h ese       people        entering           the       ground             I began          to    understand             that

there       were       difficulties               outside          the          ground,          and       it w a s       about        this

time; that          I became            aware      of       people, b a n g i n g ,              shouting             outside          and many

appeared          to    be    kicking            and    banging             on the           concertina               gates.           Given

all     this      information               I formed             the    opinion              that      there          were      great

masses       of    people          outside,            although             I wa s         not     aware         of a n y       specific

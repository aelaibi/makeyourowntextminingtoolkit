 PC falls
 to death
 while
 tracking
 thieves
 A BRAVE p o l i c e m a n
 plunged to his death from a
 factory roof as he tracked
 burglars yesterday.
    PC Barry Saunders was
 called in at 7.15am to
 i n v e s t i g a t e a fa ct o ry
 break-in.
   He found a hole where
 thieves had smashed their

i Yorkshire Post Correspondent
 way in and scrambled on
 to the roof above at the
 u n i t in R o t h e r h a m ’s
 T h ornhil 1 indu st ria 1
 estate.
     PC Saunders, 31, a mar­
 ried man with two chil­
 dren, recovered stolen pro­
 perty, t h en continued
 searching on the roof.
     As he scoured the top of
 an adjoining empty unit in
 semi-darkness he lost his
 footing and erashed
 through a skylight on to
 th e concrete floor 30ft
 below;
   ; His body was discovered
 by o t h e r officers who
 rushed to the scene when
 radio contact was lost.
     The di vi s io na l com­
 mander at Rotherham,
 Chief Supt Terry Wain,
 said: “We are deeply sad­
 dened and shocked by the
 tragic death of such a keen
 and enterprising officer.
     "Barry was devoted to




        ‘Keen officer’
 his duties and his death
 has shocked us all.”
   A spokesman for South
 Yorkshire Police said: “PC
 Saunders was a young
 police officer doing his
 duty in a thoroughly pro­
 fessional manner. The
 coroner has been
 informed. •■"K
   “While on the roof he
 began conducting a
 thorough examination and
fell through the skylight of
 an unoccupied unit.’
   PC Saunders’s wife and
children were not at their
Ro th erh am home, but
were being comforted by
relatives.
   He joined the force in
January 1987 and was sta­
tioned at Main Street,
Rotherham.
   The thieves are still
being hunted by police.
   PC Saunders plunged to
his death on the day his
wife, Alison, celebrated
her birthday, it was re­
vealed last night.
   Before breaking down in
tears, Mrs S a u n d e r s ’s
mother said: “It is Alison’s
28th birthday today — but
we are just too upset to
think about anything.” -
   Another relative added:
“We are just too upset to
talk about it.”
  PC ifiaunders’s children
are H e a th er , fiv e , and
Philip, three. Before join­
ing fhe police force he
worked* as a nyner.        >s

The front areas            of the    centre   pens were     cleared and I saw what            I

thought was        part of a barrier          having been broken and was l yi ng on the

track.        Howe ve r    this    could have been a piece of hording.                 The   pitch

was   finally      cleared of the dead and            injured and the         crowds    Ifft the

stadium

There were        isolated        reports of fighting b e tw ee n rival         supp o rt er s    in

the H i l l s b o r o u g h Park area but nothing untow ar d and supp or te rs went

quickly home.             A m e ss ag e had earlier      been passed that the Liverpool

supporters were to be treatd w it h s ym pa th y and u nd erstanding.

I remained        in the Police Control           unti1 approximately          10.30 pm that

evening a t t em p ti n g     for m uc h of the time to         relay m es sa ge s     t# the

N o r t h e r n General     Hospital      (officers on duty there PC S(3St2 F l e t c h e r ).

I was then i nf ormed             I was   required to attend a m e et i ng at HQ.            On

l e av in g   the boK      I went    to the gym na si um where      I saw a number $f

Se ni or O ff icer*        including the Chief Constable,             Hr. Wr ig ht     plus many*           j

m a n y officers dealing w it h the             lines of d ec eased on t h e gymttasium

floftr. I then saw Ch. Supt.                Nesbit and informed him that 1 w o u l d b»                ;

f oi ng to H«y        H e stated that a m e et i ng at that time of n i gh t a f t & r

such a day was            pointless.       I am aware     that he sought th« a dv ic e of                   ;

the Chief C o n s t a b l e on this matter and he             informed me the meeting

woilld not; ..go-ahead.

I have always         h el d the belief and still           do that the / S#F;G s t a d i u m is

as WEL L P O L I C E D as any ground in th© country and is M U C H §ETTER

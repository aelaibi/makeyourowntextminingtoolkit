STATEMENT FROM MR T HICKS - HILLS BOROUGH DISASTER 15.4.89.
Myself, my wife and 2 daughters obtained our tickets from Anfield

with thy 2 girls getting standinq tickets on vouchers from thoir
Xop Season Ticket.    My wife was allocated a seat ticket, and I

myself was given a standing ticket, - by the allocation based on

the Main Stand Season Ticket Serial Number allocation.



We travelled together in my c<ti; to Sheffield making only 1 stop at

the Wooda 11 Servians juct after Junction 30 on the M1.      We then

proceeded along the M1 and followed the Police signs at the first

junction/ asking us to proceed to the next,     We encountered a long

tailback   (1-2   miles   in nearside lane)but I continued in the

centre lane towards the front of the queue, where I was able to

leave the motorway aown tile dual carriageway section of the slip

road. (Time approximately 12.10 pro).    We then followed the signed

route to Hillsborough and when.       got to the Ground, I travelled

along the A61 Penistone Road towards the city until I was able to

turn round and return to the car park which was being provided in

the corner of the large park between the A61 Penistone Road and the

A616 Parkside Road.   We parked the car at approximately 12.45 pm

and we had the picnic lunch which we had brought with us.



At about 1 .40 pm we left the car, walked along Parkside Road to the

Leppings Lane end and arranged to rendezvous with my wife outside

ths small tobacconists to the loft of the approach area.      In the

bridge approach area,     I would   estimate   perhaps 6 - 10 Police
Officers were present (no Police horses) and it was all fairly cg.lm
with only small numbers of fans milling around.



.:>3t>v3en the car and arrival at the turnstiles, we were asked by
about 3 people if '.<•* had ■eniy oyctia tickets - normal tor such a big
game.



Other than in the approach area,         I only remember seeing Police

Officers (2 or 3) near a small Police kiosk on Parkside Road.               I

do not remember sssiiiy any mounted Malice at all.



At about 1 .55 pm, my 2 daughters and I w^nt through tho turnstiles,
our tickets being taken, split and the "retain” section returned.

Upon entering the yard beyond, I remember small numbers of people

milling around, with 1 Policeman near our turnstile and perhaps 1 -

2 more in the yard area.      There were about 2 - 3         stewards in the

qeneral area plus 2 nailing p w i y .        to the loft of tho tunnel.



The   "standing"   sign   above   the   tunnel   was   the    only   guidance

visible/given to us and there was no indication that it was not the
only way to hhn t-nrraoea. My ct*uyhLwi.& piwwj'J'jd down the tunnel,

and I bought 2 programmes from the venders to the left of the

tunnel.



X wanted a cup of coffee and observed a refreshment kiosk to tho
right of the tunnel - I believe under the stairway into the seating
area,      X queued for a few minutes and purchased my cup of coffee.
If. was this act that enabled me to                                 1L w<-!=> possible to go around
the base of the West Stand into the corner Terraccc between the

West and South Stands,              This area was sparsely occupied with a wide

choice of positions, X took up a position about 2nd barrier froin
th e           in   front7 n f   Hir**- r i t J u d l J U j h t   tow er   &na   t*   F.IV-.    Ir-.fl    tiT   tW

Police box. (Sap. exhibit. A),                    X ctood in this position drinkina ruv

coffee, reading tho programme and listening for Team news etc on

the small transistor radio I had in my pocket.



A little before the Kick-off,                        (approximately 14.50 ors, I noticed

there were large numbers of people in the centre sections {I now

understand these to be known as Pens Numbers 3 and 4).                                                   From my

position on the terrace,                  I could quite clearly see the dividing

fence and could see several people crushed against this side fence,

many clearly in some distress.                          One in particular, an old ttan, I

believe wearing a light grey coat or possibly suit, had his ey-.ir,

closed.        People were being pulled from the rear of the Pens up into

the    seating area         of the West Stand.                         Peopl e wore             also being

pulled/assisted          over     the dividing                    fence    and    some         youths       were

scrambling          over     the        pitch              side      fence       but           were        being

repelled/arrested by Police Officers on the pitch.



a   stjiiiyr   Police v t t x e e r was standing on the landing of the Police

Box, I would estimate some 10 feet away from my position and I

called several times to him trying to attract his attention to the


                                                       3
crushing,    (I believe he had gold braid on the peak of his cap and
was wearing a light coloured anorak).              He ignored me completely and

            to   observe tho         oocne   for soat* iwitiuLwa until          Us walked

down the steps and round the segregation to*crier underneath the

South Stand,     (I believe he was the Officer who ran onto the pitch

and told the Referee to stop the game some few minutes later).



A television cameraman with a shoulder held video camera (I think

the r>OA fihnwn in Kvhibi. t "I11) took up a eimilar                            byl u£fe*sr

many shouts from the crowd (and possibly some coin throwing) he
then left the landing and went back under the South Stand,



Another Police Officer who I believe I can recognise facially (I

believe to have had black braid on the peak of his cap) took up a
similar position        on    tho    atapc./landing.        I    again       implored   him

several times that people were being crushed and couldn’t he do

svjia«Lliluy to help.        Me initially ignored ‘3s and then after say 3
of 4 calls to him,            looked down at me and said ’’Oh,                  shut y u m

fucking   rattle",      and     then    continued      to   look       in    the   general
direction of Pone 3 and 4.



Both myself      and    the    man     standing   on   my       left   were     ext r-'iiiely

concerned as X knew this was roughly where my daughters were and

this man said he had a son in the sane section.                             More and more

people were beginning to climb out of the section and I became

increasingly conceraod for my daughters’ safety.
The game had just kicked off and a Police cordon of 2 - 3 men deep
were put in an arc around the 2 central Pens behind the goal and

it was obvious that their purpose was to prevanfc anybody climbing

over   the   barrier.   It   is my belief   that   several   people were

actually held back and -.ill the signs were that the Police Officers

had been given instructions to contain the people within the Pen

*!.■«*. Officers along the fence appear«d to be pushing people bii.uk,

whereas their colleagues standing in the arc were just standing

watching, many with their arms crossed.     I would estimate this took

place for some 5 - 1 0 minutes, bringing the time to approximately

15.05 - 15.10.



It was during this ti^e that the Officer in the light coloured

anorak ran onto the pitch &:Vl .--.poke to the Referee, whereupon the
gaTio was efcoppod. (X know thio to be 15.0C).



I also noticed a large number       (100 - 150 approximately)     Police

Officers emerged ffjL’vift Lh« opposite corner and they took up lines

across the pitch at the "centre” and along the North Stand.



I started to move down the terraces towards the side fence to try

to find my daughters and to render what assistance I could.

As I got approximately half way down, I saw the limp form of my

youngest daughter Victoria,      being passed over the barrier.        I

therefore    changed direction   to the pitch access gate       from my

section (which was manned by a Policeman) and pushed my way onto
the pitch.



I   came upon my 2 daughters Victoria .md Carah, laid. on the pilch
juet at tho tou<?hlin* nlitfht 1* In i1><- rlijht of the goal.          :»ara»i v;as

receiving assistance        from 1 man and he,           myself plus    2 others
started to render mouth to mouth resuscitation to both of them.

One of the men attending to Sarah called for suction (I have since

discovered tnat this was Dr C K Flenley), whil<2- ws conr.inufifl f'n
resuscitate    my    daughters    I   nhoutetf my daughters            into thoir

ears and called to Police/Medics several times for suction but none

was available.        We then continued taking turns at mouth to mouth

resuscitation.        One man was called away to help a friend and it
therefore     left     myself    and     1    other   giving   mouth   to   wouth.

resuscitation on Victoria with Dr Flenley and a man in a chequered

shirt, {who was apparently an off-duty Policeman from the crowd)

rendering assistance to Gajrah.              Tht&re   was no medical equipment or

assistance Available to us throughout this time.                We conti.nued to

give mouth to mouth resuscitation, taking turns for some 10 minutes

or more, whereupon the first ambulance (the one trapped behind the

goal) tried to gAf. past us catching my too/;              I knelt and the foot
of sortcono *l 4»« laid on the pitch.



Thia flmhulanc* h^cl             up a ridiculous posit-iori wiLii LLs muv«sii«nL

onto/off the ground grossly impaired.             Presumably this was to avoid

cutting up the playing surface-
We continued to attempt to resuscitate «ay daughters for a few more
minutes when a fireman came over carrying an oxygen bottle with a

face mask attached (smoke-inhalation devina?) but this was no good

ci9 ws could not yeL ch<j gitiss to breath unaided and the oressurs

in the bottle/regulator was insufficient to force oxygen into their
lunge.



A second ambulance came onto the pitch area and stopped adjacent

to us.    We agreed to put Sarah and Victoria into this ambulance.

Two of us put Victoria into this second ambulance and were about

to turn around and lift Sarah into it, when a third group of people

put in a man who had to go onto the floor.      I then was faced with

t:ie awful choice of leaving Sarah, wlvj x '^ds assured would be

placed in the next ambulance which was apparently coming.



The ambulance started to move away so I rejoined Victoria and along
with a PC.1926 MnGuinn^ss, rr>.o5;inusd to giva mouth to mouth.



in the ambulance was the ambulance attendant, a woman, myself and

PC McGi,iin<?ss,   There was a young man in hie 20's on the floor, who

did in fact have a throat tube in his mouth, but the ambulance man

said was dead within a minute or so of us driving off.             The

Ambulance Attendant and the woman attended a person on the other

seat, but he was also pronounced dead by the ambulance man.        The

ambulance man and myself continued artificial respiration with PC

McGuinuess holding an oxygen bottle and we continued throughout the
time it took uc to rcach th« Northern General Hospital.                 The
ambulance man was of the opinion he felt a faint pulse on a couple

<->f ■'uTcasions during this journey.



Victoria was then taken straight into the Casualty section and

because   they   thought   there   was   possibly   some   life,   received

immediate medical attention from a team of Doctors and Nurses aided

by PC McGulnness*    I observed for some 2 or 3 minutes, whereupon

I was asked to leave the area and was taken into a side room.

Obviously conditions were extremely hectic with people and bodies

arriving very quickly.     The Hospital was well equipped and I was

given the impression that all possible care was being taken with

people who were believed to have a chance.



After about 10 minutes, I was informed by PC McGuinness that my

daughter had been pronounced dead.       I thanked PC McGuinness for his

assistance and also cipologised for the verbal abuse I had poured

upon him as a representative of the Police throughout our time in

Thn ambulance and at the Hospital.        Once I was lold that Victoria

was dead, I then went around the Hospital Living to locate Sarah

on the grounds that I had been told she would be in an ambulance
following closely behind.



After some 30 minutes of futile searching,          I was taken to the

Physiotherapy Department by a Psychiatric Nurse <                     ) who

had come on duty to help with the problems.          I was kept i.n this
area for some half to three quarters of an hour and on a couple of
occasions                    tried to establish whether Sarah was indeed

at this Hospital or not.         Eventually, I was taken round to the

fiftot.ion of the Hospital whore the bodies of Uie deceased were being

attended to.      I gave a description of Sarah to the Police Officers
on duty     and   it appeared that     they had "a young un-identified

female” who could possibly have been the Sarah.              A Police Officer

went into the room and brought out a Swatch watch which I felt at

the tim« wfl? tho cana as trhAt .of my d*uyhfcer Sarah.          After about

10 or 15 minutes, I was taken across to the Hospital Mortuary to

identify who I expected to be Sarah.         It is now a matter of record

that this was indeed Victoria who somehow had become detached from

her label when X at first           identified her on admission to the

Hospital.      Despite the unnecessary distress this caused to aie

personally    I did    not   feel   bitter   towards   the    Hospital   as   I

considered they were attempting to cope with the extreme pressure
that was put upon them.



Myoclf,                  ctnd d Reverend returned to cne main Hospital

building and I was retained for perhaps another half an hour or so.

Throughout this time, I was trying to establish the location of ray

wife and Sarah.       I explained again that Sarah’s condition was

obviously serious when we were on the pitch and                 that she was

supposedly "in the next ambulance".           I was then told that some

casulaties had been taken to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and

that Sarah could be there (as could my wife).
 Communications       were   difficult       and   evorbody,   both   medical    and
 administrative, were at full stretch and all              telephone   limes were

 jammed,      I was    told that   11    people were dead at the Northern

general Hospital and that          no other females were there.           Further

discussions took place and         it was agreed that Ishould go to the

Hallamshire Hospital and if my wife arrived at the Northern General
nospii*if x woula De contacted and she would not be told about
Victoria's death until I returned to meet her.



A t about 6 o'clock, I was taken by a young female Padre
           and                  to tho             HaHamahire Hospital.         Hoon
arrival,     I gave a full description to the staff and they then

circulated i._ to see whether Sarah had indeed been admitted.                      I
had to wait in thf» genoral reception                  £ur some time, attended

initially b y _____________ |a nd nurses from the Hallamshire Hospital.

At one point,     a man in a suit            stood on a desk and called for

attention.     He read out a list o£ ’'patients” who had been taken to

che Northern vJpn^ral Hospital,               called out Victoria's name and
as I knew sne was dead, I broke down and began to cry,



A nurse took me into a side room and triod to consol* mu and

assured me they were attempting to locate Sarah and that some

people had bean taken to Barnsley Hospital.                t said I suspected
the worst because of Sarah's condition on the pitchJ

A Police Officer also took f u U details of th® location of my car

and my wife       assured me he would try to locate and re-unite me

                                        10
with my wife before she was advised of the death of Victoria.



At about 19.45,       I received a message to say that my wi£« had

arrived at the Northern General Hospital and I was then taken back

there by a "Cruse Couneellor”        (I                            in her car.

At approximately 20.00 hours, my wife and I were re-united in the

foyer oC the Northern General Hospital, where I was appalled to

find she had been advised of the death of Victoria had been refused

permission to see her body and had been told I was with a female

at the Hallamshire Hospital whom she had assumed was Sarah.                    She

was distraught when I was unable to confirm Sarah's whereabouts.




I made formal protests to both Hospital and Police Authorities ana

demanded our rights to see our child.           After some 5 or 10 minutes

we were advised by the Assistant Matron that our daughter's body

was no longer on the Hospital premises, and at police instructions,

had been taken back to the Hillsborough Ground.



I   pro tetter!    -tbrongly   at   this    callous   and   unnecessary       act,

especially as I had already identified her twice, latterly at rest

in the hospfcial mortuary.           My protestations were met by off­

handedness    by    the Police Officer        (who claimed    it   was   at    the

Coroners instruction) and sympathetically by the Assistant Matron

(who had     tear filled eyes).           We ware advised that there were

"several un-identified people at the ground” and we should return
there.



Nobody advised us how many casualties/bodies we could expect to

find, no transport was offereed and we were left to make our own
way there.



In the accompaniment of a                            and

            ______________ drove us .back to Hillsborough in his car,
whereupon we arrived at the entrance to the Gynasia'-n/Temporary
i’lortuary at approximately 22,00 hours.          We were refused entrance

by an extremely callousr rude and unbelievably insensitive Police

Officer in charge on the gate.       He was a Hanking Officer (I believe

Inspector)    and    regretfully,   I did not take         his name.       He was

totally callous      to ttiy wife and I and this canbe borne out by the

2 independent       witnesses   aforesaid.      After considerable         heated

argument with him,      I compromised,    agreed to        go to fch« park and

collect my car,      whereupon he would then allow us access upon our
return.



The 4 of us plus a Police Constable walked back along Penistone

Road fco the corner of the park where T di«!covar<*d tho gato vaa

Still open and my Granada C-3X wfjf?         ."inly c»n<6 x.1wua i.n 1ng on the car

park.     We then drove back to the Ground gates and parked outside.




Further remonstratiotic with aforesaid Polica Officer took place and


                                     12
we were again refused admission.            In addition he upset my wife
further by saying we had no rights in the matter, that the girls

were the property of. the Coroner, and would have to undergo a Post

Mortem.      His attitude to us, and handling of us, was unbelievably

callous.     I wish to make a formal complaint about this Officer when

he can be identified.     I gave my business card to a Norwegian Press

Photographer who took photographs during my remonst rat ions with the

Police Officer.      Should I receive contact from him, then I will

make these available.          The best that the Police Officer could do

was to offer for us to sit in a Police van for 30 minutes.              This

I refused to do and said that I insisted that having been sent

there by the Hospital, knowing full well 1 daughter was dead and

suspecting the fate of the other, I demanded to be allowed access*

After a few minutes, two CID Officers (aged in their mid 30's with

one in a brown leather jacket) took charge of the situation and

•guided my wife, myself and our 2 Social Worker colleagues into an

anteroom.     This Officer is to be commended for his handling of an

extremely difficult situation.        He did explain that the formalities

were not quite completed and he did so in a sensitive and caring

manner.



After suuie 10 or 15 minutes wait, we were shown into a room at the
si dp   of   fcho gymnasium,    and   nnkr.d     vi«w   aora*   01   PulaiuiJ

photographs which wf‘
                    .re pinned to a board.          My wifio caid "Oh, my

God, how can there be          so many dead!" he replied "I’m afraid     that

this isn’t the end of it, T.nve".

                                       13
We quickly    identified     Lh« photograph of our youngest daughter
Victoria,    bat   initially    were    unable   to   see    that    of   Sarah.

Naturally, we hoped at this time she ;nay have been a survivor and

at one of the other Hospitals.           We were asked to look again and

whereupon we found what we beleived to be the photograph of our
elder daughter (Reference No «4).            Ayai'i !.h« fim Officer In the

brown jacket asked U3 would we please wait Coi" a few tuinut«« and

would we prefer our daughters bodies to be brought out together or

Independently.       My wife and I requested that they be brought out

together.     This    was   carried    nut   with a reasonable degree         of

sensitivity and formal        identification of our         2 daughters     took
plaaft.      ng fclv; ixieiiLiClvaLiwn, :uy wi£« saddled boLli and noticed

that Sarah’s body was Still warm - nailing out "She's still warm -
 are you sure she’s dead!".       I consolled her but also noticed the

distinct difference between Victoria’s body and Sarah*a.



After a few minutes to say our farewells to our 2 daughters we were

ushered to a series of tables set up at one end of the gymnasium,

whereupon we were interviewed by, T believe 2 male and 2 female

Police Officers, and I was asked to swear out a statement.                    We

also took receipt of tho poroonal e£€cefe9 of Viet*ri& whidh v*ei«

in a white plastic baq from the Hospital.



At the same time, I gave a description of a brown leather jacket
(Amoriocm Flyer type) that C&irah had been rfesnrii'iy      ujjuu   wwLiy Lu Lhy

Ground huh was not wearing when I last saw her on tho pitch.               After


                                       14
some    10   - 15 minutes delay,       (coinciding with           the time I was
Gvo-arinef out the *fea.fc^mcAt) Lhc             was retrieved and returned

to us.       Upon examination, of the pockets, all of Sarah’s personal

f.'hfftnts. mnnpyj rhe^na book, wallofc, a ^ v d o ,     Jsujs-               I.R.

appeared to be intact.         We therefore took possession of the jacket
and signod the ncccoaary form* Iujl the Pulicy Officers.                   ay wife

and I were given a cup of tea and the Social Workers escorted us
from tho Mortuary,



We were given offers of accommodation from various Clergy and the

2   Social     Workers   but   expressed    a   desire   to       return   home   to
Middlesex.      A half nc-arted prowise o t a Police d-iver to drive us
back wac made but I declined                prnfprrp^ to driv® rayeolf.           My

wife and I returned home, arriving home at some 2.30 am Sunday

morning.      Following release at lunch time of the first casualty

list which contained the narttes of our 2 daughters *s<iong 14 others,

we were inundated with telephone calls and visits from the Press.

It is questionable whether full address details should have been
given in that first casualty list.



I would summarsize my assessment of what I experienced as follows



1      The Ground/approach areas policing/stewarding was low key -

       even casual, with little guidance and control being excerted.

2      There are a limited number of turnstiles through which to go.

3      Once through the turnstiles, the only sign visible was a b o v e


                                       15
the tunnel, giving a natural inclination towards this route
in - especially if you were       in a hurry.
Police/Stewards failed to notice       the build up in thecentral

pens.

They did not distribute the      fans to the side areas.

Senior Officer ignored {and      many others) pleas to helpthose
in the central pens.

It was obvious the Police totally misread events - believing

a     pitch   invasion/trouble   was   underway     and   mounted    a
restraining rather than rescue operation.

The rescue commenced some 10 minutes too late and was totally

dis-organised,     - The    death toll being      much higher   as   a
consequence.

The    fences were   such   they prevented escape - evsn        with

assistance ovsr the top.

The single gate was oflittle use other      than to those in the

near vicinity and it was opened too late.

Medical .Assistance and equipment was inadequate/non-existant.

Ambulance/Fire assistance was far too late arriving.

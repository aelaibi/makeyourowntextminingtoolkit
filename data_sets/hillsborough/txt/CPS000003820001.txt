         HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - REQUESTS FOR STATEMENTS

         Thank you for your letter of 31 October 1989 advising us not to release
         statements at this time. I have noted your comments and have put a new
         policy into effect immediately.

        Attached to this letter you will find a letter from Hammond Suddards
        dated 3 November 1989 which is attempting to identify precisely where
        fatalities and serious injuries occurred. Of course, this will be
        primarily an issue for HM Coroner in Sheffield, but in the light of your
        letter of 31 October, I do believe a parallel can be drawn. Consequently,
        unless you have any comments to the contrary I intend to invoke a
        similar policy on non-release of material.  I will, therefore, write to
        Hammond Suddards to that effect once you have indicated to me that you
        agree that their request should be treated as if it were a request for a
        statement.

        I am also writing separately to HM Coroner, Dr Popper, and advising him
        of this policy in the meantime.  I feel sure that he will concur.

        I do believe that we will get a number of requests both from the
        plaintiffs and the four defendants to the civil action. I understand
        that the civil action will commence in Liverpool on 19 June next year,
        before an unidentified, as yet, High Court Judge. You may feel it
        appropriate that you or I ought to write to the legal representatives of
        those parties to the action and advise them of the policy whilst the
        criminal inquiry continues and up until a decision of the Director of
        Public Prosecutions or conclusion of any proceedings instituted.  I await
        your advice on this matter.

    Dear

    HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY
    REQUESTS FOR STATEMENTS

    Thank you for your letter of 24 October.  I have given careful
    consideration to the points which you raise on dealing with
    requests from witnesses for copies of their statements.

    I can quite understand the decision to supply statements upon
    request during the earlier phase of the enquiry.  However, I
    feel that there is a distinction to be drawn between the
    inquisitorial nature of Lord Justice Taylor's Public Enquiry
    and the full criminal investigation which is now being
    conducted.  I feel that such statements should remain the
    confidential "property" of the investigation and they should
    not be released until either after the end of any criminal
    proceedings or after the Director has reached a decision not
    to issue proceedings.

    If it is necessary, of course, there would be no objection to
    witnesses refreshing their memories from their statements in
    the usual way prior to giving evidence.

    I would, of course, be prepared to discuss this matter with
    you on the telephone and I would also be most interested to
    hear the response which you receive from the Police Complaints
    Authority.

     Dear Sir/

     Hillsborough

     On 20th October, we wrote to the Coroner, Mr. Popper, with a request
     for advance disclosure of certain information which will be relevant
     to the civil actions.

     One issue which has been raised is the extent to which injury or
     death may have been caused or contributed to by the collapse of a
     barrier in pen 3 of the Leppings Lane terraces.

    The question of precisely where fatalities and serious injuries
    occurred will be highly material evidence on this issue. Certain
    evidence on this point was presented to the Taylor inquiry, but
    considerable further progress in investigations will no doubt have
    been made by the West Midlands Police on behalf of the Coroner, so
    that the positions at which the great majority of the fatalities
    occurred could now be determined with considerable accuracy.

    Our unusual request of the Coroner reflected the unusual
    circumstances in this matter, because there seems to be every
    possibility that a civil trial will take place before inquests on
    the deceased are held. Certainly, directions have already been
    given in open Court by Mr. Justice Steyn in relation to the exchange
    of expert evidence, the precise nature of which will inevitably
    depend on where the majority of fatalities and injury occurred.   It
    is difficult to see how such evidence can be completed and exchanged
    without the relevant information.



                                                                                                                            /... contd.

  Our letter to the Coroner, Mr. Popper, did ask him to consider the
  position and let us know if we could approach the West Midlands
  Police with regard to this additional information. We did express
  that any information supplied to us would, of course, also be
  available to other parties in the civil action. We would also
  advise that our letter to the Coroner pointed out consent would also
  be required from the Director of Public Prosecutions, on whose
  behalf you are also conducting your investigations.

  Unfortunately, in response to our letter, we received, on
  26th October, a letter from the Coroner, Mr. Popper, stating that he
  did not, in any event, think it right that he should release or
  authorise release of the West Midlands files whilst the criminal
  investigation was under way.

  We would be obliged if you would advise us of any specific objection
  the West Midlands Police may have to the disclosure of this
  additional information.


  Yours faithfully,

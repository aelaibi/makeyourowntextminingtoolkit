we     climbed          onto        the     fencing         i t self.

I saw        t ha t     the     crowd was             pushed against                   the     fencing.            It w a s         obvious

t ha t      persons          were     badly         i n j u r e d , they were                 on    the    floor       behind            the

Together            with       other        o f f i c e r s we       began        to     pull       as    many     people           as

possible            over       the    top      of     the       perimeter           fencing.              T hey were           either

             stretcher           we     removed        one     body          from       the    pitch        to     the      gymnasium.                The

               been       taken from            them.      Their       general          mood and       behaviour          was       generally

good      but,      as    kick       off     time approached,                 it s o o n      became          apparent          that     a

lot     of    the    fa n s      had     been      drinking          heavily.

As     the    kick       of f    time ap proached,                by a bou t 2 . 3 0 p m           (1430),         there        was a

large        nunber       of     supporters             in the L e p p i n g s         L n a r e a a n d we w e r e

gradually           pushed         b a ck a g a i n s t       the w a ll     at    th e      turnstiles.                 There        was a

lot     of    confusion amongst                    the     f a n s as      to w h i c h      turnstiles            gave a cc es s

to     their      particular             area      of th e      ground,          it w a s     difficult            for     t h e m to

know which area                  they       had    tickets        for,      due    to       the    poor       indications

s h o w n at      th e    ground.            Several          of the       fans    were       in fa c t a d m i t t e d

through          the w r o n g       tunstiles           pure a n d        simply       to    try and           release         the

pressure          outside          the      ground.           I had       been    engaged          in the a r e a          in the

central          turnstiles            but    had       to m o v e    across       to       the    side       to a v o i d

being        crushed against                 the    turnstile             wall.        We    tried       to     encourage

t he    supporters              to m o v e    back and          form       some    sort       of       orderly queue              but

because          of the         sheer       numbers        involved         this was          not       possible.              The

situation           stayed         the      same    u n ti l    3.00pm        (1500)         by w h i c h       t im e    the

majority          of the         fans were          inside        the      ground and             shortly after                th e    kick

off     everyone          had ga ined ad mittance.                         We went          into       the    ground and              took

After        meal    was        completed,          p rior      to    the     e n d of       the       game,     we      took     up

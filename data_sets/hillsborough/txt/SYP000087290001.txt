We a r r i v e d   in S h e f f i e l d a bout 2.15        (1415)    - 2 - 3 0 pm (1430)         a nd the van

was     parked     in a car      park just o f f L e p p i ng s Ln.

I saw people drinking              from     cans    near to the ground,                 but as far as            I am

a ware       no one on our m inibus          had a n y t h in g a l c o h o l i c      to drink.

We all w a l k e d straight             down to the ground,             we    received no escort or

d i r ec ti on s   from the P olice a nd           I saw no d r u n k e n e s s , viol en ce          or

di so rde r .

I a r r i v e d at the     entrance        of the ground at a bout 2.40pm                     (1440).        I

knew w hi ch set of t u r ns ti le s             to use,       having    been there before.                 It was

just m a y h e m outside         the ground,        which       is n ot hing unusual            for that

ground,        it's a lways      the same.         It was       e very man for himself.                It

b ecame       quite a crush w i t h        peoplei tr/ying
                                                   trying to get               to the turnsti |/es.

I e v e n t u a l l y got t hr ou gh a t u r mist ii e at about 2 . 45pm                  (1445)./     I wasn't

in the        crush too    long.         There were P ol ic e        on hors eb ac k outVide               the

g round trying to sort             it out,        but w e r e n ’t succeeding.

■now his address,           he    is m                     friend,

O n e ntering       the g round         I handed my ticket           in a nd        retai ne d the     stub.

I i m m e d i a t e l y n oticed that       the/ a r e a      b eh in d the goal        in the L e p p i n g s L n

ter ra ci ng was       crowded,     wh er ea s     the sides were             empty.       T here were a

number       of surges     in that ar/ea,          but     I d o n ’t know the          cause of them,

P eo p l e    began to climb ouV«/of that a re a onto the                          pitch a nd e v en t u a l l y

 he q.ame was stopped.                  I realised that          the s it u at i on was         not   too good

w hen    I saw people        lying/on the          pitch a nd being            carried away,

liy friend,        Tony QWENiS,/ who        lives       in[          , came over to us from on

the     pitch a nd said            it             was    injured and had been carried away,

I then de ci de d to go on a n ^ s e e              what       I could do,

I went a nd found                       fi/rst and found him at the                   players    dyfei out.

getting        his    breath back.              I got him a drink        from a F o rr es t           fan and

gave    him my jumper              because       he was    cold.

T og et he r w it h T ony OWEN,                               and two of T o n y ’s f r i e n d s, we

carried                   to the first aid aVea,               then    I went      back to see what                else

I could do.

I h elped        carrV a number            of    people    up the     pitch?      the m a j o r i t y were

still       a li v e ^ / t h e r e was    only one who       I think was dead.                 He was       lying by

the goal         w ith    people     round him.           I c o u l d n ’t see his face,            he had a

coat over him and                 couldn't describe          the    rest of him.

This went         on for some            time    in fact    our mini     bus      party were          the    last to

leave the         pitch,      except       for one man sitting           by the goals.

By this        time we       realised G ary CHURC)4 w as m i ss i n g              so        we hung a r o u n d

looking        for him and then went                bacM? to the mini          bus.

D ur in g    the evening ws made                 various e n q u i ri e s a bo ut Gary and             repor te d

him mi ss in g at a P olice Stat ion.

At about m idnight we went                      down to the g ro un d t o see                ifwe could

recognise any             people from           photographs.                  /

'here were           three    of us w e n t ;                            C         S          jU     ■»»».

They saw a p ic t u r e and thought                   it was Gary,       it was Ng            14.    We were

then taken e ve nt u a l l y to see                the body.

                                                       I checked his          c l o t h i n q/ a nd knew he had

a green swea ts hi rt w ith his Liverpoo l                      a w a y s tr ip shirt          underneath,

which       t h i s- bo dy did and         I a sk ed the O ff ic er      if he had been w e ar i n g

w hite R ee bo k         trainers w i t h a blue stripe,              which       he said he had,             from

that    I was able           to    i dentify the body as G a ry CHURCH./

I have k nown G ary for about a year and knew him t hr o ug h o </r football

team,       he sometimes           played for us.           I know he        lived      in                   next to

the                       with his        parents.

W hi ls t    in the g round          I did not see the             c o n su m pt i on of any a lc ohol

a nd   I did not w itness any                   criminal    offences.

             The i^-o1 i ce , whilst      dealing w it h the      incident,       just   d i d n ’t seem to know

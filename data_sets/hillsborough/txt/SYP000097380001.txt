I am also aware                  that       some       of y o u r    officers         are    still        off     d u t y s-i'ck,

To       save     time,       therefore,           I have        taken      the      l i b e r t y of     copying          this

 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I have now been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord Justice Taylor to request
from a selected number of your officers their recollections in writing, of
what happened at H i l l sborough on 15th April 1989. The criterion for
selection is based on an examination of your operation order which identifies
those police officers who were likely to be at Leppings Lane end, both
inside and outside the ground. Counsel are keen to obtain a
cross-section of accounts well before 15th May 1989 when the Hearings begin.

 I would like to make arrangements with your liaison officer to receive as
 many written submissions as possible. There will be no need for u;y officers
 to see yours personally, although a proof of continuity will be necessary
 but I would hope this could be easily achieved through your liaison officer.

 I am also aware that some of your officers are still off duty sick, which
 might present pratical difficulties. I would like to stress that
 Counsel's request through me is not intended to add to any distress that
 some may be suffering. Consequently, I leave it to your discretion to
 manage this aspect as you see fit". The Police Federation will also have
 an interest and may be contemplating obtaining legal advice on an individual
 or collective basi.3, or both. To save time, therefore, I have taken the
 liberty of copying this letter to them for their information.

The invitation to submit written recollections follows the same criteria as
for the senior officers before; in that there will be no interviews, just ■.
requests to w h i c h the officer will be free to decide what he or she wishes
to d o . ' In supplying any w r it t en*submission the officer will be free to
keep a copy.

I hope this is of assistance to you. If there Is anything further you
need to know please do not hesitate to contact me, .In order to progress,
and in anticipation of your support, I have asked my Superintendent Taylor
at Purniva.l House to contact Chief Superintendent Don Denton on the
m o r ni n g of Mo n da y 8th May 1989 to discuss arrangements.

    T h an k i n g you once again in anticipation of smooth liaison, which I
    might add has been excel l e nt to date.


    Yours sincerely

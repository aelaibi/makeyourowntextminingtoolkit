            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER, SATURDAY 15.4.89 <150489)



            Sam (0800)        At Sam (0800) on the above date I started duty at West

                              Bar Police Station.                   Following

                                                                             PAGE    2

                  Hillsborough from the Station and I noticed that all

                                                    ith supporters.



                  arms around



2pm (1400)       At 2pm (1400)    I arrived at Hillsborough and met up

                 with the rest of my Serial       in the gymnasium.



2.30pm (1430) - Together with Serial       I had my meal   in the gym.



2.50pm (1450) - At this time I asked PS KNIGHTS            it was O.K to go
                                           /
                  up into the main North Si/and.     /I
                                                 / / Ha ag re e d .   I went

                 alone into North Stand i/p tjpfe steps into the
                                                      \  y-
                 entrance way where s t e ^ r / s were checking tickets

                  stubs of Liverpool    fans'.   There was no other

                  police presence here at all.       I looked to my

                  right and could see that the Leppings Lane end

                 was full, mainly behind the goal and the crowd

                 was swaying violently as they chanted.          As I

                 watched the terrace was getting more packed by

                  the second.



2.55   (1455)    At 2.55pm (1455)     the entrance where I was

                  standing was now jam-packed with Liverpool          fans

                  trying to get seats.      There were now 2 stewards

                 attending to tickets,      but still no police.        I

                  had to sort out several heated arguments as

                  people tried to get in and push up the entrance,



3.03   (1503)   - At this point the crowd was nearly all        in their
                                                                                    PAGE    3
                                                                                    S3534

                  seats and the match was underway.



3.06   (1506)   - At this point I looked towards the Leppings

                  Lane end and I could see that there was some

                  kind of disturbance behind the goal area,                 I

                  jumped down from the front of the stand and

                  onto the perimeter track.            At this moment   I

                  knew something was wrong, a pitch invasion I

                  thought.       Nothing was coming over my radio at

                  this point.           I then saw a senior officer run

                  onto the pitch towards the referee.             I began to

                  run onto the pitch from the North Stand towards

                  the Leppings Lane goal.            I could now see fans

                  coming from behind the goal and over the

                  fence.      As they came onto the pitch they were

                  collapsing on the grass.            I came across a

                 young man next to the goal            posts.   I asked him

                 what was wrong as he was clutching his chest.

                 He stated that he was an asthmatic and that he

                  had been crushed in the crowd.            I gave him my

                  ventolin inhaler which seemed to help him.                    I

                  then went behind the goals and could see that

                 all the Liverpool fans were pushing and

                  falling forwards towards the wire.             Many were

                  t rapped with their faces          pressed hard u^f ^ga in st

                  the wire fence.           The crowd were now sc^amyjfng            ^

                  and m o a n i n g .    I saw that the small qatfe /aVt_J»^en

                  opened behind the goal,          however the mtfftbers of

                  people pushing meant that those behind the gate

                  just fell forwards with people lying on top of
                                                                       PAGE
                                                                       S3534

     them.        None could hardly move.         I helped to try

    and pull them cl ea r, but it was hard as they had

    become stuck.           More officers arrived here to help

    so I returned to the/fence behind the goal.

    There        I saw P C 7 4 7 / L A W S «/7 Together with him we

     climbed onto the c d r \/r £ te wall and up the blue

    fence.         I was now stafding/£>ver the crowd and

     could see that some of the faces had stopped

    screaming and were lifeless.               Their faces were

    turning blue in front of my eyes.                 Most had their

    mouths open and I saw one youth with blood coming

    from his nose, mouth and ears.                He looked to be

    dead.        People were vomitting everywhere,            the stench

    was getting stronger.              In company with PC LAWS we

    tried to help those at the front of the fence who

    were trapped,          by leaning over from the top and

    offering out our arms.              People sfjcmt^d at us to

    help them n e x t .        We manag/d tq/puj^i three people

    from the mass over the ffencjg.^/ T h a others who

     pleaded were stuck and wwr couldn' tXjjiOve them.                 I

    was pleading to the crowd to move backwards.                      As I

    did I saw one man run from the back,                 over the

    bodies,        standing on them and climbed over the fence

    himself.         He was in no danger from where he had come

    from.         MyseIf and PC LAWS pulled at the fence

    frantically,          but it would not, giva/’w ^ y .     I then saw

    a young woman at the front; of tfare fenfce.               She had

     long blonde hai r , w a s ^ynin and1 in her U w e n t i e s . /

    She was not moving but stl.il/had colour TTTner

                                    to get some response.        She was that close to the

                                    fence that I managed to blow into her mouth and

                                    nose.     As I tried 1 could see her slowly turning

                                    blue and her lips purple.         I saw her suddenly

                                    shudder and presume die.         I then moved back to the

                                    gate where a lot of people had been moved.              I went

             Further to my recollections of the Hillsborough Disaster which I have

             recently submitted.

             When I first went to the fencing which divides the pitch from Pens 3

             and 4 of the           ground I saw amongst the crowd a female with blonde hair,

             it was long hair.           She was right up against the fencing.           I could     see

             she was thin           and appeared to be in her twenties.

             The girl was           not moving but she had colour       in her face.The time         then

             would be about five past three             (1505).    The football match was still

             being played and a Senior officer was running onto the pitch towards

             the referee.

The girl on the photograph who I           understand        is Ingar SHAjfl, is in

exactly the same position on the           phiot^rgraph as when I saw her in                just

to the right of gate 3 in Pen 3.

I have also viewed             F oot age   and at Video Tape             (Reference         MAP7)

(Exh           ) Time Reference    15.27.07.21          is a sequence showing a police

    ficer, whose identity I d o n ’t know,         carrying a girl         in his a r m s

across the pitch.      I recognise the clothing and the girls hair.                         This

is the girl     I have made reference to at the front of Pen 3,                     Ingar SHAH,

I was one of the officers who climbed on the fencing and assisted

injured fans to climb out of pen 3, over the fencing, and onto the

jp it c h .

Having completed this I joined other police officers who formed a

chain at gate 3.      We passed several bodies out from the gate along the

  chain where they were handed to other officers.
                                                    1'            1
One of the bodies I passed back in the chain was Ingar SHAH.
                                               **                   -
I have today v iewed a p h o t o g r a p h t h e clothing worn by Ingar SHAH on

15th April     1989 (150489)   (Ref NA2)     (Exh            ).       I recognise the grey

sweatshirt and the Liverpool Football Club scarf as being the same as

those worn by the girl     I have previously made reference to.

I have viewed a mortuary photograph              (Ref         ) (Exh               ) of Ingar

SHAH,     the photograph is of poor quality but the face is similar to the

face of Inqar SHAH as I remember           it.

As far as dealing with any other deceased is concerned I have viewed

Video and Photographs but am unable to identify any of them.

          q     At     the   time        of     t hi s      happening             there      were        a     l a rg e    number       of p e op l e

                b e h i n d me       and       I was        being          pushed       by the      mass          of      spectators          s t ill

                trying        to     get       in.         If    the       operator          had    not        allowed        this       person           through

                th e     turnstile             it w o u l d       have       caused a             considerable               delay       whilst           he

                ostricated              himself            from       the    turnstile             and       back      into       the    mass        of     p e ople.

                W h e n we        got    to     our        seats       in the       N Stand             we     found       that     they       were

                already           occupied           by o t h e r          people.           This       wa s     after       the    game       h ad       been

                halted.            We    stated            to    these       people          that       they      were       occupying           ou r       seats

                and      they      said        "Okay"           and    moved       for       us    to    sit       down.          There       wa s    no

                argument           and     I go t          the    impression             t h at     people           without        tickets           h ad

                gained        ac cess          to    the        N Stand       area.

                the      fans      on   t h e ^ ^ i t c h to be c l e a r e d a n d                     for      the      game     to    continue,

                Another           m a n t u r n e d a r h ^ h i t hi^rn a n d t h e n                   other        people        intervened               and

                split        the     two.           T he    a g g r e ^ o r \ex plai n e d              that      his      son was        on     the

                Leppings           Ln    terrace            and       he w as      obviously             concerned            for       his    son's

                safety.            This        statement              by    the    man       effectively               calmed       the       situation.

                This     happened              at    about        3.17       (1517       hrs>       or       3.18      (1518       hrs)       and     even         I

                w a s n ’t f u l l y a w a r e             as    to    what       was    happening              on     the    pitch.

                This      incident             could        probably          have       been       prevented              by a     loudspeaker

                announcement               explaining                 to    the    fans       exactly           what       w as    happening.                  I

                can't        describe           either           of    th e m e n       involved and                 I wouldn't           recognise

                them     again.

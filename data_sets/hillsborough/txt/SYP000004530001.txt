                           Hi 1lsborough,     Sheffield.




           Sheffield Wedrf        ay Foot

           basis and always work the WeVt Stand which is my regular post for all

           match days.



           I am not first aid trained however                 I am aware of the Club's emergency

           and evacuation procedures and policy.



           At 11.10 am (1110 hrs)            on Saturday 15 April,       1989 (150489)            I attended

           She f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football Club in m y c a p a c i t y as a Steward,          on
                                                                                      PAGE

arrival all Stewards assemble                   n the^West Stand and we received a

briefing as to our duties from a Senior Police O f f i c e r , who I do not

know by name,         concerning the Liverpool -v- Nottingham Forest game which

was to take place later that afternoon.


                                                             GfAT«65    •
    that day I was posted to the emKrQency exit West Stand near to the

Po 1 i c e x o n t r o 1 box,    I took up "th^t position at about          11.30 am (1130

and were standing in the West Stand e n c l osur es.



My duties during that game was to ensure that no person used the

emergency exit without authorisation however this particular gate                         is

never    locked in my e x'p*<i e n c e 1 have never seen the exit in use.


                                                                 se<
From this position I had a clear and unobstructed view of enclosures

T^to" 7 West StandU^Btri^jiot of the Leppings Ln entrance.



I r e m i n d a/l this post and the West Stand seating area and enclosures

s lowly^-Ti lied with Liverpool            fans throughout the afternoon.           Whilst

at my post I did not see any alcoholic drink being consumed within

th£\around or any crowd disturbances 'however, a v approximately £.30

pm (1430 hrs)         H
                 was noti ceable that e nclosures 3 and 4 immVdiately

behind the goal wens, full to capacity and that the remainder   , 2, 6

and 7 v e r e    not,     in my opinion enclosures 1 and 2 were half full.                I

could see people sat down reading                 programmes and enclosures 6 and 7

were two thirds full.



Also at this time ^l^noticeo\severa1 Liverpool                  fans climbing out from

enclosures 3 and 4 inVq the adjoining                 pens and I saw one or two being

lifted from the terraces                           ancr a b o v e , from previous

                                                                                      S453
       experience with Liverpool       fans I assumed that they were attempting to

       get a better view of the game,       there was no activity by Police

       Officers and other S t e w a r d s to make me suspicious       that there were any

       problems.



       I would say that at that time there was no panic or alarm from the

       fans   in enclosures 3 and 4 and it appeared as normal^



^vv\
 A     At aboutxjg^45 pm ( 1445 h r s ? 1 noti ced that a large number of fans

       were still arr iv ing and entering     into enclosures        1 and 2 I looked

       across and had a side view of the tunnel           entrance    I coul d n’t see a

       great deal of m o v e m e n t , fans were not filtering across      into the

       adjoining side enclosures.



       The fans already in enclosures 3 and 4 did not appear to be in any

       danger or experiencing any problems           I could hear only football       songs

       and cheering.



       I wriust have been about 3 pm\Al50Q h r s ) because        Iwas    aware that the

       game had begun although my attention was drawn to the wu n n e 1 entranee

       I could see a mass of people who continues to push fowards into pens

         and 4 which w e r e V u l l
                               to capacity.   I noticed that the whole of the
                                o^/e .
       front perimeter fence tffOpens 3 and 4 were full of people atem p t i n g

       to c,l imb over onto the pitch.     Several      people were climbing over the

       dividing fence into the a djoining enclosures and I could see people

       being lifted into the stand a b o v e .


                                                 _      fA
       N oth ing at this time had come o ver frfte loud speaker system in the

       ground to indicate that their was a problem,           the \ r o w d were shouting

       and screaming for peo pi e to move b a c k .      I could see P-&J. ice Officers
climb onto the fence and shout to the crowd and attempting to lift

people out.



The situation remaind the same for several minutes until I noticed a
        X                     N i n o
Policeman i\n ont'fcK.the pitch and speak with the re fer ee. At this

time   I was joined by            (I1don't know his second name) who is

also a R e w a r d we had not received any instructions from the other

ground Staff or the Police but felt that there was a problem and made

our way down into the^SoVth Stand and o'tHkp the pitch.



I went over to enclosures 3 and 4 at this time there were a lot of

people walking aba^it^on the perimeter walkway surrounding the pitch

many of^WtTO were Liverpool, fans I climbed onto the metal fence and
                            '\v             c'J             ^
attenpted to lift peop le out x r o m behind the barrier I assisted

about twenty supporters,      some were injured,    they were holding their

limbs and complaining of chest and stomach pains, who appeared

breathless and in shock.



Whilst    I'^s   helping these   people out I can only describe the scene

j.nside the pens aTS-^pani c , people screaming and shouting,       people were

pressed up against each other,       I could see people   climbing over each

other and small chi 1 drenNbteing passed across above      people's heads.

In my opinion I pulled out thVee people who appeared dead,            they were

lifeless,    not breathing,   speechless,   all the people being brought

out by me were being passed down to others behind me who were

administering first aid.



Xcan     only describe the people I assisted as of mixed generations all

White irien.     I cannot describe what they looked like or what they were

wearing,    I cannot describe    these people,   it was so quick.    I had
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                             P&T)    J                                                  S433
     assisted people out o f ~ enclosure 3 nea,r to its dividing fence with
                  \                                                    V          <oV » M   -
     enclosureX^.           I then made my way to the st a diu m sports h a i l with a

     young lad of about           10 - H^sjjars of age who had lost some relatives,                              I

     do not know who this person is.



     I immediately then returned to the pitch outside West Stand and

r>   together
     u o y c w n t f r with    otheV
                       w x vFi u vnc people,
                                     p c o p i c y rFans
                                                     <3iris> and Stewards         I made six or seven
\                                             CAT
     trips with casualties on advertising boards to the far corner of the

     pitch where awaiting ambulances and First aiders were helping the

     i nj u r e d .



     It was at this time that a white man who was administering first aid

     to people         came over to me whilst I was                        putting a youth who I would

     describe as male white of 19 - 20 years of age medium build wearing a

     Liverpool         shirt,   into the recovery position,                      he looked at this youth

     I asked him if he wanted any help he replied "There's now't we can do

     he's dead".          I cannot recall what this man looked like except that he

     was white and appeared of about 30 - 40 years of age.



     I cannot say from which part of the enclosures this youth was brought

     from except that he was on the pitch in the 18 yard box near to the

     foyeline.



     I continued to help injured people for sometNime but                                   I did not   return

     to the perimeter fence.              During the whole                    incident   I did not witness

     any crowd trouble X^peopie fighting except where some Liverpool
                                              M I5                 .
     supporters appeared
                     r—  ■
                           hd^tile towards a cameraman who was taking

     pictures         I would \ a y   that this must have been in frustration.


                                                         I a   j

     I saw a Liverpool          fan punch a Policeman in the chest who told him to
                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                   S453

        ‘calm down.     I cannot describe these two people.      I myself was not

         subjected to any threats or violence.



         I would like to say that the pr           action by the Police,      Stewards

         and Saint John's w^> great and that^ somebody in authority should have
                                \                   c&YUrurVb'
         been preventing any more supporters entering the         tunnel   leading to

        ,Pens 3 and 4.     I feel that the dividing metal    fences on the W e s t

         Stand serve no purpose.



         I have i ndi cated on a ground map of Sheffield Wednesday f o o t b a l l

         Stadium w i th an *X* the position I was posted to during the game on

         15 April,    1989 (150489) and also I have    indicated with a dot the

         position I administered First Aid to        a Liverpool fan who Icarried         to

         the waiting ambulances     (Exhibit No.                 ) (Ref. No                )

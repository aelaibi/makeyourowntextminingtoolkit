help       others          as    I was           OK.         People          were     shouting                   at    the       Police               to     hurry

up    and       get     there.              A    lot       of     people        were          being          resuscitated                        out       here,

people        who       did,     there       were        barriers           some        100    yards          from    the     ground          to

filter        people           out    who    naan't         got      tickets.             1 know         at    Anfield        the       Police

filtering            you       out.     I    think        they       should          be    really         strong        with      ticket

were     shouting              for    tickets        it    was       incredible               really.           The     Policeman             who

pulled        me     out,       I would       like        to       thank       but      J. d i d n ' t    know       his    name        or

                                                          20th April 1989

Dear Sirs,
I would like you to accept this letter as an attempt in a small way
to assist you with your Inquiry into the events that lead
disaster last Saturday at Hillsborough.
We travelled to Sheffield (my husband and two sons, aged 15 and 11),
for the game arriving in Sheffield at approximately 11;30am. JJ®       .
ioined the flow of traffic around the ring road (directed by
which although only four miles from the ground actually took over 1,
hours to reach the parking areas designated for Forest supporters.
During this drive and subsequent walk to the ground we passed numerous
public houses, overflowing with heavy drinking, rowdy supporters.      As
we neared the ground on foot, p o r t l y before 1.45pm we had difficulty
aetting through the crowds outside these public houses having to walk
around them into the road.  Also we met many supporters coming away
from the ground, and it was obvious from their comments that they
were making their way to these public houses.

Havina secured our places on the Kop end at approximately 1 45pm we
noticed that although our end of the ground wash^ = ° n^ y f^ ^ g o a l
then, apart from the central terracing section behind the far goal
the Liverpool end was almost empty.         We watched m  won?e™ e "J
areat number of Liverpool supporters who were [jumping into the central
?errace from ?he seating a r e f a b ov e , and the -game' that was being
played by the supporter! ie. standing on their fellow supporters
shoulders and diving back into the crowd as seen done by fans at rock
concerts.
With a few minutes to go before the kick off the Forest "drunks" arrived,
and our end of the ground became totally full.       We ^ f o r t u n a t e l y had
five of these undesirables behind us.       At one stage after the jame had
been stopped and as some Liverpool fans ran across the pitch to taunt
our supporters one of the undesirables behind us knocked my youngest
son off the barrier he was sat on and trampled on him in his eagerness
to reach the Liverpool fans, and then turned on my husband and neigh
 bouring supporters after being r e p r i n t e d Therefore I “
opinion that if those fences had not been there at the front, the con
 seauences could have been far worse, because of the actions of the
 beer sodden, unthinking 'yobs' that seem to be attracted to football
 matches.
 T was verv surprised to see that unlike the League game against Forest
 and Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsbrough on New Year's Eve where we were
 even stopped from standing up in the front row of the Leppings Road
 seating area prior to the game, on the orders of the many police in the
 crowd there were no stewards or police between our turnstiles and the
 perimeter fences at the Semi-Final, and I can only assume that this was
 the same the other end.
\




    If we want to encourage women, children and famiLes to
    matches we must improve facilities within the grounds and remove some
    of the aggressiveness that seems to be in the supporters, fuelled in
    manv cases by excessive amounts of alcohol.   This also adds to
    disruption by the need to keep leaving their seats or places, much
    to the annoyance of people around to answer the call of nature,   and
    subsequently the inevitable sight of male personnel relieving them­
    selves wherever they pleased, oblivious to the people around them.
    This was especially evident at Wembley during the Littlewoods C“P
    Final, where the toilet facilities at such an impressive venue were
    pathetic, disgusting and unable to cope.

    We appreciate that the disaster was caused by n,any 4.<ron^ ^ ^ 1" L faCt°r S '
    but the sight of some of the stretcher bearers gesticulating and
    soittinq at the opposing fans who were mostly young children at the
    S
    f K £  L d the m a ^ non'-ticket holders trying to hide in the seating
    areas leads us to conclude that many spectators have no regard for the
    safety and feelings of their fellow supporters.

    We hope that all the vested interests> ie;

          the   FA and Clubs desire to return to Europe,
          the   publicans desire to continue to sell alcohol
          the   Liverpool politicians desire to paint everyone snow white,
          and   the police desire to appear super efficient,

    do not cloud the issue and the true facts and reasons for the disaster
    are allowed to be published.



    Yours faithfully,




    Aged 40

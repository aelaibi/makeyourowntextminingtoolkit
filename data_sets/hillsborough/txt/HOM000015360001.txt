            On Monday I had the chance of asking w h e t h e r yo u would
       consider reviewing the law in respect of the compensation
       which will be paid to the victims of the Hill s b o r o u g h
       Stadium tragedy.    You replied that y o u w a n t e d to think
       about this.

            I can imagine just how extra b u s y y o u are at the
      present time but I w o n d e r w h e t h e r I m ight have a brief
      wor d with yo u early next week?            P e r h a p s I could get my
      secretary to c heck w i t h y our office to see w h e n you will
      be voting and maybe we could spend five minu t e s after
      a division.

              With best wishes.

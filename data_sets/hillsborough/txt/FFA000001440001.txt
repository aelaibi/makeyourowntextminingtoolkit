Commander ROBINSON opened the meeting by welcoming those present

to New Scotland Yard.


Commander ROBINSON raised the issue of disorder which occurred

the previous evening at Loftus Road at the Q.P.R -v- Millwall,

Littlewoods Cup fixture.   He expressed concern at the level of

disorder which he said could have reached the scale of the

notorious Luton -v- Millwall match but was prevented from doing

so by good intelligence and good policing.   He said he was

disappointed by the comments of the Millwall Manager on LBC Radio

that morning which seemed to suggest the behaviour of the fans

had helped the team.


Comments on the matter were voiced by representatives of the two

clubs and Mr CROKER (F.A.).
Mr CROKER informed the forum that he had already begun to look

into the matter and the interview broadcast in the morning was in

fact recorded immediately after the game and the Millwall Manager

was unaware of all that had happened.


Commander ROBINSON reminded the forum that if another outbreak of

disorder occurred on the scale of the Luton -v- Millwall match

the Government may consider such measures as 100% membership

schemes being imposed on the Football League


2.    MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING


The minutes were agreed and there were no matters arising.


3.    PRICING POLICIES   (HOME/AWAY) SUPPORTERS


Superintendent McCRONE explained that he held regular meetings

with the Football Supporters Association   (FSA) and raised a point

from their last meeting.   This was the situation at a ground

where home supporters were charged £4 entry whilst away supporter

were charged £8 which caused problems when away supporters

attempted to gain entry in the cheaper areas of the ground.


Mr CROKER (FA) stated he believed only one club had done this,

and they had since dropped the idea.    This was confirmed by the

club representatives.
4.     MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES


Commander ROBINSON addressed the forum on his meeting with

divisional Chief Superintendents regarding membership schemes.


Mr CROKER (FA) informed the meeting that it was the

responsibility of the League to ensure clubs have a 50% scheme

w o rking.


Mr CRAWFORD   (Football League)   informed the meeting that clubs

have done a tremendous amount of work in marketing the scheme.

Administrative difficulties have arisen in keeping records and

membership cards.   Delegates informed the meeting of instances of

misuse of the scheme, i.e. one supporter was seen selling

membership cards outside a ground.     Mr CRAWFORD stated the League

would review the scheme in six months in order to assess how it

is working.


Delegates were invited to comment on their experiences in running

the membership schemes.


Several problems were highlighted including cases of large crowds

of non-members unable to gain entry to Stadia thereby creating a

potential for public disorder, and cases where members were able

to take 2 or 3 guests   (one club allowed ONE member to take up to

eight guests).
5.    EXCLUSION ORDERS


Chief Inspector HOSKINS addressed the forum on Exclusion Orders

and gave an overview of Section 30 Public Order Act 1986.     Since

commencement on 1st August 1987 Exclusion Orders can be made all

football related offences from drink upwards for periods of

3 months to Life.


He informed the forum there were fifteen Exclusion Orders, so

far, relating to supporters of London Clubs, with a number in the

pipe line, at present before the Courts.


Mr CROKER said the F.A. recieve copies of all Exclusion Order and

send a copy of every one to each club.


6.    COST OF POLICING FOOTBALL


Superintendent McCRONE addressed the meeting on the cost of

policing football.   He said the estimated cost of policing in

London, last season was about £8,000,000 of which about

£1,000,000 was retrieved from clubs under Special Service

Agreements.   He stressed to delegates that police were not trying

to recoup the outstanding £7,000,000 but instead were trying to

save the £500,000 which it is felt was incurred unnecessarily.

He said this applied in the main to rearranged matches,

cancellations due to weather conditions and postponed matches.

Where police officers were warned to attend matches, later

postponed.
                               -   6   -




He gave a brief outline of the Police Regulations on payments to

officers at the various rates and informed the meeting that the

Metropolitan Police Finance Department was looking at the

possibility of charging clubs higher rates, if less than eight

days notice of changes are given.


The subject was discussed at great length.


Mr CROKER suggested the police commit to paper the problems

together with any suggestions which will be looked into with a

view to possibly changing the rules governing the games.         This

course of action was agreed.


7.   POSTPONEMENT OF MATCHES


This was covered in 6 above.


8.   BANK HOLIDAY   (KICK OFF TIMES)


All delegates agreed to morning kick offs on forthcoming Bank

Holidays.   Where visitors had a long journey it was agreed that

kick offs may be extended with the agreement of police to 12 noon

or at the latest 12.30 pm.


Commander ROBINSON expressed his thanks to London clubs for

cancelling their home games over the August Bank Holiday because

of police commitment to the Notting Hill Carnival and would be

grateful for similar co-operation next year.


Mr CROKER suggested the League take this on board now and feed it

into their computer to ensure all London Clubs play out of London

on the August Bank Holiday Monday.         Mr CRAWFORD undertook to take

this back to the League.
                                      -   7   -




    9.    SPORTING EVENTS    (CONTROL OF ALCOHOL) ACT 1985 AND PUBLIC

          ORDER ACT 1986 - TEAM COACHES


    Superintendent McCRONE reminded the meeting that team coaches are

    not exempt from the current legislation and must not carry

    alcohol.   Prior to the Public Order Act a team coach may have

    been exempt if privately owned and not a PSV but that is no

    longer the case.




t   10.   CLOSE CIRCUIT TV


    Commander ROBINSON informed the meeting police were very pleased

    with the installation and use of CCTV, however older equipment is

    now becoming obsolete and therefore clubs may apply to the

    Football Trust for grants to modernise their equipment.


    3rd and 4th Division clubs who have not applied to the Trust for

    CCTV, were advised to do so.


    When considering the type of equipment monitors should be in

    colour for easy identification of trouble makers.


    The cost of maintaining equipment is the responsibility of the

    club and clubs were advised to take out a maintenance contract,

    the Football Trust would consider meeting this cost.


    11.   ANY OTHER BUSINESS


    Chief Inspector HOSKINS addressed the meeting making reference to

    the Football Intelligence Unit, should delegates come to hear of

    information regarding disorder at games, please let the Unit know

    on (230-2839 or 230-4462)    to                      or

                       information will be treated in confidence.
Points raised on British Police in Dusseldorf were raised and

discussed at length.


With no other business Commander ROBINSON thanked delegates for

their attendance and passed on their local Commanders and Chief

Superintendents thanks for their assistance in the past.


The meeting closed at 4.50 pm.

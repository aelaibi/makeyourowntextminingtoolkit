Lord Justice Taylor,

 Car          or,
Last Friday I visited three young men, constituents of mine, wh^
had been in the thick of the crush at Hillsborough. They are
still at school, and although they very shocked by what they
experienced, I think that they have a great deal to offer the
Inquiry.         Iwas visible in some of the photographs that
appeared after the tragedy.



              |was in the ground by 1.30, and said he felt that it
was filling dangerously fast. He had been searched twice outside
the ground, but not inside and he had not been asked for a
ticket. By 2.30 he said that "it was like being among people who
were drowning", and that people were screaming with pain and fear
but nothing was done.

His feet were lifted off the ground, he was crushed against a bar
and the wind was driven out of him. At 3.10 he clambered over
the security fence and asked the police to fetch a wire cutter.
They refused to do this, neither did they remove the goal netting
that obstructed hundreds of people. One of his friends was
punched by a police officer while trying to struggle free of the
crowd.

At 3.30, they were moving a corpse and a photographer drew down
the coat that was covering the dead man's face and asked them to
pose. It was 4.00 pm before Kenny Dalgleish came on the tannoy
to try to appeal for calm.
It seems from the Liverpool Echo report, a copy of which I
enclose, that there was no attempt to stop fans without tickets
before they reached the ground. I am sure that this will be a
vital part of your Inquiry. Furthermore, I Iso enclose coopies
of a report of a statement made by Peter Robinson, the Chief
Executive of Liverpool Football Club, made on March 22nd, and
which I snet that day to Colin Moynihan. I enclose the
Minister's exteremely complacent reply.

Having spent two hours with these three young men who were in the
very worst of the crush and subsequent rescue, I am sure that
they have an important contribution to make to the inquiry, and I
think that you should hear their descriptions yourself. They are
              of                       , Liverpool 19;
        of               Liverpool 17 and              of
                      Liverpool 19.

I hope that you will be able to come to Liverpool to see these
young men, and I can only add that I will be happy to co-operate
in any way that I can with the Inquiry.

22 March: The Daily Express article that David Alton sent to
Minister for Sport, Colin Moynihan, warning him that the
management of Liverpool FC were uneasy at the FA cup semi-final
being played at Hillsborough.

           “ They appear to be living in an
        ivory tower showing a complete
        disregard for the fans who are the
        |ifeblood OjfT-he game,” he declared.
          The cham pions are furious over the
        PA’s choice of Sheffield Wednesday’s                  T > A I i_y
        Hillsborough ground to stage their
        April 15 semi-final collision with
        Nottingham Forest for the second
        season running.                                       EXPRESS'

           Although Liverpool's average Anfield
        attendance of alm ost 38,000 is m ore th an
        17,000 higher th an F o rest’s, th e M ersey
        club’s tick et sh are is only 24,400 co n tra st­
        ing w ith F o rest’s 28,000.
            T hat 3,600 shortfall is caused by F orest

        H illsborough on police advice to allow for
        access to th e stadium from th e S o u th —a
        repeat of last season’s arrangem ents.
            B ut angry Robinson rev e ale d : “ I spoke
        to th e FA after th e sem i-final draw had
        been m ade b u t before they h ad tak en a
        decision on choice of venue.
            “ I told th em th a t last year we accepted
        w hat had been done after th e venue had
        been decided. And I stressed we had no
        objection to H illsborough as a ground,
        and th a t we m u st abide by any security

                   Thank you for your letter of 22 March enclosing a cutting from
                   the Daily Express about the venue for the FA Cup semi-final
                   match, Liverpool v Nottingham Forest.
                   The choice of venue for these matches and the allocation of
                   tickets is entirely a matter for the football authorities.      I
                   understand that the Football Association took account of
                   Liverpool's views in considering the venue for tine match against
                   Nottingham but decided that, in all the circumstances, the
                   Sheffield Wednesday ground     at Hillsborough was      the most
                   appropriate location.    The arrangements for the allocation of
                   tickets have been handled by the Sheffield Wednesday club who
                   are staging the game on behalf of the Football Association.     I
                   gather, as suggested in the Daily Express article, that the
                   allocations were made on the basis of police advice.

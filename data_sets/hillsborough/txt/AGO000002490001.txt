         HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

         I refer to previous correspondence and your visit to LSLO this morning. This
         letter confirms that you have taken possession of three files each relating to
         correspondence received from Sir Malcolm Thornton MP. They are LSLO files
         20.18.94, 20.26.92 and 20.1.92. In addition you received extracts from our
         general file on Hillsborough (400.89.105). I now enclose as requested parts A
         and B of our file INQ.4.92.

         We identified the need to handle the material contained in the files in a way
         which does not breach the convention that Ministers of one adm inistration are
         not apprised of the advice given to Ministers of another administration. You
         agreed to consult as appropriate.

         Finally, I should be grateful if, in opd^r that we have a record as to where our
         files are, you would endorsga-etfpy of this letter and return it to LSLO.

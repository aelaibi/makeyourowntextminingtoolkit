Dear Mr Shepard

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

I understand that Mr Preston telephoned you on 20 April to
discuss the division of costs between the Home Office and your
Department, arising from the Inquiry into events connected with
the disaster at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April 1989.

He informs me that responsibility will be divided in the
following manner: the Treasury Solicitor's Department will bear
the costs of; salaries and expenses of Treasury Solicitor's
staff; fees and expenses of Counsel to the inquiry; and
witnesses' expenses.

Your advice is that the sponsoring Department bears the cost of:
the legal representation for those granted such representation
who cannot afford to pay - mainly the injured and relatives of
the deceased; shorthand writers and transcript production;
accommodation for the inquiry team, including telephones, etc;
fees, travel and subsistence of the inquiry team and co-opted
members, assessors, etc (excluding Counsel); research; staffing
costs; printing, production and distribution of inquiry
report(s); and other general expenses.

Perhaps you would be kind enough to confirm your view about these
areas - a reply by Facsimile (on 01-273 3964) would be helpful.

                                        Yours si    ely

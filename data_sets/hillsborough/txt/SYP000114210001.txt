                Hillsborough,                 Sheffield.                 1 was      in S e r g e a n t         F r a n c e ’s     serial          36,' w i t h

                but        f a i r 'with      the    supporters.

                After        the    briefing             we    all       assembled            at       the    rear     of     the      stand          in     ti

                The        train    was       coming          at    about       1.50      p .m .        and    so    we     decided          to       walk        the

                short        distance          to    the       station          and     wait           at    the    railway         station.                At

                this        moment       it    was       about       11.00        a.m.         The          weather       for     the       time       of     year

                was        very    good       and    in       itself       felt         like       a    summer's          day    with        clear          blue

                skies        and    the       sun    shining             down.

                As     we    made       our    way       to    the       station        we     were          passed       fay ^ L i v e r p o o l

                supporters              going       in    both       directions.                   A    large       majority           of    the       fans

                were        either       drinking             from       cans     of     beer          or    carrying         packs         with       them.

                At     this       time     I saw         no    one       drunk     or     shouting;

                There        were       about       five       or    s i x ’ of    us     stood             around     near       to    the       station

and      we      were    just       talking        in     general          about       everything.                       Again,           I saw

football              supporters          walking         up    the       road       past       Wadsley             Bridge          away        from

Hillsborough                 and    large        groups        congregating                outside             the       industrial

estate           outside          Halford's        store",          drinking          from        cans         and       bottles.               Thijs

•Flow o f         people          continued        for      the      next       hour       or     so.          I had          my     own

personal              radio       with    me     and    heard        for       someone          to     go      and       check           these

large         groups         to    make     sure       everything              was    in    order.;

At     about          1.50    p.m.        the special           train          arrived          with        the         supporters              on.

All      the      supporters              I saw        were     well       behaved          and        orderly                     when        I

escorted              them    from        the t r a i n     towards            Leppings          Lane         e n d of         the       ground.

We. a r r i v e d       outside           the g r o u n d      at   about           2.20    p.m.          and       I saw       large

groups           of    supporters           walking         around         outside          Leppings                Lane.            A    lot       of

the      supporteyC               were    sat     on    the     bridge          wall       drinking                from       cans        and

 bottles,,            /here        were     also       large        groups          stood       on     the         pavement              drinking,

 I heard/arge                 groups        of    Liverpool           supporters                walking             up       and     down

.s a y i Jjjf,    "Any       spares       boys?"          This       request          was       repeated                by    as     man       as

     teady/stream             of    fans       coming       down      the       road.           There          was       a    large        build

       at/ t h e       turnstiles          and     I    could        see       horses       going             in    to       try    and        stop

     ie/fans          from    pushing.            I heard           over       my    radio        someone               asking           for    a

A l l the         time       1 was       outside        I could           smell       the       stench             of

liquor           from    all       the    discarded            cans       on    the    road          some          half       full,        and

bottles           left       littered          about      the       place.           Over       the       air       again          I heard

someone           pleading          for    the     gate        to    be    opened          and       the       voice         was         getting

desperate.               The       next    moment         I made          my    way    to       Leppings                Lane       turnstiles

were      I, s a w      people       walking           about        dazed       and    confused.

                     the       sij^s    of    the    ground.           I saw       people        choking          and    being          sick     and

                     peak's          being     carried          out    were     semi-conscious.                    I    ran    over       to     this

                     were       dead     people       b e i n g .carried...out.             .At'this             moment       in    time       I was

                     Again,          fans     very    threatening              came       and    shouted,          “Y o u     fucking          dick

                     An    Inspector           came       over    and       told     me    and       other       officers          to    keep       people

                     away       from     the    bodies.           Again,        fans       shouted,          "You       useless          cunts."            I

                     saw       Liverpool        fans       trying       to     assault          Poli cemen.             I heard          nothing           over

                     the       radio     but    heard       a    loudspeaker              announcement             asking          for    Liverpool .

                     fans       to     move    back.

                     After       spending           some    time       at    the     back       of    the    ground,          I re-grouped                 with

                     Inspector           Ellis       and    went       back     with       other       officers          to    W a d s ley       Bridge

           On Saturday 15th April,     1989 <150489)          I commenced duty at Woodseats

           Pstn at 8.45 am <0845 h r s ) for depioyment at Hi 1lsborough f o ot b a11

           ground for the Liverpool ~v~ Nottingham Forest FA cup semi-final.                          We

           arrived at Hi 1lsborough at around 9.30 am <0930 h r s ) where we were

           briefed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and several other senior

           Offi c ers .   After the briefing we were deployed to the Peni stone Rd /

           Hop enclosure where a further briefing took place,                    given by

           Superintendent Greenwood and Inspector Booth.                  We were made aware of

           possible potential     problems on the terrates and outside the ground.                         I

           was then de pi oyed as a member of Seria/l 9 with responsibilities for

           turnstiles nos 43 / 44 on Peni stone j/k d.



           ye supervised the entry of Forest fans and prevented them taking any

                                                                          S2586
dangerous    items into the ground and searches of numerous fans were

made.     We were under constant supervision form the Serial S e r q e a n t ,

PS767 Jessop, who remained at the turnstiles.             We were also checked
                               ZS'Sn
periodically by Inspector Booth and other senior Officers.



We remained at the turnstiles un t i 1 around 3.10 pm (1510 h r s ) when

Sergeant Jessop gathered us together and informed us we were required

inside the ground at the Leppings Ln end.           At this time we all

believed there to be a pitch invasion in progress.             The turnstile

operators were instructed to close the gates and they complied with

this    request.



The Serial then went round the rear of the Hop and made our way

through the crowd to the perimeter fence and we were let out through a

gate behind the goal.       We had an easy passage through the Hop and

there appeared to be ample room on the         terrace.     (Whilst working on

the turnstiles     I noticed that we never     had any great build up of

Forest supporters and the queues were never more than about            15 to 20

at any one t i m e ).



Once on the pitch I could see that a large number of Liverpool fans

were already on the pitch and that more were climbing over the

perimeter fence.        I also recall seeing   others being hauled up into       the

stand above the Leppings Ln terrace by         other fans.



Initially,    I thought there had been pitch invasion as did the Forest

fans, as I recall the chant       'Off the pitch"    being shouted by Forest

fans.     The serial as a whole walked towards the Leppings Ln terrace at

a normal walking pace,       still believing   it to be a pitch invasion.

After    reaching the Leppings Ln terrace,      I could see several supporters
                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                 /                      S2586
    s qu as he d t ig ht ly ag ai ns t    the   perimeter    fVnce a nd they were   obviously

    having difficulty breathing.                Police Officers were stood on the fence

    trying to get the crowd to move back,                   but they seemed to take no

    notice.      I can recall one of the gates directly behind the goal being

    opened and there were several Police Officers pulling fans through

    this gate and out onto the pitch.                 By now I had realised that the

    situation was serious because I can recall seeing the people being

    taken out of the ground who were obviously dead and had already

    started to turn a blue-ish colour.                 By this time I had become detached

    from my serial and gave assistance where I could. The bonjy of a young

    male,    caucasion approx SO years old with blonde hair, yas passed
J
    through the gate to myself and another officer who wai stood next to

    me.     He had stopped breathing and was also a blue-ish colour.

    Together with the other u n k n ^ n Officer,               we took him to the side of

    the pitch nearest the South/Stand and laid him on the grass.                      The

    other Officer gave mouth j/o enough resus c itat ion whilst I gav^/ heart

    massage.                         _/



    ye kept this going for around 10 minutes but with no success.                       A

    Fireman and a supporter then took over^/rom us and I did not see what

    happened to this man after              leaving him there.       I returned to the

    perimeter fence and helped other injured fans onto the pitch.                      By this

    time the pitch was full of Liverpool supporters and when the Forest

    fans started chanting, a large group began to run towards the Forest

    end of the ground obviously wanting to fight.



    Along with several other Police Officers we attempted to stop the fans

    getting to the other end of the pitch (I also recall several Liverpool

    fans, mostly in their 30 *s , urging the Liverpool                 fans to go back and

    help their friends and not make matters worse than what they already
                                                                          PAGE      4
                                                                          S2586
were).      Most of the fans did return to the Leppings Ln end but others

were still     in an aggressive mood.    The Liverpool     fans on the Leppings

Ln end had a mixture of emotions.        Some did all they could to assist

in helping fellow fans,     others appeared to be in shock walking         round

aimlessly,     others were venting their anger on us and the press whilst

others were hysterical and unable to control themselves.            By this time

I realised that we had a major disaster on our hands as I could see

bodies everywhere.      I looked on the pitch and Police, Firemen,

Ambulance and supporters were giving the Kiss of Life to prostrate

bodies all over the pitch.



I cannot recall seeing any stretchers at this time and fans were

making makeshift stretchers from the advertising hoardings around the

ground.      The bodies were beginning to be ferried by Police Officers

and supporters to the rear of the North Stand.            By now I had somehow

become part of a cordon of Police across the pitch around the halfway

line.     I d o n ’t recall how I came to be in the cordon and I now realise

that    I was probably in the early stages of shock.         I remember   looking

at the bodies of the supporters as they went past me, as I was worried

that    I might know some of them.      (I am Liverpool    born and several

family and friends attended at the match and were actually on the

Leppings Ln terraces).      I remember a small outburst of sporadic

fighting breaking out in small sections around most parts of the

g roun d.



By now I had lost all track of time and can only remember there being

a tannoy announcement that the match had been abandoned.            The ground

gradually emptied of fans and our serial eventually re -grouped.              We

took up our after match positions on Penistone Rd to supervise bus

queues,     but this turned out to be a pointless excercise as most of the
                                                                                      PAGE    5

         fans had fay now left the area.



         ye then returned to the North Stand for a debriefing.            By now rumours

         numbered the dead to be over thirty.           I approached my serial

         commander , Mr. Booth, and asked him if I could make some enquiries

         regarding my immediate family and friends who I knew to be at the

         ga m e .      In the c i rc umstances, this proved imposs ible for obvious

         re a so ns .     Everyone   in the stand sat in stunned silence, and some were

         c ryi n g .

Well     before 3 pm           (1500 h r s ) C l a y w h e e 1s Ln was        filled with Liverpool

coaches and b e tw e en 2 . 3 0             pm    (1430 hrs)       and 3 pm      (1500 hrs)       there was

only the odd            car    came along,         the o ccupants asking              if there was

s o me wh er e    to    park.



Fr o m   the     front       of the T ra ff ic Garage           I could see the j un ct io n of

C l a yw h ee l s Ln / P e n i s t o n e Rd N.            In the    15 minu te s      up to 3 pm        (1500

hrs)     I could see man y              suppo rt er s making        their way to the           ground.

D ur i n g   the 30 m in u te s         leading up to 3           pm (1500 hrs)         I also    heard

reports        over my        radio     of trouble        in the Gate      Inn,       The Fox and the Five

A r c h e s public       houses.



Just     after 3 pm           (1500 hrs)         I heard a call        over     the    radio   for all

officers         to a t te n d   inside      the    ground.        I saw a group of officers

approaching            the T r af fi c    garage and went           down to meet         them to direct

them to the ground.                    Seve ral    O ff icers     had obtai ne d a hot meal             from the

c atering        van a nd were about              to sit     down at    tables        in the Traffic

garage.          These       officers     were also        sent    back to the ground.             At    that

time     it was        thought     that     it was a public          order      problem.



I was a s s i st e d at C l ay w h e e l s Ln by Se r ^ e a              2264 Hewitt,          T ra in in g

D epartment,           and    from the      time that        problems    began to occur           until       late

evening        I kept a log of all                calls    to the Traf fi c S e ct i on f o r

a ss i s tance.         R eq ue s ts    for motor      cyclists      to open routes to the

H a l l a m s h i r e and N o r t h e r n General         H o sp it al s were   passed to

Superintendent               Brougham.       A request was made           for the two Force              coaches

to transport            relatives        to Hamrnerton Rd from the football                    ground.        The

                                                                                                                      52197

              handwritten             log was     h an d e d to    Inspector Sewell           at 8.45    pm    (2045 hrs)

               that    evening whe n           I d el i ve r ed    the    collected        radios to the       police    room.



              As O f f i c e r s were         r el ea se d    from the gr ou nd during the a f t e r n o o n they

               r e t u r n e d to C l ay w h e e l s   Ln.      It was a pp ar e nt        that man y were      in deep

              shock and very d istressed.                       An enqu ir y was made of the B a r ns l ey and

              D i s t r i c t General         H os pi ta l    regarding        possible     treatment.        The ad vi ce

              g i v e n was       to talk      if t hey wished,           to    let them sit auietlv           if they

              wished;        but      not to     leave       them alone.         I

              division,           who   had    come    on duty as the            result     of a radio appeal,          to sit

              wit h    them and to make a note of their                          collar     numbers.     Fro m this a

               list was       later       p re pa re d for the        i n fo rm at io n of the Force Welfare

              O fficer.



               D ur i n g   the    later a f t e r n o o n     several     Liv er po ol     fans    called    in at

               saw at       least       one fan who was           still    su ff er in g    heavily from the effects

              of drink.            He kept       repeating        "We are      not to blame        for this".

Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to The Prime Minister
which has been passed to this department in view                     of   our
responsibilities for the Safety of Sport Grounds Act.

You express the opinion that, following Lord Justice Taylor's
Final Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster, members of
the lower divisions of the football league should be treated
differently due to the size of their attendance and their lack
of money compared to the bigger clubs of the First and Second
Divisions. Lord Justice Taylor recognised these differences and
recommended that clubs in the Third and Fourth Divisions be
allowed an extra 5 years, that is until August 1999, to eliminate
terraces from their grounds.

In addition Lord Justice Taylor recognised that current
attendances at many grounds of clubs in the lower divisions are
well below the maximum capacity of the ground. He commented, in
his Final Report, that a small scale redvelopment, possibly
involving only part of the ground, might be sufficient in some
cases.

                                                    Yours sincerely




                                                    Steve Bilbe

                                went       into a pub n earby to have a arinfc prior to the match.

                 can't        remember       the      name    of the       pub.      The        pub was     quiet    to start with,

                 but    filled up gradually.                       There was        no drunk e n e s s       in the      pub,

                 e v e r y b o d y was      happy      in high spirits.

                 We    left the        pub at a bout            ten      past two and made              our way to the ground.

                 On our way to the ground,                         I remember        seeing a lot of Policemen,                      who

                 were     standing at a bout                 twenty metre           intervals.             I remember       commenting

                 at    the time        that      there were a lot of P o l i c e m e n                  on the;/route to the

                 ground.         We    did not         receive a n y Police                d i r e c t i o n asr such,     nor   did we

                 receive any escort                   to the ground.              I did not          see/any form of fighting,

                 disorder         or d r u n k e n e s s whilst walk i n g                to the g r o u n d .

                 a    case     of f o llowing          the    crowd.         I had not           been to the H i l l s b o r o u g h

                 As    soon as we got to                 the t u rnstiles           it was        just/a     heaving mass           of

                 people,        s tr e t c h i n g    back    to the       road.          The    crowd were        no t c o n t rolled        in

                 try and get           to the turnst iles.                   At this        stage/we        were    near    to the

                 ease     in the       crowd.          We were all           still        packed     in,    trying     to/^et       to the

             m a t c h ticket             in and was         given the stub back.                     Once      on the    inside     of

             the    ground,              I can remember            having a look a r o u / d the area                    behind     the

             stand.           As     I did so        I became           of a concerting* type gate                  that was        open.

             The    gate was              behind my         right       shoulder,         I crow know this gate as gate

                         As     I looked at the gate                     I could se/6 a considerable                     number     of

    /fsl     people       had just      s ta rt ed to come throtigijif the gate.  It was obvious that

             the gate           had just been opened.      This w o u l d have been at five to three

             (1455).            The       people were walking                     in t h r o u g h the gate%»       w hich were

the    hands     of other       people.        I m a n a g e d to    contr o Lr my breathing with

short     breaths.           I knew that       I was       in a severe / r u s h ,        the    like of w hich

I had never           experienced       before.        I had been          in crushes       on the kop

before,       but     never    one    like this       before.        It e v e n t u a l l y got    to the

stage     that        was a s k i ng myself will            I live    through       it.     My    initial

p o s ition     in pen number          three was       towards       the     rear   near    to the dividing

fence wi t h        pen number        four.     I have       i n d icated this          position on the

a t t a c h e d grid,    using       the figure       1.     The    crus iff continued and          I was

being     carried more and more towards                      the     frsrnt of the pen.            1‘ was

being     s u bj e c t e d to severe         pressure       from     yne    rear.        I was aware     of      the

game a c t ua ll y      kicking       off and the          game    feeing in play,         but    only very

briefly.         At    one    stage    I nearly       lost     consciousness.             The    crush    carried

me    towards       the front        of the    pen and       I ended up in a position w hich was

in a stright           line w ith my first            position.            I have   i n d icated this

second     p o s i t i o n on the a t ta ch ed grid using                 the figure       two.     Once      in

this     second       position,       I was    still       being    s u b j e c t e d to severe     pressure.

The    pressure was so           intense       that    it caused me to vomit,                    I did not

have     pain as such,          but    extreme     pressure an d a lot              of discomfort.

A fter a matter          of    perhaps a couple             of minutes,          I became aware          of a

girl    s c r eaming     be h i n d me.       She was       screaming,          "I c a n ’t breath,       I c a n ’t

breath."

The    girl     had an obvious L i verpool                 accent.        All    of a sadden       I became

aware     that      the girl     went     very quiet         behind me.           I could not turn

around     to    look at       the    girl    because       of the    crush.        I nat u r a l l y a s s u m e d

that    she had died b e h in d me.               I did not         get    to see the girl          at any

stage.        At a r o u n d the      same    t irne as this,        I heard a ma 1 e vo i c e s a y ,

“H e ’s had a heart a t t a ck ,"

The    voice     had a n o t i c e a b l e West C o u n t r y        accent. Again,         I was unable

to    look a r o u n d beca u s e      of the    crush,       but    I n a turally a s s u m e d that            the

voice was        referring       to an elderly             person who must          have    been

                im m e d iately       behind me.           At    no stage         did    I a c t u a l l y get to see the male

                v i c ti m of the heart attack,,                  but     I assumed            that an elderly male             had

                died s u ffering a heart                attack         im m e d i a t e l y    behind me.        I w o u l d say

                that at     this       time    it w ou l d have           been about            three    fift e e n    (1515),     as

                the    game was a b a n d o n e d       some minutes              prior        to this.      The      pressure

                g r a d u a ll y eased off,          o bv io u s l y    because         people were fully a ware                that

                either     by       climbing     over      the sides of the                   pen or going       back    down the

                tunnel.         I e ve nt ua ll y     got back          to the        tunnel      and went       back    down the

                tunnel.         I would       like    to say here that                  during     the    crush       I can remember

                closed a g a i n by Police,                before        people       could get o u t .          This    resulted        in

                a scuffle           b e t w e e n two Policemen,             o b v i o u s l y o v e n whether        the gate

                stand,     I had a walk a ro u n d for about                        f i f t e e n minutes.         I can remember

                seeing a lot of              people     lying      on the gr o u n d whislt at the                     rear

                of the stand,            I was    smoking a cigarette agai n s t                        the stand,       when    I saw

                some    fans        carrying a lad out             from        the tunnel.          They     put him      down

                outside     the         tunnel    e n t rance          and   Isaw a lad start             to try and

                resusc i t a t e      him.     I knew the basics                  of first aid and             I could see         the

                lad had      it all wrong,            so        I went       over     to see      if I could help at all.                 I

                went    over        to the    lad and we were joined                     by a w oman who           identified

            since we         first       e nt e r e d the ground           and got to the            end of the tunnel.                      I.

            e ve nt ua ll y       left      the    ground at about             five     fifteen (1715),              leaving         of my

            own accord.               U pon rny return to my               car,      we were      re-united w i t h                 who

            was wait i n g           there     for    us.

            T hr ou g h o u t     the    course       of the a f t e r n o o n       I did not see a n y t h i n g               that    I

            w ou ld    consider          to be a criminal                offence.

            F r o m the      time       that      the m a tch was a c t u a l l y        stopped,        I could describe

            things      as a b s o lu te          chaos,     there       being    no o r g a n i s a t i o n y o r   general

            s u p e r v i s i o n amon g s t       the Police and the a u t h o rities. /                    It was         only the

            instincts           of    indivi d u a l s      that    resulted         in help baA rig given to injured

            people.          There was ari obvious                  lack of s u p e r v i s i o n amongst              the Police
CAT
AO          who also         f a i l ed to act         on their          own   initiatiy

O D H H Z h J T r think that          the    principal        cause       of the      disaster was           the      lack of

            c o m m un ic at io n b et w e e n        the Police,          insider and outside               the      ground and

            b e t w e e n the Police an d              the    ground ajitforar i t i e s .          I think          that    orice the

            disaster was              occuring        the Police were             too    slow to        realise        the       sever i t y

            of the      disaster,            perhaps        if they had          realised earlier,               then J m e        tunnel

            could have            been sealed off,               preventing          further      people                enterings

            pens 3 & 4.               This again,           to my mind,          comes     back to the^lack                 of

            communic ation.                 I feel     that there was a total                   lack i/f crowd              control

            outside         the      ground as        there were          i n s u f ficient Pil/tce to               control       the

            crowd.          To my mind,            from my ex p e r i e n c e s       on the a f t e r n o o n there was an

            obvious         lack      of medical         facilities,           ie,    s t r e t c h e r s arid oxygen.             I feel

            that      the    lack       of s up er v i s i o n     by senior Police Officers                    to the           lesser

            ranks      c o n t r i b u t e d to the         general       chaos.

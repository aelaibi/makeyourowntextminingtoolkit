                  On Saturday 15th A p r i l, 1989 (130489) at approximately 1 .00/pm (1300

                  hrs).    I left my home addresy'with my mother to go shopfcj/ng in the

                  locality at the Sheffield T/own Centre.           From my home address     I had

                  cause to drive through tlV£ Hillsborough area of Sheffield             to get to

                  the town centre,       I was driving/my own car,



                  During the journey I drovey^ast five public houses which are all

             ^   within a mile o ^ L e p p i n g s Ln,   the west side of the Hi 1 l/'bo rough

             fS'' football groymi.       The first pub I drove past was t h ^ Sportsman in

                 Worrell V?d/it would be around 1.05 pm (1305 h r ^ the car park and

                  grass v e ^ e s   were packed I estimate there wVre two hundred people

                  outside and I presumed inside was full as well.
                                                                           PAGE     2
                                                                           S1128

I then drove past another 4 pub s r >yfie Horse & Jockey,         in      _n, was

a similar situation but appear/d to be more people a^dfund,             I then

went past the Beehive     in Wyrrall R d , The Castle         Dykes HI Rd a nd

finally the Wadsley J<



All these were again packed out around,,             pubs.    I would estimate on

that particular journey I saw betwa^i a thousand and a thousand five

hundred ^Liverpool fans outside J t h e s e   five pub s .   All the fans at this

stage were high spirited and/boistrous .          However there was no

disorderly behaviour that I saw.         Most of the fans that I saw standing

around outside these     pubs were either drinking pint glasses of beer or

from cans containing some sort of beer.



On completion of my shopping in the Town Centre.              I ls-PiTand did the

same journey in reverse,      passing the same pubs ,>4tThi ch I had drove       past

on the way.    The time w>dld be around 2.30 j m         (1430 hrs) as I passed

the Beehive Public M ouse     it appeared th^e there was around the same

            opl
amount of peopl         there had been on the previous journey the crowd

were still well behaved and drink             alcohol.



As I went past the Wadsle^/Jack which is quite a bit further out from

the Hillsborough Grouncfi was astounded that there were still so many

fans drinking at that time when kick off for the match was only half

an hour or so away.      If anything there were more fans than on my

previous journey.     The fans were by this time more boistrous and

getting somewhat disorderly.        However,    I didn't see any fighting or

anything of that nature.



The Sportsmans and the Horse y J o c k e y were the same situation a lot

more fans who were becoming/more boistrous,           I remember one fan who ran
                                                                                PAGE      3
                                                                                S1128

         in front of my car with two pints of beer in his hands by the time

         he reached the other side of the road he had spilled most of the beer.

         Again the fans were somewhat disorderly but I did not see any

         fighting.



         One thing that did strike me as stcfinge was that the t i m e ^ m e

         Liverpool fans w ere still drinking around the pubs wjaien I saw them it

         was between 2.30 pm <1430 h r s j f and 2.45 pm (1445^nrs) it would have

         been a fifteen minute walk/;o the ground,         levying a very short time to

         get to the ground b ^ f o r e A i c k - o f f .




                                                                               3IGNED

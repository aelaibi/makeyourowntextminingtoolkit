                                                   EMPIRE HOUSE 10 PICCADILLY BRADFORD B 0 1 3LR
                                             SUBMISSION



  This     Inquiry        has        proceeded         at     great     pace and has had laid

  before        it, in its 6h weeks of sitting, a considerable quantity

  of     material        both oral and written.                   Its objective has been to

  endeavour,        despite           the constraints of time, to ascertain what

  happened at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on the 15th

  of April 1989 and why the tragedy of that day occurred.



  The     actual investigation of those events has been in the hands

^^of     the     West Midlands Police.                  It continues so to be and it is

  no     secret     that their enquiries are not complete, nor as it is

  understood,          are they expected to be until some weeks or months

  hence.          They     have        a   formidable task.              Further, material in

  their        possession        from      dates        in May was being disclosed even

  only     at the end of June.                 As Counsel for the Inquiry indicated

  in     his     opening,        it    must       be        obvious     to   everyone that the

  investigation           is still continuing and all the evidence has not

  yet been assembled.



  At     the     Inquiry        no     rules      of    evidence        prevailed,           no sworn

  testimony         was        given       (and    once        the    Advocates        had     become

  accustomed to such licence), leading questions became the order

  of     the    day,      hearsay upon hearsay was invited and opinion and

  speculation            was          canvassed.             Additionally,        it     has     been

  emphasised        by     the       Inquiry       in       the      circumstances       that     the

  absence       of a challenge to the material laid before it will not

  be taken adversely or as an indication by any of the persons or

  bodies present of an acceptance of the material given.
  Accordingly              it        may     be        unsafe,     even    if    it were considered

  possible,           to        come        to    what      might     strictly      be described as

  findings           of fact.              It is submitted that it may be dangerous to

  attempt        anything              more        than     an     impression or a general view

  (which in any event may ultimately be demonstrated to have been

  mistaken).



  In     some        areas           even        the     forming     of    a    general view may be

  difficult.               For example whilst it is plain that the failure of

  crush     barrier              124A        in Pen 3, perhaps in two stages, played a

^^crucial        part in the events, scarcely any material has been put

  before        the        Inquiry           or any attempt made to enable an informed

  view     to        be     tentatively                 reached as to when or how or in what

  circumstances                 that        occurred.        Arguably that barrier's failure

  led     to injury              and death.             The state of the material before the

  Inquiry        indicates that                   the     failure         or    failures     may   have

  occurred           as     early as around about 14.47, see BBC video, or as

  late     as 15.04, see the accounts of                                               and

  Their     accounts,                 it     is        noted, taken in May (from                     as

  early     as        the        2nd        of May), were not made available until the

  latter        stages               of the        Inquiry and were not the subject of an

  oral     hearing.                  It is submitted that no final view can, at this

  stage,     be           reached as to when whatever happened to the barrier

  occurred           but        it     is     likely        that    such failure was, not upon

  either        of        those        times, the result of a sudden inrush of fans

  from Gate C being opened.



  Given     that           the        state       and      nature    of the material canvassed

  before        it     will          be well in the mind of the Inquiry a detailed

  discussion           of inconsistencies and conflicts is for the greater
  part unlikely to be helpful.                             It is proposed in this Submission

  to deal with the matters in a "broad brush manner".



  CHOICE OF GROUND



  When     it     was        known        who the semi-finalists were, the Football

  Authorities,           knowing the Police requirement of segregation and

  which        ends     would        be        allocated to which supporters, selected

  Hillsborough.               That was a decision of the F.A. and of the F.A.

  alone.          Any        criticism              that     might arise         therefrom cannot

^^properly        be     addressed              to the       South Yorkshire Police. It was

  the     same        arrangement              as     had    taken    place       in 1988. No one

  suggested           that     1988        had been          flawed in its       Policing. No new

  circumstances were identified or disclosed.



  POLICING OUTSIDE



  The      Semi-Final           was        a        sporting       event,    likely      to     attract

  considerable           crowds,           for the most part intent on enjoying the

  company        of     their friends and fellow supporters and, it was no

  doubt        hoped, a fine game.                   Whilst a formidable Police presence

  at     every turn, equipped for every eventuality that might occur

  to      the     imagination              anticipating             such    an   event        might   be

  provided,           some judgment had to be exercised.                         It was necessary

  that     a balance be struck and that required that regard be paid

  to     experience           and to information and intelligence.                            It was no

  more reasonable, in the absence of intelligence, to assume that

  no     one     would       turn up than it would have been to have assumed

  that     some        thousands          would        present        themselves for admission

  after        2.30     such     that          they        would     have   no real prospect of
  getting in before the kick-off.



  The Police had the previous experience of 1988 to draw upon - a

  match between the same teams in, according to the intelligence,

  identical circumstances.                   Not unreasonably, it is submitted, it

  was     determined           to     follow    the     same plan and, in relation to

  Leppings Lane, to provide the same level of Policing.



  In     the planning not every eventuality would be spelt out, such

  was     not practicable and would probably not have been wise.                         In

^ L u c h circumstances it would arguably be preferable to -encourage

  flexibility              and the exercise of judgment and not to inhibit or

  discourage           initiative.           The Policing was, by and large, to be

  done        by     highly     experienced         Officers    well      acquainted   with

  dealing           with     crowds, with Hillsborough matches in general and

  with        the     Leppings        Lane    end     and   Semi-Finals in particular.

  Added        to     that     body     of experience was the presence of highly

  experienced                Merseyside        Mounted          Police.          Including

  Superintendent Marshall, Chief Inspector Creaser and Inspectors

  Sykes        and     Purdy,        with the 5 Mounted Officers, provision            was

  made        for     some     53     Uniformed      Officers     at   the Leppings Lane

  entrances          which      number       swelled to 78 upon the arrival of the

  Wadsley Bridge contingent at about 2.15.



  It     is        submitted        that no reasonable relevant criticism can be

  levelled          at the Police planning for this event.                  That problems

  occurred          which led Superintendent Marshall to ask for gates to

  be    opened        should        not be taken as indicative of some planning

  error.           The Policing which was to be carried out was perfectly

  orthodox - no suggestion to the contrary has been made.
  Reference           has     been        made     to     queueing.         In the sense of neat

  lines        to     each turnstile doorway it is submitted that queueing

  was     not        practicable,           was     not       done     and, as Counsel for the

  Inquiry           observed,        "to expect orderly queueing from a football

  crowd        is     to expect something that simply will not ever happen

  and     has        never     happened".           When queueing is spoken of in this

  context it is submitted that what is intended is something like

  that situation which is shown in photograph MWL.10/25A in South

  Yorkshire composite bundle No.l.



^fe?he    nature           of such Policing is such that it depends very much

  upon     the        consent        and co-operation of the public who exercise

  self     control,           listen        to     advice and observe the instructions

  and directions given.                    Such Policing can be vulnerable.                     It can

  be     confounded           and        overcome.            That     is     not to say that the

  situation           or     occasion        is unpoliceable for plainly, depending

  upon     a        preparedness to use a infinite or substantial level of

  force        or     considerable           numbers          of     Police     it    is   not.    The

  surprise, whether forensic or real, which greeted the admission

  that such balanced Policing might fail is, it is submitted, not

  justified.                It fails to recognise that Policing well short of

  saturation          with         men     and     equipment,          cordons       and   barriers,

  coralling           and     dragooning          the        crowds    may be appropriate and

  preferred           -     even     were        the other to be practicable at such a

  place for such an occasion.



  LEPPINGS LANE - WHAT HAPPENED



 Although           Superintendent           Marshall had asked for the closure of

  Leppings           Lane       there       were        no    problems        at     Leppings     Lane
  turnstiles           until           some        time     after 2.30 and more particularly

  from     about        2.40.           The H.S.E. report at page 5, paragraph 4.17

  indicates        a fairly steady flow actually through the turnstiles

  between 2.05 and 2.50.



  There     was however a build-up of people outside and it occurred

  quite     quickly.                   It     contained           a significant and substantial

  element         of            non-ticket           holders,          an   increasing     number     of

  latecomers           and        a considerable number of persons who had taken

  drink.          To        a number of observers it appeared as though there

^ w a s concerted action.                     It was certainly unlike many experienced

  Officers,        including                 those from Merseyside had ever previously

  witnessed.                Such        difficulties              as    occurred     may   have     been

  aggravated           by        the        poor     and confusing signing leading to the

  involvement           of Officers to an unnecessary degree in the giving

  of directions to confused ticket holders.



  NON-TICKET HOLDERS



  These     should           probably              have     been        numberedin     several 100s

  (according           to        Inspector           Sykes        2 000 was "probably nearer the

  mark"     Day        15       page         24H)     and     the general impression is that

  there     were        considerably                 more than might have been expected.

  See     for     example              the accounts of Inspector Sykes and Sergeant

  Proctor       Day         1    page         38F.          The    presence        of the non-ticket

  holders       had     various               consequences              -   therewere those who by

  various devices confounded the turnstiles and their operators -

  there     were        those who attempted to                         buy their way in and had to

  be dealt with or were turned away -there were those who                                     got to

  the     turnstiles              and       went back and, curiously there were those
  who    detached themselves from their fellows, submitted to being

  searched and yet did not enter the ground.



  There were also those who planned to get in with others - to be

  the    recipients            of     tickets thrown out wrapped round coins and

  tickets passed by spectators over the turnstiles as can be seen

  on the video tapes.



  All    the      foregoing           would inhibit the flow of people and cause

  annoyance           and trouble. Additionally there were those who                                  may

ffebe said to have had some stratagem or scheme to get in.



  In    relation         to     the        last-mentioned,            the      very    notion        that

  something           was planned           or    organised to defeat the Police                      and

  embarrass           them          into having to open the gates was, in the early

  stages         of      this         Inquiry,          dealt        with      perhaps        somewhat

 dismissively            and     treated         as     fanciful          by Counsel          for     the

  Inquiry.             Clearly        it     is not a matter upon which it might be

 expected             evidence        would be          readily,          if ever,       available.

 However,        belatedly            it    has        to     some degree emerged and it is

 submitted            that     the    notion           of     a    plan   by    some     to     foment

 difficulty            and     disorder          cannot       be     airily dismissed.              It is

 noted      that       probably        at        the        time that this matter was first

 canvassed         there       was already in the hands of the West Midlands

 Police at least one statement to support such a view.



 That      there       was some concerted effort or some stratagem was an

 impression           that a number of Officers independently had arrived

 at.        It     does account for some of the behaviour of members of

 the crowd and it is consistent with a relentless persistence, a
surging           and     pushing from the back without reason, a disregard

for        advice        and     a        failure     to        heed the repeated requests of

Police Officers - all of which occurred.



The        material       in         the "Yellow           Book"      compiled    by the South

Yorkshire           Police           discloses disturbing intelligence concerning

certain           elements           of     Liverpool           fans - a determination and an

appreciation on the part of such fans of what they can threaten

and can achieve.



[?he       conduct        of     some was           described         as being   like a planned

invasion (PC                         Day 17 page 15E).



It     is        significant that a large number of complaints from many

different               people,           addressed        to     a   considerable   number   of

individuals,              attributed the events of the day to "No Tickets",

and        "No     Tickets, the Wrong End".                      At one stage in the Inquiry

it     was        suggested that such complaints were to do perhaps with

hurt       pride but             that does not bear analysis.                    When death and

injury           have     been       caused it is not credible, it is submitted,

that       thoughts should have been upon hurt or injured pride.                              To

look        for     such an explanation may, it is feared, be indicative

of     a     pre-conceived notion or attitude.                           Is it not more likely

that       the      fans,        who would know better than anyone, were aware

that considerable numbers had been present and had got into the

ground without tickets, having been deprived of the opportunity

of     buying           tickets by reason of the smaller allocation?                      It is

not     unreasonable,                it is submitted, to consider that those who

referred to "No Tickets" were advancing what they identified as

the cause of the events.
  ALCOHOL



  The     Inquiry           has     been provided with various information as to

  the     consumption              of    alcohol            by   Liverpool     supporters in the

  build-up        to        the     match.              There are the impressions of local

  residents,           some        of whom found their gardens visited more than

  usually by urinators and others of whom found their refuse bins

  unusually        full           with        empty      cans     of   alcohol,      a     noticeable

  proportion           of     which        had      previously         contained         the stronger

  brands     of        beer        and        lager.         In discussions, Counsel for the

^^Enquiry       spoke of records provided by supermarkets giving their

  alcohol       sales         in     the morning and early afternoon of the 15th

  April     1989       that         show       very         high and speedy takings for such

  beers and lagers - these records are yet to be produced.                                     There

  are     thetestimonies                 of     seasoned         and   experienced         Police

  Officers: for his part, Sergeant Smith gave this account at Day

  16, page 64E:



           "I have not seen in my experience that amount of drinking

          going        on     in        the     streets prior to a football match.                  I

          speak        now        not     only from my experience of Liverpool.                     I

          have     been           to football matches in Manchester, Birmingham

          and      London,          and I have not seen that amount of drinking

          going         on         in         the       streets        prior    to        a   game".



 Such     material,           though           disparate         in    source, speaks with one

 voice,     namely           that consumption of alcohol in quantity by some

 Liverpool        supporters              was       a       factor at this year's event that

 marked it as different from the circumstances that attended the

 1988 Semi-Final Cup tie.



                                                        9
In our submission, that factor is material to any consideration

of what happened on the 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough for two

reasons:            firstly,           it        accords           with        the     body     of   evidence

suggesting           that        this        year's match was different also for the

large     numbers          of         supporters              presenting             themselves       at   the

Leppings        Lane       end         later than usual, if not in fact late.                               In

this     connection,                 the attention of the Inquiry is drawn to the

evidence of Messrs Sykes, Purdy, Duffy, Best and Crawford given

respectively              at     Day        15        page     11D        and page 24B, Day 15 page

48B,     Day        15     page 88H, Day 15 page 103D and Day 16 page 100B;

secondly,        where           the        Police           had        placed proper reliance upon

Policing        with       the consent of the crowd, it made a significant

element        of        that        crowd less willing to do as counselled - for

example,        queue, await its turn - and more ready to                                        engage upon

unhelpful           activities              of        its own            volition, such as pushing,

diving        under        horses           and       thereby            frustrating           the strenuous

efforts of the Police to manage and                                     order the crowd in front of

Leppings        Lane turnstiles.                      In this           connection, the Police face

the     dilemma of deploying manpower to eject and/or arrest those

who     are     fired           by     alcohol           or        of     allowing           such persons to

continue their obstructive behaviour as part of the crowd.



LATENESS



Any     lateness          by numbers of supporters cannot be accounted for

by     traffic           conditions              or    problems and, it is submitted, can

only    be     attributed               to       their         own conduct and choice.                 As to

traffic,         see            particularly             the         account           of     Superintendent

Brougham       Day         12        beginning          page            110,     and        compare the 1988

experience.
UNCO-OPERATIVE BEHAVIOUR



For     whatever           reason, be it a design, the effect of alcohol or

simple        selfish           arrogance,        it     is   plain     that      there     was   a

considerable              relentless           disregard of the safety and wellbeing

of     others        by        some     fans.          Care    should be adopted when the

conduct        of        some     of     those       fans     is   perhaps euphemistically

described           as     "boisterous",             "happy",      "merry".         There was a

persistent,              heedless        pressing on by fans, the forcing open of

the     L e p p i n g s g a t e s ,                                a   squeezing      under and

between        Police           horses, a thrusting into the throng, a surging

at     its    back         and        the climbing of side fences by the river to

endeavour to get into the crowd at its front from the side.



The state of the crowd cannot, it is submitted, be explained by

frustration              and     an individual concern that the kick-off might

be     missed.             Frustration           and    anxiety,       having to wait, must

confront        most           people     at     some    time.     They do not ordinarily

respond       by         pushing and shoving, by throwing themselves into a

mass     of people, under horses disregarding the Police their own

safety and the repeated tannoy and public address requests.



Even     if     such           conduct could be so explained by frustration or

exasperation              it     is     submitted       that such behaviour and to the

extent        encountered              on that day could not reasonably have been

anticipated              and,         when      it     occurred,       it   was    not in     the

circumstances possible to                               deal with it.



The    methods           of     dealing or attempting to deal with thecrowds

were orthodox and in accordance with normal practice.
MOUNTED POLICE



As     regards     the        disposition of Mounted Police, not long after

2.35     pm     many,        if     not    most of the 13 horses deployed at the

Leppings Lane end were used to supplement the blue wrought-iron

perimeter gates, by way of further physical barrier restraining

spectators from joining the large and massing crowd in front of

the     turnstiles.                In     our    submission,       this was a proper and

reasonable        use        of        the Mounted Police.         Indeed, at one stage,

this     ploy     caused           a     gap to appear between that crowd and the

Mounted       Police         (see        Day 16 page 61G).         If such a disposition

was     not ultimately effective, that is eloquent evidence of the

determined        and        unreasoning          mood    of   a    crowd   with the sole

apparent        intent        of getting into the ground.               No doubt, having

by     choice     forced           open     the gates or "negotiated" the horses,

groups of those supporters did not hold back from pushing their

way     into the crowd before the turnstiles.                        In this connection,

the     reaction        of        the animals themselves should not be ignored

and provides an interesting and useful gauge of the mood of the

crowd after 2.40 pm.                   For example, Police Constable Grunhill, a

very     experienced           Officer with an experienced mount, gave this

evidence on Day 16 at page 85C:



         "Some     of        the agile supporters got underneath him.                He's

        very      sound           and he has done a lot of ground, but even he

        got a bit agitated with that, people popping up all round

        him              the Merseyside Police horses would not walk in;

        they      had     had          enough.      The    only     way I got him to go

        backwards            towards       that    gate (one of the blue perimeter

        gates) was to rein him backwards".
  So     far as any danger posed by the use of Mounted Police at the

  Leppings          Lane        end     is     concerned,           the    only     accounts of any

  injuries          in     fact        sustained        from the horses are those of one

  spectator         whose         toe was fractured and of Sergeant Proctor who

  was     kicked.          In truth, the situation that obtained in front of

  the     Leppings Lane turnstiles after 2.40 pin was a dangerous one

  and     of the kind that as much threat to life and limb was posed

  by human agency than any other source of potential danger.



  Further,          in     our        submission,           some     of    the spectators were a

^^danger         towards          themselves           where       the    Mounted       Police     were

  concerned         -      particular             reference         is made to the accounts of

  Messrs       Hand-Davis,              Sykes,        Ellis        and    Grunhill      all     of whom

  describe          remarkable              scenes     of     spectators          diving      under the

  bellies of the horses.



  The     Inquiry's             attention          is respectfully drawn to the account

  given by Inspector Hand-Davis and to paragraph 1.43 of the ACPO

  Guide        to        Policing           football     matches          as   giving      sufficient

  justification             for        the     further        use and deployment of Mounted

  Police to control crowds approaching turnstiles.



  CORDONS



  It     has     been       said in some quarters that a filtering system or

  cordoning         off         should       have      been practised.            Even if that was

  practicable (and it would have had to have been upon and across

  a     public      highway            in    at      least     2    places     and enforced by a

  preparedness             to     carry        out arrests) it would have had to have

  been     carried          out in streets bordered by dwellings and private
property.           It     may     be that such would simply to have been to

have      removed        the     problem      further         along the road.     It would

still      have required co-operation on the part of the spectators

to      have        been effective              and         would   have    considerable

implications.              The     Inquiry       is    invited to conclude upon the

material before it that it is not satisfied that such cordoning

or     filtering had ever been practised although it is plain that

individual Officers or numbers of Officers undoubtedly did make

random checks upon individuals to ascertain whether or not they

were      ticket holders.           Quite what should be done with those who
flacked     tickets        or     insisted on walking along the road or gave

the     reasonable         excuse       that they were expecting to meet their

friend who would be waiting at the gates with a ticket for them

is     unclear.          To      have    arrested           individuals    without proper

justification            would      have its          own     problems     and    the   very

arresting        itself        would     have     severe       manpower     implications.

However,        on the material available the Police did endeavour to

move      off   non-ticket          holders and encourage others to get into

the ground.



STEWARDING /POLICING - THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CLUB FOR SAFETY



In the Police Review for the 16th of August 1985, Lock recorded

his     "regretful         experience"          as a former Police Superintendent

responsible          for        Policingfootball              matches      held    in South

Yorkshire as follows:



          "......frequently             the   Police take it upon themselves to

         assume      stewards duties.                 This is not acceptable.           Some

          football       clubs      pay    only       lip     serviceto    stewarding,
              offering          derisory           salaries,        so it is not surprising to

              find       the     least           able employed in those positions .....

              Clubs       must be forced to employ fit, able-bodied, trained

              persons in those positions and not just match watchers."



  In     his        account          to     the     Inquiry,        Lock     recognised   that the

  physical           abilities of the stewards employed at Hillsborough by

  the Club are restricted by their ages (Day 31 page 48 at A ) .



  Further,           many       of the stewards in attendance at the Semi-Final

^Pties        this year received no more than £9 for carrying out their

  duties (page 141 of the Club Bundle) .



  Our     submission             is        that     such a meagre sum reflects the basic

  limited           nature       of        the     tasks     in     fact     carried out by those

  stewards.              In broad terms, the job of stewards at Hillsborough

  is     to        help people to go wherever their ticket directed them -

  for     example,             the        full-time        job     of a West stand steward was

  described by one witness as telling spectators which rows their

  seats are on (Day 21 page 116G).



  Moreover,             this job is not begun at the Leppings Lane end until

  a     spectator           presents          himself        at     the     foot of the stairways

  leading          to     the        West        stand.          There     are no stewards in the

  forecourt             between           the blue perimeter gates and the turnstiles

  (Day        21     at page 82G), nor any stewards at the turnstiles (Day

  21 page 82F).              Similarly, on the occasion of the Semi-Final tie

  this year, there were no stewards in the concourse area between

  the    turnstiles              and        the     West    stand stairways - except for a

  solitary steward, without instructions as to giving directions,
  stood     at     the     gateway          in the wall running between Gate B and

  Gate C.        Lastly, there were no stewards on the Terraces.



  The     slightness        and       simplicity       of    the   role     played     by the

  stewards        has     increased          the burden upon the Police and led to

  the     apparent        assumption          of    duties    adverted to by Lock.         In

  effect, the Police are left to direct spectators to the correct

  turnstile            sections,       to     check    spectators     for     tickets,     to

  persuade        and     cajole spectators to the outer Pens (Day 31 page

  55F),     to     evacuate spectators from the West stand (Day 21 page

^^31C)     and     to     concern       themselves with the gates at the top of

  the     radial        fences       on the Leppings Lane Terraces (Day 21 page

  32C) .



  Indeed,        the     imbalance          of function between the Police and the

  Club's     stewards          has     caused such a reliance to be placed upon

  the     former by the Club that Lock stated that he would quiz the

  Police,        as the responsible party as it were, if he noticed the

  ground to be filling slowly (Day 31 page 68F).



  Again,     in our submission, this reliance may have been fostered

  for    two reasons: firstly, so far as the Club is concerned, the

  Police        have       successfully            managed   their    games     and,     more

  particularly,          met        the difficulties posed by the topography of

  the    Leppings Lane end (see the account of Stuart Thorpe at Day

  21     page      47A);       secondly,       to     the    extent   that    the      Police

  stewarded,       the      Club       is    relieved from training fit and able-

  bodied     stewards          to    carry     out the multiplicity of stewarding

  tasks identified below.
  At    Chapter           4,      paragraph           4.13    of     his final       reportprepared

  following            the       Bradford        Fire        Disaster, Mr Justice Popplewell

  identified this dangerous misconception:



             "Because,           as     a matter of practice, Police Officers have

             regularly           attended in large numbers at football grounds,

             it     has        somehow        been     assumed      by    the      Clubs   that the

             responsibility              for     control       of    what goes on inside the

             ground has passed from them to the Police".



^^The       evidence           given     by Mackrell suggest that this assumption

  has been made by the Club.                         On Day 3 0 at page 116D he stated:



             "The       Police        were      operating the system themselves.                The

             Police       had         never     come     back to me at any time and said

             hang       on,     the      Green       Guide     says you have got to do the

             stewarding.            We are not going to do it any more".



  In    short,          soon after publication of the 1986 Green Guide, the

  impetus         for     changing        what may have gone on in the ground was

  to    be    provided, if by anyone, according perhaps to the Club's

 view, by the Police who in effect were there for monitoring, as

  an ongoing concern, the safety of crowds attending Hillsborough

  football stadium.



 As     a    matter of generalisation, the 1986 Green Guide states at

 Chapter          2,    paragraph         23 that the safety of the public inside

 the    ground          is the responsibility of those who stage the event

 and        administer           the     ground        in    which       it   is    held   ie   the

 "management".               This      responsibility          applies in both normal and
emergency       situations.               With specific regard to stewarding the

1986 Green Guide makes the following matters plain:



        (i)       Effective           stewarding          should prevent overcrowding

                  in     sections           of   the      ground        (preface to Chapter

                  13) ;



        (ii)     Basic duties stewards are called upon to carry                         out

                  include        "controlling             or directing members of the

                  public       who are entering or leaving the ground, to

^                 help achieve an even flow of people to the viewing

                  areas        and        safe   dispersal         of    spectators on the

                  terraces           or     "viewing slopes" and "patrolling the

                  ground       to         deal   with any emergencies".            (Chapter

                  13, paragraph 195(a) and (b));



        (iii)    Stewards        should          prevent overcrowding by ensuring

                  that     the        crowd      limits     in     various parts of     the

                  ground        are        complied       with     (Appendix     B, Section

                  2 (i ) ) •



None ofthese responsibilities is                          set out in similar terms or

at   all in     the original Green Guide and their inclusion as part

of the 198 6 publication marks the new emphasis placed after the

Bradford       Fire     Disaster          upon      the   primary        duty   of Clubs to

safeguard       those     admitted           into     their      grounds and onto their

stadia through the agency of competent and fully-trained safety

stewards.



In   the context of Hillsborough, such emphasis should have done
  no    more     than reinforce the general duties allocated to safety

  stewards       by        Section        9        of     the 1979 Safety Certificate.                 The

  absence       of        reference           to        stewards      upon     the        Leppings     Lane

  terraces       at        Schedule           3,        Part   2 of the Certificate does not

  absolve       the        Club     of        its        responsibility,            as     identified by

  Paragraph          195(b)        of     the           1986 Green Guide, for the safety of

  spectators upon those terraces.



  The    Safety           Certificate cannot and should not be regarded as a

  synthesis          of     the     Green           Guide's        particular            application    to
#^Hillsborough
    .
                            football           stadium         even     less        as     a
                                                                                                 ...
                                                                                               definitive

  statement of how the Club was to discharge its duties.                                          Rather,

  at    all     times,        the        Club           - like any commercial organisation,

  which is run for profit, organising a private function - should

  be regarded as having the primary and continuing obligation and

  responsibility             to     ensure              reasonable safety for those who are

  invited       onto its premises.                       Some recognition was given to this

  responsibility             by     the        Club       document,          "Use        and Training of

  Stewards"          -     stated        only       to be for "management information".

  The attention of the Inquiry is once more respectfully drawn to

  Sections 1, 3 and 8 of that document.



  In    contra           distinction, the Popplewell Report, the Green Guide

  and    the     Safety Certificate identify the Police's primary duty

  as    to     secure        and preserve law and order.                       This is set out in

  unequivocal            terms      at Chapter 4, paragraph 4.15 of the Report.

  Similarly,             Section     7    of the Safety Certificate provides that

  the   holder shall at his own expense arrange for the attendance

  of an adequate number of Police Officers "to secure the orderly

  and lawful behaviour of the spectators".
  These        few        statements              of        what     is the proper and appropriate

  division           of responsibility between the stewards and the Police

  may not concur with what the Inquiry might consider was in fact

  undertaken              by these two bodies of men.                        What the Police did or

  did     not        do        in        the past, the acceptance by Officers in their

  accounts of a "responsibility" or of a function does not in law

  determine           that           responsibility.                   The    Police   were    not sub­

  contracting stewards on behalf of the Club.                                      Even if they could

  properly           in law take on that role it could only be done in the

  clearest           of terms.              Whilst Lock spoke of the existence of some

^agreement            to       some         such        effect        (in    the   absence    of    clear

  suggestion              thereof           in        his     statement       and the novelty of its

  suggestion              at        so     late        a stage in the Inquiry apart) such is

  refuted        by the Police who crave leave to refer, in particular,

  to     the     statement,                 of        Superintendent Chapman, dated 3rd July

  1989     which           has           been     served           upon the Inquiry and is annexed

  hereto.             It is understood in any event that the Club does not

  so assert.



  The     better           explanation                 for     the     variance between theory and

  practice       may be found, with respect, upon consideration of the

  most     pertinent                area         of     immediate        concern    to this Inquiry,

  namely        crowd          control            on        the Leppings Lane terraces.            If the

  division        of       responsibility, stewards to Police, is decided in

  fact according to where stewards were placed - for example, the

  safety stewards had little concern for the safety of spectators

  in     the West stand, except when an emergency arose (Day 21 page

  117D)     -     so       too the decision as to where stewards were placed

  was     determined                 in     large part by their fear of going onto the

  Leppings       Lane terraces.                        Perhaps the most eloquent evidence in
  support       of     this        last       submission was the reaction that Chief

  Inspector          Calvert's           address        to     the    stewards       at the annual

 meeting of 1981 prompted.



 Is     the     assertion           that        those        terrace are a "no-go area" for

 stewards        good        or any justification for causing them to be the

 preserve        of the Police?                 Stewards worked upon the Spion Kop at

 the     Semi-Final           tie        this    year        amongst       away    fans where the

 anticipation             was of Liverpool supporters having some Spion Kop

 tickets and therefore of their mingling with "rival fans".                                     One

^Lay     query        whether           the     Policeman's          lot   is     likely    to *be a

 happier        one than a steward's upon terraces.                             Indeed, if such a

 steward        is     fit        and able-bodied there is no reason to suppose

 that     he might not effectively discharge his tasks.                                Evidently,

 some     football           clubs       had     regarded stewards as having greater

 potential           than their present deployment at Sheffield Wednesday

 might        suggest        -     see,       for     example        the reference to Chelsea

 Football        Club        in     Lock's       Police        Review      article referred to

 above.



 In     like     manner, we submit that the suggestion that the Police

 were         somehow         agents            for      the         Clubin       meeting    its

 responsibilities                 for    the     safety        of stewards on the Leppings

 Lane     terraces           cannot be accepted or regarded as justification

 for,     in effect, not actively managing that part of the ground.

 There        was no agreement between Police and Club to give rise to

 such an agency.              In any event, the "agency argument" is no more

 than     the        practical realisation of the dangerous misconception

 identified          by     Mr     Justice          Popplewell         and is contrary to the

 spirit,        if    not        the     letter, of the 1986 Green Guide.                   To the
  extent        that the Inquiry may entertain the notion of a de facto

  agency,        this can and should not absolve the de facto, and here

  de jure, principal (the Club) from its overall responsibility.



  Where        the     Club faces responsibility in matters of safety that

  could        not     be        assumed         by any other agency, our submission is

  that     in        material          respects         the Club failed to meet them.           In

  particular,              as     regards         the     role    and importance of a Safety

  Officer and in relation to sign-posting within the ground.



^^Ef     Lock        was        the    Safety       Officer       at     the Inquiry, the chief

  steward        for the West stand, namely Stuart Thorpe, was the only

  person        to     consider            him     as such.       That said, it would appear

  both     from        the Police Review article and from Section 1 of the

  Local        Plan        that       at    some       previous        occasion    Lock   had been

  regarded, if only by himself, as Safety and Security Consultant

  to the Club.



  If Mackrell was the Safety Officer, he described himself in his

  account        to the Inquiry as Chief Executive for the Club, rather

  than     in        addition         its        Safety    Officer.         On the information

 presently            available,            it    would     appear       that     Mackrell had no

  special        expertise            in    matters        of safety.       Further, one might

 query         the    wisdom          of    having        the same person acting as Chief

 Executive           and        as    Safety Officer where the ensuring of safety

 may     be a costly process - please see again Minutes of Meetings

  in     the Club Bundle which indicate that expense was a deterrent

 to installing further turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end.



 So      far    as     sign-posting               is    concerned        this     was a matter of
  particular           importance        where, as indicated above there were no

  stewards        in     the        concourse    and     the     solitary steward at the

  gateway        in     the wall running between Gates B and C was without

  instruction.           Complaint had been made about the sign-posting at

  earlier        annual        meetings (see the evidence of Stuart Thorpe at

  Day     21     page        38B), though it would appear that such complaint

  fell     on deaf ears.              In consequence, at the Semi-Final tie this

  year     the        only     way    people     were likely to get onto the North

  standing        area        was     if they happened to see the steward at the

  gateway        and     he     was    pointing        towards    that area or by going

^^through        the     tunnel,        onto    the centre Pens and then filtering

  along        (see     Day 21       page       4OF).    The inadequacy of this sign­

  posting        gave        rise to        a    potential for       overcrowding in the

  central Pens.



  USPPINGS LANE TERRACE



  Given that the supporters were all of the same persuasion there

  was     no question of any segregation occurring, the whole of the

  terracing        being        available for their use.            Additionally it was

  an     all     ticket match           and      unlikely that       the capacity of the

  terraces       would        be     exceeded.      As in 1988       the Police were not

  intending to fulfil nor had any arrangement been made that they

  should perform any stewarding role.



  The    giving         of a choice to spectators as to where to stand may

  be    mistaken.              The fact is that the Club took no steps on the

  day     in     question           in the discharge of its obligations to those

  who purchased Leppings Lane terrace tickets.
  The     situation on the terraces can be observed from the videos,

  the     photographs                and        the        accounts         of     those who were there.

  Whatever           view       is     expressed                 thereon         will be determined by a

  number        of     individual                and        perhaps peculiar factors including

  one's previous experience, if any, one's standpoint (whether in

  a particular part of the crowd), one's sensitivity, the time of

  assessment,              (whether             it        is contemporaneously with the events

  or,     for        example,          the           result        of having been present at this

  Inquiry)           and    the        criteria employed.                    At the end it cannot be

  more     than        an       impression                 and     the impression may be that the

^^central        Pens       still           had           some     room     by      2.46.    Such however,

  because        of the distribution may have been entirely wrong.                                      The

  accounts           by various fans may not be easily reconciled but they

  were there. Ian Clark spoke of Pen 3 being quite full with room

  for another 100 and feeling "slightly squashed when the players

  came     on,like          at Anfield".                   Diane          Connolly spoke of it being

  crowded        bya quarter to three saying it was                                    "like an ordinary

  match     day             when           it        is     packed".Mr Moody spoke of it being

  uncomfortably             full           at        2.48        and   Mr    Postlethwaite        of being

  anxious        for       his own safety at 2.40.                          Clearly the density will

  vary from place to place and from moment to moment.                                           There were

  accounts by fans of no problems before kick-off.



  It is submitted that if the Pens were overcrowded at some stage

  Police        Control          are not to be criticised for not noticing what

  no one else saw.



  As     soon     as       it    was        appreciated that there was a problem the

  Police        reacted          and       the        perimeter           gates      were     opened.   The

  photographic             and       video           material          shows       that     the gates were
  opened       certainly          by     2.59     and that by then       numbers of people

  were     already           out       on    theperimeter       track.    That any    Police

  Officer            ignoredwhat            he   saw     to   be    a problem is resisted,

  although the            speed        with which it nature was appreciated may,

  for     some, have been conditioned by thoughts of ground security

  and     pitch          invasion.          The Liverpool goalkeeper's account, not

  tested       by    cross-examination,                is plainly wrong in a number of

  respects,         showing on his part an understandable pre-occupation

  with     the       game.           Whatever        efforts are made to reconcile his

  recollection            with     the       accounts of others it is plain that he

^^ras obliviousof any problems until well                          intothe game and when

  play was down             at the Forestend.



  We     invite      the     view,          having     regard      to the accounts that no

  conclusion         could safely           be drawn but that once opened,           (save in

  respect           of     what Mr Smith         did),        any of the gates were again

  closed      and        that      in Mr Smith'scase what            happened is credible

  and     explicable.              In his case no conclusion, it is contended,

  could       fairly       be     drawn      that his closing of Gate 3 had any or

  any other than momentary effect.



  The     presence         and     concern of the Police was for public order,

  but not such as to preclude them from activity and intervention

  in    the      event       of peril or hurt appearing or appearing likely.

  When such was perceived they acted.



  There     was      some        suggestion       that Police Officers had actually

  thrust people back into the crowd, and assaulted and beat them.

 We     contend that no conclusion to that effect can reasonably be

  arrived      at.        If the accounts thereof have any credibility, and
that      is      disputed,           they     are     not     supported       aliunde,      no

photographic or video material to that effect has been seen and

they     may     be the result of incorrectly perceiving what in fact

was     being     done.          We    submit        that     there is no force in the

criticism that the Police should have been tuned to looking for

overcrowding        or     to have immediately recognised the reason why

individuals        were     coming       out     of     the        Pens.     When     it   was

understood        that     individuals          were        being hurt and crushed the

Officers acted.



^RADIAL AND PERIMETER GATES



The     first     radial     fences       were introduced to improve Policing

following        1981.     The provision of gates in them was, so far as

the Police were concerned, necessary to provide access for them

and,     when     segregation was being practised, the gates would be

closed     in    which      circumstances,             as     described       by     Inspector

Calvert        they would be attended by the Police.                        That such gates

were     ever     agreed by the Police to be constantly manned is not

the     Police understanding.             Mr Calvert the only witness who was

actually present at the various occasions when the matter arose

has     given    his      unequivocal          account.            Not only was it not so

understood, it was not so practised.



The     perimeter        gates    were        attended        by     the    Police    but for

Policing purposes.



The     value on the day of the perimeter gates as constructed for

other     than    Police access is most debatable.                         In fact by their

size     and     the      approach       to    then         they    may    have     proved   a
  disadvantage rather than a benefit.



  COMMAND AND CONTROL



  The     account of what happened in the control box has been given

  by     those who were there.             Their attention was not only focused

  upon        the    Leppings      Lane    terraces   nor upon the Leppings Lane

  entrances           although       by     degrees   the        latter   assumed   more

  importance.



^^As     to     what was happening at the Leppings Lane entrance whilst

  the     impression         may have been of numbers it was not, certainly

  at     an early stage one of risk to life and limb.                     That occurred

  when        the   mood,     as    it    has been put, changed.          At 2.3 0 it is

  submitted          it    would    be    difficult   to fault a decision not to

  postpone          the    kick-off.       Thereafter       it    may be difficult to

  identify a time when such a decision might have been considered

  to be reached in time to have made any difference.



 When     PC Buxton was asking for it the problem at the turnstiles

 was perhaps demanding more instant relief.



  COMMUNICATIONS



 The difficulties of the day were compounded by a communications

 problem        but       those    problems were not peculiar to the Police.

 The     radios of others were affected.              Communication on the Club

 radio        was     thwarted      and   difficulties were experienced by the

 Ambulance          Service.       No fault has in fact been found in any of

 the     equipment.         The problem may have been one of the amount of
  air     traffic,          it     does     not appear to have been related to any

  particular          part of the ground.                The equipment was orthodox and

  its     manner       of        usage, on talk-through, well practised.                    Radio

  equipment plainly has its limitations and even when functioning

  has to compete with the external noise.



  COMMUNICATION



  Chief       Superintendent              Duckenfield has given his account of his

  understanding             of the peril of Leppings Lane entrances.                       He had

^ ^ a life threatening situation at the turnstiles, the result of a

  throng in a narrow space and the requests of an experienced and

  valued       Officer,           Superintendent          Marshall, for the gates to be

  opened.           Beyond the gates was ample space.                      The opening of the

  gates       would run counter to Policing policy.                        To open the gates

  whilst perhaps the obvious course was not a decision, it may be

  said     easily          taken.          In    the circumstances, whilst foresight

  (essentially             the     result       of     hindsight)     might      suggest     that

  various           matters        should       have     entered     his    mind,   his     pre­

  occupation was with the safety of those outside.                               It is perhaps

  too     easy       here        to say what else he should have done.                 He gave

  the order to open the gates.



  CRUSHING



  Given       the    propensity           in the terraces for fans to sway, surge

  and     move       and     that     such       actions     are,     it    is   arguable, in

  themselves         potentially           highly        dangerous     (whether or not any

  barrier        fails       should       anyone lose their footing or faint), it

  may    be      difficult to form any reliable view as to how and when
  any     particular              injury        or       death       was    in     fact       caused-    The

  situation           may       be     simple         or     may      be highly complex, but the

  substantial              injuries          and      death         would       appear    to     have been

  sustained           in     Pen       3     and      below the area protected by barrier

  124A.          To        arrive at a view that because people went into the

  tunnel       upon         the       opening         of     Gate      C    injuries or death were

  thereby        caused would require a detailed investigation the like

  of     which        has       not,       on      the      occasion        of     this Inquiry, been

  attempted.            Whilst perhaps convenient and for certain purposes

  attractive such a simplistic view would not, it is submitted be

^^justified.               This        has      not        been      a trial nor is there, it is

  submitted,               the          material             available           upon         which     such

  conclusions           might even be tentatively based.                             Whilst it may be

  considered           that          notions         such      as     the burden and standard of

  proof       may      impede          the      Inquiry process, the fact is that they

  have     not        featured          and        that what has been done has been done

  whilst evidence and further material are still being sought and

  gathered.           Speculation            will        not        suffice      although        it may be

  interesting              to         ponder         what           satisfactory         or    sufficient

  explanation           or explanations can be given for, as appears to be

 the      case,       some           deaths having occurred to individuals who may

 have      come       in        at     the      second opening of Gate C.                     The Inquiry

 cannot,       it      is        submitted permit the conclusions post hoc ergo

 propter hoc.



 As to the positions in which people may have died we urge that,

 as     has    been indicated will be the case, there should be taken

 into     account           the       material           supplied          by    the South Yorkshire

 Police in relation to Pen 3.
  ACTIONS



  Criticism is made of the Police action taken upon the nature of

  the     problem        being realised.                In this context it is urged that

  it was not unreasonable for there to have been no specific plan

  to     deal     with     such        an     event.       It was not foreseen.        When it

  occurred        it was horrendous and outside anyones expectation but

  Police        Officers        at     different levels displayed initiative and

  acted     whether        or        not they had been previously or were at the

  material        time     under instruction and direction.                      Officers went

^^to the tunnel within moments and made endeavours to relieve the

  throng        and bring out casualties.                   Such was done quite quickly.

  The     perimeter        gates           were     opened,       people were helped up and

  out.      Endeavours were made to cause the crowd to go back which

  endeavours were not it seems understood or immediately complied

  with.         Many in the crowd were oblivious that any incident let

  alone     some       tragedy        had         occurred although they were close to

  it.



  A     major     incident        was        set     in    train,       operation support was

  called,       Ambulance            and    help was summoned.             In so far as there

  was     chaos or confusion that, in the earlier stages, is perhaps

  understandable.                People           did     their    best     in   many instances

  without        regard     for       their        personal convenience or wellbeing.

  Officers,        Messrs       Nesbitt, Greenwood and McKay for example set

  about         arranging       and        organising.            The     emergency   services

  attended       and      it must, in the light of the material available,

  be     doubtful      whether any lives or injuries would or could have

  been     saved       in the circumstances by any other course of action

  once it was realised that people were trapped and crushed.
  EMERGENCY SERVICES



  In     our submission, close analysis of the accounts given to the

  Inquiry         reveal            that       such    obstacles      as    may    have presented

  themselves             to        emergency        vehicles (for example, non-emergency

  vehicles          blocking              in    part    an   access        route   or advertising

  hoardings             on       the perimeter of the pitch) were temporary or no

  impediment.                    Most significantly, the attention of the Inquiry

  is     respectfully                drawn to the account given by Station Officer

  Higgins         at         Day     24    page        49C where he stated that, so far as

^^SYMAS Ambulances were concerned:



             "I     think it went as smoothly using the first entrance as

             it would have done using the in-out method"



  and      then         also        to the account given by Station Officer Easson

  on Day 24 at page 68E which suggests that the in-out method may

  have      been         available             to   such Ambulances from the first or at

  least       from           a     stage       earlier than Station Officer Higgins was

  himself aware of.

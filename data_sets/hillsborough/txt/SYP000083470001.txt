              On Saturday              9 A p r i 1,      1988,        ( 0 9 0 4 8 8 ) , I w a s y^fetai led              to    perform           d u t y at

              between Liverpool                     FC   and N o t t i n g a h m     fyirest F C .

              I w as       in    c h a r ge     of a     s e r i al    at    this/event         and       my    duties              were    to     c o ve r

              the      turnstiles             numbered        9--16 at Jfhe L e p p i n g s              Lane       side       of     the     ground,

              on the        inside         of    the     ground.

              At      11 a m     <1100)         t ha t   d a t e , fallowing          briefing            and       refreshments,                 my

              s e ri a l   and        I t oo k      up   d u t i es    on    the    inside      of       the    g r o u n d , at           turnstiles

              9-16.         To    the      b es t    of m y      recollection,            one    or       two       of    these         turnstiles,

              were      for      ticket         holders       for      the    seated area and                  to       prevent         other

              ticket        holders           for    the    terraces          from    entering            into          the    seated         stand
area,      there           were    two m e t a l           barriers             placed       between          the      turnstile           wall

and    a dividing              fence.

This     side         of    the    ground was                designated               for    the       Liverpool            supporters

a n d as     they          entered        th e       ground,             the    officers          on m y      serial         and     I,    made

random       searches             for     illegal           articles             etc.

On    several          occasions             we      were       informed          by    the       turnstile            operators,           that

supporters             were       attempting               to     enter         the    ground          without         tickets,           but

there      w as       no    evidence            of    t hi s      on our a r r i v a l            at    the      turnstile.

At    1.50       pm    (1350)          t ha t     d ate,        I assisted             another          officer         in e j e c t i n g      a

m an who       was         believed          to      have       entered          the    ground without                  a J-ijjket

Apar t from            the     enquiries              from        f an s       asking       where       part i c ul ar         terraces         or

stands       w ere,         they were             not      directed             to a n y     one       terrace.

Near    to       these       turnstiles,                were         two       sets    of    toilets          and      on    numerous

occasions             my    officers            and     I had            to m o v e    countless             fans      on,     who      were

stood      outside           the       toilets,            urinating             against          the w all.            This       continued

up u n t i l      kick-off             time ,        when       the       rear    of    the       terraces            and    stands

c 1e a r e d .

This    particular                problem again                   reared         it's       ugly       h e a d at      h alf      time,     when

not    only were             the       fans       urinating                 outside         the    toilet        walls,           but

were    stood          on    the       upper         terraces             urinating          into       the a r e a         directly

behind       the       stands.




At 3 . 5 5       pm    (1555)          t ha t     d a t e , officers              of m y      s e r i al

and myself             went       up    i nto        the    seated area above                      the       terraces,            where

fans    from          the    l owe r      terracing               were         being    helped          up    into      the W e s t

Stand      seating           a r ea .        There         w as      a    number       of    fans       t h at    had a l r e a d y

dispersed amongst                      the      crowd,          but       15 to S O         persons          were      ejected          from

the    ground          for    their          actions.

At    4.-5       pm    <1605)          t ha t     date,         my       serial       was    di re ct ed         to    the S pi on Kop,

             we a r r i v e d at       t hi s    location         there       w as    no    fighting       taking      place.          It

             was    shortly after               t hi s   t ha t   I t oo k        refreshments.            My    s e ri al    and    I then

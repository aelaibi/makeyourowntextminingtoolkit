TAYLOR REPORT

I attach a copy of the second revision of the draft statement
which you sent me late this morning, on which I have
incorporated somesuggested amendments. I have numbered the
paragraphs for convenience. I have taken account of comments
from Mr Moriarty, Mr Mower and Mr Goddard.
2. Mr Mower has suggested the amendments to paragraphs 2 and
3. The former aims to give a more reasoned explanation for
leaving the membership scheme to the end of the statement, the
latter to bring in the role of the football industry early.
3. Paragraph 6 perhaps deserves more discussion. Taylor also
offers section 6(2) of the 1975 Act as machinery for all- „
seater stadia - we are not sure if it is wide enough. Section
II of the Football Spectators Act covers only football.His
recommendation goes to Scottish football and national stadia.
Moreover a firm statement that we accept his timing mav. for
good reasons, be unattainable at one or two grounds. The
earlier draft "we propose to bring it about" might offer less
hostage to fortune.

4. Also on paragraph 6 we have heard from Treasury officials
that they would like Treasury Ministers to be consulted. Is
it essential to draw attention to the details of the financial
issues?

5. In paragraphs 14 and 16 we think the Home Secretary may
wish to point more to the future about any possible
implementation of a scheme.

6.   Mr Mower thinks paragraph 15 may be best Omitted.
7. In paragraph 16 we wonder if Popplewell's final
recommendation that "consideration should continue tp be given
to some form of membership scheme" is sufficiently strong to
be quoted.

8. The other amendments are largely drafting?   -I-will, of
course, explain if necessary.

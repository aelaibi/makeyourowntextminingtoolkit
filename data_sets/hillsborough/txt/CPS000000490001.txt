Dear Madam

This letter is being written at the express request o f Akw. JoaesQCan&he has askedthat if at
all possible you consider it personally. This is because he takes the view that thr iti rnaiwin i~
very unusual perhaps unique and delicate enough to warrant your personal attention.

For some time now the HFSG has been trying to get originals of witness statements taken
either for the Taylor Inquiry or the Inquest or by a Police Force. A private prosecution
alleging inter alia manslaughter has now been commenced by way of summons and obviously
this makes it even more important we should have access to those originals. It is clear that, to
put it at its lowest there are significant amendments to statements and your office we are sure,
has not always been given the unamended statements. The degree of amendments is
significantly greater than we put to Stuart-Smith LJ so we are not simply as it were re-hashing
that point.

For the first time by letter dated 24 July and received here 31st we have now been told that
“for storage purposes” all the originals are now with the South Yorkshire Police. This is the
force that employed the Defendants and whose behaviour is at the core of the incidents. It
was not the investigating force nor did it take the majority of statements. Alun Jones has
asked that you consider the propriety of this arrangement and that you ensure that, if it is to
continue, what restrictions/security arrangements ought to control access to the material.

Mr Jones is presently in Spain otherwise he would have been in touch personally but I can say
this letter is being sent with his approval following a phone call between him and me.

On a general point Mr Jones is anxious that any momentous decision such as would be any
decision effectively discontinuing the existing prosecution be taken at the highest level and
asks that if at all practicable it be reserved to you and if that is totally impracticable the person
delegated (de facto not de jure only) be of similar authority and capability or as close as can
be.


Yours faithfully

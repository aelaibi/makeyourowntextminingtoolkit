                     INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND
                       SHEFFIELD ON SATURDAY i§"APRIL 1989

On behalf of the Chief Constable, Mr. Wright, I am gathering information to
enable the Force to present evidence to the forthcoming Committees of Inquiry.
This exercise has no connection with the investigation into the policing of
the F.A. cup semi-final which is being conducted by a team headed by Mr. Dear,
Chief Constable of West Midlands.

What I require from you is a self-written account of your actions on the 15th
April 1989. Please note that this is not a CJA statement and it should be
written on plain paper.  It would be helpful if your account could include the
following information.

1.      What time did you come on duty?

2.      To whom were you responsible?

3.      Where were you deployed, and did you get deviated     to any other
         location?

A.      What did you see   that is in   any way relevant to the incident?

5.      What did you do?

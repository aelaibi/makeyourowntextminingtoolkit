always     gets at the front of the standing                  area against            the fencing.

W hen we decided to move from 8 to C block our                           friend Peter G A RR ET T

decided to stay where                he was,    because    he said that          he was OK and that

he had a good view of the                   pitch.    F rom that    point       I did not see my

                                             (2000)   on the same        day,   at the S h e f fi el d

N o r t h e r n General      Hos\ital

At around       14.53 hrs          (1455)    I had got    into C Block          end of the L ep pings

Laneend,      and during           the next 20 minutes       I was       to witness      the horror         of

the disaster w hi ch has been plastered,                    w orld wide over           the    press.

As the teams w al k e d OsUt you              could see that       the B S e c ti on was

a b s o l u t e l y solid    packed with         people and as soon as the game kicked off

there was       people       climbing       o v W 'the fencing and there was loads of

people walking          behind the Liverpool             goal and then minu te s             later    there

were    people all          over    the goal a rea and      I saw plenty of            people grabbing

hold of Liverpool             players and       pointing    to the a rea behind the goal,

one    lad grabbed hold of                                 and grabbed him over               to the

a rea where all         the    people were.

At first      I did not        realise exactly what was             happening         but event ua ll y

it hit me that          people were          being    injured and    I then heard that

s o mebody had been killed and at this                    point    1 went       to the gate      in G

block where        there were 2 police officers and                  1 a s ke d the Police

Officer      if 1 could go           into the    pitch because my friend               could be hurt

or even killed and he                replied,    HNo fucking       get back       m    there" and he

grabbed hold of me and he threw me back                      into the C block,               I then

returned to the             police officer and now being             e xt remely a n gr y       I.

going       onto     the    pitch to help people and to               look for my           friend and the

same     police       officer       then   replied,    “Ok.,   I'm sorry about              before."           I did

not    note the officers              collar    number and      I w ould not           recognise         him

a gain as       I had other          things    on my min d      at the time.

I got onto the              pitch and      I saw injured            people lying       on the ground and

I went to them to offer any a s s H t a n c e                   and at this           point      I saw a

different           friend of mine         crying on the'voitch,              I went     to him and            I then

h elped other          injured       people who were         lying xyn the floor,                there was

just     too man y         people   on the     pitch trying         to help.

I can h on estly say that from my o bs er vations                           there was       about 5-10

P olice Officers             on the    pitch trying         to help     injured or          seriously

injured       people        by giving any first- aid.               I saw a line of Police

standing       there spreading across                the    pitch    in a cauldron,              I now

first 5 -10 officers w hom                 I have    p reviously m e n t io ne d started to help

that others          then     realised and started to assist wit h the                           injured.        I

stayed on the              pitch for about         1 hour    trying to find my friend Peter

 I stayed at my vehicle                 for a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1 hour.     After          this   period     I

decided to a tt e n d one of the hospitals                          rn S h e f f i e l d and the first             one

I a t te n de d was      the S h effield N o r t h e r n General              Hospital          where      I was

lead with my friends                to the Staff Canteen,                  there    I stayed for about an

hour a nd a half w ith my friends,                        Social        Workers and    priests and other
                                                                                            \
                                                                                                \
people       in the same        position as myself.

The    hospital      a dm i n i s t r a t o r    came   in from time         to time       readir^a out         lists

of    people who were at the ho\pital                       and who were           injured and whty were

d e ce as ed and on the second                   list\[    was    to     learn that my friend/Peter

G A R R E T T was alive,        but he was           injured,      and at this        point          I left the

room,    a very       relieved man.               At this     point       1 would    like       to thank all

the    hospital       staff and e s pe ci al ly the               priest who helped me                 through my

ordeal       as this maybe my one and only                       chance     of thanking             him.

I then saw my friend who had                        crushing      injuries     but was          ok and the

hospital       then released him and we all                       returned safely back to

Li ve r poo 1.

The    following       points have ari se n during my stay at Sheffield,                                   and they

are m ai n ly to benefit              the enquiry;

1.     The    obvious       question,           of the ticket a l l o c a t i o n w hi ch was

ridiculous          from the       outset.

2.     Why was B section so full yet A & C sections                                 half    empty.         C ou ld

this    have not       been down to the turnstiles.

3.     One of the        reasons which              I think      that a lot of        people          died was due

to the fact of the              railings          inside    the ground,        these are             used for

segregation,          yet    they were           one of'^.he mai n         reasons why so many died.

5.     Lo ok in g    back

because       of the total lack of o rg an i s a t i o n o^j'ta^ide the ground.

6.     There were        no signs         to me of any           drunkeness        violence          or pilfering

of the       property       left    on the        floor.

7.     It a p pe a r e d to me that a m a j o r i t y of Police                    officers          seemed to

                    people will      be asking,      I w ou ld    like   to hear        the   comments   of the

                    person reading      this statement           to see what          they think.

                                                                                                              I will

                    always    count myself     lucky that        on S a t u r d a y    15th April   1989,   (150489),

                    I was    not one of the 95.

                 Fu rt he r to my a t t a c h e d statement w h i c h                 I made     on 30 t h April         1989

                 (300489),            I w is h to make a further                statement      to   clarify     certain         points.

                 At   1400 hrs          (1400)        on the day of the m at ch w hen we                reached      the

                 t ur ns ti le s       outside L ep pi ng s Lane            there was     no o rganised queues              just a

                 mass     of people ail               trying       to get   in, and the        crowd was all         pushing

                 a cross and going                in different          directions.       At this       time a lot of

                 people outside w ith ou t                   tickets     I knew this      because       they were asking

                 people for spares.                       These    people a d d e d to the       confusion outside              the

                 turnstiles.

                 B e c au s e    of the      crowds a r o u n d the t urnstiles                it took me from           1400    (1400

                 - 1420 hrs            (1420^/to           get    into the ground.

n umbe/s    (1)    ( 2 ) ( 3) / 4).     W he n    I entered the terrace          I was wit h Peter

GARFETTtland                            and      it was v^rry crowded.         We made           our way to
A-
pt^int one w hi ch      I j h ow know to be Pe/f 3 and            paused for a short while.

 ie   then saw s ome/other           friends      in/Pen 3 at     point mar ke d 2.              We made

'our w ay to this/point w h ic h was mi d way down the terrace against                                   the

centre fence.          I stayed on this            position until about a quarter                   to

three    (1443).      Peter G A R R E T T     left us and went to stand at the front                           of

pen three because            he   could not see.        At this     point we were            getting

crushed and        pushed a ro u n d so we decided to move.                  I have     been       in large

crowds     before at matches and used to the                    pushing    backwards and

f orwards    but on this          o cc asion we w ere     being    pushed forward but               because

of the people        coming       in behind we were           not able to move         back       to the

original     position.                                                                                   \

At ten to three         (1450)       I together with                             and

             m oved to point          three ors the grid this being              by tbfe perimeter

fence di rectly behind the goal.                    At this     position     I saw fa. m an about

5*8 w it h dark      curly hair,        aged about 30 yrs.           I do not know what he

was wearing.         He was with another about                 trie same age     but a lot taller

wit h dark hair,        these men were hel ping/people               over the       central         fence

into Pen 4.        They helped me and my f/i ends over                    the f e n c e .        Before we

climbed over the fence               I saw Peter XiARRETT standing             close      to the

perimeter     fence     in Pen three          I trnd him that we were going                  into the

other area but he said he was gc/ing ,t<3 stay there                         because        he    could see

At this time we         could get down            into Pen 4 without         to muc h difficulty.

It was     crowded but not           packed.      We made our way along           the front          of Pen

4 to about        half way and then made             our way to position 4 ma rk ed on the

grid.      At this     point      there was a lot of space and were                 not      pushed or

crushed at all,         we    could have sat down on the steps                  there was so much

room.      It was five to three             (1455)    whe n    I got to this       point.

                                                                                                    S3627A

At this       point       I saw people           climbing     over the    perimeter      fence   just

after     the game         s t a r t e d , and    I then heard that someone           had died.         On

hearing       this      1 went     into the        pitch,     through a gate and tried to find

P eter GARRETT.

D uring     the time           I was    on the     pitch    I saw a lot of      peopie     on the    pitch

receiving attent i o n , and                  I he 1ped quite a few and did what             I could but

the    only person that                I remember      is a y outh with      light    ginger     coloured

hai r aged about      18 to    y e a r s . On looking at this y outh I thought
                    i?>
that     it was C olin J^AFER he was lying on the pitch by the right hand

goal    post        in tb te   six yard box.           An a m b u la nc e was at   the    back behind

him.      Th e r e ^ e r e      peo pi e wit h him and he was            gett i ng attention.        The

reason      I thought          this     person was C o l i n WAFER was        because      I knew him

from school,            I cannot        d e fi na te ly say    it was    him but   it looked      like him.

R eg ar di ng       the six      points       I made   on my first       statement    I wish to stress

that    the re are what            I saw and not as a general               ment i on of the whole

i nc i d e n t .

I was     not       injured at the            incident and did not         loose any      property.

I am            [tall, dark        hair,      big bui Id,      I was wearing a T shirt           I do not

know the           c o l o u r , this was      under a white         long sleeved jumper with a

                         on the        left    c h e s t , I think   I had jeans     on and white

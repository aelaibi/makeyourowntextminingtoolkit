     Dear Mr Kelly,


                                 Re   Hillsb o r o u g h Disaster of   15th April



    As a Council Member present at the game I am happy to submit a personol statement
    as requested by you in your letter of 21st April 1989.  However, I can a dd little
    to what is now a c c e p t e d wisdom.

    I a t t e n d e d with a friend and initially drove past the Stadium at 11.45am on my
    way in to drop my wife in the city centre an d have a meal.        I returned to H i l l s b o r o u
    via a service bus (hoving par k e d in the centre) arriving at the ground a r o u n d 2.10pr-
    I obser v e d no problems nor exces s i v e queues but did not go near the prob l e m end of
    the ground.

    We took our seats in the Directors Box about 20 minutes before kick off an d being
    at the side furthefcst from the Liverpool end mere l y observed the mo r e crowded
    terrace than that nearest us.      From the distonce we were away our initial
    reaction to the cro w d e n croachment was one of a prcblem of possible hooliganism.

    My only additionol o b servation wou l d be that the potential f o f f real affrays in
    the cro w d remained for some time after the immediate stoppage because a complete
    lack of good c o m municatio n left the majo r i t y of the crowd uncertain af the real
    p roblem and therefore always likely to blame persons on the pitch (and the latter
    to respond e motionally an d justifiably).       Sensible words an the tannoy wou l d really
    have helped.

    Beyond this I can make little comment except to say the true nature af the discster
    was still really unknown ta me when I left the ground aro u n d 4.40 pm to walk bock
    into Sheffield.



                                          Yours sincerely,




                                          C.Jones   (U^Uiy

the     journey          to     the       ground          I saw          no    bad       behaviour           by       any          fans       either

Liverpool           or       Nottingham              Forest.              We    arrived           outside             ffie t u r n s t i l e                at

for     something             to     eat.         Then         we    went       to       an    off     licence             and          bought          four

cans     of       larger        each       which          we    started             to    drink        sitting             on       the       wall

outside.            Paul        Car 1 i 1e        then         decided          he       would        go    to    a    nearby                pub       which

    Between        2.35           pm a n d 3 . Q            pm       it    just       got       m o re      and more _                         d around

    where       I was,            it a p p e a r e d        to       be    just        building-up more'and                                more       from     the

    back     as    it       eventually                developed              into          a    v e r y \ sevg/e            crush.              I do

    not    remember              any       sudden          surge,           it    just          seemed          to     build          up       gradually.

    It    was     very       very          hot,       but       although              it       was    packed           I was          not

    particularly                 worried             except          for     a    little             lad    of       about        11/13          yrs    who

    got    trapped           between             me       and                                  as    we    were        getting             near       and

    nearer        to    the       front          fence.              I was        holding             one       arm     to       keep          him    up,    and

           had     his       elbow          under          his       chin        to    keep          his    head        up.           I don't

    remember           anything            about           what       went        on       on       the    pitch        all       I can          say    is     I

    saw    the     Liverpool                goal          keeper          but     I don't             know        if    this       was          during       or

    before        the       game       started.

    I suppose           I was          about          2    yards          away        from          the    f ront       p</r i m e t e r         fence and

    from    that        point          I    remember             nothing              more,          I tl^injj/i            just       fainted          f rom

    the    heat.

    Some    minuteSi»before                      I    passed          out        I remember                fans        shouting             at       pt^tice       to

    open    the        g^tes,          I could             not       see    any        gate.              I also        saw       f a n s /cl i m b i ng
                                                                                                                                                             PAGE           4
                                                                                                                                                             S2404

               and       trying       to       climb          over          the    fr^nt          fence.

               I    saw    one       police             officer             who    was       shouting at          the       crowdand             waving       at

               them       to    push       back.              I also          saw       a    policewoman              on    the       fence       trying          to

               pull       fans       up    but          she       just       could          not    do    it.

               The       next    thing             I    rem e m b e r        is    waking          up    on the       pitch          by     that       time       it

               was       about       3.20          p m - 3 .25         pm    no    one       was       with I was          at    the        edge       of    the

               penalty          box       on       the       left       of    the       goal.           I don't        know          if    I was       carried

               t he re     or    walked                there       myself          and       fainted       again.               I just          walked       round

               the       pitch       for       a       bit    getting             myself          together.            I walked             to    the       Kop    end

               tried       to    get       out          that       way       but       was    sent       back     by       Police          so    I then       went

               through          the       north          stand          round          the    terrace          and     out       through          the       tunnel

               as    I    left       the       ground             it    was       4.15       pm.        I got     a    b u s , to          the    r a i 1w a y

               station          where          I met                    and

               The       only    other             thing          I went          to    say       is    that    while           at    the       railway

               station           on       my       arrival             at    Sheffield             I overheard              a    police          officer

               talking          to    another                one,       and       he    said       it    will     be       chaos          today.        The       other

               asked       why       and       he       said,          "Sheffield             United       are        at    home.           There       is    the

      (//^     supporters             and          now       we    have       got       to    look       for    ticket           touts,          and    there          is

               just       not    enough                police."              It    may       be    that    they        did       not      have     enough

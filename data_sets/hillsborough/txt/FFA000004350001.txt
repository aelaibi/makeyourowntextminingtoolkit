 MISS RICKARD                               16 April 1989


 FA/HILLSBOROUGH


 Telephoning             having been telephoned by          She
 asked me whether there was anything that should be
 immediately done.     I said that the only immediate thoughts
 that occurred to me were that people should start preparing
 statements as to what they had seen when they had been at
 the match yesterday because no doubt memories would start to
 fade and it would be very relevant as I understood
Graham Kelly had been there and no doubt there were other FA
officials.         confirmed that this was the case and
Glen Kirton had been there as well.     I also suggested that
we should start digging out all the papers concerning the
allocation of tickets and the choice of venue.
explained to me that the venue was chosen back in February
once the draw had been made.     She said that in fact Liverpool had
only complained about the ticket allocation a few days
before the match was due to take place.     The allocation of
tickets had followed from the decision that the police had
made with regard to the ends that the fans should be given.
I mentioned to       that I had heard that Bert Millichip was
proposing to make a donation of Â£2^500,00^ to the fund that
was being set up.    I thought the FA should careful over the
way in which it made the donation as one would not want it
to be thought that there was any degree of responsibility
for what had happened.         asked me if I had any wording in
mind.   I said off-hand I didn't but that if she mentioned it
to Bert Millichip I was sure that he would have some
appropriate wording.     I mentioned that I had a fax at home
and gave her my number if she needed me any further.

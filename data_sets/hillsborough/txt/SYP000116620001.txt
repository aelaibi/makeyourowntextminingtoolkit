              After      an       in-depth,         initial       briefing       on    the    logistics          and       strategy      to

At    approximately               11.30am           after          a further          briefing             by    Inspector

I was      deployed,             together           with        the     rest      of m y       serial,           inside       the

ground,         at       the    Leppings          Lane        end,      behind          turnstiles numbered                    9 -    16.

The     serial           S ergeant was          PS     1 757        Burns.            He    i n f o r m e d us    that     we

should work               in   pairs        behind          t he    turnstiles             with       female       officers

deployed            behind       the m a j o r i t y        of      males,        on       searching duties               in

accordance               with     the I n s p e c t o r ' s         previous           briefing.




from      roughly          11.30am          u n t il     14,15        or    thereabouts,               the       passage        of

individuals               into    th e      g r o u n d was         sparce        with       very      few       people       coming

into      the       ground,           The    o ne s      t h at     did       c ome    into      the       ground       between

these      times,          appeared          to     be      family         types       in g o o d      jovial          mood..



As    I s a y , there            continued             to    be a s t e a d y          flow,        albeit,        sporadic,              of

people         through         the     turnstiles                into      the    Leppings            Lane       Enclosure.

H o w e v e r , at        roughly        2.13pm          t ha t     same       dat e,       there      began       a    profuse

build      up       of    people       outside           the       ground        entrances            to    the    Leppings           Lane

of    people         outside          the    ground          who      were       very       tightly         packed       against

each      other.



I as      an    individual             member          of m y       serial,           continued with               searching

duties         at    this      t ime.        Presently--              as m o r e       and more            people       filed        in

through         the       busy    turnstiles,                 I was        approached            by    several          Liverpool

supporters               who   claimed         that         the     situation              outside         was    becoming           rough

and      unr u l y , with          people         starting            to      push and         shove        each       other     out-side?.

This      situation            continued             for     s o me     minutes,           and      I remember           stating           to

a    colleague,            that       I knew         something             was    about        to     happen,          that     we w o u l d

At    approximately                    1430       that        same       date    I sa w      t ha t     several            young    men        ha d

started          to    enter           the    ground           by    scaling          the    outer        perimeter            wall       and

the    roof's of            th e       nearby          turnstiles.



They       were       repeatedly              told        by m y s e l f        and    other       officers            to     refrain

from       climbing             in t h i s        way.         The       Liverpool          supporters               declined       to t a k e

heed       and    regardless                 of    care,           continued          to    enter       the       ground        in this         way.

It w a s      seen         by m y s e l f         that     a vast          majority          of    these          persons         together

turnstile,             were        smelling             heavily            of    intoxicants.                 1 saw         several

attempts          by       officers           to       eject        or     arrest          these       p e r s o n s , result            in

an    argument             with WPG           Pearson              about       whether       or    not       he      had    got    a ticket

to    see    the       football              match,           in    the    ground,




He    became          agitated            and      started abusing                    the    WPG       and      so    1 intervened.

A ft er      lodging                my    prisoner,         in the Police          d e t e n ti c m    room,    the

normal         p rocedure         for    prisoners was         followed,          w i t h regards        to

it was         then,    that       1 realised that            some      form of disaster               had occurred,

due    to the vast            number       of bodies and           injured        laid outside           the Police

room       inside      the g r o u n d .



Myself        and PC B urke             then t ried to        locate      our Serial         Sergeant          1757

Burns.         We were        unable       to do so,        and    now    in r etrospect              this was

pr ob ab ly due to the                  chaos    caused      inside      the ground on the t-eppings

Lane       end..



A ft e r     trying     to g ai n acc ess            to the    p it ch / te r ra c in g a re as         via the

Le pp in gs Lane,           N o r t h West S tand area,              PC Burke and my se lf               returned        to

the    rear        of the West Stand.

                                                                                                                         Rfi'c?

             It was     here    that.    I was a p p r o a c h e d      by a doctor,          who     sta t e d he wanted

             to know where all               the     injured were.            I e s c o r t e d him     to the    rear of

             the N or th S t a nd       outside        the g y m n a s i u m are a ,     where       1 then a s s i s t e d    in

             the     treatment     of    casualties.



             At    1610 or the r e a b o u t s ,       I left      the g y m n a s i u m area due to all            of    the

             casualties        having        been conveyed to            hospital.



             I then returned            to    the       rear of the L e p p i n g s Lane a rea and tried                  to

             console m em be rs         of    th e      public. At t h i s          time,    most     people were        though

             distraught,        n e v e r th el es s     u n d e rs ta nd in g      of the Police          situation.

             Others     however,        some       smelling      of drink,          were more abusive,            stating

             the     cause   of the      disaste r          to be the Po l i c e action,              or    in™act ion as

             the     case may have           been.



             At    roughly     1700 all        Po l i c e    personnel        were m u s t e r e d    in the N o r t h Stand

             where Serial         Sergeants           after    d eb r i e f i n g    could   stand their         respective

             serials      down.



                   1830 my     serial        was     stood d o w n an d       I returned to B a r n s l e y

              I am a P olice                     Constable        of   the S o u t h      Yorkshire            Police,      currently

              No11ingham                Forest.

              After       a briefing                in the        North      Stand       inside       Hillsborough             football

              ground,          my       serial       was     deployed            outside       the    turnstiles          to      the     Leppings

              Lane       end       of       the    ground,        on s e a r c h i n g    duties.

             All        people          entering          the     ground         through       the    Leppings          Lane      turnstiles

             were        searched.                 Most     people         accepted       this       as   the    "norm"        and      were

              happy       to       oblige.

             After        the       kick          off m y    serial         was    further          deployed       to    the      rear       of    the

                                                                                                                                       R 2 3A

This    enclosure,                immediately                situated             behind       the L e p p i n g s         Lane     en d

g o a l , was      very        full      and       as    a    result,             the    officers            detailed,           had    to

s t a n d at      th e    entrance            to     the      enclosure,                with       the    rest       of    us,    as    it

was    impossible              due      to    the       immense          congestion                of    people       within        the

enclosure.

I for       my    part,        s t o o d at        the       end    of       the       tunnel       which         feeds     the     terrace

from    the       rear       of    the       Leppings             Lane       turnstile             are a ,     remaining          here        for

most    of       the     first       half       of      the       game.

It s t r u c k     me     at      the    time        that         the    design          of    the       security          fencing         wa s

inhibiting             the     movement            of    persons             within        the      enclosure.

By    this       I mean        that      the       end       of    the       tunnel        opens         out      onto     the

terracing           immediately               behind          the L e p p i n g s          Lane         goal,      and     only a

matter       of a p p r o ; ; i m a t e l y        six       feet       is    faced with a                s t e el    railing          fe n c e,

which       transcends             the       terracing             right          to    the    front         wall.         This     would

mean    that        persons          entering            onto       the L e p p i n g s            Lane      terrace),          would      have

to    turn       sharply,          almost          immediately,                   on t h e i r      ex i t     from       the    tu n n e l

either       to    the       right       or     to      the       left.

After       a snack          meal       in    the       gymnasium             at       around       the      half-time           mark,        I

together          with       other       members             of m y      serial          returned            to    the     Leppings

Lane    terracing              a r ea.

This    t i me      I took         up a       position             at    the       rear       of    the      Leppings           Lane

terracing, underneath                         the       North       Side          of    the W e s t       Stand,          just    to    the

south       of    the     uncovered             standing/quadrangle                           terracing            area,,

X again          saw     that      the       p l ace     was       full       though a             little         better        than    the

area    behind           the      goal.

I can       finally          state,          that       1' s a w    nor       heard       of a n y        problems          in    relation

to    either       problems             with       the       tunnel,          tunnel          gates,         or a n y      other       part

of    the    ground.

After       the    fans        had      left       the       ground          my    serial          was    stood       d own,      a n d we

returned          to B a r n s l e y         after       the       game.

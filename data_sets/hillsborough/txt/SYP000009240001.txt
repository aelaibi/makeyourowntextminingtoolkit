              did not- have any d if fi c ul t y with traffic                       enroute.

              U p o n arrival         I saw that       numerous    s pectators were               leaving        the ground.

              We    left our a p pliance and entered the m ai n g a t e s .                             I saw that there

              were a number            of people against          the    perimeter          fence to my          right,         in

              the area to the            right    of the turnstiles.

              It was apparent            that alot       of these       people       required           first aid
                                                                                                                   /
              treatment.          Some were       standing,       some    lying d o w n .             I could also           see

              that    there were about            fifteen b o d i e s of           people       lying moj/ionless, most

              of w ho m had had their             heads    covered by a rt ic le s               of    clothi n g .Our
                                                                                                                    /

              a t t e n t i o n was    drawn by a Po li ce Woman to a male                       casualty wh</ was

              lying on the ground on his                  right side.              The Police Woman /told us that

              she thought         that he had stopped breathing                      but    she thouorit that

              there     was a     chance    of    resuscitation.  liyself a n d F /mqm                                   applied

              the    'Maximan'         resuscitator       to the     casualty.             He    responded to action

              w i t h i n a few seconds.           He also       responded to          instructions             given to him.

              The man was         in his    late twenties,          had dark          hair and moustache.                     He was

              wearing a black jacket               or jumper and m ed i um to well                      built.     As        I was

              applying      the       resuscitator F /m an                    I think       it was,       was

              attempting        to find a pulse.            The    resuscitator was                   sufficient        to

              revive     the man.         We then       left him with the Police W oman and another

              s pectator.

              The    s i tuation was       rather       chaotic at that time.                    We received

              inforrriation that the pitch was still full of casualties.       Slyself,

              south stand to gain access                  to the ^p^Cch.             I know the ground,                 so we

              d i d n ’t have any d if fi cu lt y finding               our    route.

              T here was alot           of congestion.           We wa lk ed       down the second ailse                     of the

              s outh stand and onto              the    pitch.     We    couldn't          use'-t^e first ailse as                     it

              was    being used by amb ul an ce            personnel          to    clear       casualties.

By the time we got                to the       pitch I could see that a lt ho u gh there were

still a considerable                number       of spectators            on the west stand terracing

behind the goals,             there was          no signs of         panic to get onto          the    pitch.

A l t h o u g h there were a large               number      of    people    on the    pitch at this

time,        some    of whom were         dazed and shocked               I did not see an yo ne        that

required my           immediate attention.                I was      carrying       the spare

resuscitator             oxygen    cylinder and F /man                        had the resuscitator

a nd for       obvious      reasons we stayed together.

We were        on the      pitch for about           five minu te s         just to see       if any further

a s si s t a n c e was     required.           The   other    e m er ge nc y services were        quite     busy

but    the     casualties         had been       removed.          It was    basically only       people

mill in g around.

We    retraced our steps and                   returned to the a re a outside             the L ep pings Ln

turnstiles.              There were a large            number of Police Officers                in the area

sh ielding          the motionless         bodies      from the general             public.

We went        to    people who were            injured asking            if any jwere having

d i ff i cu l ty     breathing.   Two persons required t h e / resuscitator and we
                                   ------------------------T -----------------------
a d m i n i s t e r e d oxygen to them.   The y were notx/n serious d if fi cu lt y

breathing,           it was   just       to aid them.             Their    positions are m ar k ed as          X2

and    X3 on the a tt ac h ed map               (Exhibit Ref TJW            1).

The    person at X2 was a male and the                        person at X3 was a female whose

co mpanion          informed us that           she was asthmatic.                 Apart from

a d m i ni s te r in g    oxygen,       both    person seemed alright.

These        casualties were            dealt with      in a short          distance    of the    first

casualty marked at                XI.

W hi l s t    I was      in the area outside            the turnstiles at             this time       1' became

aware        of verbal      conf rontation between                 i rate fans and members            of the

P ol i c e Force.

The    fans were w it hi n the area at the                        rear of the turnstiles m ar ke d             1 -

The gate        between the two turnstile                 sections was open.

Ha v i n g    satisfied ourselves            that there were        no further       urgent

casualties at the turnstiles                    in L e ppings Ln we again           returned^ia         the

                                      pitch I was aware o                                       EISH,    the

U p o n arrival        I saw that a system spemed               to be    in progress      to

T here were a number of firemen, a m bu la nc e men and St Johns

personnel attending to the injured.      At this point Fire ma n                                        and

m ys e l f    became     separated.          I was   helping    to stretcher        injured     persons

to waiting ambul a n c es and g enerally giving what                         help   I could.

I could see         that a pool         of    resusc it at io n equipment       had been formed          in

the      centre    of the     room and the medical             equipment      had also arrived.

I was        instructed by a Senior Officer                 to remain wit hi n the gym area              in

case      of trouble as the a b an do nm en t             of the game was       being announced.              I

just      continued helping where               I could and did so until             I was     ordered

back      to the appliance.             We even tu al ly     left the ground at about             1645

The      injured    people     that     I dealt with by the turnstiles                I did not

see again.          I did not have any dealings with any                      persons    deceased.

A part       from the verbal       exchanges         by the t urnstiles        between the

Liverpool         fans and Police.             I did not witness any           persons    in a u th or it y

being        o b structed whilst        carrying      out their     duties.

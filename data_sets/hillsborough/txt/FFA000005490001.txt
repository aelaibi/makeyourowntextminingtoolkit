            For Graham Kelly

            FA Hillsborough

            I attach a draft                    letter to Mr Whalley, the Secretary to the
            Inquiry for your                    consideration. Perhaps now is the time to make
            the approach. I                     had thought that there was an agreement between
            Counsel that the                    submissions would be freely available to any
            interested party                    but it seems this is not the case.
           Regards______

DRAFT LETTER TO MR WHALLEY


                                                  August 1989



Dear Mr Whalley


I understand that Lord Justice Taylor has received a large

body of written evidence in connection with the second phase

of the Inquiry.   As you know the FA and the Football League

have made a joint submission in this regard.


I wonder whether it would be possible to obtain from you

copies of the submissions that have been received or
alternatively a list of contributors so that we may approach

them direct.


The FA are of course happy to make their own submission

available to any interested party.



Should Lord Justice Taylor require our services in

connection with any of the visits or inspections that he

proposes to make please let me know and I will make the

necessary arrangements.



Yours sincerely


Graham Kelly
Chief Executive

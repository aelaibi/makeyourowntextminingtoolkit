 6          w e l c o m e to have it.
 7   MR.    BONE:     We will        send you one if you want.
 8   MR.    CHURCH:         I w o u l d like to say now I w o u l d like a copy.
 9   LOR D JUSTICE       STUART-SMITH:               Yes.       I have read the various
10          doc u m e n t s tha t y o u have sent to m e and you raise a v ery

17   LORD JUSTICE        STUART-SMITH:               Can I say this,       that     I understand
18          that this not i n f r e q u e n t l y happens,             I am afraid,         but it is
19          not s o m e t h i n g that      I can r e a l l y deal with.            There are
20          p r o c e d u r e s w h e r e b y you can mak e complaints against
21          solicitors and so on but t h a t is not r e a l l y the purpose of

12   LOR D   JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:        The inju n c t i o n p r e s u m a b l y was to
13           stop you c o p y i n g them.
14   MR.     BONE:     I t h i n k the p o s i t i o n was that Mr.      Church's       lawyers

18   MR.     CHURCH:     No, we wer e a l l o w e d to see but we have never                    to
19           this da y seen t h e m beca u s e the s o licitor said that we were

21         - was n o t h i n g to gain for our case.            But that doesn't m e a n -
22           - I n e v e r seen t h e m so I could argue about that.                    But they
23           c ould be shown to the o t h e r families and there m i g h t be
24           possible     evidence to them.             It could have been â€”            my

 3   MR.   CHURCH:       What      I've read on the statements off the po l i c e
 4         they're      just a b s o l u t e super men,        they ' r e everywhere.
 5   LORD J U S T I C E STUART-SMITH:         Who        was that?
 6   MR.   CHURCH:        The two p o l i c e m e n w h o give statements           in that
 7         b o d y file.      For the times t h e y give it's i m possible to be
 8         w h e r e the y were.
 9   L ORD J U S T I C E STUART-SMITH:        W h i c h two po l i c e officers are you
10         t a l k i n g about?
11   MR.   CHURCH:        W e b s t e r and Hayes.       Webster's      a wonderful       guy.
12         He's    half a m i l e      away fro m the ground, he's called                 at
13         q u a r t e r to three,      there's t r o u b l e at the ground.            He's
14          just that m i n u t e t o l d supporters wha t it will take at
15          least,    b e c a u s e of the h e a v y      traffic,      an hour to get      to the
16          ground.       E ven      if he's g o i n g p r e t t y fast he's still in and
17          out of his m o b i l e o b s e r v i n g that all the pubs are still
18          overflowing.           He's just vile,        the m a n is just vile.           Any
19          g ood b a r r i s t e r w o u l d have t o r e him to pieces.           I was
20          t r a i n e d to do â€”      I u sed to be security on these docks,                       I
21         was t r a i n e d b y M e t r o p o l i t a n Police to fill note books              in
22          and I k n o w for a fact t h e r e are no dates on two of these
23          statements,        the y d e f i n i t e l y never come out of a note book,
24          a p o l i c e note book.        He sees too much,            comments on too
25          much.
26   LOR D JUST I C E STUART-SMITH:            Can I just help you on that.                    My
27          u n d e r s t a n d i n g of the p o s i t i o n is this,    that all the police
28          o f f icers i n v o l v e d w e r e t o l d to go away and make out a
29          w r i t t e n statement,      not a note book,           of their recollect ions

 2         be admissible.             One of the things that I a m g oing to look
 3         at is the cases w h e r e t here have b een any alterations to
 4         the o r i g i n a l han d d r a f t e d sta t e m e n t b y the police o f f i c e r
 5         as o p p o s e d to w h a t was t h e n p u t forw a r d as their final
 6         statement.
 7                  I have looked at some of these and some of t h e m the
 8         al t e r a t i o n s   are q uite trivial,         just one w o r d or the use of
 9         a w o r d or s o m e t h i n g of t h a t sort has b e e n changed.                 In
10         some cases t h e r e have b e e n comments and opinions cut out.
11         But    I am g o i n g to look at t h a t to see w h e t h e r t here has
12         b e e n any s i g n i f i c a n t a l t e r a t i o n in those statements.
13                  I do not t h i n k that m a n y po l i c e officers m a d e out
14         note books,            in fact I am not even sure that any of t h e m
15         did a n d I t h i n k that tha t is entirely u n d e r s t a n d a b l e if
16         w h a t t h e y d i d was to put it straight on to a ha n d w r i t t e n
17         st atement ra t h e r than p u t it in a note book.                        That is the
18         p o s i t i o n w i t h r e g a r d to that.
19   MR.   CHURCH:          I am sa y i n g in the pr o p e r court of law w i t h the

 7   MR.    CHURCH:        The case itself was proved,                 the first        time it

21   MS.    COLEMAN:       I can summarise that,              find that out and let you
22           have that.
23   MR.    CHURCH:        I had to trawl t h r o u g h a law b o o k for that and I

26   L OR D JUST I C E STUART-SMITH:              I a m af r a i d this is a p r o b l e m w hich

20   LORD J U S T I C E STUART-SMITH:              I a m afraid,      Mr.   Church,     I cannot
21           sort out d i s putes b e t w e e n y o u and y our solicitor and your

23   MRS.    CHURCH:        W e u n d e r s t a n d that,    we are just p o i n t i n g to you
24           w h a t has gone on.
25   MR.     CHURCH:        W e have a situation,             Hillsborough, w h e r e the
26           Legal A i d Ac t was a l t e r e d in 1989 to accomm o d a t e group

30           get.
31                   It s t a r t e d off w i t h 40 solicitors,            80 solicitors and
32           no w I b e l i e v e it's      143.     T h e y ' r e g e t t i n g funded b y the

35           are.      When    I p h o n e d up 12 m o n t h s ago to see if I c ould get

 2         Society.        It was the L a w S o c i e t y that set the S t e e r i n g
 3         Group up,       so I'm right b a c k on the roundabout.

 5         prud e n t to comment on at some point,                     is the role of the
 6         S t e e r i n g C o m m i t t e e or the r o l e of S t e e r i n g C o mmittees
 7         ge n e r a l l y in d i s a s t e r s of this kind.          But in p a r t i c u l a r
 8         this is not,         Mr.      and Mrs.    C h u r c h ' s case is not unique.
 9         T here is a hig h level of d i s s a t i s f a c t i o n amongst families
10         ar o u n d the W i r r a l that the         S t e e r i n g Co m m i t t e e play,
11         phrases      like    "ambulance chasing"             have b e e n b a n d e d about.
12         But m o r e s e r i o u s l y if some of the d o c u m e n t a t i o n is looked
13         at, p a r t i c u l a r the s o - c a l l e d b u s iness m e e tings b e t w e e n

18         t heir role in the inquest.
19                 I t h i n k that is not a unique opinion,                     that is q u i t e a
20         general opinion,              c e r t a i n l y amongst the group tha t w e n t the
21         High C ourt in Lo n d o n and it does raise the issue of
22         St e e r i n g " G r o u p r e p r e s e n t a t i o n and a lot of the individ uals
23         in that.
24   LOR D JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:                 I a m aware.        This w h o l e q u e s t i o n of
25         group r e p r e s e n t a t i o n cases of this sort is v ery difficult.
26         There are always p r o blems w i t h pe o p l e w h o do not wan t to
27         join in the S t e e r i n g Group.             There are o ften problems with

29         are not s a t i s f i e d w ith it w a y it has gone.                   I am fully
30         aware of t h o s e sort of problems.                    I have to say I do not

 9   MR.    BONE:          T h e s e are all for us to keep?
10   MR.    CHURCH: Yes.           I t â€™s just to examine â€”         to say the p o s i t i o n

Dear Graham,

As requested,   I have pleasure in                                          detailing below a brief
history  of  events  concerning the                                          all  seater stadium at
Highfield Road.

Work was carried out throughout the Summer of 1981 to convert
Highfield   Road  into  an  'all  s e a t e r ' stadium for the
commencement of the 1981/82 season.     The ground capacity was
set at 20,500.

The Club received enormous criticism from lifelong supporters
for  implementing   the all seater scheme and we therefore
decided to re-open a standing area immediately behind the East
Terrace seats for the start of the 1983/84 campaign.        The
capacity  for  this   area  was set at 2,000 with admission
restricted to Members only.   The Ground capacity was therefore
increased to 22,500.

In January 1985, during an F.A. Cup tie against Manchester
City, over 400 seats from the East Terrace were ripped out by
visiting supporters and used as missiles against the Police.
Following this incident and due to the fact that many visiting
supporters were unwilling to sit on open seating, it was
decided that the seats on the East Terrace would be removed
during the Summer of 1985.      As we were, in addition, still
receiving  constant   criticism   from our   own  supporters,   a
decision  was  taken to divide this Terrace into standing
accommodation for both home and away supporters.       This area
now accommodates 7,544 home supporters; 2,800 visitors and has
an  overflow  section   for  960.     The  Ground  capacity   has
subsequently increased to 29,800.

R.H.G. Kelly/    F.C.I.S.




Even  now     we continually receive   requests   from our  own
supporters    to remove the existing seats from the Sky Blue
Terrace which is uncovered and also from the West Terrace
which is partially covered.      It was in fact the Club's
intention to remove the seats from the Sky Blue Terrace during
the current close-season and support had been offered from the
Football Grounds Improvement Trust for this work.   However/ in
the light of the Hillsborough disaster/ we decided to await
the outcome of Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry.

During the past eight years we have generally found that
supporters  are unwilling to sit on open terracing/ basically
because the climate in this Country is unsettled.     When we
play matches   in  cold  or wet  conditions we  notice    that
supporters choose to stand up for the entire game in these
areas.

We also found during the all seater period that we were only
able to accommodate approximately 2,000 visiting supporters in
the area allocated to them.  On numerous occasions/ therefore/
visitors obtained tickets    for areas allocated to our own
supporters and consequently confrontations occurred.      This
resulted in making the policing of the stadium very difficult.

I trust that this information will be of help to you        and
should you require any further assistance/ please do        not
hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely/




Graham Hover

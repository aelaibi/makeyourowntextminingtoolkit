         NEW FOOTBALL TRUST ARRANGEMENTS ANNOUNCED


               SINGLE BODY TO ASSIST RESPONSE TO TAYLOR REPORT



Important changes                    in the administration and organisation of The

Football Trust were announced today.                                              They are designed to assist

the game in its response to the final report of Lord Justice

Taylor and with the administration of the substantial new funding

announced by the Chancellor in                                       his Budget on Tuesday.                                   The work

of   th e     existing                Football                 Trust            and        the        Football                Grounds

Improvement            Trust          is being               combined              into        a single               body,       to be

known as The Football Trust (1990).



The membership of the new Football Trust will be drawn from the

same   organisations                    which          have        nominated                trustees              hitherto:         the

Football League,                  the Football Association,                                     the Scottish Football

League       and       Scottish                Football               Association,                      the        Professional

Footballers'             Association,                   the local               authority associations,                             the

chief police officers and the pools.                                                 An observer will continue

to represent the Minister for Sport.                                                     One change is that the

Football League is to nominate a third Trustee:                                                                    the existing



                                                                                                                   Continued.../




            The Football Trust is funded entirely by Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters from their Spotting-the-Ball competition.

chairman       of   FGIT,    Tom    Wharton,          will     be    th e    first     such

appointment and he will chair an important committee which will

be responsible for grant aid policies                   for the professional game

in relation to the Taylor Report.



The   Chairman      of   the new Trust will be Lord Ab e r d a r e and the

Deputy Chairmen will be Richard Faulkner and Tom Wharton.                              In a

letter      to clubs telling them of these new arrangements,                           Lord

Aberdare confirms that it will be the Trust's intention that the

professional game should continue to receive around 75 per cent

of the funds that are made available from the Spotting-the-Ball

competition     organised       by Littlewoods,        Vernons       and    Zetters.     On

current      forecasts    that     is worth         something       in excess of £7.5

million per annum.         Added to this amount will be the money raised

by    the   reduction      in    pool   betting         duty    announced        by    the

Chancellor: worth, on his calculation, £100 million in total over

the next five years.



The needs of grassroots and community football, and of the semi-

and non-professional        clubs will          continue     to be    looked after as

generously as possible.



Explaining the changes, Lord Aberdare writes                    : "For some time it

has been apparent that the division in responsibilities between




                                                                        Continued..../

The Football Trust and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust has

been the cause of some confusion.                              This question has been given

added         point         by     the     Taylor      recommendations,            and   by    the

Chancellor's welcome decision to reduce pool betting duty and to

make       the     £100          million   thus       raised    over    the next    five   years

available            to The        Football    Trust.           The   implem e nt at i on of   the

Taylor Report will require a unified coherent approach, not only

because the Government is requiring that the contribution it is

making should be channelled through The Football Trust, but also

because Taylor's proposals                        for ground improvements and crowd

control measures need to be seen in a single overall context,                                   as

will the relationship with the Football Licensing Authority, once

that has been established."

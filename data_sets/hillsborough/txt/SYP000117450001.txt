             I came on duty at 7.30 am at Wath Police Station on Saturday

             15th April          1 9 3 9 collected uniform then went to Rawmarsh Police

             Station where along with other officers                  I was    conveyed by Force          coach

             to Rotherham Main Street P.S. where a number                     of other officers were

             pi ck ed up.

             From there was            conveyed to Hillsborough for main briefing,

             I was on Serial No. 56 along with DC Hubbard,                     DC Humphries,      DC Winter

             PC 660 D e x t e r , PC 340          Waldron,   PC Edwards and PC        84 Hunt.   The?

             officers         in charge of        this Serial   were PS       Taylor and Insp.     Newsy.

             After briefing around                11.15 am we   went to Rawson        Spring Road to

             supervise the parking                of vehicles   belonging to the Nottingham Forest

             supporters.            We did this from that time until 3 pm.                There was no

             trouble from the supporters,               they all    seemed in a happy mood and a

             number had been drinking.
                                                                                  /
             Just after 3 pm our brief was to go to Claywheels Lane for meal.

             We walked up Rawson Spring Road onto Herries Road and then down

             towards        the Hillsborough ground.

             Once we reached the junction with Penistone Road adjacent to the

             Spion Kop End I saw a Superintendent stood on the central

             reservation.            He told us to standby because there was               possible      crowd
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         R 106

tr g tibI e wi thin the ground at the Leppi ngs Lane end.

A matter of 30 seconds to a minute                          later he ordered us into the ground

to the Leppings Lane end where the supporters were                                   climbing over the

fences o n t o the playing a r ea .

W & w ent d i r e c 1 1y into the g ro u n d and a t               that t ime saw t,he p 1aye r s

leaving      the     pi t c h ,    we a p p r o a c h e d f r o m the K o p e n d a n d whilst      running

towards the Leppings Lane end 1 saw supporters                                climbing over the

f e n c e o n t o Lh e p i t c h .

On a r r i v a l    at   the L e p p i n g s L a n e   end I s a w s u p p o r t e r s   crammed    up

against the fence,                 these were obviously being crushed.

I went to the right hand side of gate 4, that gate was already open,

there was several                 officers already at that gate,                 I remember one was a

bald headed Sergeant,                    These   officers were pulling supporters                    from

inside the gate,.                 I climbed onto a wooden spar situated to the                           right

hand side of gate 4 in front of the wire fence.                                  I gestured with my

hands and shouted to the supporters at the rear                                 in an effort        to

encourage the supporters to move back and pull back the people                                           in

front.       This was met by shouts of abuse such as                            'Fuck off*     and two

fingered salutes.                  At that time there appeared to be room at the back

of the     immediate           crush.

One man attracted my attention he was approximately 4 yards                                        into the

crush and was crying,, he s a i d he w a s                    stood on someone and couldn't

move.      At this time             I was also assisting supporters w h o were freeing

themselves          to   get      over   the   fence.

The wooden spar that                 I was stood on broke and myself and other

officers fell.

At that point 1 noticed the people who were at the front were being

crushed.           One man was trapped about                 1 foot to the right hand side of

gate 4, his head was turned sideways and trapped against                                    the fence,

he was bleeding from around the ear.                           Other     people adjacent           to him
                                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                                            R 106

         were obviously dying.

         I then       gave    assistance           at    gate       4    pulling      people       through,,       Then     in

         company       with    PC    1 9 14 H o y l e ,     other         officers      and    several       supporters           we

         ripped       up w i r e    meshing        fe n c e s ?     I tied      one    section       up w i t h    a    s c arf

         supplied       by    one    of    the     spectators,             then      assisted      with     pulling       people

         out    and    onto    the    p i tc h .        Once       the    crushing      had    ceased       an    officer

         dropped       down    into       the    terrace           and was      giving      mouth     to mouT,h to a

         s u p p o r t e r , I do    not    k n a w w ho       this       was   ar w h e t h e r    the    persqn

         survived.,          I then assisted              supporters            on    the   pitch     with       first    aid,.

         Then PC       1914 R o y le and PC 1513 Reeves and m y s e l f along w i t h several

         supporters          carried the body of a per sort to the gymnasium.                                          The three

         of us c a r r i e d the body into the gym and PC Reeves                                     remained with it.

         Then PC R o y 1 e r e t u r n e d onto the field;- and at t h a t                            stage there were

         many distressed supporters.                           I        joined other officers t h e n              to form a

         cordon across the field,                       I then remained there until                        ordered onto

         Penistone Road to supervise N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t                          fans    leaving the ground.

         I then returned to original                        point on R a w s on S p r i ng R o a d ,              junction

         with 1-terries Road,              assisting with traffic                      control.           Whilst- at that

         location       I was       approached by a distressed Liverpool                                  fan, who was

         shouting a b o u t         the gate at the Leppings L a n e end b e i n g                           opened.,        He

         threw a hamburger across the road at me which struck my leg.                                                     I went

         over to him,          calmed him down and advised him,                               he was then escorted

         away    by    his friends.

         At 6 . 3 0 pm r e t u r n e d to C l a y w h e e 1s L a n e w h e r e e v e n t u a l l y we got back

         on the coach and returned to Rawtnarsh P o l i c e Station.

         During the incident                there appeared to be a lack of communication

         between officers on the ground                                  and the      control box. 1 donot have

         any previous e x p e r i e n c e at the Hi 1 l>-fcrtrroutjly ground.

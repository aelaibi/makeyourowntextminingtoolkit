MR ELLINGFORD


ALL SEATER FOOTBALL STADIA


1.   Mr Atkins has noted your submission of 11 July covering a
letter from Home Office officials to the Football League.

2.   He is content with the recommendation in paragraph 5 of your
submission - that this Department should support the line being
taken by the Home Office of not introducing primary legislation
to extend the all-seater requirement to other sports.

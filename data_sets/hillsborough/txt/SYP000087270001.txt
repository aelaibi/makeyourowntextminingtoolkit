           On Saturday 15th April 1989 150489 I attended the FA Cup Semi Final to

           be played between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC at the

           I am a Live^j/6ol supporter and paid £6 for a Leppings Ln standing area

           ticket,    I bought this from Anfield,

           I travelled to the match with three of my friends,               they are



           and                                                   We travelled by coach,

           Barnes    lravel being the operators.

            We travelled directly to Shl^Pield with no stops and were only delayed
           C/\rr ' T ' R y v ^ i c l
            on the M&2 by roadworks .\\flhe coach arrived in Sheffield at about

           2.20pm 1420 and was parkNafe near to a brewery with all the other

           coac he s.

Whilst walking to the ground I saw a&fier fans drinking from cans and

the Police were stopping some o f them,       but this was the only Police

activity I witnessed on my way down to the ground.         There was no

drunkeness,   violence or disorder apparent to me on the way to the

(at c h .

I arrived at the entrance to the ground at about 2 . 3 0 pm 1430.     There

were no queues at all at t h is time,    it was just a mass of people

trying to get in.    I saw two Police Officers on ho^jj^back in that area

but   I wasn't aware of them organising any queues and I saw no stewards

giving directions.     I had no difficulty find the set of turnstiles        I

had to use, although I had great difficulty getting        into the ground

due to the sheer mass of people and the fact that there were no

organised queues.

Eventually I got into the ground through a turnstile and as I did so I !

handed in my ticket.    I did not see any gates open at this stage or

witness the opening of any of them.

Having entered the ground I knew that the way to the terracing was

down the tu nn el,having been there before and was not aware of any

signs directing us to our viewing
  o /v t  '
I went down the tunnel and had fre

Police or Steward control on the tunnel.

I did not see any unauthorised entry into the ground and I did not

witness any consumption of alcohol      in the ground itself.

I entered the ground with the friends      I*d travelled with.    I went down

the tunnel as I like to go behind the goal, although I did know that

you could go to the right by the Police Box\toy^jet onto the terracing.

In fact I ’d been to the same place last y e a n /

At the end of the tunnel, although the terracing was fairly full,         it

was nothing excessive and we were able to push through to where we

wanted to stand, we left the tunnel and veered to the right into the

             Once on the tairracing I met some more friends and we all stood

             together for about        10 minutes.      They were

                                Standing nearby were some other people I know including

             Davrid*        I       have indicated on the attached plan whereabouts             I was

             standing to begin with on the terracing,               this being about D4,

             WiJm all the e;<citernent of the day and with us jumping up and singing

             and shouting, we seemed to separate back into two groups.                I ended up

             I had first got onto the terracing at about 2.35pm 1435 and when we

             split     it was about 2 . 5 0 pip/1450.    The crowding at this time was no more

             than you would expect.

             As Liverpool       came cmt onto the pitch to start the match,         there was a

             expecting to go back,        but there was no relief,        it just got tighter a nd

             t,ighter.     I saw no more of the match,        I was almost at the front fence,

             in fact I was about 6" - 8" short of touching at full stretch,                my

             right arm was free and I just couldn’t breath,               the pressure just kept

             coming, my breaths got shallower and shallower.                I felt there was

             never going to be an end to it.             I have no idea what    caused the surge

             or kept the pressure coming.

             People all around were screaming,            shouting and crying.

             I remember there was one man who was slightly to my left and in front

             of me.      His head was being pushed down by another mans arm and he was

             crying out "Help me,        I *m dying."     I c an’t describe him or anyone else

             in there with me.

             There was a slight release in the crowd and I managed to wriggle

             myself up with the help of                         He was able to push my foot

             up.     I managed to grab hold of the mesh,            then the pressure started to

             increase again slightly but enough to hold me there.

               Again there was a slightly relaxation and I managed to pull the top

               half of my body over the top on the fence.  With the help of a man on

               the other side I was pulled over,                not before I ’d been cut on the

               stomach by the spikes on the top of the fence.

               I stumbled onto the pitch and got my breath back,                but then I realised

               my mates were still        in there so I went back to pull people out.

               I helped a policewoman to pull a man out through the fence which had

               now been broken back.            This man was unconscious.       I d o n ’t know whether

       ff/Q- light brown or fair hair, this was thinning.     He was quite tall and

             had a fairly stocky build.  I c a n ’t remember what he was wearing.   We

     1   '     pulled him over the wall and straight onto either a stretcher or

fr6-C£AS£i)    hoarding and some other           lads rarried— t^im away.

               Just before this incident        and I went over to the fencing and
                  -» P-££a         a/c£5
                ried to kick it in.  The surge had gone back a bit and you could see

               a mass of bodies on the floor with arms and legs sticking out of it.

               I could see                       behind them,      I shouted to him but he couldn’t

               hear me.

               Whilst kicking the fence a Policeman came up to us and told us to stop

               doing   it as w e ’d only make things worse and to clear the area.

               A short time after that,                   and I were trying to take the stantions

               of an advertisment hoarding and another policeman told us to stop

               doing that and clear the area and th&h he just carried on walking up

               and down,    just as if he was on patrol
               CAT      'V t5V £ £ T -   ^ tO A ^ D /W C fs ,
               I then helped carry 4 or 3 people on hoardings across the pitch to the

               far end but I co uldn’t describe any of them.

               After the last trip over I took a rest and it was then I realised for

               the first time people must have been killed.                  I could see them lying

               around with their faces           covered or with bluey green faces and vomit

               from their mouths.

                                                                                            S3153

          I went down to the Liverpool      end and looked for my friends,           the only

          ones   I knew were safe were          and           and lads in the stands.

          I ended u p by the players tunnel and someone gave me a glass of water.

          I asked a club official      if there was a phone I could us and he said

          there weren't any in the ground they were all outside.               So I climbed

          up into the press box a nd after asking I used one of the radio station

          phones to call home.
                                                                P/’T I -T A ^ 's fO Y v X
          I left the ground about 5-10 mins after the loud speaker announcement

          saying the match was abandoned.       I got back to my coach and all the

          lads I'd travelled with were      there.

          Later that night I found out      that David MATHER had died there.               The

          last time I'd seen David was      near to   me in   the terracing about           10

          minutes before the surge.

          I have indicated on the attached plan where I was taken to with the

          surge it is at F7.

          Whilst    in the terracing   I did not see the barrier break in pen 3 and I

          don't know whether    I was near that barrier.        I did not see at any time

          anything I considered to be a criminal offence.                /

          As a result of the incident I received bruising to my b a c k , arms and

          chest and cuts to my stomach.




          The .Police didn't seem to know what to do, even when they realised

          wMat was going on they reacted very slowly,          there was no urgency to it,

^®^M£|s/T^£he Police Officers    I spoke to were very off hand with me.              I think

       ^ they thought     it was a pitch invasion but     it was blatently obvious               it

          wasn't.    There was a distinct lack of communication and the fans

          seemed to take the initiative.

          There should have been an announcement to let the ground know what was
                                                                                 PAGE     6
                                                                                 S3153

         going on and how serious the situation was.     Even the ambulance       crept

         round the side of the pitch when it should have gone straight across.

         Last year    it was much better organised outside.     There was a cordon

         round the ground and tickets was being checked and if you w e r e n ’t in

         possession of a ticket you were turned away.     Because the queueing

         system fell apart,    the entry rate was much slower    causing more

         problems.

         All    it needed following the opening of the concertina gates was a

         block at the entrance to the tunnel and people directed away.           I know

         there are gates on the tunnel as they were shut once on me at a league

         match there.

         Even at last year's semi final match it was overcrowded behind the

         goals.    1 can 't understand this year why the people    in the Police

         control   box didn't do something about the overcrowding as they could

         clearly see it.

         The fencing off of the terracing    into pens was a major factor because

         it prevented you moving sidwards to relieve the pressure.        There

         weren't enough gates    in the front fencing and they weren't big enough.

         Liverpool   should have been given the larger end as they would

         obviously have more support.

                                                                                SIGNED

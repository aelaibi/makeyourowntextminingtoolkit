        Dear Sir



        You will know that I have been appointed to investigate matters that
        surrounded the tragic events at Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday 15
        April 1989 and to report direct to Lord Justice Taylor, who has been
        appointed to hold a Public Enquiry into those circumstances.

        In that capacity I would be grateful if you would release to my officers
        any video tape recordings that you may have of the ground or its
        environs that were taken on the date of the disorder.  The Judge will
        require to see all such material which, as you will appreciate, could be
        vital to his Enquiry.

        I hope that you will accept this letter as sufficient authority to
        assist this request.

        Further to our telephone conversation, I confirm that the material will
        only be used for the purpose of the Judicial Enquiry.  If any evidence
        is obtained from your film which can be used in legal or civil court
        proceedings, application will be made to you before its use.



        Yours faithfully




        Chief Constable

for P u b l i c       E n t e r t a i n m e n t Li c e n s e s .

This     report         and     submission          of e v i d e n c e    has     been     completed,

in my        c a p a c i t y as a c o n c e r n e d       citizen,        for     the    i n f o r m a t i o n of

the P u b l i c       Inqu i r y being          conducted          by L o r d J u s t i c e      TAYLOR.

It must         be e m p h a s i s e d     that all        views,        comments        and statements

within        this      report        are my      own an d must           not     be a s s o c i a t e d wit h

                                                   The     need     for    this      report       to    be

pre s e n t e d w i t h i n a r e s t r i c t e d         timescale        has      dictated       that

the    report         cannot       be    c o n s i d e r e d as    being    c o m p r e h e n s i v e and

may    in fact ap p e a r             be disjointed.               Many    of the        issues        raised

will    therefore             need      to be e x a m i n e d      in greater           detail     by the

expert        witnesses          at     the P u b l i c    Inquiry.         Nevertheless,               I

trust        that my views will                 be of some          benefit.

I was        one     of those Liv e r p o o l           s u p p o r t e r s who     considered

himself         fortunate          indeed       to a c q u i r e    a £14 N o r t h       s t a n d ticket

to w i t n e s s      the FA C u p s emi-final                 between Liverpool               and

Nottingham Forest                  at H i l l s b o r o u g h on Saturday,               13 April       89

(150489).            The    tragic: events             of that      day will         no doubt          be the

subject         of    debate,         analysis,        s p e c u l a t i o n and     conjunction             for

many rnonths to               c:ome .

It    is h oped        that      the most        of the        incidents will             be     recorded

at    the Pu b l i c        Inquiry an d that              clear,        practical        a n d s e n sible

guidelines           will      emerge       from      the P u b l i c       Inqu i r y      to hel p       those

in a u t h o r i t y     to    better       understand           crowd       behaviour           an d     to

indicate        those m e a s u r e s        that      must      be     introduced            to e n s u r e     the

future      safety         of all         football       specta t o r s .

For    over     t w e n t y y ears         I have      travelled            the    length a n d          breadth

of the       coun t r y as a football                  spect a t o r .         I have a t t e n d e d a

E u r o p e a n C u p Final,          FA C u p Finals,               Milk    Cu p Finals,            Charity

S h i e l d Matches,           as well       as    numerous           FA Cup       semi-final            matches

and    countless           league matches.

It is t h e r e f o r e        my    considered          opinion         that my          collective

experiences,            and     powers       of o b s e r v a t i o n enable me                to    comment

in both        general         a n d specific:         terms         r e garding        the    control         and

b e haviour      of football               fans    both      leading         up to the

Hillsborough            t r a g e d y and at H i l l s b o r o u g h          itself.

OBJECTIVES

The    term     ’R e l e v a n t     event*       is u t i l i s e d     to h i g h l i g h t       those

decisions,           actions         or    lack    of a c t i o n s      w h i c h have        contributed

to the      circumstances                 of the     tragedy

The    objectives             of this       report,        and hopefully,                 the P u b l i c

Inquiry will            be     not only       to d e s c r i b e       what a c t u a l l y         happened

at H i l l s b o r o u g h     but also       to ensure              that   those         in a u t h o r i t y

are    f u l l y aware         of the       significance              of each and e very

"Relevant        E v e n t ’ that          led up to the               tragedy.

It    is e x p e c t e d      that    other       ’R e l e v a n t    E v e n t s ’ will       be

e s t a b l i s h e d at      the Public          Inquiry and            that      clear,       sensible

and    practical           guidelines         w i 11 emerge            from       the     Inquiry

following        a detailed analysis                     of all        ’R e l e v a n t    Events*        by

I propose        to     list        specific       questions           which       should,          in my

It    is my        intention              under       Item 3 . 0       to examine           and       highlight

<1504389).                 It     is     recognised         that       e ach and         every        'Relevant

E v e n t ’ may       not         by     itself      have      caused      the       circumstances             that

led up to           the         t ragedy.           Each Relevant            Event,         however,          may

have      contributed                  in some way          to the        circumstances                of    the

after all,            a subjective appraisal.                            The     pictures             that    linger

HI LL.S80R0UGH , 150489

I set      out     fro m my      home        in N o r t h W a l e s    at S . 30 am         (0830)         and

arrived         in L i v e r p o o l    at    1000 am w h e r e         I met     up w i t h my

b r o t h e r - i n - l a w a n d my w i f e ’s cousin.                The    three      of     us

possessed          concurrent           stand tick e t s        for H i l l s b o r o u g h .

We    left L i v e r p o o l     about        1025 am.        The      journey        to S h e f f i e l d

was      particularly          tortuous          (Relevant        E vent No          1A).     The

numer o u s      delays       no doubt          prevented many Liverpool                      fans        from

arriving         at    the    ground with           time     to spare         before        the      kick-

off.

Q U E S T ION         Di d the F o o tball          Association             consult w i t h          the

relevant H i g h w a y A u t h o r i t i e s          to    either         establish        the      scale

of the      likely        congestion           between Liverpool                and S h e f f i e l d          on

150489 or to            seek     their a s s i s t a n c e     to m i t i g a t e      against

d elays?

The      car we       travelled         in was      parked      in A v i s f o r d Rd.         On     the

walk     b e t w e e n A v i s f o r d Rd a n d H i l l s b o r o u g h       comment         was     made

of the      unusually          high number            of P o l i c e       detailed      to    kee p the

Q u e e n ’s Peace,,         an d the        c o m petent w a y       in w h i c h    the S h e f f i e l d

Police      had m a r s h a l l e d      the     numerous      vehic l e s       to the

designated            parking areas.

We a r r i v e d at       the S t a d i u m about 2 . 2 5             pm    (1425).      Having           paid

£.14 for a seat we               fully e x p e c t e d to         join a brief              q ueue        and

still      be     in good     time       to    purchase       p r ogrammes           etc.     an d    be

s eated well before              kick-off.            The    real i t y      of the      situation

was,     however,         quite        different.          There was          no s e m b l a n c e        of

order      or o r g a n i s a t i o n at the S t a d i u m            (Relevant        event         No

2 B ).     There was         a sea       of fans       contained within a courtyard
                                                                                                             P AGE          6

    which        led to a row of t u r n s t i l e s                serving          the N o r t h S t a n d

    adjacent         to a blue           concertina           exit       gate.         T here were

    u n f o r t u n a t e 1y i n s u f f i c i e n t    Police          d e t a i l e d o u t s i de    the

    Stadium        to    ensure         that     only those             fans     tickets       actually

    jo i n e d    the    queues.             It a p p e a r e d as       t h o u g h most      of      the P o l i c e

    had been d e t a i l e d            to    control        the    crowd        from the        cars        to the

    Stadium which              left      very few P o l i c e            to o r g a n i s e    the      queuing

    arrangements            at    the stadium.

5   We had no o p t i o n             to join what            appeared          to be the           back      of the

    queue.         We    did so with o u t             a n y qualms,           we    had all        arrived            in

    good time a n d            quite         naturally assumed                 that all        was well.

    The    volume        of fans         gaining a c c e s s            into    the S t a d i u m       through

    the t u r n s t i l e s      was     insufficient              to    reduce        the    number         of

    people        queu i n g     in the        courtyard.               In fact,        the    crowd s w e l l e d

    an d w i t h i n a r e l a t i v e l y        short       per i o d of          time a n d we f o u n d

    ourselves           c o n t a i n e d w i t h i n a throng.

6   The    situation           quickly         became        uncomfortable and many                          of the

    fans     complained           in no u n c e r t a i n          terms       to two,        by now,

    helpless P o l i c e m e n who               had    positioned             themselves           close         to

    the wall         near      the      blue     c o n c e r t i n a exit       gate.         One      of the

    Policemen           let those who were                   complaining,             know of          his

    feelings         re g a r d i n g    the situation,                 again       in no u n c e r t a i n

    terms.         The     numerous           suggestions           to     the Police          that      horses

    s h o u l d be used          to     control        the   queu i n g a r r a n g e m e n t s         were       not

    a c t e d upon.

7   The    pressure         of the           confined        crowd became              increasingly

    u nbearable.            I couldn't            move,      my arms were               locked         into my

    chest.        I quickly           lost track         of time.              One e l d e r l y man          in the

    crowd was           persp i r i n g       profusely.           He was           trying    to b low air-

    on to his            cheeks         through the          side        of his mouth.              His

efforts a p p e a r e d            to be a f o r l o r n            gesture.         The      colour       of    his

neck an d        cheeks        appeared           to     be    continously           changing.             The

m a n was      obviously distressed.                           The     thou g h t    crossed my m i n d

that     he w o u l d        not    be able        to w i t h s t a n d      the     heat       and

pressure.           The       s i t u a t i o n was       potentially            lethal.

Individuals           within          the    throng were               complaining           about       elbows

in their        backs        and      other       sharp obje c t s           w h i c h had

inadvertently                placed to the              disadvantage             of others.

The w h o l e      e x p e r i e n c e was        hot and           tiring.         ye    had     been     in the

queue       for a b o u t      twe n t y m i n u t e s         and    had h a r d l y m ove d

forward.           It a p p e a r e d       to me       that        the   pressure          of the       crowd

was a c t u a l l y     locking           in d i v i d u a l s      within     the mass           an d   thus

p r eventing        those          near     the    front         from a c t u a l l y       getting        into

the    turnstiles.

M an y of the         crowd         se n s e d that           the    s i t u a t i o n was      potentially

lethal.         The     crowd's           patience            b egan to      break as           kick-off

time a p p r o a c h e d .          Whe n the          f r u s t r a t i o n and     discomfort            became

unbearable          m a n y of the           crowd s t a r t e d          s h o uting       for    the     gates

to be opened.

I noti c e d sorne y oung                 lads     climbing           up d r a i n p i p e s      etc,     to

a v o i d the      crush and get               into       the Stadium.               I concluded            that

their       patience         had snapped.                 The       thought     never        c r o s s e d my

m ind w h e t h e r     or not         these       fans        had tickets.               Wit h    the

Due    to    the    locking          effect        of the           pressure        of the        crowd     1 was

Policeman          s u d d e n l y appear,             presumably          from      inside        the
                                                                                                               page;

      Stadium,          an d     p o s i t i o n hims e l f     to    one     side       of    the      gate.         I

      did not        see who a c t u a l l y           opened        the    gate     but       considered             that

      the    openi ng of the                 gate was a d e l i b e r a t e          decision            by the

      Police       to help            prevent       any     injuries        or f a t a l i t i e s       outside

      the Stadium.                At   that      time,       I considered            the       decision         to

      open     the      gate      to be       reasonable         bear i n g       in m i n d      the      dire

      ci r c u m s t a n c e s    outs i d e     the ground,            not      beca u s e      of my d e s i r e

      to see       the m a t c h        but     because        1 was       by that        time       very

      con c e r n e d    for my own sa f e t y as well                      as    being        concerned          for

      the s a f e t y      of others            in the        crowd.

13    The    open i n g        of the        gate    had      a similar effect                  to pulling

      a plug       out     of a nearly              full      bath.        The     pressure f o r c e d           those

      in the       front         of    the    crowd t h r o u g h       the gate.               It w o u l d    have

      been     foolhardy              to try to        resist        the    pressure.              I,    too,     was

      swept a long             by the        tide.         I had been s t a n d i n g            in an a w k w a r d

      po s ition and was                twisted        round,        when     I was       catapulted

      I was      surprised             to see       so m a n y P o l i c e m e n     inside          the S t a d i u m

      totally        chaotic and a s k e d him w h y                    hadn't       the Pol i c e

the     throng       had     tickets       to    the S t a d i u m      because         it wa s      highly

unlikely        that a n y b o d y w i t h o u t         a ticket         would       have     joined

such a queue              in a n t i c i p a t i o n    that     the Pol i c e m a y         decide        to

open the        gates.

QUESTION             - Di d     the P o l i c e        close     the    concertina           g ates      after

the     initial       surge       to ensure            that    fans w i t h o u t       tick e t s    did

not gain        e ntry       into     the S t a d i u m ?        Ho w m a n y gates w e r e           opened

by the P o l i c e an d           for how        long w ere          they     left      open?

I re-established                contact w i t h my             travelling

partners        and       i n f ormed    them that            I had to        pay a      personal         visit

before       taking        up my seat.            I had not            had such an o p p o r t u n i t y

since     leaving L iverpool.

I would        record at          this     stage        that     I had       not    seen

a ny acts       of m i s c o n d u c t     by any        fans     outside          the S t a d i u m .        I

had also        not    o b s e r v e d any acts            of drunkenness.

Whe n    I a r r i v e d at       the e n t r a n c e      to G a t e w a y    '0'     the

m atch    had well          and     truly started.                I a s s u m e d at       that      time

that     the    gate was          op e n e d a r o u n d      three m i n u t e s      to three.              I

i nformed       the S t e w a r d       of my seat            number at        the     entrance          to

gate w a y     ’0'    and he        pointed me           in the        right       direction         to my

seat.

I sat     down as Peter              Beardsley's              shot     hit    the     cross-bar.              My

had been d i r e c t e d          to the w rong            gateway.           I tur n e d     to the

person who           occupied        the seat          next      to mine an d          told him about

the     chaos     outside         the S t a d i u m an d         informed him that                in my

actually           happening         within        the L e p p i n g s     Ln t e r r a c e s      but

c on c l u d e d    from the         r e a c t i o n of the Police,               and the

subsequent            pleading         fro m the        tannoy       system       that       spectators

sh o u l d   return         to the       terraces,          that     there     had been a

breakdown           in     public      order.

The P o l i c e       appeared         to be       pushing        and help i n g         fans      back     into

the terraces.                 Many     of the        fans who        staggered           from      the

terra c e s        fell     onto     the     pitch as         though       drunk.         A g a i n , the

reaction,           or     lack    of action,           from      the Po l i c e       did    not     convey

any sense           of    urgency.           The     fans a p p e a r e d     to be g e t t i n g         out

the    pitch.

To the a m a z e m e n t          and d i s a p p r o v a l    of m a n y    fans       in the N o r t h

s tand P o l i c e        reinforcements              arrived        but    did not          go to help

or    relieve         the     s i t u a t i o n at    the L e p p i n g s    Ln    terraces.              The y

merely       stood        shoulder          to s h o ulder        in front        of    the N o r t h

E>tand to a p p a r e n t l y          ensure        that     fans    did not          gain e n t r y onto

the    pitch.        This      action again             r e i n f o r c e d my m i s c o n c e p t i o n

that    we were           experiencing             a breakdown           in public           order.

Afte r 10 or             so m i n u t e s    fans were         be i ng     pulled       out     of    the

At    no time        did     I hear a n y e x p l a n a t i o n            on the      tannoy system

Question         -        why w a s n ’t the           tannoy        s y s t e m used to          co n v e y    the

seriousness           of the        incident           and    to ask        for     specialist

After     half an hour              or so       the a c t i v i t i e s       at    the L e p p i n g s Ln

leave     because          by that         time we         had     lost all         interest         in the

outcome       of any        football           match.         It was        obvious         that     there

was    little        or    nothing we           could        do to help.             T here wer e         now

The TV       coverage         can no doubt              better        e s t a b l i s h what       happened

on the L e p p i n g s Ln          ter races an d             pitch.         The     testimony          of

fans    nearer        to the s i t u a t i o n will               also      no doubt         help to

explain what              happened.

We    left    the S t a d i u m         in s t u n n e d     silence.        Outside         the S t a d i u m

anxious        to     phone      home    to    let their          loved ones           know      they were

safe.         We    had h eard on the             radio       that at         least      ten    people

had died.            We    knew otherwise.               W h e n we      reac h e d the          car we

were     invited          into a n e a r b y home           by    complete          s t r a n g e r s who

obviously           knew     of the      t r a g e d y at H i l l s b o r o u g h an d         noticed

that we were              d i s t r e s s e d and shocked.              They       offered      us the

use     of a telephone.                 T h e y also     offered         us a w e l c o m e       cup of

people will            not     be forgotten.

        amendments          has    been a d m i n i s t e r e d w i t h      emphasis          pl a c e d on the

        need to s e p a r a t e         fans   of o p p o s i n g     teams.          The L a w a n d       order

        aspects          have      been given           undue      priority       over        the    s a f e t y an d

        comfort       of suppor t e r s .            The    construction          of ani m a l        like       pens

        certain fans            to act      in a c c o r d a n c e    with    their       surroundings.

        F o o tball    C lubs      have     in the m a i n         been forced           or    coerced       into

        A u t h o r i t y has     naturally          b een g e a r e d more       towards           the

        maintenance          of    public      order       t han to the         sa f e t y an d       comfort

        troublesome          grounds        has      proved       difficult       to    resist.            The

        need to a c q u i r e        the    necessary Safety Certificate?                            the    fear

        action     rather         than the        need to e x t e n d and             improve S t a d i u m

view,     fi n a n c i a l    a s s i s t a n c e and      encouragement               must     be made

available           to football             clubs      to en s u r e      that a p p r o p r i a t e       works

are    carr i e d      out    before         the      start     of the         next    footb a l l      season.

It    is strange           when     one      con s i d e r s    that      the L i v e r p o o l    K o p used

to    swell      and      sway     in the        1 9 6 0 5s w i t h     over 2 5 0 0 0 s p e c t a t o r s .

The    sway i n g      of fans          in a     large     s t a n d i n g a rea       relieves         local

pressure         points.           The     prob l e m at        the L e p p i n g s      ln t e r r a c e s

was    that      there       was    not a s u f f i c i e n t l y         large       en o u g h a r e a    to

disperse         the      local     pressure           points.          Ha d the       internal

barriers         within       the       terraces,,       that       split       the g r o u n d    into

d e f i n e d sections,            not     been e r e c t e d then the                pressure         points

ma y well        have      been     relieved.            Similarly,             had the       p e r imeter

fence     been       designed           to a c c o m m o d a t e    the    safe       egress      of   fans

onto    the      pitch       in an e m e r g e n c y       then a g a i n        the     disaster          may

have    been m i t i g a t e d against.

It appe a r s        as    t h o u g h the       crowd at L e p p i n g s         Ln end       su r g e d

insufficient              room w i t h i n       the    enclosure          to a c c o m m o d a t e    the

actual      number         of fans.             The    p r e ssure was          such that         those

trap p e d at        the     front were            subsequently            crushed        by the       sheer

w eight     of the         crowd.          It    is t h e r e f o r e     my    considered opinion

that    the Fire S a f e t y and S a f e t y                   of Pla c e s      of Sp o r t s     Act      1982

practical           aspe c t s     of    crowd behaviour.                  I consider          that        it    is

i mperative          that all           perimeter        fences         are     either      r e m o v e d or

amended       to enable            fans      to escape          onto      the    pitch at         times         of

The    second Relevant             E vent       (Relevant E v e n t           No 2 B ) was        the

Heysel      disaster         in Belgium.             Since      that       time    it has        been

fashionable          to knock all             f o o tball      fans.        E a c h an d    every

unsatisfactory             incident         has    been h i g h l i g h t e d      by   politicians

and the Press.

There     is no doubt            that     there are           far    too many       thugs

following        football.             T hese     thugs       are    not    true    football

s uppor t e r s .      In general,            they are         teenagers          looking        for a

laugh and the             occas i o n a l     c o n f r o n t a t i o n all    at the       expense         of

the genu i n e       football          fan.       Football          matches       can be       the     ideal

opportunity          for     hooliganism           to fester.              There    is a d e f i n i t e

'us an d     t h e m ’ attitude           which     fuels       the     fires      of   the      hooligan

element.        The a t t i t u d e       of all       c o n c e r n e d must      change        if

hooliganism          is to be s t a m p e d out.

The    third R e l e v a n t     Event        (Relevant E v e n t          No 3 B ) is         in my

view    linked       to R e l e v a n t     Event No 2 B .            It is the G o v e r n m e n t ' s

obsession        r e g arding      the      introduction             of an i d e n t i t y       card

system w h i c h       is contr a r y to the a d v i c e                of all      those        who    know

and u n d e r s t a n d    the    philosophy and               culture        of football.              I

personally          believe       that all         citizens          should       carry     identity

cards at all          times.           However,        I do     not     consider        that      it    is a

practical        proposition            for     fans     to    be stop p e d on an

individual          basis at       football         matches          in order      to      prove       their

identity.           I also       consider         that    it    is not m o r a l l y        right       for

football       fans       to be trated on a d i f f e r e n t                 basis     to other

citizens.           I cannot       believe         that       other     groups     of      the    general

public will          tol e r t a t e    the     situation           if they have          to     provide

i dentity      cards       before       gaining        entrance         to the     threatre,

           culture.            This     devotion          is    part    of     the w a y     of    life w i t h i n

           m an y     city e n v i r o n m e n t s .       The    open       display        of C l u b     loyalty         is

           important           to the        separate          identification            of a city or town.

           The      coming      together         of a c o m m u n i t y at a football                    m a t c h adds

           to the        sense       of belonging,              c o m r a d e s h i p an d security.              This

           is p a r t i c u l a r l y     important            to a city        like L i v e r p o o l      which        has

           suffered         over       recent       times.        Football          can be a p o s i t i v e

           force       that     harnesses           the spirit          of a       community.            The   fact

           that L i v e r p o o l       leads       the    coun t r y a n d        p o s sibly E u r o p e     in

           football         matters          also     helps      to    restore        the    pride and         self

           respect        of    the City.

4   . 11   One      cannot      ignore        the     fact      that    there       is a s i g n i f i c a n t

           hooliganism            element       within          the    footb a l l     e n v i r onment.

           However,         this       elem e n t     should      not     be g i v e n undue            promin e n c e .

           Hooliganism           needs        to be s o r t e d        out    but    genuine        f o o tball      fans

           should not           be     ill    trea t e d       because       those     in a u t h o r i t y    are

           unable       to deal         with    the a c t i o n s       of the       u n r u l y min o r i t y .         My

           view      is that TV s u r v e i l l a n c e           must       be e x p a n d e d    to    c atch     the

           thugs       and once         caught        the thugs         must       be dealt w i t h         by the

           Courts        in an ef f e c t i v e        fashion.          Football           thugs       generally

           misbehave           outside,        rather          than    inside       football        stadiums         —

           this      fact a p p e a r s       to have          been     ignored.

        and separation               of fans         policies.          T here     can be no doubt                  that

        the    fans     of L i v e r p o o l      Football        C l u b were      aggrieved            by the

        choice      of H i l l s b o r o u g h as a S t a d i u m an d the                 subsequent

        ticket      allocation.                They     voiced       their     disapproval              as    soon as

        the    d e c i s i o n was      taken.         Liverpool          F o o tball      Club's        appeal       to

        the F o o t b a l l       Association           that O l d T r a f f o r d s h o u l d          be

        considered           instead          of H i l l s b o r o u g h was a p p a r a n t l y        dismissed

        out    of hand.           Nottingham Forest                  have an a v e r a g e         of    19000

        s u p p o r t e r s at     home matc h e s         yet    t hey were a l l o c a t e d 2 8 0 0 0

        tickets       for      the semi          final     whilst       Liverpool          have an a v e r a g e

        home    attendance            of 3 9 0 0 0 a n d onl y          r e c eived 2 4 0 0 0       tickets.

        One    can only           conclude        that     the    football         Association's

        decision        to     hold the          s e mi-final        at H i l l s b o r o u g h was          taken

        w i t h the     full      knowledge           that     the    ticket a l l o c a t i o n w o u l d           be

        to the d e t r i m e n t        of L i v e r p o o l     Football         Club.       This       unjust

        ticket a l l o c a t i o n may well                have      influenced Liverpool

        supporters           to travel           with o u t    tickets.           T hose    fans        may    have

        considered           that     the      e xtra tick e t s        allocated          to N o t t i n g h a m

        Forest      s u p p o r t e r s may       have     been sold         to    less     committed

        supporters,            or touts,          and t h e r e f o r e     it was      more       likely       that

        tickets       would        be on sale          outside        the    ground.

4. 13   The    fooball         A s s o c i a t i o n ’s i n a b i l i t y to deal          w i t h ticket

        touts     has       cer t a i n l y    contributed           to the       number      of    fans who

        travelled without                 tickets.

        I would       suggest         that       in future        the F o o tball          Association

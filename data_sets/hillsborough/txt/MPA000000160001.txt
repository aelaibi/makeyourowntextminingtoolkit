                        STATEMENT BY COUNCILLOR GUSTAFSON REGARDING THE

                                     CHIEF CONSTABLE’S APPOINTMENT


                 Councillor Gustafson responds following some confusion over her interview with

                 Radio Merseyside, broadcast this morning.



                 “Following a question about the Maria Eagle statement, I would like to clarify that I

                 knew nothing about this statement made in the House o f Commons in May.



                 “I would also like to clarify that Merseyside Police Authority was aware o f Mr

                 Beitison’s operational policing experience, including his experience at Hillsborough,

                 through an assessment by Her Majesty’s Inspector o f Constabulary made available

                 at the meeting on the 24m September.”

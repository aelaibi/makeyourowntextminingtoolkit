                 Whitlam.         This            s e r ial's    duties were            to man the turns t i l e s at the

                 Leppings        Lane       end of the ground,                   turns t i l e s     numbers       1 to 8,          searching

                 L i verp ool     s u p po r t e r s and             checking      their       entrance       tickets       before

                 allowing        them to            enter       the     ground,        to sit     in the N o r t h Stand.

                 At     11.15 a.m.          that        date whilst           on duty at         the above m e n t i o n e d

                 turnstiles,          it was            quite        notic e a b l e    that    large numbers           of Liverpool

                 supporters         were           gat h e r i n g    in L e p p i n g s Lane.

                 At appro;; imat e ly                11.45 a.m.          I was     d i r e c t e d to join anot h e r          serials

                 office rs also             in the L e p p i n g s Lane                area,    together with           other officers

                 from my own serial.                       I was        now   required         to assist        in the s e a r c h i n g of

                 buses      for alcohol               and the         s e arching       of supp o r t e r s    getting       off     the
buses     at       the    Leppings       Lane      end.     Although          by    now   there     were    a    great

number         of s u p p o rt er s     in the area,          none     of them were making                 any

a tt e m p t    to    form a queue and await                 their      entrance          into the ground,

instead         they were           intent       to wander     in the area.               Some mad e their way

to nearby t ak ea w a y s and shops,                      some w a n d e r e d a way from the L e p pings

L ane    area a l t o g e t h e r an d others were                 just       hanging a r o u n d      in the area

sittng         on the bridge walls and w i n d o w                    sills of the           t e r r a c e d housing

in that         street.         N um e r o u s    times as     suppo^t.P             up re i-iett. ina off        their

r espective           buses      I was a sk e d where          they     could buy tickets              to

them     into the ground.                  T hey were a d v i s e d accordingly.

By    12.15        p.m.     the m a j o r i t y of the        turns t i l e s at the L e p p i n g s Lane

e nt ra n c e s were         open      however,       very few s u pporters were                  taking

a d v a n t ag e     of this        fact and those           in the area were               still    quite       happy

to    be w an de r i n g around.                 There was      becoming           quite a b u i 1d— up of

supp o r t e r s      on the        opposite       side    of the      road across           from the Leppings

Lane     entrance,           apparently           I was    i n f ormed by other             officers,       that    the

m a j o r i t y of these            people       had no tickets and were wait i n g                    for somebody

offering           to sell       their own tickets.                A lot of s u pporters               it could be

noticed at            this     time were          carrying and drinking                   bottles    an d tins      of

ale.       I ,;.•%* well       as    numerous       other     officers,            a d v i s e d supporter*,

regarding            d r i nking     ale    before     e n t ering     the ground and numerous

supporters wer e               r e q uire d to dispose           of    their        i ntoxicants       in black

tains provided by the Police.                          The y were       then a d v i s e d acc o r d i n g l y .

Also at          this time          s up p o r t e r s were a r r i v i n g    in privately          owned motor

vehicles           and hired mini            buses.        On several          occasions        I saw vehicles

packed full              of s up p o r t e r s    and a lot      of those           travelling       in privately

owned motor              vehicles        could be seen          to be     consuming alcohol.                    Those

still      arriving           on buses were           by now being            directed       to the turnstiles

and enter            the gro u n d      to stop any further               build-up of           people w a n d e r i n g

the     streets.            Some     took     notice      however,      the m a j ority         just    crossed         the

H i l l s b o r o u g h &av/n centre or towards Petiistone Road.                                   As    the    time drew

nearer        to the      kick      off,     more and more              people were        being         required to

were gat h e r i n g        in the area who                 it was      k nown had no tickets.                      On two

occ a s i o n s     I had to adv ise              large groups           to disperse w h e n they were

bidding        for    tickets        being        sold by other              supporters,       as not only were

they        blocking      the    footpath,            but    people were spilling                  onto       the    roajJ

and        causing    traffic        to     come      to a standstill.               A lot of           pe0 p 1 ej^kjlvised

these s upporters,               more       than the         other      older age groups,                were       abusive

towards m y s el f a n d other                officers whe n              they were       required to dispose

o f their          intoxicants.                                                                           ^

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1.13       p.m.    my duties           were     deviated back            to normal           and

to man the           t ur n s t i l e s m e n t i o n e d    earlier.           Some of the o f f icers                  on my

serial        had a r r e s t e d    s u pporters           for   being       in poss e s s i o n of drugs w h i c h

left        one m a n to each turnstile.                      There      was     by now a stead               influx       of

forty years           of age        upwards.           Several         a t t e m p t s were made         by younger

suppo r t e r s      to ob t a i n     entrance w i t h o u t           tickets,       these were             turned away

following           be i ng advised.              Some      s u p p o r t e r s we re coming        to the

t urnstiles          in pairs and they had torn one                             ticket    into      two       pieces

trying        to dece i v e me         into       b e lieving      they had one full                ticket          each.

These were also a dv i s e d and tu r n e d away.                              People     of ages         16 years

upwards were w al k i n g              up to the t u r n s t i l e s            smelling      of    intoxicants and

also        carrying      such      in plastic,          carrier        bags.       They were           required to

no       luck.'     One     of the        horses was v i r t u a l l y               being    lifted off the

ground.            I was      by now being s q u a s h e d agai n s t                   the turnstile wall,                      the

black       dust b i n w h i ch had           c o n tained alcohol                   disposed      of by supporters

had c o l lapsed an d               the    contents also            squashed.                I made my way to the

t u r n stile w h i c h        1 was at and went                 through             it and told a senior

o fficer at           the    other        side    of what was          happening.                 People       on the other

side were           now b e c oming         very a n g r y and were                   trying      to force              the

c on c e r t i n a doors           open w hi c h       led to the N o r t h Stand.                      People who were

still       Coming        t h r o u g h the      t urnstiles        were         complaining            of    injuries           to

limbs and           ribs.          Finally,       the gate        to the N o r t h S t a n d was                   opened and

a stampede           of s up p o r t e r s       ran t h r o u g h an d          into    the N o r t h Stand.                   As

the main           problem had now been allevi a t e d ,                             the gates were            closed

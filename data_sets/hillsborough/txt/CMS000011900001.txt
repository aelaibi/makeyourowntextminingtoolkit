The FA Cup Semi-Final between Nottingham F'orest ana' Liverpool took, place

at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground on Saturday 15 April.

In order to ensure orderly access the gates were opened at 12.00 noon.

The match was due to commehce—a^-B.OO-pr*'.—



At 2.30 pm most of the JfeffctirfgiiaBf Tane were in the ground but many of

the Liverpool fans were still arriving and it was clear to the police

officers in chargc that there was ample capacity still to be filled in

the Liverpool sections of the enclosure.



At about 2,li5 pm there was a large crowd uf Liverpool supporters at the

turnstiles in Leppings Lane behind the West Stand.      There are only s e v e n

turnstiles and there, was difficulty in coping with the pressure.        Police

vehicles with loudhailers were used to urge the crowd to be patient.



At about       pm more Liverpool supporters arrived until there were

about 3,000 to *1,000 in this same area.    Gome spectators started to

climb the walls and tumeti-lcs ang those at the'                  -fctbVd vtei-'e

under considerable pressui'e from those behind.     The police resources -

mounted and foot officers - were unable to relieve this pressure.         -------------- —



The senior officer present considered frlsens- was tire passible danger to

life in respect of spectators at the front of the crowd and arranged for

an exit gate near the turnstiles to be opened to let a section of the

rrrwrt through and reliovo the dangerous pr*a*urc i-eferred to. O ih ltx ^       ^ A r




Shortly afterwards there was a surge in two pens on the Leppings Lane

terrace which crushed fans at the front against the safety barrier and

this accounted for practically all of the fatalities and injuries.         The
latest confirmed figure is 93 dead with at laast 70.injured persons

still detained in hospital in a serious condition.



The connection between the opening of the gate and the surge on the

terrace has not/1>een established but the time scale is such as to make

the connection possible.

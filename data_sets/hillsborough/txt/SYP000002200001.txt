The       coach was             almost          full          with     about          2         3    spaces,             about       50    people.

We    travelled                up     the      M5    to       the    M6.         Then          st op pe d after                about       2 hours

at    a    transport                cafe       near       to C a n n o c k so              that          s om e     people          could       h ave

so m e     breakfast.                    We    only       stopped           for a b o u t            1/2 a n         hour       then       drove

straight             on    to S h e f f i e l d .

At    about          12.30          pm w e h a d          pulled          off       the        motorway             at    the       junction           for

Sheffield             when          we    were       flagged           down         by     the v P o l i c e .            Two       officers           got

inspected,            the       coach          for       alcohol.              There           were       no       problems          and       we

continued             on       our       way    after          a few minutes.                        We       had    by     n ow a r r i v e d         in

Sneff ield and                  the       traffic             was    quite          heavy.               When       the     coach         got       c l o se     t

was       quite       busy.              There       were       a    lot       of     people             walking          to    the       g r o u n d at

the       ground          we    knew where                we     had      to     go       to    get       in so we w e n t

There          was    one       polic em an stanainq                        at      the        t u r n s t 1 1 e on         the      outside           who

    1       ground        I know where                    1 was       going           in the       ground            so    I d i d n ’t n o t i c e           or

            still        with my           two       friends          and        we    went       straight            to     our     standing                area      in

            the     pens.           To     get       to    the       pen a r e a we             had     to      go    through a               tunnel          that

            leads        th ere .

            There        were       a few           people         using         the       tunnel       at      the       same      time       as       us,    but

|           we    ha d    no     trouble            at     all       inside           the    tunnel          - everyone              was       moving          down

            the    tunnel           towards              the    pitch.            T he      only       trouble            t h at    we    did       have       was

            actually           at       the     end       of    the    t un n e1 where                 it    leads         into      the       pens.

            There        were       a     lot       of    people        standing             around          at      this      point- a l m o s t

            blocking           the       e x it      and       I remember              we    had       to    push         past      them       to       get    into

            the     pens.           I don* t t h i n k               they        were       lost       but      had       just      decided             to    stand

        ^   there        to    watch          the        game.        We     always          try       to    stand         just      to       the       r i ght     of

            the    goals         when         we     watch         a game,            so we       all       went      int          p e n 3.         Both       pens

            3 and        4 were          both        quite         empty         at    this       t i me     1.35         pm a n d       we    c o ul d

            decide        where          we     wanted          to    stand           we    eventually               stood         just       in    the

            We    stood        with        no       problems          for        about       15 m i n u t e s         or     so.         T h e n we

            experienced                 s e v e r a 1 s u r q es       i n the             pen.        It    s e e m e d as         thougn          a    large

            were     p u s h e d , as           a    crowd,          several           yards       forward.                This      happened                about

            s i k t im e s ov e r a                 period         of a b o u t        20 minutes               but       each      t i me     we       managed

            to    get     our w a y           back        to    our    original              position.                I am         not    s ure         of    the

As    the      time     went      by     I could             tell          that        the pen w a s            becoming quits

tightly          packed with             fans       on       some o c c a s i o n w h e n                the     crowd            surged

forward,.         I was       pushed          against             a    barrier             in the         pen     ( I later              realised

painful          being      pushed          against           t hi s        barrier             so    I decided              to m o v e       just        in

was    literally            standing             n ext       to       the       left       corner         of    it.          My    two

fr l e n ds      had m a n a g e d       to      get     in f r o n t            of      the     barrier          and were             standing               a

two    girls       who      started           off      standing                 n ex t     to    us w h e n we           first         got      into

and     could       see      tha t       s o me       people         were       beginning           to      slip    down       into       the

crowd       others         appeared            to      be       held        up     by      the     chest. I m y s e l f         was       in

s emi    crouching             position               which       had      been       brought          on     by    the crush.             A fe w

minutes          passed        and       the      situation               did     not      ea se.        A man      shouted          to me

from my          left.         He    asked            me    to    help      his       friend        w ho     was    standing          at       my

left     shoulder.                I looked                 to my left            where I         saw another             man.        He    was

a white          male      middle          2 0 ’s          short dark            h a i r, t h a t s    all       I can     remember.

He    was     purple          in the        face           and was         lifeless           at      the    time       I didn't          think

th at    he      was      pead      b ut    no w       I realise            he     must       have       been.

At    this       t i me     I remember                t ha t     the p o l i c e w e r e         standing          on     the    fence          at

the     front       of     the      pen     shouting              at        the     crowd        to    get back.          I also

remember          t h at      p e o p .1e w e r e          literally            climbing           over      the    heads       of    the

crowd       to    get      out      of     the        crush.

I called          to my        friends            who       were       both a few             yards         away    to my ri gh t              and

asked       if    they were              alright            t h ey     said       they       were      ok.

I am      not     s ur e     of     the     time           at    t hi s    p o i nt     but      1 remember             that    the       game

must     have       been       stopped            because              there       were a        lot of         people     on the

fence       and     on      the     pitch,                 I did not            p a ni c    at all a n d         stayed        relatively

calm,.        My legs h a d just s t a r t e d to go n u m b a n d                                     I could          hear    my    h e art

pounding,              I again           looked            around         and     sa w a m a n         n e xt    to me      on my

right , a white                male        about           2 0 - 2 5 yrs        old     he    had      short       brown       curly       hair

his     eyes      open       and     he was            grey       and      lifeless.               I remember            p eop l e

shouting          for      lie Ip    from         the       crowd,.          I was         stuck       like      thi s    for    about

ten m i n u t e s         when      suddenly               the    crush         seemed        to    ease.          I st i l l     c o u l d n ’t

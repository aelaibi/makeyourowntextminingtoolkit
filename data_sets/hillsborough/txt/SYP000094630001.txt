                    position          in the N o r t h West J ^ r r a c e               area.            I have       i n dicated our

rttftsj            A fter we had             been     in our          viewing      p o s i t i o n for about               an hour          it was

&W5                either         just     before       or just after              *kick off*               at 3pm        (15G0).           I remember

                   seeing a su p p o r t e r            on the         pitch.         I did         not see         how he got         there       but

                   he was         in the a rea          in front          of    the     hoardings,              actually       on the grass,

                   but      not     on the       playing area behind                    the       goal      line and        in the          region of

                   the e i g h t e e n yar d          box,         I have m a r k e d            the     plans                        wit h a

               circle         i ndicating       the a p p r o x i m a t e     area.

               I then saw a Po l i c e              officer      go to        this m a n and        I think         he    came from
 C A i
 fb u o e .    off    the      perimeter        track,       although         1 cannot         fas sure.        The      policemen
   * T
               lifted       the m a n who a p p e a r e d        to be        injured,        from off        the       grass and

               then,    as      I rem e m e b e r     it,    he just        seemed       to throw him down.                  1 am quite

               sure    it was a d i l i b e r a t e          throw as         o p p o s e d to either         dropping         the man

               or just         not   supporting         him whe n he             could not       stand.         Several        people

               stand i n g      near    to us       shou t e d at     the        pol i ceman about           the    i nc: i d e n t »

               1 can not time            this       incident any more a c c u r a t e l y and                   I cannot         describe

               the    supporter.           As     1 can tell         you      is that         the Police        officer was a

               male    in full         u n i f o r m and wear i n g         a helmet.           1 cannot        identify the

               Policeman         or d e s c r i b e    him further.

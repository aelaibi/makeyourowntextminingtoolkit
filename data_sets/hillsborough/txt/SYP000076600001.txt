            I am a lifelong Liverpool supporter and rfo-p                              €son ticket holder.



            On Saturday 15 April           1989 (150489)          I went to the FA Cup semi final

            match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough,                                                 I got
 •          my ticket from Anfi e 1d .             It cost £6,00 and was fo r

            ter ra c e .
                                                                                   /                                       n>

            I travelled to the match with                                                and                                We

            set off from Manchester at about 12 nodra ami travelled by car,                                                We

            came out of Manchester on the M67 and w^re held up for about forty

            five ifi:i.nut es by a ta i 1 ba ck of t ra f rTc ,            I d on’t know what caused the

            hiold up.

                                                                                                                   S2086

We    d i d n ’t stop en route and a r r i v e d                  in S h e f f i e l d at about          1.45pm

( 13455.         We    parked the            car    in Wheels Ln,           opposite a park.                   We walked

towards      the football            gro u n d and stop p e d on the way to buy some                                chips.

On the way to the                gro u n d    I saw one or two              people drinking              from       cans

but     I d i d n ’t see a n y on e who was                 drunk.         I d i d n ’t see any          pubs       that

wer e    open.         I saw the          police stopping m i n i b u s e s and hired vehicles

wi th fans       in them.            The      police a p p e a r e d       to be searching              these

vehicles

                                                                                             V' t A

We a r r i v e d outside          the L e p p i n g s Ln ent^raprce at about 2. 1 0 p m                    (1410 5.

T here were a lot of                peopie         t rying      to get     in.         There we r g n ’t an y

queues,      just a mass            of    p e o p l e.       I saw three itiountedypQ 1 :i.ce officers

Two     of them were          next       to the external             gates       of          ground,      trying          to
                                                                                        XX                     m
control      the flow of            people         into the       ground.             The    third
                                                                                             thi   officer was

inside     the    gates a n d        I think he was               trying       to organise            people       into

queues,      taut without           success.              I saw one more              police    o f f i c e r standing

on a barrier           next      to the       turnstiles.             He was          shouting at        people       to

move     back from the            turnstiles.



                        and      I jo i n e d the         crowd outside           the turnstiles           and moved

slo w l y towards        them.            It was         very    packed and after                while

s aid    he had had e n o ug h and m oved a w a y from us.                              /L    lost    sight        of him

It took               and mys e l f about                forty m i n u t e s     to/get      through the

turnstiles.             It was       very      packed just           outsioe jjjod a few               people were

s t a r t i n g t o pa n i c .



W h e n we got        through the            turnstile                      was alre a d y       inside        the

ground.          He said that             he had         coj*fe in thro u g h a gate.                 I then saw

that     there was a gate                open arya crowds            of    people were          corning through

it.       I saw two       stewards ui^ririg                  orange       blazers       next to the gate.

            inside       the turn s t i l e s     but    I d i d n ’tVsee         them giving any directions                     or

            The    three      of us he a d e d towards              the tunnel          a long wit h quite a lot             of

            other        people.        None     of us had been to H i l l s b o r o u g h before and

            th er ef or e we d i d n ’t realise               that    there were           other ways        of    reaching       the

            terraces.              I d i d n ’t see any signs              for    the    terraces.



            As we w a l ke d along          the tunnel             it was    vj^y dark.              We    got about       half

            way along and s u dd en ly there was a j & r q e                           from behind.            All      three of

            us were        carried a long         by the        cr<j#fd.         We    tried i / s ' make our way to the

            side     of the tunnel          but     cosu 1 dr/1 .          At the endr of the tunnel                   we went        to

            our    right      i.n t o pen t h r e e .         We    tried to q j f further               to the    right and

            back     of the        terraces     but were           swept    doy/h towards the front.                      This

            w o ul d have      been at about            £. 55 pm \( 14f?6) .            I ended up about               ten feet

            from     the front        of the      terrace and about                   ten or fifteen feet               to the

            right at         the    gate   in the       fence.         I was          i m m e d i a t e l y trapped and was

            unable        to move any       part      of my body except                 my head.                   was    right       in

            front        of me and                    was     behind me.                            was trying          to push

            wit h his arms a ga i n s t           the    people       in front          of me      in order       to    create

            some    space      for me.          While        I was    trapped at first               the    crowd seemed          to

            sway backwards and forwards,                       but after a short                  time    it became even

            w or s e an d the swaying             stopped.            It seemed          to go quiet and               it was as

            if e ve r y t h i n g was      hap p e n i n g    in slow motion.                 At one stage             I saw the

            gate    to the         pitch being opened and three                        or four      people     got out,      taut

            the    gate      then    closed again.                 There were          four   or five       p j/tice     officers

            near    to the gate at             that     time.         I saw y o u n g s t e r s      aged between          10 and

The    crush was        getting       tighter all        the t i m e / ’       I was aware          that      the

game     had star t e d       because       I could hear         tp/4 crowd cheering but I wasn't

paying a t t e n t i o n because            of the    crust*'’
                                                             .       A few minutes after                 the kick

off    I saw a man to my              right.         He ywas about        three      people away from me.

His    face was        blue and he had tee&i sick.                      I think was            dead.     I would

de s c r i b e   him as white,         a ged e / g h t e e n to twenty f o u r , w i t h mousey short

st r a ig ht     hair a n d    clean shaven.             His     nose    looked big and his eyes

looked as though they w e r y popping                     out.          People    ar o u n d him were

shouting          ’Get him out,! his’s d y i n g ’ , but he was                 so tightly trapped that

it w o u l d have       been    impossible          to move    him.        About       five minutes            later

I looked across             a g a i n and    c o u l d n ’t see him.           I a s s u m e d he had either

fa l l e n to the       floor       or been drag g e d backwards.



By this          time my arms were           numb and             It as    though s o m ebody was

st a nding       on my foot.           I was     trapp               about      f i f teen to twenty

a no th er man drag g e d me back              towards      the tunnel.              As     I was      dragged

there were          people     under my feet.                            then    left me and went               back

down the terrace              to help other          people    get      out.      I grab b e d a couple of

y o un ge r      lads who     had fa l l e n and helped them to their                       feet.                   did

the    same.                  and    I then headed for the               tunnel.            As we did so we

called t o                     to    come w ith us a n d         I thought       he was following               us.

         and     I went     t hr o u g h the tunnel.           It was      dark and            I think     there

were     people      lying     on the       floor    in the    tunnel.         /As     we      came out of the

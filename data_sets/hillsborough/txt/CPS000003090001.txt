                 BE: THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


                   INSTRUCTIONS TO COUKSEL TO ADVISE


Counsel will receive herewith

(1)   Interim Reports of Lord Justice Taylor.

(2)   Copy Judgment   R -v- Dytham.

      Counsel will of course be aware of the publicity surrounding the
      publication of the report of Lord Justice Taylor. The report was
      considered by the Director who on 15 August wrote to Mr Peter Wright,
      Chief Constable of South Yorkshire stating that the natter should be the
      subject of a full criminal investigation.

      Counsel will also be aware that Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry was
      assisted by Mr Geoffrey Dear Chief Constable of West Midlands Police
      whose officers conducted initial enquiries and took statements from
      hundreds of witnesses many of whom gave evidence before the enquiry.

      Because of the close involvement of the West Midlands Police with the
      investigation Mr Wright appointed Mr Dear to conduct the criminal
      investigation and he is assisted by Assistant Chief Constable Mervyn
      Jones and a team of officers. Whilst the criminal investigation is, in
      part, an enquiry into officers of the South Yorkshire Police and this is
      how the enquiry has been projected by the media, it will in fact
      encompass the possibility of offences by persons and bodies in addition
      to South Yorkshire police officers, namely, South Yorkshire Police
      Authority, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield City Council; Dr
      Eastwood and football fans.

      Whilst the investigation will focus upon the possible offence of
      manslaughter, police officers may well have committed the Common Law
      offence of malfeasance or culpable non-feasance, this offence is not
      dealt with very fully in Archbold and Counsel may be assisted by the
      judgment in Regina -v- Dytham.

      Counsel will in due course be asked to advise as to possible criminal
      charges, but that is someway ahead, but now Counsel is asked, having
      regard to the unusual circumstances of this investigation, to advise the
      Police on an ongoing basis as to the scope and direction of their
      enquiry.

      An early conference has been arranged to dismiss the case in general
      terms when the Police will explain the extent of their enquiries to date
      and the number and form of witness statements that have been obtained.
                          JOINT ADVICE


We are instructed to advise upon two letters dated 20 October

1989, from Hammond Suddards, solicitors for the Chief

Constable of South Yorkshire in civil proceedings brought by

the families of those who died at Hillsborough Stadium.



1.   There are two lead actions, in effect test cases. There is

to be a pre-trial review on 26 October 1989 at Manchester.



2.   Barrier 124A

This is a request for samples to be taken for metallurgical

testing. In our view this is a reasonable request providing

the following undertakings are given

      (i)    When samples are taken, and when tests are carried

     out wherever they occur, a representative nominated by

     the C.P.S. is to be present.

      (ii)   Photographs are to be taken whenever samples are

      obtained, and copies provided to the C.P.S.

      (iii) All reports and data are to be provided promptly to

      the C.P.S.



3.   Possible prejudice

This is a more difficult area. The bereaved, quite

understandably, wish a speedy resolution of the civil dispute,

and apparently an undertaking has been given that full

cooperation will be given in order to secure a prompt trial.

We have considered In re D.P.R. Futures Limited [1989] 1 WLR


                                 1
778. In our view, the possible prejudice in D.P.R.'s case was

more likely than in the present matter.

     On balance our advice is that no application to stay the

civil proceedings needs to be made. However, we should obtain

an undertaking, if possible form Hammond Suddards, that the

judge dealing with interlocutory matters at any stage be

referred to D.P.R.'s case, so that he may be alerted to the

problem, if necessary making orders restricting publication of

sensitive or potentially prejudicial matter. The same would

apply if the civil trial itself were to precede our final

Advice.

     We shall need to review the situation periodically.

Doubtless Hammond Suddards will agree to liaise direct with

the C.P.S.

1.    Will an indictment for manslaughter lie against a

      company?


      In R v Cory Bros. Ltd     1927   1 K.B.810 Finlay J. quashed

an indictment against a limited company containing counts for

manslaughter and an offence under s.31 of the Offences against

the Person Act 1861 (setting an engine calculated to destroy

life or inflict grievous bodily harm with intent), saying that

a corporation could not be indicted for any felony or for a

misdemeanour involving personal violence.         But in R v I.C.R.

Haulage Company Ltd .    1944   K.B.551, where it was held that

an indictment for a common law conspiracy to defraud would lie

against a company, Stable J., delivering the judgment of the

Court of Criminal Appeal said:

      "It is sufficient in our judgment to say that inasmuch

as that case     Cory Bros,   was decided before the decision in

D . P . P . v Kent and Sussex Contractors L t d . ^1944_ K.3.1^6 and

3 s Chuter v Preeth and Pocock L t d . j 1911* 2 K.B.832 was not

cited at all, if the matter came before the court today the

result might well be different.        As "was pointed out by

Hallett J. in Kent and Sussex Contractors1 Case (at p.157)

this is a branch of the law to which the attitude of the

Courts has in the passage of time undergone a process of

development."

     Stable J. later said that whether a corporation is

liable for the act of an agent must depend, inter alia, "on

the nature of the charge."       On this, Lord Reid in Tesco

Supermarkets Lt d . ▼. Mattrass [1972J A.C.153, 173, coaaeiited:

     "I do not see how the nature of the charge can make any

difference.      If the guilty man was in law identifiable with
the company then whether his offence was serious or venial

his act was the act of the company but if he was not so

identifiable then no act of his, serious or otherwise, was

the act of the company itself ... ”

      A limited company was tried for manslaughter in R v.

Northern Star Miping Construction Company L t d . at Glamorgan

Assizes on February 1 1965 before Streatfeild J. but

acquitted on the merits (The Times, February 5, 1965).

      In Miliar (Robert)(Contractors) Lt d . /197Q   2 Q.B.54 a

limited company was convicted of counselling and procuring

six offences of causing death by dangerous driving.      Robert

Millar, the managing director, sent out the driver, who was

convicted as the principal offender, with a vehicle, knowing

full well that the front offside tyre wss in a dangerous

state.     It does not appear to have been questioned in the

Court of Appeal (Fenton Atkinson and Megaw L.JJ. and Crichton J.)

that a limited company could be guilty of such an offence.        As

the   managing director, who was the directing mind and will of

the   company, had actual knowledge of the risk, it appears that

he and the company could equally well have been convicted of

being party to causing death by reckless driving which, the

House of Lord's has held, has the same" ingredients as man­

slaughter:     Jennings v. United States Government £l983^] 1

A.C.624;     R. v Seymour [l983j 2 A.C.493.   It would be very

surprising if a company could be convicted, whether as a

principal or a secondary party, of causing death by dangerous

or, today, reckless driving, and yet not be liable to con­

viction of manslaughter.

      There are some offences of which a corporation could

never be convicted as a principal because it is incapable of

performing the actus reus (e.g. bigamy) but of which it might
be convicted as an accessory.      It may z e that offences of

driving fail into this category, because the corporation

rar.not drive, but manslaughter does not.        In Robert Millar

the managing director's act (and therefore the company's act)

was not one of driving:     but it was an act which caused death

and that is the &ctus reus of manslaughter.         (Procuring

requires proof of a causal link between the act and the

commission of the offence:     a.-G.'s Reference (No.l of 1975) C“W ? 5 l

1.3.773)•

     There seems to be no English case in which a corporation

has been convicted of manslaughter but there is no modern

authority that it cannot be so convicted except the dictum

R. v Cory Bros.    In the United States it has several times

been held that a corporation nay be convicted of manslaughter.

A leading case is State v Lehigh Valley Railway C o . Supreme

Court of New Jersey, 1917, 90 N.J.L., 103 Atl 685, affd 9 h

N.J.L. 171, 111 Atl.257.      Swayze J. said

     "... a corporation aggregate may be held criminally for

criminal acts of misfeasance or non-feasance unless there is

something in the nature of the crime, the character of the

punishaent prescribed therefor, or the essential ingredients

of the crime, which makes it impossible for a corporation to

be held.    Involuntary manslaughter does not come within any

of these exceptions.      It may be the result of negligence

merely, and arise out of mere non-feasance ..."

     This seems to be a sound statement of principle.            In

some states it has been held that a corporation cannot be

guilty of manslaughter, usually because of a statutory

definition interpreted to mean that the offence is the

killing of a human being by a human being.         That Is also the

position in New Zealand:     Murray Wright Ltd    Jl97oJ NZLR 476,
criticised by Sir F.   Adams in ( m a i n * ! Law and Practice in
New Zealand, para 9 2 ' 2 .   North and McCarthy JJ "ere :     the

opinion that a corporation might be guilty of manslaughter

as a secondary party.

      It is not surprising that Bingham L.J. should have been

tentatively of the opinion, in R. v. H.M. Coroner for East

Kent Zx a. Sooonfer. that a corporation may be convicted of

manslaughter or that he would need considerable persuasion

to reach a contrary conclusion.       In my opinion, it is most

improbable that it would now be held that an indictment for

manslaughter would not lie.


2.    The Law of Manslaughter

      Two distinct types of manslaughter are relevant.

(1)   Manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act

It is unnecessary to prove that the accused knew that the act

was unlawful or that it was dangerous:         P.P.P. v. Newbury and

Jones (1976) 62 Cr App R 291.      The unlawful act need not be

directed at anyone:     Goodfellow (1986) 83 Cr App R 23.       An

act is "dangerous'’ if it is "such as all sober and reasonable

people could inevitably recognise must subject the other

person to, at least, the risk of some harm resulting therefrom,

albeit notserirus harm.11     Church £l9.66)    1 Q.B.59 at 70, CA.

If such an unlawful and dangerous act, attributable to the

company, could be identified and proved to have resulted in

death, it would seem to follow that the company would be

guilty of manslaughter.       If the company were guilty of an

offence under s.44 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1979 and the

commission of the offence resulted in death, it would

necessarily follow that the company was guilty of manslaughter.

By definition, the offence Involves "serious danger to life."

Since the company commits the offence simply by being the

owner of a ship in port in that condition, it would appear
.Tiir.d and w i l l ” of t h e company.      However, for t h e   reasons

given 'ey the Wrecks Commission at pp.71-72 of their Report,

it seems clear that the company was not guilty of this

offence nor of that under s.3(1) of the Merchant Shipping

(Load Lines) Act 1967.           I am not aware of any other offence,

apart from manslaughter itself, of which the company was

g u i l t y , and, i n the absence of such an offence there is no
c a s e of manslaughter to answer on this ground.
(2)   Manslaughter by "gross negligence1* or "recklessness"

      Until recently it was arguable that manslaughter could

be committed by acting (or omitting where there is a duty to

act) with a high degree of negligence - that is, by deviating,

not slightly but greatly, from the standard of care to be

expected of a reasonable person - and that this did not require

proof of any state of mind.               The test laid down in Bateman

(1925) 19 Cr App R 3 at 11 is whether -

      ” ... in the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the

accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation between

subjects and showed such disregard for the life and safety of

ethers as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct

deserving of punishment.’’

      Though the words,       "showed such disregard for the life

and safety of others," suggest that the accused must be aware

of a risk to the life and safety of others, oth^r cases

suggest that "criminal negligence" did not require proof of

any foresight of harm.          Thus in Lamb        |l96?J 2      Q.B.981 at

990, Sachs LJ said (obiter) -

      "... it would, of course, have been fully open to a jury,

if properly directed, to find the accused guilty                  of »an-

slaughter     because they considered his view as to there being

no danger was formed in a criminally negligent way.*                   in
bodily harm must be proved:       a "high degree of negligence" was

all that was required.

      Since the decisions of the House of Lords in Caldwell and
                     f
                     AC   3^1 and 51C, there appears to have been a

change.      In Seymour (1983) 76 Cr App R 211 at 216 Watkins L J ,

delivering the Judgment of the Court of Apreal, said:

      ” ... we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or

helpful to make references to compensation and negligence.

The Lawrence direction on recklessness is comprehensive and of

general application to all offences, including manslaughter

involving the driving of motor vehicles recklessly and should

be given to Juries without in ar.y way being diluted."

      In Kong Cheuk Kwan v The Queen ( 1985) 82 Cr App R 18

Lord Roskill, giving the opinion of the Privy Council, agreed

with that comment.         The "model direction" in Lawrence, as

adapted to the facts of that case (a collision between hydro-

131 -S j , WT; S —
      "Did their respective acts of navigation create an

obvious and sericus risk of causing physical damage to some

other ship and thus to other persons who might have been

travelling in the area of the collision at the material time?

If so did any of the defendants by their respective acts of

negligence so navigate either without having given any thought

to the possibility of that risk or, while recognising that the

risk existed, take that risk?"

      The particular importance of this from the point of view

of the present case is that the Caldwell/Lawrence test is said

to require proof of one or other of the two "states of ®ind* -

"not giving thought" being treated as a state of mind.          In

Caldwell, Lord Dip lock, with whom the majority agreed, said
that recklessness was the nens rea of the offence of cri'inal

 lattage, with wr.ich the case was cncerned, and that "rr.er.s rea

is, by definition, a state of saind of the accused himself at

the time he lid the physical act that constitutes the actus

reus of the offence;      it cannot be the     mental state of some
                    f
non-existent, hypothetical person."          He continued to refer to

two states of mind as did the courts in Seymour and Kong Cheuk

Xwan.

        A corporation has no mind and it follows that, if it is

to be convicted of an offence requiring pro-.-f of a state of

mind, it must be proved that the material state of mind existed

in some person who can be said to be the "directing mind and

will" of     the corporation.     It may be that this difficulty   does

net arise in    the case of an offence which can be committed      by

inadvertent negligence, gross or otherwise.


3.      Is there evidence that the company committed manslaughter?

        The company cannot be convicted of manslaughter unless it

is proved that:

        1.   The company caused death and

        2.   did so with the fault required by the definition of

manslaughter

(1)     Did the company cause death?

        This means that it must be proved that death was caused

not merely by the company’s        employees or agents but by one or

more of those persons whose        acts are in law the   acts of the

company and whose state of mind is the state of mind of the

company.      The coroner was of the opinion that the conduct of

shore management and of the        directors of the company was too

remote to be a cause*       Was    it?
        Tc constitute manslaughter, a person's conduct must be a

causi of ieitr..         It need not _e the only csuse or even the

sain cause as long as it contributed significantly to the

result.        Whether it did so contribute is generally a question

of fact for the jury:         Pagett (1983) 76 Cr App R 279, 297-291.
T                    r


        (i)    it was the duty of management to establish a safe

system of operation;

        (ii)   such a system was not established;     and

        (iii) the existence of such a system would have prevented

the disaster -

        then, in my opinion, there is evidence that the conduct

of management was a cause.

        It is -.ell established in the law of tort that an employer

cwss a personal, non-delegable, duty to his employees to take

reasonable care to provide a safe place of work and a safe

system of work.          His liability for breach of that duty is

personal, not vicarious, anc it        applies tc corporations as

much as to ether persons:        Wilsons and Clyde Coal C o . v English

 1938    AC 57.     It has never been doubted that the employer has

caused a tortious injury if it results from the unsafe state of

the place of work or the lack of a safe system.             There is no

difference in the principles of causation in the law of tort

and of crime.       The existence of a duty of care in the civil

law is not conclusive of the existence of a similar duty in the

criminal law;      but it is highly persuasive.      Cf. Pittwood

(1902) 19 TLR 37 where a contractual duty was held to be the

foundation of a duty to act in a case of manslaughter by

omission.
(2)   Attribution of fa'.It to the company

      This is the difficult question.       It is necessary tc

prove that someone who can be identified with the company

acted,   or, _n breach of duty, failed to act, with the fault

required for the offence.      It seems quite clear that neither

Mr. Stanley, the /"assistant bosun, nor Mr. 5a be 11, the chief

officer, was sufficiently senior.       The case of Captain Lewry

is perhaps aore arguable.      He was responsible for the aspect

of the company's business represented by the Herald.       However,

it seems that the person in charge of a branch of a company's

business is not to be regarded as the co-pany for this purpose.

In Tesco Supermarkets L t d . v. Nattrass jl972j AC 153 the

manager of a Tesco surermarket was held to be "another person",

distinct from the company for the purposes of the company's

liability.     While the degree of independence of the master of

a vessel at sea is no doubt greater than that of the manager

of a supermarket, there is probably no difference in principle:

neither is at the heart of the company’s affairs.        The Herald

w=s only one part of a large business and control of the

HeraId was very far removed from control of the company.          If

the captain of the Herald were taken to be the company,

presumably every captain of a British Airways aircraft would be

British Airways - and perhaps every bus driver would be the bus

company.     Corporate liability would be extended far beyond

present English law.

The Board of Directors

      The 3oard of Directors is certainly to be identified with

the company.     The Report finds (14.1):     "they did not apply

their mines to the question:     what orders should be given for

the safety of our ships?     The directors did not have any

proper comprehension of what their duties were."        It has to

be considered whether there is evidence of the elements of
that "obvious" means obvi us to the reasonably prudent man, not

necessarily to the particular defendant:         Slliott v C (1983)

77 Cr A zr. R 103;    Stephen Malcolm R (1984) 79 Cr App R 334, CA.

In this context, rit must mean '’obvious to the reasonably prudent

director of a shipping company."           It is not clear what, if any­

thing,    '’serious'* adds.

(ii)    Risk of what?     The answer seems to be, risk of the ship

sailing with bow doors open (since that was the cause of death)

and consequent injury to the person.          Awareness of a risk that

the ship might sail when overloaded, or with other hazards not

proved to have contributed to the accident, is not relevant.

According to the Report (18.3),         ”by the autumn of 1986 the

shore staff of the company were well aware of the possibility

that one of their ships would sail with her stern or bow doors

open.      They were also aware of a very sensible and simple

device in the form of indicator lights which had been suggested

by responsible .tasters."         Among the shore staff who were aware

of the facts was Mr. Cevelin, who was a director, and who

acoears to have had at l^ast le facto responsibility for the

relevant aspects of the Company’s affairs.           There appears to

be evidence of a serious risk which would have been obvious to

the reasonably prudent director.

        If there is evidence of an obvious and serious risk, there

is also evidence that Mr. Develin either gave no thought to the

possibility of it or, while recognising that it existed, took

the risk.      If so, there is evidence that he *>as guilty of

manslaughter and, if his act can be attributed to the company,

so was the company.           But if he considered the matter and

decided that there was no risk, or that the risk was no greater

than that which is always accepted in sending a ship to sea
'for there is always some risk) then he wculd r.ct he guilty i r . i

neither w :uld the company.    if ”r . Develin testified to that

effect, the question for the jury wculd re whether what he said

might reasonably be true.

     As tc the beard of directors generally, the Commission's

opinion was that'they did not apply their minds to the question

at all;    and if that is so, and the risk was one which should

have been oovi~us to them, they too should be guilty of man­

slaughter.     But it does not aooear the board was aware of the

possibility that one of their ships would sail with the bow

doors open.     In the absence of any such evidence, the question

then is the extent to which they are to be treated as if they

knew what they ought to have known.      Miss C ' s ignorance of the

croterties of white spirit (Slliott v C, above) did not avail

her in the least.     But the case against the Board of directors

as a body looks distinctly weaker.

     My conclusi:n is that it appears from the Report that

there is evidence that the company was guilty of manslaughter.

The evidence is presumably to be found in admissions made by

the senior officials of the company at the inquiry.

Mr. Allan Green, Q.C.,
Direcor of Public Prosecutions,
Headquarters,

LONDON.  SW1H 9AZ.


Dear Director of Public Prosecutions,

Your recent decision to not proceed with prosecutions against
individuals or organisations involved in the Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster disturbs and perplexes this Authority, given the weight,
emphasis and clarity of evidence already available on public record.

I request that you provide this Authority with all the relevant
criteria, utilised by the Crown Prosecution Service in this instance, in
formulating your decision.

For your information a formal protest has been forwarded to the Home
Secretary on this matter.

Yours sincerely,




Councillor Harry Chase,
Chair,
Hillsborough Working Party.

 Bo err



 I write in reply      to your letter of 6 September 1990 concerning

 the Hillsborough      Football Stadium disaster and my decision not

 to institute any      criminal proceedings.



 Initially may I,      through you, express my sympathy to those who

 lost relatives and friends in this terrible tragedy.



 The possibility of a criminal prosecution being instituted was

 given the most careful consideration.         I would stress that I

 applied the same evidential criteria in this case as is applied

 in all cases considered by the Crown Prosecution Service.        This

 criteria, set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, is whether




^BKEN0910.G05\
or not the evidence available discloses a realistic prospect of

a conviction being recorded in the courts            if proceedings are

instituted based on that evidence.



The case had been thoroughly investigated by the West Midlands

Police.        This   investigation   produced   extensive   evidence   and

additionally all the evidence and documentation received by Lord

Justice Taylor's public enquiry was made available to me.                A

number of individuals and bodies were considered as potential

defendants for several criminal offences.          After a very full and

thorough scrutiny of all the material I reached the conclusion

that the evidence was not sufficient for there to be a realistic

prospect of convicting any person of any criminal offence.               In

reaching this conclusion I had the benefit of a joint opinion

provided by two experienced Leading Counsel.



Whilst I note that you have written to the Home Secretary to

protest at my decision,        I can assure you and all those whose

interests you represent^ that the decision was reached in this

case only after the most careful deliberation and analysis of all

the information and the relevant law.

     The Attorney General has now had an opportunity to consider
     the joint advice from Mr Gareth Williams QC and Mr Peter Birts
     QC.  He is in complete agreement with the conclusion expressed
     in that opinion.  I understand that the CPS proposes to make

Before Mr Justice Turner



Central Criminal Court     22/5/1990-25/5/1990



Counsel for the 8th Defendant

   Sydney Kentridge QC

   Jonathan Caplan

   Jeffrey Chapman



Counsel for the Crown

   David Jeffreys QC

   David Calvert-Smith

   Edward Brown



MOTION

To quash the indictment against the Company on the ground that

as a matter of law a company, not being a natural person,

cannot commit the common law offence of manslaughter.



RULING

Against the motion. Full reasons were reserved to another date

- possibly 5th of June being the date of the pre-trial review.




                                1
APPEAL

Initially it was believed by both parties that the Company

could only appeal against this ruling after the trial itself.

However Turner J announced that judicial review of his

decision would be available immediately.



INDICTMENT

This was drafted in very wide and very general terms, merely

stating that on the relevant date the Company "unlawfully

killed" a few named victims. In particular the indictment did

not specify either the species of manslaughter alleged or

wether it was alleged the Company was liable as a princpal

offender or as a secondary offender. In the course of argument

however the following became clear;

-the Crown felt unable to pursue a prosecution on the basis of

constructive (or unlawful act) manslaughter (see below).

-the species of manslaughter alleged is a type of

recklessness/gross negligence manslaughter, in that sailing

the ship with the bow doors open created a "serious and

obvious risk that the ship would capsize" etc.

-although there was considerable debate on the subject of

secondary liability (see below) Turner J confined his ruling

to the issue of the liability of the Company as a principal in

the first degree.




                               2
DEFENCE SUBMISSIONS

That the Company not being a natural person cannot as a matter

of law commit the common law offence of manslaughter.

It was accepted by the defence that a company may be guilty of

certain criminal offences involving mens rea. However against

this it was submitted that as a matter of law there are some

offences which only natural people can commit,eg offences of

violence, perjury, bigamy.



Mens Rea

The Identification doctrine states that a company is to be

identified with its personnel that represent the directing

mind and will of the company, see Tesco v Nattrass, Bolton v

Martin etc.

The defence submitted that where you have an offence the actus

reus of which is capable of being committed by a company, then

the identification doctrine is the means by which the mens rea

of that company is revealed ie. by examining the mens rea of

the relevant "controlling officer". This was the only

relevance of the identification doctrine. It was not of

universal application to be applied to all crimes and it did

not assist in determining which crimes as a matter of law a

company is capable of committing.

The defence's key submission was that some offences were

incapable of being committed by a company and that the legal

force of this proposition flowed from the definition of those




                               3
offences. Thus manslaughter is defined as "the unlawful

killing of one human being by another human being” , and this

definition was supported by an historical analysis of the

definition, eg. Coke, Hale, Blackstone, Stephens, Hawkins,

Halsbury's, Archbold etc. The critical point was that it was

an essential part of the actus reus of the offence that it be

committed by a human being.

Authorities.    R v Cory Bros (1927)- Finlay J held that a

company could not be indicted for i) manslaughter (then still

a felony) and ii) a misdemeanour involving personal violence.

R v Murray Wright Ltd (1970) New Zealand Court of Appeal- held

that only a human being is capable of committing manslaughter.

The more recent authorities that seem to suggest a weakening

of the R v Cory Bros position were explained as being relevant

only to the possible mens rea of companies rather than

deciding which crimes the actus reus of which a company is

legally capable of committing.



Secondary liability. Defence submitted that a company cannot

be an accessory to manslaughter. However if the court was

against them on this they submitted that a company (or indeed

a human being) can only aid, abet, counsel or procure

constructive (unlawful act) manslaughter, ie. as a matter of

law one cannot have accessories to reckless/gross negligence

manslaughter.




                                 4
CROWN SUBMISSIONS

Main submission was that the identification doctrine as

explained in Tesco v Nattrass et al is an established legal

principle. By this doctrine the intention and the actions of

the controlling officers are held to be the mens rea and the

actus reus of the company itself. This doctrine has developed

so strongly over recent years that the old authorities have to

be reviewed in the light of it.

Meeting the defence case the Crown submitted that the

definition of manslaughter is "the unlawful killing of one

human being by another". It was accepted that as a matter of

common sense an element of "human agency" was required, but

denied that the actus reus could only be performed by a human

being. It was submitted that the old definitions specified

that the killing had to be done by a human being so as to

distinguish manslaughter from deodands (an old doctrine

covering deaths from non-human causes eg falling trees,

animals etc.) rather than to exclude the possibility of

corporate liability.

The Crown submitted that there is in theory no crime which a

company cannot commit. It was accepted that as a matter of

common sense however it made no sense to indict a company for

murder as it could not be effectivel sentenced if found

guilty. The difficulty with offences such as rape, perjury and

bigamy was only practical in that it was difficult to imagine

how a controlling officer could commit these offences whilst




                                  5
still acting within the scope of his office. There was however

no conceptual difficulty with the notion of a company

committing these offences. The Crown accepted that every case

of homicide requires a human act/omission but argued that this

does not preclude a company from being personally liable for

the consequences of that act/omission.

Authorities. R v Cory Bros- explained on the basis that i) the

manslaughter point decided on the basis that the crime then

was still a felony, and ii) the misdemeanour point was decided

per incuriam   in that the identification doctrine was not

argued.

R v ICR Haulage - dicta doubting the decision in Cory Bros

relied upon.

R v Murray Wright (NZ) - decision at first instance relied

upon, albeit that it was subsequently overturned on appeal.



In the course of argument the Crown explained that they had

initially considered prosecuting the Company for several

statutory offences, but that they had finally decided on

manslaughter. At the time of the disaster there were also a

number of regulations in force (esp the Merchant Shipping

(health and Safety: General Duties) Regs 1984,reg 4) which the

Company may have been in breach of. It was felt however that a

breach of such a statutory duty (ie to take due care of

passengers and crew) being a mere omission could not amount to

an   unlawful act for the purposes of constructive




                               6
manslaughter. Similarly mere negligence as evidenced by such a

breach was not sufficient in itself to support a prosecution

for manslaughter of the reckless / gross negligence variety.



Secondary liability. The Crown accepted that a party cannot

negligently aid, abet etc a negligent act or omission, but

argued that it was possible to aid, abet etc a negligent act

or omission. This proposition was supported by authorities in

which defendants, including companies, were convicted as

accessories to crimes of negligence, see particularly R v

Robert Millar Co.



NOTE. There was no discussion as to whether all or any of the

seven human Defendants were "controlling officers" in the

sense that they constituted the "directing mind and will" of

the Company. It was accepted that they might be but that this

was a question of fact to be decidd at the full trial.

                       JUDGEMENT OF TURNER 3 .DELIVERED JUNE 5TH

                               IN THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURTS



                  At    the   o u ts e t   for     giving   my      reasons    for   ruling     again st    the     8th

D efendant's m otion to quash I would like to e xp ress my thanks to Counsel for each

side.     Firstly for their adm irable skeleton argum en ts and secondly for the c la r ity and

c o g e n c y o f their argum ents.



                  The   main thrust           o f th e   8th D efen d an t's argum ent in support o f the

submission was that not only does English law not recogn ise the o f f e n c e o f corporate

manslaughter       but as a m a tte r            o f positive English law         m anslaughter can             only be

c o m m itte d   by a natural person.              It was no a c c id e n t that there has never been a

prosecution       for corporate        manslaughter.             It was a c c e p te d by the 8th D efendant

how ever, th at th e ob sta cle in the way o f such a prosecution was not attributing the

necessary m ensrai to a corporation.



                  The prosecution subm itted that th ere was no all em bracing d efinition o f '

murder or m anslaughter and th e re fo r e there was no reason why a corporation could

not be     found guilty o f        m anslaughter.              The e x c e p tio n s to the c o m p le t e crim inal

liability o f corporations w e r e firstly whether punishment is impossible to e n f o r c e e.g.

murder      and    secondly      c e rta in      exclusively     personal     offen ces   for    e x a m p le    sexual

o f f e n c e s , bigam y, and possible purjery.



                  It was further argued by the prosecution that the old d efin itio n s relied

upon by th e 8th D efendant w ere not e xclu sive o f the notion o f c o r p o r a te liability

simply b e c a u se corporations w e r e not expressly included in them .                  It is not surprising
th at the idea o f corporate responsibility is not included when in (?) Lord Holt stated

that:

                   "A Corporation is not indictable but the particular m em bers o f it

                  are"



                   A ltern atively, it was argued by the prosecution that if it was n ecessary

th at death must be caused by a human being then the id en tification d octrin e means

that if the perpertrator is th e em bodim ent o f the corporation then the corporation

i t s e l f is liable.   This argum ent however d e tr a c ts     from   the strength o f the main

argum ent.        In 1842 (?) a corporation was indicatable but not for another 100 years or

so was the rationale for this understood.             In R v Birmingham and G lo u c e ste r Railway

Company (1842) P atteson 3. said:

                   "but it was said that an indictm ent will not lie against a corporation

                   .... and as a general proposition it is opposed to a number o f c a s e s ,

                   which shew that a corporation m aybe indicted for a breach o f duty

                   opposed upon it by law, though not for a felon y, or for c r im e s

                   involving personal vio le n c e , as for riots or assaults."



                   Stated e x c ep tio n s are noted since th e y and other dicta are relied upon by

the 8th D efe n d a n t as showing that in English law a corporation is not in d icatab le for

such c r im e s, and including in this manslaughter as w ell.



                   R v Birmingham and G loucester Railway             was a c a s e o f c o r p o r a te non

fe a s a n c e . In the sam e volum e o f the reports a similar rule is sta te d for c a s e s o f mis

f e a s a n c e , s e e R v Great North o f England Railway Company.         Lord Denm an who dealt

with in his usual trunchent s ty le said a t page 325:
                  "The law is o f te n entangled in te c h n ic a l em barrassm ents:

                  but there is none here.            It is as e asy to ch arge one person, or a body

                  corporate, with e r e c tin g a bar across a public road as with th e non

                  repair o f it; and they may as w ell be c o m p elled to pay a fine for the

                  a c t as for the omission."



                  Som e dicta occur in old cases:

                  "a corporation cannot be guilty o f treason or felony" it m ight be added

o f purjery or o f f e n c e s against the person, but nobody has sought fixam with a c ts of

im m orality.          These plainly derive their c h a racter from the corrupted mind o f the

person c o m m ittin g th em , and are violations o f the social duties that belong to men

and subjects.           A corporation which as such has no such duties cannot be guilty in

t h e se c a s e s but they may be guilty as a body c orp orate o f comm anding a c t s to be

done to the nuisance o f th e com m unity a t large.                          The l a te c a s e o f R v Birmingham

and G loucester Railway was confined to the s t a t e o f things then b e fore the court,

which am ounted to n o n -fe a s a n c e only: but was by no m eans intended to deny the

liability o f a corporation for mis feasance."



                  The e x c e p tio n s relied upon included treason and felonies b e c a u s e o f the

punishment       involved,      and    purjery       and   o f fe n c e s    against   the     person b e c a u s e   they

required a corrupted mind.              Therefore there w e r e two main obstructions to corporate

liability a t this s ta g e . One a corporation had no soc ia l duties imposed upon it and

could not form that s t a t e o f mind which was usual requirem ent for crim inal o f fe n c e s .

Accordingly a corporation could only com m it absolute o f f e n c e s .                            Two, if a m ental

e le m e n t   could    be    attributed      to    corporations            how   to   ascertain      the    mind     of    a

corporation.



                  The        problem   next        arose   in a      c onsid eration      of    the    law    under        the

Pharmacy A c t 1868 in P h arm aceu tical Society v London Provincial Supply A ssociation

Lim ited (1880).        In this c a s e th e House o f Lords ruled again st th e S o c iety on a narrow
interpretation o f th e r e le v a n t s t a t u t e but Lord Blackburn observed :

                "if this word (person) does include a corporation - I quite a g r e e that

                a corporation can n ot in one sense, c o m m it a c r im e - a corporation

               cannot be imprisoned or hanged; but a corporation may be fined, and

                a corporation may pay damages; and t h e r e fo r e I must totally dissent

                from the supposition that a body c orp orate or a corporation th a t

                incorporated i t s e lf for the purpose o f publishing a newspaper could not

                be tried and fined or an action for d am ages brought against it for a

                liable, although a corporation which c o m m its a nuisance could not

                be c o n v ic te d o f the nuisance or the like.     I m ust say that I do not fe e l

                the slig h te st doubt upon that part o f th e c a s e . If you could g e t over

                the first d iffic u lty o f saying that th e word "person" here may be

                construed to include an artificial person, a corporation, I should not

                have the le a s t d ifficu lty upon those other grounds which have been

                suggested.

                But, My Lords, my conclusion, looking a t this A c t , is that it is clear

                to my mind th e word "person" here is so used as to shew that it does

                not include a corporation, that th ere is no o b je c t or intention o f

                the s ta t u t e which shew s that it is requisite to e x te n d the word to a

                sense which probably those who used it in leg is la tio n , w ere not thinking

                of at all.   I do not think that the L egislature was thinking o f bodies

                corporate a t all.    Beginning with th e pream ble th e A ct says, 'whereas

                it is e x p e d ien t for the safety o f the public th a t persons keeping open

                shop for th e retailin g, dispensing, or com pounding o f poisons, and

                persons known as c h e m ists and drugists, should possess a c o m p e t e n t

                practised k now ledge o f their business'.         Stopping there it is q u ite

                plain that th o se who used that language w ere not thinking o f

                corporations.     A corporation may in one s e n s e , for all substantial

                purposes o f p r o tec tin g the public, possess a c o m p e t e n t know ledge o f its
                       business, if it em ploys c o m p e te n t d irectors, managers, and so forth.

                       But it cannot possibly have a c o m p e t e n t know ledge in itself".



                       The next c a s e chronologically is R. v Cory Bros (1927) w here th e r e w ere

tw o o f f e n c e s     alleged against the company. The first manslaughter and the second

s e tt in g up an engine c a lc u la te d to destroy human life contrary to s e c t io n 31 o f the

O ffe n c e s Against the Person A ct 1861.



                       Apart from th e ruling o f the trial judge Finlay 3. on the question of

corporate liability the c a s e is also o f interest b e c a u s e it was decided shortly a f te r the

procedural bar against indicting corporations had been rem oved by S e ction 33 o f the

Criminal 3u stic e A ct 1925.              The head note says :

                       ".... an in d ictm en t will not lie against a corporation either for a

                       felony or for a misdemeanour involving personal v iolen ce under Se c tio n

                       31 o f the O ffe n c e s Against the Person A c t 1861"

The 8th D efen d an t subm itted th a t th e ratio o f Cory Bros, is that th e a c tu sr e u s of

m anslaughter is som ething th at a corporation can n ot c o m m it, but in th e argu m en ts o f

Counsel      in th at c a s e a t       page    812 it was argued on behalf o f the com p an y that

m ensrea cannot be present in th e c a se of an a r tific ia l e n tity .                   In support o f this

proposition the tw o railway c a s e s were cited , as was R v Tyler.                       The judgem ents in

Tyler m erely repeat the lim itation s on corporate liability as defined by th e railway

cases.



                       Finlay   3. in Cory Bros, disposed o f the              procedural point con cern in g

Section 33 o f the 1925 A c t and then referred to Archbold's sum m arisation o f the law

which stated:

                       "By Section 2 (1), o f the Interpretation A c t 1889, 'in the c o n s tr u c tio n

                       o f every e n a c tm e n t relating to an o f f e n c e punishable on in d ic tm e n t or

                       summary c o n v ictio n , whether c ontained in an A c t passed b e fo re or
                 a f te r January 1st 1890 the expression 'person' shall, unless a contrary

                 intention appears, include a body corporate"...

                 a contrary intention would be inferred in th e c a s e o f treason, a

                 felony, or m isdem eanours involving personal violence"; and for that

                 proposition th e c a s e o f P harm aceutical S o c iety is cited."



Finlay      3.   further relied upon the two railway c a s e s and in particular Lord                   Denman's

ruling and then w ent on to say:

                 "... the less I say about this m atter the b e t te r . If it is c o n c e d e d , as

                 I think it must be con ced ed , that the substantive law is not a lte r e d

                 by the A ct o f 1925, then we have simply to ascertain from th e

                 authorities what the law is.          It is alw ays a tem p tin g argum ent to say

                 th at the c om m on law ought to keep pace with modern d e v e lo p m e n ts , and

                 t h e r e fo r e it ought to be decided th at t h e s e authorites are an tiq u ated and

                 th at in 1927 they do not apply.          Well, all I can say to that a rgu m en t is

                 this : it may be th at the law ought to be altered; on the otherhand it

                 may be that t h e s e authorities ought still to govern the law , but it is

                 enough for me to say, sitting here, that in my opinion I am bound by

                 th e auth orities, which show quite clearly th a t as the law stands an

                 indictm en t will not lie against a corporation e ith er for a felony or for

                 a misdemeanour o f th e nature se t out in th e second count o f this

                 in d ictm en t, which is based upon Section 31 o f the O ffe n c e s A gainst the

                 Person A c t 1861."

In 1943 and 1944 three c a s e s w ere decided that had a w atershed e f f e c t .                The fir st o f

t h e s e is DPP v Kent & Sussex Contractors Limited. A d ecision o f the D ivisional Court

con cern in g an o f f e n c e under th e Motor Fuel (Rationing) Order 1941 o f t h e using o f a

fa ls e   docum ent   with   th e in te n t   to d e c e iv e . The   J u s tic e s a cquitted   the   com pany

b e c a u s e th e o f f e n c e required an A c t o f will or s t a t e o f mind which could not be
imputed to a com pany.           In that c a s e Viscount C a ld e c o te said:

                 "Mr Carey Evans submits that a company can only be held to be

                 responsible in respect o f the intention or knowledge o f its agents, the

                 officers of the company, to the same exten t as a private individual is

                 responsible for the a cts o f his agent, and therefore, that the respondent

                 company cannot be held to form the intention or to have the knowledge

                 necessary to constitute the offences charged.

He has not disputed the abstract proposition that a com p an y can have know ledge and

can form an intention to do an a c t.              A company can n ot be found guilty o f ce rta in

crim inal o f f e n c e s , such as treason or other o f f e n c e s for which it is provided that

death or imprisonment is the only punishment, but th e re are a number o f crim inal

o f f e n c e s o f which a company can be convicted. In th e judgem ent o f Finlay 3. in R. v

Cory Bros, and Co there is a convenien t c itation for th e judgem ent o f P a tte s o n 3. in

R. v Birmingham and G loucester Railway Company.                        This c ita tio n begins with the

quotation o f a n o te by Holt C3.

                 "A corporation is not endictable

                 but the particular members o f it are".

P a tte so n 3. is then quoted as saying

                 "what the nature o f the offence was to which th e observation

                 was intended to apply does not appear; and that a general proposition

                 it is opposed to a number o f cases, which showed that a corporation

                 may be indicted for breach of duty imposed upon it by law, though not

                 for a felony, or for crim es involving personal violence, as for riots

                 or assaults."

Under th e     D efence   (General) Regulations          1939 it    is com m o n   for o f f e n c e s   to   be

c r e a te d in which certain a g r e e m e n ts are required to be found and th e p resen t c a s e

seem s   to   m e to   fall within      that category. They are o f f e n c e s in which it is not

m aterial to consider whether th ere is or is not m en srea which I understand to mean

crim inal in ten tion because th e ingredients are sta te d in t h e regulation c r e a tin g the

offence.      For in stan c e in the present c a se one o f th e n e c e ssa r y ingredients o f the

second o f f e n c e charged is an intent to d ec e iv e . When th a t in te n t is sta te d to be
n ecessary it se e m s to m e idle to enquire whether a m en srea is or is not involved.

Lord C a ld e c o te later went on:

                   "In Chuter v Freeth and Pocock Limited to which we will not refer

                   the question seem s to me to have been similar to the one raised in

                   this case. The headnote is "by Section 20 sub section 6 o f the Sale o f

                   Food and Drugs A ct 1899, it is enacted that every person who, in

                   respect o f an article o f food or drugs sold by him, gives to the purchaser

                  a false warranty in writing, shall be liable on summary conviction,

                  to a fine as therein mentioned, unless he proves that when he gave

                  the warranty he had reason to believe that the statem ents or

                  descriptions contained therein were true: held that a joint stock

                  company incorporated under the Companies A ct can be convicted o f an

                  offen ce under the above enactment."

I should read a s ta te m e n t in the special c a s e "the m a g is tr a te although upon the fa c ts

as      above s ta t e d   he   would have c o n v icte d    if the   respondents   servants had been

principals      in th e m atter was y e t o f the opinion th a t, as the e x e m p tin g c la u se o f the

s e ctio n im plied th a t only such a person could adm it the o f f e n c e as was cap ab le o f

believing,      then as a corporation having no mind could not e x e r c is e that f a c u lty , the

respondents,        being a corporation, were not liable under th e section."

     Lord A lverston e CJ stated th a t      f a c t and then said

                  "the m agistrate has held that in as much as th e person who             giv es a

                   f a ls e warranty is m ade liable unless he proves th a t when he g a v e the

                  warranty he had reason to b elieve that th e s ta t e m e n t s or

                  descriptons contained therein w ere true th e r e fo r e "the person" cannot

                  be construed as including a corporation, but m ust be lim ite d to

                  natural persons capable o f b e lie f.       In my v iew that is to o narrow a

                  c onstruction .    Where a person is capable o f giving a warranty th at

                  person is liable to a fine.       There is no . reason why a warranty should

                  not be given by a corporation.            It can g iv e a warranty through its
                                         ag e n ts, and through its agents it can b e lie v e or not b e lie v e , as

                                         th e c a s e m aybe, th a t the sta te m e n ts in the warranty are tru e.                        A

                                         similar point has been raised in c a s e s con cern in g a liability o f a

                                         corporation in a c tio n s which, in the c a s e o f an individual, will

                                         involve an enquiry into a s ta te of mind, such as fraud, li ble,

                                         or m alicious prosecution.              It is w ell s e t t le d th at a corporation may

                                         be liable in all th ose actions. "

In th e sam e c a s e MacNaughten 3. a fte r referring to th e background said:

                                         "It is true th at a corporation can only have know ledge and form an

                                         intention through its human agents, but c ir c u m s ta n c e s may be such

                                         that the know ledge an intention o f th e a gen t m ust be reputed to

                                         th e body c o r p orate.    Mr Carey Evans says th a t, although a body

                                         corporate may be capable o f having k now ledge and also o f form ing

                                         and intention, it cannot have a mens rea and a responsible a g e n t o f a

                                         com pany, a c tin g within the scope o f his authority, puts forward on its

                                         behalf a docum ent which he knows to be fa ls e and by which he intends

                                         to d e c e iv e , I apprehend that, according to th e authorities                      th at my

                                         Lord has c it e d , his knowledge and intention m ust be imputed to the

                                         com pany.    In my opinion the submission m ade to the justices th at

                                         th e respondents could not in law be capable o f a crim inal in ten tion

                                         cannot be sustained."

H a lle tt 3. also said:

                                         "With regard to th e liability o f a body c o r p o r a te for torts or c r im e s ,

                                         a perusal o f th e c a s e s shows to my mind th a t th e r e has been a

                  om issions to a fic titio u s person, and it required a long series o f

                 decisions to cle a r up the position.         Similarly th e liability o f a

                 body corporate for crim es was at one t im e a m atter o f doubt,

                 partly owing to th e th eoretical d iffic u lty o f imputing a crim inal

                 f e l t to th e sa m e extent."

H a lle tt   H. then referred to      Blackburn in Pharm eutical S o c iety and also r e fe r r ed to R

v Tyler      and quoted from th e judgement in that c a s e o f Bowen J.

                 ""I take it, th e r e fo r e , to be clear that in th e ordinary c a se o f a

                 duty imposed by a s ta t u t e , if a breach o f th e s ta t u t e is a

                 d isobedience to th e law, punishable in th e c a s e o f a private person by

                 in d ictm en t, th e offending corporation cannot e s c a p e from the

                 c o n seq u en ces which would follow in the c a s e o f an individual by showing

                 th at they are a corporation" Kay L.J. said "therefore that part o f the

                 argum ent that in as much as a crim inal a c t involved a mens rea, a

                 corporation which has no mens rea a t all is not subject to crim in al

                 proceedings in any c a s e , is untenable".         Applying the observations o f

                 Bowen L.J. to th e present case, if eve ry person desired to obtain

                 petrol coupons has a duty imposed by sta tu to r y authority to furnish

                 honest inform ation, it seem s strange and undesirable that a body

                 c orporate desired to obtain pertol coupons and furnishing dishonest

                 inform ation for th a t purpose should be able to e sc a p e the liab ility

                 which would be incurred in the like c a s e by a private person".
              He went on in R v Cory Bros. Finlay J. referred to ce rta in

              types o f cr im e in r e sp ec t o f which according to old authorities by

              which he consid ered h im self to be bound a body corporate could

              not be held to be liable.       It may b e th a t those authorities will

              require recon sideration in the light o f d e v elop m en ts to which

              I have already referred.."



This c a s e was followed by R v I.I.C Haulage Company L im ited in 1944.                Reading from

th e head note "an indictm ent for a comm on law conspiracy to defraud will lie against

a lim ite d company".

The judgement was given by Stable J. after argum ent containing all th e c a s e s I have

              "it was co n c e d e d by Counsel for the com pany that a lim ited com pany

              can be indicted for so m e criminal o f f e n c e s , and it was c o n c e d e d by

              Counsel for the Crown that there w ere som e criminal o f f e n c e s for

              which a lim ited com pany cannot be indicted. The controversy c e n tr e d

              round the question w here and on what principle the line m ust be

              drawn and on which side o f the line an in d ictm en t such as the

              present one falls.     Counsel o f the com pany conten ded that the

              true principle was that an indictm ent against a lim ited com pany

              for any o f f e n c e involving as an e sse n tia l ingredient "mens rea" in

              th e restr ic te d s e n se o f a dishonest or crim inal mind, must be bad

              for the reason th at a company, not being a natural person, cannot

              have a mind h on est or otherw ise, and th at, consequently, though

              in certain c ir c u m s ta n c e s it is civilly liable for th e fraud o i its

              o f fic e r s , age n ts or servants, it is imune from crim inal p rocess.

              Counsel for the Crown contended that a lim ite d company, like any

              other e n tity recogn ised by the law, can as a general rule be

              indicted for its crim inal a c ts , which from th e very n e c e ss ity o f the

              c a s e must be p erform ed by human a g e n c y and which in given
                c ir c u m stan ces b e c o m e the a c ts o f the com pany, and that

                for this purpose th e r e was no distinction b e tw e e n intention or other

                function o f th e mind and any other form o f a c tiv ity .

                The o f fe n c e s for which a lim ited com pany cannot be indicted are,

                it was argued, e x c ep tio n s to the general rule arising from the

                lim itation which must inevitably a tta c h an a r tific ia l e n tity , such

                as a company.        Included in th ese e x c e p tio n s are the c ases in which,

                from its very nature, th e o f fe n c e cannot be c o m m itte d by a

                corporation, as, for exa m p le , purjery, an o f f e n c e which cannot

                be vicariously c o m m itt e d , or bigamy, an o f f e n c e which a lim ite d

                compnay, not being a natural person, cannot co m m it vicariously or

                otherw ise.   A further exc ep tio n , but for a d iff e r e n c e reason, com p rises

                o f f e n c e s which murder is an exam p le, w here the only punishment

                a court can im pose is corporal, the basis upon which this e x c e p tio n

                rests being th at th e court will not s ta lt if y i t s e l f by embarking on

                a trial in which, if a verdict o f Guilty is returned, no e f f e c t i v e

                order by way o f s e n t e n c e can be m ade.   In our judgement t h e s e

                conten tions o f the Crown are substantially sound, and the e x i s t e n c e

                o f th e se e x c e p tio n s , and it may be that th e r e are others, is by no

                m eans inconsisten t with the general rule."



The earlier c a s e s were then re vie w e d .   Of Cory Bros. Stable J. said:

                "The learned Judge advanced no reasons o f his own for quashing the

                w h ole in d ictm en t, simply expressing the view he fe lt c o m p elled by

                th e authorities to which his atte n tio n had been c alled to d e c id e as

                he did.    It is s u f fic ie n t in our judgement to say th at, in as m uch as

                th at c a se was decid ed before the decision in DPP v Kent and Sussex

                Contractors L im ited and that Tutor v F reeth and Pocock L im ited
                   was not c ite d a t all, if the m atter b e c a m e before the Court

                   today, the result might well be differen t."



He concluded by saying

                   "Where in any particular c a se th e re is e v id e n c e to go to a jury

                   th e criminal a c t o f an agen t, including his s ta t e o f mind,

                   intention, know ledge or b e lie f is th e a c t o f the company, and, in

                   c a s e s where the residing judge so rules, w hether the jury are

                   sa tis fie d that it has been proved, m ust depend on the nature o f the

                   charge, the r e la tiv e position o f th e o f f i c e r or agen t, and th e other

                   relevant fa c ts and circu m stan ces o f th e case".

This last passage has been c r itic is e d as being t o o w idely sta te d particularly by Lord

Reid in Tesco Supermarkets v N attras o f which m ore anon.



The last o f th e 1944 c a s e s was Moore v Bresler Lim ited which in r e a lity m erely

follow ed the previous tw o.



While th e se d evelop m ents w e r e taking place in th e crim inal law in a line o f c a ses

from 1915 onwards the courts w e r e starting to id e n tify th e true basis for establish ing

th e   mind   of     a   corporation.         The   three    main   cases    are   Lenards c a s e ,    Bolton

Engineering v Graham, and T e s c o Supermarkets v N attras.



T esco v N attras deserves particular scrutiny b e c a u s e in that c a se the lim it s o f the

doctrine w ere discussed.          The doctrine is the fundam ental basis o f c o r p o r a te crim inal

liability o f the law o f England and must now be a c c e p t e d as such.



Lord Reid said:

                   "Where a lim ite d com pany is the em p loyer d ifficu lt questions do arise

                   in a wide varie ty o f circum stances in deciding which o f its o f f i c e r s or

                   servan ts is to be id e n tifie d with th e com pany so that his guilt is the
guilt o f the company.

I must start by considering the nature o f th e personality which by

a f fic tio n th e law a ttrib u tes to a corporation.     A living person has a

mind which can have his knowledge or intention or be n e g lig e n t then

he has hands to carry out his intention.           A corporation has none of

these: it must a c t through living persons, though not always one or

the sam e person.      Then the person who a c ts is not speaking or

a c tin g for the com p any.    He is ac tin g as th e company as his mind

which directs his a c ts is the mind o f th e com pany.           There is no

question o f the com pany being vicariously liable.            He is not

a ctin g as a servan t, representative, a g e n t or d e le g a te .   He is an

em b odim ent o f th e company or, one would could say, he hears

and speaks through the personna o f th e com pany, within his

appropriate sphere, and his mind is th e mind o f the company.                If

it is a guilty mind then the guilt is th e guilt o f th e company.

It must be a question o f law whether, o n c e th e fa c ts have been

a s certain ed , a person in doing particular things is to be regarded

as th e company or m erely as a company servan t or agen t.                In that

c a s e any liability o f the company can only be a statutory or

vicarious liability.

In Lenards c a s e th e question was w hether d am age had occurred without

th e "actual fault or privity" o f the owner o f a ship.           The owners

w ere a com pany. The fault was that o f th e registered managing

owner who m anaged the ship on behalf o f th e owners and it w as held

that th e com pany could not d issociate i t s e l f from him so as t o say that

th e re was no a c tu a l fault or privity on the part o f the com pany.

Viscount Haldene said " for if Mr Lenard was the directing mind o f

the company, then his action must, unless is not to be liable a t all

have been an a c tio n which was the a c tio n o f the company it
                    s e lf within the m eaning o f Section 502 .... It m ust be upon the

                    tru e construction o f that section in such a c a s e as the present

                    one that the fault or privity is the fault or privity o f som eone who

                    is not m erely a servan t or agent for whom th e company is liable

                    upon the footing respondiate superior, but som ebody from whom

                    th e company is liable because his a c tio n is th e very action o f the

                    company itself."



R e f e r e n c e is frequently made to the judgement o f Denning in Bolton Engineering v

Graham w here he said:

                    "A company may in many ways be likened t o a human body.

                    It has a brain and nerve c e n tr e which con tro ls what it does,                   it

                    also has hands which hold the tools and a c t in accord ance

                    with direction from th e c e n tre.          Som e o f th e pupil in the com pany

                    are m ere servan ts and agents who are nothing m ore than hands to

                    do the work and cannot be said to represent th e mind or will.

                    Others are directors and managers who rep r ese n t th e directing mind

                    and one o f th e com pany and control w hat it d oes.                    The s t a t e o f mind

                    o f th e se m anagers is that s ta t e o f mind o f th e company and is

                    tr e a te d by th e law as such"



In th a t    case    th e directors      of   the   company only        m et   o n c e a year: th e y l e f t the

m an a g e m e n t o f the business to others, and it was th e intention o f those m anagers

which       was   imputed     to     th e com pany.        I think t h a t   was         right.    There h ave been

a t t e m p t s to apply Lord Dennings words to all servan ts o f a company w hose work is

brain work, or who e x e r c is e so m e managerial discretion under the direction o f superior

o f f i c e r s o f t h e company.    I do not think that Lord Denning intended to refer to th em .




                                                       ■                           . ‘.S'.
He only referred to those who

"                represent the directin g mind and one o f th e com pany, and control

                 what it does",

I think that is right for this reason.           Normally th e board o f directors, th e managing

director and other superior o f f ic e r s o f the com pany carrying out th e functions o f

m an agem en t and speak and a c t as the company.                  Their subordinates do not.       They

carry out orders from above and it can make no d iff e r e n c e that they are given som e

m easure o f discretion.        That the board o f directors may d e le g a t e som e part o f their

functions o f m anagem ent giving to their d e le g a te full discretion to a c t independently

o f instructions from th em .        I s e e no difficu ltly in holding that they have thereby put

such a d e le g a t e in their p lace so that within the s c o p e o f the d elegation he can a c t as

th e com pany.     It may not alw ays be easy to draw th e line but there are so m e c a s e s in

which the line must be drawn.           Leneards c a se was one o f them"



Lord Reid then continued

                 "in th e next tw o c a s e s a company was a c c u s e d and it was held liable

                 for the fault o f a superior o ffic e r .    In DPP v Kent and Sussex

                 Contractors L im ited he was the transport m anager.                In R. v ICR

                 H aulage L im ited it was held that a com pany can be guilty o f c om m on

                 law conspiracy.       The a c t o f the managing director was held to be

                 the a c t o f th e com pany.     I think that a passage in the judgement

                 is too widely stated."

And here he referred to th e passage o f Stable J. to which I have previously referred.

Lord Reid continued        *

                 "I think that th e true view is that th e judge must direct the jury

                 th a t if they find certain fa cts proved then as a m atter o f law th e y

                 must find th at th e crim inal a c t o f the o f f i c e r , servant or a g e n t

                 including his s t a t e o f mind, intention know ledge or b e lie f is the

                 a c t o f the company."
I have already dealt with th e considerations to be applied in deciding when such a

person      can and when he cannot be identified with the com pany.                        I do not s e e how the

nature      o f the charge          can   m ake any d iffe r e n c e .        If th e guilty man was in law

identifiable with the com pany then whether his o f f e n c e was serious or                        venial his a c t

was      th e a c t o f the com pany but if he was not so id en tifia b le then                    no a c t o f his,

serious or oth e rw ise , was th e a c t o f the company its e lf .

Lord Diplock in th e sa m e c a s e then said:

                 "A corporation is an abstraction.                  It is incapable it s e lf o f doing

                 any physical a c t or being in any s t a t e o f mind.              Y et in law it is

                 a person capable o f exercising legal rights and o f being subject to

                 legal liabilities which involve ascribing to it not only physical

                 a c ts which are in reality done by natural person on its behalf but

                 also the m ental s t a t e in which that person did th em .                In civ il law,

                 apart from c e rta in statutory duties, this represents no

                 c o n c e p tia l d iffic u ltie s .    Under the law o f a g e n c y the physical a c ts

                 and mind and s t a t e o f mind o f the age n t are in law ascribed to the

                 principal, and if th e agent is a natural person it m atters not w hether

                 the principal is also a natural person or a m e r e legal a b straction .

                 Qui F a c it Per Alium Facit Per Se: Qui C o g ita t Per Alium C o g ita t

                 Per Se"

But th ere are s o m e similar liabilities imposed by s ta t u t e which, e x c e p tio n a lly , ex clud e

th e c o n c e p t o f vicarious liability o f a principal for the physical a c ts and s t a t e o f mind

o f its agent: and the              c o n c e p t has no general application in the field o f th e criminal

law .       To   c o n s tit u te     a crim inal o f fe n c e a physical a c t done by any person must

generally be done him in so m e reprehensible s t a t e o f mind.                      Save in c a s e s o f str ic t

liability   where a crim inal             s t a t u t e excep tionally m akes a doing o f an a c t a crim e

ir r e sp e c tiv e o f th e s t a t e o f mind o f which it is done, crim inal law regards a person as

respeonsible for his c r im e s only.                   It does not r e cogn ise a liability o f a principal for

th e criminal a c ts o f his ag e n t: because it does a scrib e to him his a g e n t's s t a t e o f

mind.
Qui P e c c a t Per Alium P e c c a t Per Se is not a m aximum o f crim inal law."



Lord Diplock continued:

                "In my view ,    th e r e fo r e the question: what natural persons are to be

tre a te d in law as being the com pany for the purpose o f a c ts done in th e cou rse o f its

business, including the taking o f precautions and the e x e r c is e or due d ilig e n c e to avoid

th e com m ission o f a crim inal o f f e n c e , is to be found by identifying th o se natural

persons who by th e memorandum and a r ticles o f association or as a result o f action

taken by the directors or by the company in general m ee tin g pursuant to th e ar tic le s

are entrusted with the e x e r c is e o f the power o f th e company."



Since the middle o f th e 19th century there has beena huge increase in th e numbers

and a c tiv itie s o f those corporations whose a c t i v i t i e s en ter the private live s o f men

and subjects.    There is a cle a r c a s e to be made in favour o f imparting s o c ia l duties

upon corporations for e xam p le a duty not to break th e crim inal law.



Over the last 150 years the courts have developed a m ethod o f imputing a mind to

corporations who sa tisfy the requirements o f th e crim inal law.            Parliam ent has also

done this is e v id en ced by Section 18 o f the T heft A c t 1968 which provides:

                "Where an o f f e n c e c o m m itte d by a body corporate under S e c tio n 15,

                16 or 17 o f the this A c t is proved to have been c o m m itte d w ith the

                c on sen t or c onnivance o f any director, m anager, se c r e ta r y or other

                similar o f fic e r o f the body corporate, or any person who was purported

                to a c t in any such c a p a c ity , he as w e ll as the body corporate shall be

                guilty of that o f f e n c e , and shall be liable to be proceed ed again st

                and punished accordingly."
O nce a s ta te o f mind is e f f e c t i v e l y attributable to a corporation all th a t is l e f t is to

d eterm in e th at s t a t e o f mind.    Therefore once that is done the o b s ta cle to the general

liability o f corporations is o v e r co m e , C essante R atione Legis C essante Ipsa Lex.



I find unpersuasive th e argum ent o f the 8th D efe n d a n t that the old d efin itio n of

manslaughter positively exclud ed corporations.              Any cr im e in order to be justiciable

must be c o m m itt e d through a human agency th e r e fo r e th e term "human being" in the

d efinition o f manslaughter is e ith er tortologous or intended to d iff e r e n tia te c a s e s of

manslaughter from c a s e s o f death from inanimate ob je cts or an im ate o b je cts such as
                   .]>€0<*cuu)s
animal as in .doordanee .           I am confident that        th e   use o f "human being" in the

d efinition was not intended to lim it corporate liability.

It is not for m e to se t the lim its o f corporate liability in English law.            Other exam p les

will no doubt be decided on a c a s e by c a se basis under the com m on law.                   But where

a corporation through a controlling o ffic e r with a g u ilty mind does an a c t am ounting

to m anslaughter it as w ell as th e controlling o f fic e r can be indicted.



On arriving a t this decision I have borne fully in mind the warning shot fired by the

8th D efendant contained in the c a s e o f R v Withers (1975) .               H ow ever I do not think

that I c r ea te d a new o f f e n c e or widen an existin g o f f e n c e so as to m ake punishable

c onduct o f a typ e hitherto not subject to punishment in the se n se exp lain ed by Lord

Simon in that c a s e .       The prosecution have c o r r e c tly reminded me o f th e secon d o f

Lord Simon's principles, n am ely that the court cannot refuse to apply a leg a l duty

deducible from a authorative decision to c ircu m stan ces analogous to th o s e inherent in

such a decision.          My d ecision in the present c a s e is in a c c ord an ce with th e second

principle.



No   disrespect     is   intended    to    Counad in not     referring    to   the d e c s io n s o f   other

jurisdictions in this area o f th e law.          In som e o f th e jurisdictions the opportunity has

been taken to c o d ify their crim inal law as for e xam p le in N ew Zealand w h er e the
crim inal law was e n acted in 1893 using Stephens D raft Code.                   The Crimes A c t in .1961

c lo s e ly follow ed the 1893 A c t and the definition o f m anslaughter remains th e sa m e in

both A cts.



The      case of      R . v Murray        Wright    Limited was    g r e a tly   relied upon by    th e   8th

D efendant.         The report o f th e c a s e helpfully includes c e rta in s ta t e reports from the

U.S.A. which dem onstrate the diversity o f approach.                It is interesting to t r a c e Murray

Wright from th e first in stan ce where before Henry J. th e argum ent was id e n tic a l to

th a t before m e, i.e. that th e definition of m anslaughter excluded the possib ility of

corporate liability.          H owever Henry J. in that c a s e took a d ifferen t approach.              He

s ta t e d that:

                   "The killing referred to .... is e x f a c ie a killing by a human a g e n c y .

                   There is nothing in that f a c t which would n e cessarily e x clu d e a

                   corporation b e c a u se in all c a ses o f corp o r a te crim inal repsonsibilty

                   th e responsibility is for th e a c t o f so m e human being or beings.

                   Corporate a c t i v i t i e s may involve the com m issio n o f an unlawful

                   a c t or the om ission to perform or observe a leg a l duty. Such

                   a c tiv itie s or rem issions are a c ts or rem issions o f a human being or

                   beings, but if such a c ts or omissions can also properly be held to be

                   th e a c ts or om issions o f the corporate body which is the alte r e g o o f

                   a person or persons who do those a c ts or are guilty o f those

                   omissions, then th e r e is no reason why the corporate body should not

                   be held responsible."

For m y se lf with substitution o f "embodiment" for "alter ego" and "also" a f te r th e word

"should" I would readily e m b ra c e the reasoning o f th a t passage.



In th e Court o f Appeal this reasoning was not approved.
North P. giving judgement said:

                  "the question w e are c alled upon to d eter m in e is a narrow one and

                  depends e s se n tia lly on what c o n s titu te s         hom icide as laid down

                  in sections ss 158 and 160 o f the Crim es A c t 1961.

                  In this Court Mr Davison senior Counsel for th e applicant com pany,

                  m ade it p e r fe c tly pain that his argum ent did not pend on th e broad

                  question o f the c ir c u m s ta n c e s in which a com pany may be c o n v ic te d

                  o f a crim e.    He said th at he did not rely on th e opinion expressed

                  by Finlay. J. in R. v Cory Bros, and in England an indictm ent will

                  not lie against a corporation for m anslaughter.            Counsel co n c e d e d

                  th a t whatever th e law may have been a t th at point o f tim e,

                  subsequent decisions plainly showed th at th e r e is nothing in the

                  ingredients o f th e c r im e o f manslaughter standing in the way o f a

                  company, in a su ita b le c a s e being indicted for this crim e. He

                  drew our a t te n t io n to a number o f c a s e s and particularly to R. v

                  ICR Haulage L im ited where the court r e v ie w e d th e way the law

                  had developed in th e more recent years, e v e n in c a s e s where mens

                  rea was an e s s e n t ia l ingredient of the c r im e . In discussion R v Cory

                  Bros and Co L im ited Stable J. who delivered th e judgement o f the

                  Court said .... "

And to avoid repetition the c it a t io n then says :

                  "But, D e f e n c e C ounsel submitted, that the words in our s e c t io n 158 "the

killing o f a human being by another" clearly m eant that "Homicide" was th e killing o f

one human being           by another        human being which,         in his submission m ade all the

d iff e r e n c e . So far as I am a w a r e this question has never b e fore been con sid er e d in

N ew     Zealand but      Mr      Davison   was able to point to a judgement o f t h e Court            of

Appeals       o f N ew York,      P e o p le v R ochester Railway and Light Company w h ere the

p r e c ise   point argued by him had been considered by th at Court and d eterm in ed in a

way favourable to his subm ission, th e judgement o f the Court o f Appeals o f N e w York
was delivered by Hiscock J. who had this t o say:

               "within the principles thus and e ls e w h e r e d eclared, w e have no

               doubt that a definition o f certain form s o f manslaughter might

               have been form ulated which would be applicab le to a corporation,

               and make it crim inally liable for various a c t s o f m isfeasan ce and

               non fea s a n c e resulting in hom icide, and am on gst which very

               probably might be included conduct in its su b stan ce similar to th a t

               here charged against th e Respondent. But, this^being so the question

               still confronts us whether the corporations have been so made liable

               for the c rim e o f manslaughter as now e xp ressly defined, in the

               s e c tio n alone relied upon by the p eople, and this question w e think

               must be d e c isiv e ly answered in th e n e g a tiv e .   Section 179 o f th e

               Penal Code defin es hom icide as "the killing o f one human being by

               the a c t , procurem ent or omission o f another"

We think th at    this   final word      "another" naturally and c le a r ly means a secon d or

additional m em ber o f the sa m e kind or class alone referred to by the p r e ced in g words,

n am ely another human being, and that we should not in terp ret it as appellan t asks us

to, as m eaning another "person", which might then include corporations.                  It s e e m s to

us th a t it would be a viole n t strain upon a crim inal s t a t u t e to construe this word

m eaning an a g e n c y o f so m e kind other than that already m entioned or r e ferred to, and

as bridging over a radical transition from human beings to corporations.                T h er e fo re we

c on stru e this definition o f hom icide as being the killing o f one human being by another

human being."



We w e r e also referred to another American c a s e by Mr Davison, S tate v Lehigh Valley

R ailway Company, a judgement o f the Supreme Court o f N ew Jersey.                      In t h a t c a s e

S w a y z e J. found h im self able to distinguish the earlier c a s e on the ground th a t he was

not bound by sta tu tory defin ition .    The following e x t r a c t from the-L earned Judge's
opinion is I think, worth citin g.         He said:

                    "we have exam ined the authorities in other jurisdictions which

                    w ere referred.     The decision o f P eople v R och ester Railway

                    and Light Company was based e n tir e ly upon the construction o f the

                    e x a c t language o f the penal code, which defined hom icide as "the

                    killing o f one human being by the a c t , procurem ent or om ission

                    o f another", and the Court n ecessarily, w e think held th at "another"

                    m eant "another human being".        But, Judge H iscock, now the em in a n t

                    C h ief Judge, who spoke for the Court was a t so m e pains to show th ere

                    was nothing e s se n tia lly incongress in holding a corporation a g g r e g a te

                    crim inally liable for manslaughter. The c a s e is a good illustration

                    o f th e way in which th e proper growth and develop m ent o f th e law

                    can be prevented by the hard and f a st language o f a s ta t u t e , and o f

                    th e advantage o f our own system by which the way is open for a

                    Court to do justice by the proper application o f legal principles."



In th e court below , Henry J. who had before him th e judgement o f t h e Court of

Appeals          from   N ew   York in the    Rochester & R ailw ay Light Company c a s e , found

h im se lf able to distinguish that c a s e on the ground th a t Section 158 did not d e fin e an

o f f e n c e . This, as he quite c o r r e c tly said, was d efin ed in Section 1,60.   This being so he

saw no reason why the appellant company could not be indicted for th e c r im e of

m anslaughter.          In reaching this conclusion he relied to o on several e arlier sectio n s

such as 153, 155, 156 and 157, which c reated duties imposed on "everyon e, who is

placed in the various f a c t situations defined in th e s e ctio n s.             I have g iv e n careful

consid eration to Henry J.s thoughtful judgement, but, in the end I find m y s e l f unable

to a c c e p t    his   reasoning or his conclusions.        The passage      I have c i t e d   from the

R och ester Railway c a s e c le a r ly shows that the situ ation in the N ew York s t a t u t e s was
expressed in very similar term s to our own S e ction 160.             In my opinion,    th e reasoning

of    the Court o f      Appeals   in the   R ochester    Railw ay   case   was right    and I s e e no

justification a t all for a d iffe r e n t view being e n te r ta in e d in N ew Zealand.      As I have

earlier     m entioned    the plan   fact   is that those responsible for the drafting o f the

Crim es A c t 1961 failed to ap p r e c ia te that in defining "homicide" as a killing o f human

being by another o f n e c e s s ity      they excluded a com p any which cannot possibly be

described as another human being.             I am accord ingly o f the opinion that Mr Davison's

submission m ust be a c c e p te d and the present in d ictm en t m ust be quashed."



In th e sam e c a s e the judgem ent o f Turner J. said:

                  "Mr Davison fo rc e fu lly argued that m anslaughter must n e c e ssa r ily be

                  culpable hom icide; and that hom icide is d efined in Section 158 o f the

                  Crim es A c t as "the killing o f one human being by another".            If, then

                  he said, th e killing was by a person not a human being (eg by a com pany)

                  it could not be hom icide, and a forturi, not c u lab le hom icide.        Ergo,

                  sin ce a com pany cannot be guilty o f m anslaughter, the in d ictm en t

                  should be quashed as not stating in s u b sta n c e a crim e.      Mr Davison

                  c it e d in support the c a s e o f People v R o c h e ster Railway.

Mr Savage for the Crown subm itted that this argu m en t though a t t r a c t i v e was not

w ithout flaw .      He supported the judgement appealed from and invited th e court to

n o t ic e that notw ithstanding th e provisions o f S e c tio n 158, it was still possible for a

com pany to be c o n v ic te d o f manslaughter - e .g . as a part to the cr im e by virtue of

th e provisions o f Section 66.        He concededth at this would not be possible i n th e c a s e

presen ted by th e Crown on the present indictm en t, in which it was th e a c t , or rather

t h e om ission, o f th e com pany its e lf as a principal th a t provided the su b sta n c e o f the

c h arge.      But said Mr Savage while manslaughter must involve th e killing o f one

human being by another, y e t if a company o m its to perform a legal duty o f car e

resting upon it, and this submission causes one human being to kill another, it is not
th e result o f manslaughter for which the com pany must be crim inally lia b le as the

principal?     It it s e lf has o m itte d to do what the law has enjoined upon it to do.



For m y se lf I was for a tim e a t tr a c te d by this argum en t, but r e fle c tio n has convinced

m e th at it cannot su c c ee d , for the reasons which are now s e t out.                    Manslaughter is

culpable hom icide.          H om icide is the killing o f one human being by another.               No action

or om ission o f a company which causes death can i t s e lf amount to m anslaughter,

b e c a u se th e a c t or om ission which kills must e x hypothisi be the a c t or om ission o f a

human being.          On the otherhand, if the a c t or om ission o f the company is relied on,

not as directly causing death, but as causing so m e human being to c a u se death, the

chain o f c ausation is broken in law: what has in law cau sed death in such a c a s e is not

th e a c t or om ission o f th e           com pany, but the          a c t or om ission o f a human being

c on cern ed , for which the com p any cannot be held vicariously crim inally responsible,

e x c e p t under th e provisions o f S e ction 66. And S e c tio n 66 is not available on th e fa c ts

o f this c a s e ev e n if - as I do a t te m p t to decid e - Mr Savage is right in conten din g

th at it may be available to support the charge o f m anslaughter against a com p any in

other circum stances." - such as for an aider or a b e tte r e t c .



It is o f n ote       that courts     in th e s e    jurisdictions     when m anslaughter is a sta tu to r y

o f f e n c e f e l t unable to depart from the s ta t u t e , w h ereas the com m on law has been

able to   do     so    -    parce   Lord    Simon.          I won't    refer   to other c a s e s   from    other

jurisdictions.



B e fo r e concluding and b e c a u s e th e topicality o f th e c a s e I must refer to th e c a s e o f R

v H.M.Coroner         for    East   K ent    ex     parte    Scrouner    and    others a d ecision         of   the

D ivisional Court in relation t o th e s e lf sam e e v e n ts b e fo r e m e.             One short passage

from th e judgement o f Bingham J. explains why lit t l e w eight has been p la c e d on this

case :
                "the argum ents which w ere deployed and e lab orated before th e

                Coroner have in substance been r e p eated with great coge n c y and skill

               before us.    The first question is whether a corporation can be

               indicted for m anslaughter.        The Coroner originally ruled th at it could

               not in the course o f argument in this cou rt be indicated at an early

               s ta g e that we w e r e prepared to assum e for the purposes o f this

               hearing that it could.       As a result th e question has not been fully

               argued and I have not found it n ecessary to reach a final conclusion.

               I am , h ow ever, t e n t a t iv e ly of opinion th a t on appropriate f a c t s the

               mens rea required for manslaughter can be estab lish ed against

               a corporation.     I s e e no reason in principle why such a charge should

               not be e stab lish ed . I am therefore t e n tiv e ly o f opinion that the

               Coroner's original ruling was wrong, and indeed I would need

               considerable persuasion to reach a conclu sion th a t it was correct."



In concluding if I am in c o rr e c t in law I would adopt th e reasoning o f Henry 3. in

Murray    Wright i.e.   that if it be a c c ep te d that m anslaughter is the killing o f one

human being by another human being and the person who is the e m b od im en t of the

com p any has done the a c t or om ission that caused death then the com pany as w ell as

th at person can be c o n v ic te d o f manslaughter.

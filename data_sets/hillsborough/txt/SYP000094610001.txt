             I am the owner of                    and trade from the above address.

             On the afternoon of Saturday IS April                   1^89 (150489),    I employed a

             freelance       pho tographer,                         o take photographs at the FA Cu

             Semi-Final         football match between Li 'Mr pool and Nottingham Forest at
                                                                       f
             the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield.                   ^iy contract was to provide

             photographs of the match to the Sunday People newspaper.

             I was not present at Hillsborough as                   I was covering the other semi­

             final match between Everton and Norwich at Villa Parks, Birmingham.

             On the evening of Saturday 15 April                  1989 (150489),   I   took possession

             of three sets of negatives from,                              which were taken at

             Hillsborough that day.                  ^       f

             About a fortnight after the Hillsborough disaster,                    I can't   remember

             the exact date,         I personally delivered the three sets of negatives,
                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                  S3SS7

         taken by                  to the Merseyside Police Headquarters,    Canning

         Place, Liverpool City Centre.         I handed the negatives over to the

         person on duty at the reception in order that they be collected by the

         West Midlands Police for use in the        Inquiry into the Hillsborough

         di sa st er „

         I now understand that the three^j^ts of negatives are        reference

         The negatives were   left at Merseyside Police Headquarters      in a sealed

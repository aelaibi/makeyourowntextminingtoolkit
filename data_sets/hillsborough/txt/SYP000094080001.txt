                   ca^teeen to take our meal.

               At 3.08 pm (1508) during our meal break we were informed that

'OPERATION S O K g p R T * had been called at Hillsborough Football Stadium

and together with the aforementioned officers we made our way to

Hillsborough in a marked Police transit vehicle.

On route to Hillsborough we were informed via personal            radio to report

to the Police    room upon our arrival at the ground.

At 3.14 pm (1314)     the same day we arrived at the g                       ided

                      but we were given no idea as to

 OPCTh&IION SUPPORT    had been called but were instr                        o the

piaying area.

Upon arrival    on the playing area I saw persons apparently injured at

the corner of the Hop and North Stand end of the ground.

I saw that there was 1 ambulance        in attendance at this time.

We went across the pitch and saw a line of officers near to the half

way line and beyond these offi                     d see numerous supporters on

the pitch.

We went to the line of officer             „       uperintendem, CHAPMAN who was

on the Kop side of the officers.        We were     instructed by him to join

the line of officers and were informed that there was a possibility of

persons having been killed.

We were not told how or where but it became obvious that there was

frantic activity behind the Leppings Lane goal and I saw persons

climbing the perimeter fence and climbing from Leppings Lane terrace

into the West Stand.

There were numerous officers at this           location who were assisting

supporters over tHe perimeter fence.

We were approached by m m e r o u s   supporters who were on the pitch and we

ascertained from what had ms^Dpened.

We then left the line of offi cerV^and went towards the Leppings Lane

goal and assisted supporters who were           injured.

Several were attended to and removed to the side of the North Stand

and towards the Kop where St J o h n ’s ambulance staff were in attendance.

Once most of the injured had been removed we re-joined the line of

officers across the pitch and during this time several         injured persons

were taken through the line of stretchers and pieces of advertising

hoardi n g .

The injured were being carried by supporters and Police officers.

We remained at this location until an announcement was made to the

supporters that the match had been abandoned.

During my time on the playing area I was approached by several

supporters of Liverpool who were very abusive towards m e , although it

is fair to say that they were very distressed at this time.

Several of these supporters had obviously been drinking heavily and I

saw numerous supporters standing on the olavina area and urinating.

Immediately after the announcement f                      egarding the match

being abandoned we returned to our \                      t to the Midland

Rail wav Rt.^st.inn t.n 5iinprui«ie ! ivernc   ,,         onto the trains.

At 6.30 pm 01830) we were released from the Midlands Station to attend

aFyWest
    est Bar Police station for a de-briefing by Chief Inspector

DONNELLY and Superintlta&nts BAT!

Following this     I did not have any other duties relating to

at Hillsborough.      I retired from duty at 3.00 am (1500)     the

morning.

The serial     I was on for this day was Serial     19.

Mr S Jones




Dear Mr Jones

I understand from my Listing Officer that you have telephoned to say that on
reflection you do not wish to give evidence.

Bearing in mind the availability of witnesses I had taken the decision that I
would respect the wishes of the bereaved who were at Hillsborough as to whether
or not they wished to avail themselves of the opportunity of giving their
account of the events.

In the circumstances I do not insist that you should come, although in the
light of earlier communications I had thought that you might have wanted to put
your account to the Jury.

If on further reflection you change your mind with regard to giving evidence,
please get in touch with my Listing Officer and we will try to fit you in
before the Inquests have concluded.

Yours sincerely




S L Popper
HM Coroner

FILE NOTE DATED 12.4.90



RE HILLSBOROUGH INQUES



Telephone conversation with D.C. Fairfield, noutr-fil. I discussed

with him [and Superintendent Beechey] the statement from the nurses

and doctors, which they had sent up to me; these are the ones which

had been linked up to any specific bodies.     Having viewed them I

^^ l t that at least in some of the cases it was worth looking into

them a little bit further because:



    if some there was sufficient information which might enable them

to identify somebody if they were presented with visual evidence and

others it might be worth asking them to think a little bit harder

before one decided that they could not help.



I realize that it would be impossible to get this done before we

started, but even if we did get additional information whilst we

4^^re proceeding we could see whether it was worth incorporating it

 into the evidence and if so we could find a slot for it, no doubt.

FILE NOTE TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR. CLOUGHLIN RE

SUPT. DUCKENFIELD.

He was referring to our exchange of letters regarding the

summaries.   He said that he wasn't trying to be difficult.

He was making two points.

1.   That as his client hadn't verified the evidence,    it

     was difficult for him to be able to say categorically

     that it was correct though he didn't have any reason

     to assume that it was wrong.    What he was concerned

     about was that it should'nt be alleged because they

     have agreed the statement therefore they are tied by

     what was written down.    I said I didn't really think

     that that was a particular fear as if a minor

     inaccuracy say was established, one could deal with

     that. What I didn't however want was that if something

     was an agreed statement, had been an agreed and as

     soon as one was challenged on it, one should resign

     and say well no I don't really agree with that.

2.   His second point was that whatever the facts might be

     it didn't necessarily follow that everybody knew

     about them at the time.   I said that this wasn't

     the purpose of the statement.   Whether somebody knew

     about it or ought to have know about it was issues

     which no doubt would be explored

     I also said that no doubt there would be plenty of

     matters which the lawyers would be able to proceed.

         SUBJECT:    HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST




         Prior to the Christmas adjournment of the Hillsborough Inquest on 19
         December 1990, representations were made by the Hillsborough Support
         Group, consisting of the bereaved families to H.M. Coroner, Mr Popper.




         Mr King, Barrister for the bereaved, had accordingly requested the
         attendance of Mr White for him to give evidence at the proceedings. I was
         subsequently contacted by Detective Sergeant Tredgold of the West Midlands
         Police L iaison Team, who requested initial contact with I        Iby this
         office.




         I contacted him by telephone and informed him of this decision, During
         the Christmas holiday I received the attached correspondence from Mr
         White, which I now produce for your perusal.

         Should you agree, I will forward the original documents to the West
         Midlands Police Liaison Team, in order that H.M. Coroner may be fully
         appraised of the current situation regarding the health of Mr White.

RE: INSPECTOR WHITE

I showed Mr Manning the paragraph on the 3rd page of Mr White's
statement of 25.2.91 r e f e r r i n g to Supt. Murray ( f i r s t seven l i n e s ) .
Mr Manning sa id t h a t his c l i e n t would emphatically deny t h a t .
He also in d ic a te d t h a t he and everyone e l s e , including Mr Is aacs ,
was aware of Mr W h i t e ' s a n d           he would not t h e r e f o r e put too
much credance on any statement anyway.              I sa id I was i n t e r e s t e d
in a s c e r t a i n i n g whether Mr Murray would agree with what was said
and he had answered t h a t p o in t.

P ri va te discussion with Miss Addleman, regarding PC |                  ~~|


I explained to her t h a t I had got th e d o c t o r ' s l e t t e r and I was
r e l u c t a n t to c a l l him in th e circumstances.    On the other hand,
I also f e l t i t would be b e n e f ic ia l i f we heard something from him
and i t occurred to me t h a t we could e i t h e r use his statement or the
PACE state ment.      She wasn 't too happy about th e PACE state ment, and
I explained my problem with t h a t was t h a t I had always taken the
view t h a t                            i t was simply t h a t i t was evidence
t h a t th e statement had been made and not of i t s t r u t h and w h ils t
I could break         my r u l e i f I wished, I did not want to do so.


With regard to the other statement (Recollection) I thought I could
introduce i t under Rule 37 because i t r e a l l y wasn 't t h a t c o n t r o v e rs ia l
but, because i t was a Recollection as opposed to a proper state ment,
I would have p r e f e r r e d f o r my own peace of mind i f she could agree
to i t s use, although in the end I could use i t i f I wished.


I asked her whether she thought t h a t PC                  could atte nd on the
understanding t h a t he would only be asked to confirm t h a t th e statement
as read was h i s .     Hefresponse was t h a t she had met him and i t was her
view t h a t he was i l l .   She also understood t h a t he would not go anywhere
near the bu il din g.


She expressed concern t h a t I might d i s c lo s e the medical cause as to
why I w as n't c a l l i n g him and I rea ss ure d her t h a t I would never do
that.    I f the worst came to the worst I would only do so in Chambers.
She sa id t h a t she appreciated what I had sa id and would l i k e to have
another look at the statement and would come back to me.

 IN STRICT CONFIDENCE

 Dr S Popper
 HM Coroner
 The Town Hall
 Sheffield


 Dear Doctor Popper

                             Res Police Constable

 I understand that the above patient may still be required to take the
 stand at the current inquest into the circumstances surrounding the
  Hillsborough Disaster' on 15th April 1989.

               ::l°oking after him in my capacity as his'General
 ilfia ml ndft had a total of thirty two consultations directly attributable
 to the above incident. The first consultation was on 11th July 1989.

I believe that you have already had sight of a medical certificate that
I issued on 6th November 1990 in which I stated that an appearance at
the inquest would be likely to be very harmful to Mr         health. I
wonder if the following details will assist you in understanding the
reasons for issuing that certificate.

Since the disaster Mr       has required continuous and intensive
treatment from myself and other health care professionals. He remains
on treatment and has only shown marginal improvement in his severe
depressive illness. He has demonstrated a significant suicidal risk
which has been confirmed by Professor Sims of the Department of
Psychiatry at the University of Leeds.

It remains my opinion that the distress induced by having to give
further testimony in a court of law poses the high risk of him suffering
a relapse with consequent exacerbation of the suicidal risk. It is for
this reason that I feel he should not be required to testify.

Yours sincerely,




Dr J G Benjamin.

P.S. If required to appear in court myself, I would be grateful if this
could be arranged for a Thursday or Friday afternoon with as much prior
w a r n ino as possible-_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

 EX INSPECTOR H. WHITE




As you are probably aware, the Coroner would like to have called Mr WHITE as
witness to the Hillsborough Inquests.

 However, as a result of correspondence received from Mr WHITE’S
              as a result of very helpful enquiries by your Sergeant John MORGAN,
 the Coroner has decided not to call him.

 Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Mr S Jones




Dear Mr Jones

I understand from my Listing Officer that you have telephoned to say that on
reflection you do not wish to give evidence.

Bearing in mind the availability of witnesses I had taken the decision that I >
would respect the wishes of the bereaved who were at Hillsborough as to whether
or not they wished to avail themselves of the opportunity of giving their
account of the events.

In the circumstances I do not insist that you should come, although in the
light of earlier communications I had thought that you might have wanted to put
your account to the Jury.

If on further reflection you change your mind with regard to giving evidence,
please get in touch with my Listing Officer and we will try to fit you in
before the Inquests have concluded.

Yours sincerely

Additions and ? amendments to "draft” statement of Michael Jon Foster
dated 8th October 1990 intended for use as agreed input of background
facts at the resumed inquests into the Hillsborough deceased to be
resumed on 19th Nov. 1990.


Page 3. second para. ? is "Prior" thecorrect word ?

Page 4. last line Is the reason for rejection agreed bythe club? If
not perhaps delete and we will elucidate during evidence.

Page 5. second para 2. I presume the only way to cross from A-G to
11-16 was to go out o the perimeter gates and start again. Is this
correct and if so should we say it.

Page 6. third para. I think this parashould be amplifiedslightly. Is
it saying that people entering through turnstyles 1-10 could only get
to the North stand but that people entering through the other
turnstyles could get through the brick wall through a gate which was
open and therfore could reach an part of the west stand and west
terrrace?

Page 6. last para. Were there any portakabins in the area served by
the turnstyles A-G. Is it possible to locate them in relation either
to the tunnel or Gate C ?

Page 7. I think it would be better if we said the 'southern "part of
the " concourse'. I wonder whether it would be a good idea in the para
describing the concourse on page 6 to name the parts as northern
central and southern ?

Page 7. para 2. I think at the end of this para it would be helpful if
a reference to the letters B and A were made which I think were also
displayed over the tunnel, with a description on which side of the
tunnel these letters appeared. It might be worth saying that in the
normal course of events if someone walked along the left hand side of
the tunnel when entering it they would end up in enclosure 4 and if
walking on the right hand side in enclosure 3.

Page 7. final para last line do you think that "introduction" would be
better word than "implementation" ?

Page 8.first para. There is reference to three sets of gates. I wonder
if it might be clearer if the gates at the rear of the terraces were
dealt with in a seperate para.

Page 8. first para. Do you think that it would be helpful if at the
end of this para (as presently drafted) one were to add a sentence
about the projecting walls into enclosure 3 and 4 and point out that
people wishing to enter enclosures 2 and 5 etc respectively would have
to enter enclosure 3 and 4 a slight distance and then go backward to
get to the gates ?

Page 8. para 2. Are we sure about the gradient on the terrraces?

Page 9. Para 3. I think that we should spell out that the error on the
plan was not discovered until well after the disaster.

Is the revised figure quoted the figure based on LJT recommendations
or the figure which would have applied had he not suggested revisions?
Can we make this clear if possible.

Page 9. Para 4. Are we sure that this interpretation is accepted? I
thought that the figures of 1200 and 1000 were never completely
explained but were taken to represent the revised capacities. If I am
right then some redrafting may be needed. In fact I think this para
needs a rethink as does the next which I cannot quite understand.

As a general point I think the section on gate 9-10 starting with
"Schedule 2" upto "pen 5 was introduced" would be better after para 1
(ending "as originally created in 1981") on page 11.

Page 10. para 3. I am not sureabout the last sentence as this
expresses an opinion on a possibly controversial point. I wonder
whether just setting out the size differences would be better ?

Page 10. para 4. Last line is the word "specific" correct ?

Page 11. para 3. Do we know the distance from the control box   to say
gate 3 and or gate 4.

Page 13. Para 1. My recollection is that the electronic clock was one
minute slow. If this is correct should we say this here. As a matter
of interest what is this time adjustment based on ?

Page 14. para 2. Am I right in thinking that in 1956 there were no
radial fences ofany sort nor any perimeter fences ?

Page 14. para 3. Am I right inthinking for this match in 1981 there
was the perimeter fence but no radial fences which were installed as
a result of this incident ?

Page 14. para 5. Was this Ferenc Morath ?

Page 15. para 3. Had the officers working party not changeditsname
by the time of the disaster ?

Finally we have tended to use theword enclosure rather thenpen at
the inquests. I wonder whether we shouldcontinue to doso ?

Dear Sir

RE CASE NUMBERS 82-94 INCLUSIVE

With reference to yotr letter dated 8 June 1989 concerning the above, enquiries
are currently being made at the two hospitals concerned to establish the
details of treatment given te the deceased.  The full facts have not yet been
established but the details known to date are as follows j

Case numbers 82-84 and 86-94
Northern General Hospital.

All of the patients were taken to the hospital by ambulance and were initially
admitted to the resuscitation room. A number of medical staff were engaged
with the patients and arrangements are in hand for all the staff to be
interviewed and details of treatment obtained.

An initial statement has been obtained from James WARDROBE„ Consultant who was
in charge of the Accident and Emergency Department. A copy of his statement is
attached for your information.

It is known that when resuscitation attempts failed the bodies were taken to a
nearby plaster room which was designated as a temporary mortuary.

The bodies were in the charge of a team of five police officers and mortuary
attendants from the hospital.

DR       certified death of each body in the plaster room, however we are
pursuing this further as we believe there may be an earlier certification by
the Doctoi actually treating the patient.

The deceased were transported by ambulance > with a police officer, to the
gymnasium at Hillsborough on the evening of 15 April 1989.

                                                                  Continued...



    PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
Case number 85
Royal Hallamshire Hospital

The patient was transported from the football ground by ambulance. A statement
                           is
                            who
                              attached
                                outlinesfrom
                                          the DR
                                               treatment given. Arrangements are
in hand for Dfi       to be seen as the doctor was with the patient in the
ambulance. DR LUMB certified death at 1740 hours at the hospital.


The enquiries outlined are being carried out as a matter of urgency and the
further details will be supplied to you as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully

         w.e.r.e..three patients, in .the .Resuscitation .Room. undergoing .QsrdiQ. pulmonary

But. I, would point.out. we .re.ceived.no. adeauate notif ic$itipp. of .the .scale. Of. .this

these patients.


             staff arriyed. I_ was. able .to .concent.ra.te .on .the.triage, and, .management. role

resuscitation.                      There is definite post mortem evidence of intensive resuscitation
attempts.

99.. _ PHILIP STEELE
             There is no evidence in the medical record nor any evidence from the post
             mortem findings that Mr. Steele received any resuscitation.                                                                           I think it
             likely that he was triaged                                 as dead.


119.         ARTHUR HORROCKS
             There is no evidence in the medical record of any resuscitation attempts
             and there is no evidence in the post mortem findings of any resuscitation
             attempts.                I therefore think it likely that Mr. Horrocks was triaged as
             dead.


In summary, there is definite evidence both from the hospital records and post
mortem reports that six patients received resuscitation attempts.                                                                               In a further
three_ patients there us some evidence that the patients may have received some
resuscitation attempts.                                  In four patients there is no evidence of resuscitation
and it is likely that these patients were triaged to the mortuary on arrival
at the Accident and Emergency Department.


I.feel, it may be helpful to give a brief summary of our experience of traumatic
asphyxia.                Traumatic asphyxia is a fairly uncommon condition, normally occurring
in sporadic cases, either in car accidents, or heavy injury.                                                                           There are a
number of well documented instances where large numbers of people have died
in crowds as a result of traumatic asphyxia.                                                         Such events are fortunately
rare..               The Northern. General Hospital Accident and. Emergency .Department.
admitted              . fifteen cases of severe traumatic asphyxia within a space.of one

               STATEMENT OF DOCTOR ASHTON

               In response to your letter of 14 June to Mr Foster I have pleasure in
               enclosing a copy of the statement which was prepared by Dr Ashton. Dr
               Ashton, you will recall, was particularly vociferous in the media
               immediately after the incident. No doubt many of the comments he made
               then are the reasons for his wishing to give evidence at the Inquest.
               You may find it appropriate later for us to discuss Dr Ashton's
               possible attendance as well as other key witnesses.

               I trust this is of assistance to you.   If I can be of any further help
               please do not hesitate to contact me.




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
                               Hillsborough, 15th April 1989
                                        Dr John Ashton



I    am   a medical       practitioner       and    senior       lecturer    in     Community    (Public)
Health at the University of Liverpool.                       On Saturday 15th April I went to
the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield with other members of my family.
This year we travelled by way of the M62 and Ml because for the same event
last year we had travelled on the direct route through the peak district
and there had been very bad build-ups of traffic on the way home.                                 We left
Liverpool at about 10.15 am and arrived in Sheffield at about 12.15 - 12.30
pm.       We had a meal at a pub some distance from the ground and afterwards
walked perhaps 2 miles to the match.                  While we were at the pub a coach-load
of Liverpool supporters came in.                   They were boisterous but well behaved and
there was good humour between them and the local people who were eating in
the dining area.


We arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at around 2.30 - 2.35 pm
(myself,      sons Matthew,        16 and Nicholas,          14 and nephew Carl Nichols,                24).
It was immediately apparent that it was going to be difficult to get in.
We    had    four    tickets      together    for    row     2    of   the   West    Stand,     above    the
Leppings Lane terrace.              I had been particularly relieved to obtain seats
this year because              at last year's       game   in the       semi-final we were         in the
terrace itself (in the right hand corner behind the goal) and it had been

terribly crowded and unpleasant.


On Saturday we found that outside the ground there were a large number of
supporters trying to get in to a small number of turnstiles and that there
was very      little police presence.                I saw no stewards outside the ground.
There appeared to have been no attempt to marshal the supporters into lines

in advance of our approaching the turnstile areas.


We    managed       to   get   nearer   to   the    turnstiles         but   the    crush was    becoming
unpleasant.          I heard a police officer telling the supporters that it was

their own fault for coming late.
I decided^ that I did not want to go on because it was so unpleasant.                                     Carl
said   it     would     only       get   worse     and       that he       was   going   in.    Matthew    and
Nicholas insisted on going in with Carl and they stayed where they were as
I withdrew to the wrought-iron fence.


After a few minutes I thought I would try again.                                 I could not see my family
and assumed that they had managed to get through the turnstiles.                                      When I
approached again it was now much worse and again                                 I withdrew.     I was aware
of an officer trying to close one of the wrought                                 iron gates,but he had no
chance on his own.             I noticed that there was now a police landrover in the
lane just outside the gates and my instincts and experience of 30 years as
a Liverpool supporter told me that things were going badly wrong.                                     I went
to the police landrover and obtained the attention of one of the officers.
I said to him,          "you've got to get a grip of this situation,                            it is out of
control,        there    is    going        to   be      a       tragedy."        He   seemed   bemused     and
unresponsive.           People were closing in around the landrover and I withdrew
to the other side of the road to see if it would ease off and I could try
again.        The time now must have been 2.45 - 2.50.


After a few minutes I suddenly realised that everybody had gone in and I
was able to walk up to the turnstiles and gain admission without difficulty
after tendering my ticket.


Once inside the turnstile it was at first unclear where I should go.                                      There
were     no    stewards       in    sight    and      the        section     labelling   was    confusing.    I
realised where the entrance was to the West Stand and went to get in after
buying a programme.                At this stage I had no idea that things had actually
now deteriorated to the extent that they had done.                                  It must have been just
after 3.00 pm.


When I went to the gate into the West Stand there were a few other people
in the process of getting in and two policemen were checking their tickets.
I then became aware of a man crying and beseeching the police.                                    "There are
kids dying in there," he said,                   "you've got to do something.”                  He seemed to
have come out of the terraced area.                              The police were unresponsive to him.
They checked my ticket and let me in.


                                                             2
Once insijie the stand area I turned              up the stairs, now worried to check
that Matthew, Nicholas and Carl            were alright.       As I got to the top of the
stairs it was difficult to make progress because there were so many people
in the aisle.       At the top of the stairs I could begin to see why.                       Many
people were being pulled up out of the terrace and into the front of the

stand.


I could neither attempt to get down to row 2 nor see the boys.                       I decided
to make my way along the adjacent row.                  Everybody was helpful and I was
able to do this without difficulty.           It must have been about row 20.                When
I got some way along        it I looked down to see                if I could see the b oy s.
First I saw Carl,     then Matthew,        then Nick.      I was able to make my way down

to them over the seats.


When I reached them I could see that there were a large number of people on
the pitch,   people trying to get out of the terrace on to the pitch and
people were continuing to come up in to the stand.                    There seemed to be few
St. Johns Ambulance people attending the people who were lying around the
pitch and I could see people lying on the pitch unattended.                        There was a
large line of police officers across the pitch at the centre circle.                          The
tannoy told the supporters who were on the pitch to get off it.


The pressure was bad where we were so I made my way back some rows with
Matt and Nick.       Carl stayed where he was to help pull people up from the
terrace.     When    we   got    further   back    we   had    a    clear   view   of what    was
happening    on the pitch;       it seemed    incredible.           The   time must have been

about 3.15 pm.


The overwhelming impression was of a large and growing number of casualties
 and not much response.         The supporters were now impatient and angry at the
 slowness of the response to the emergencies.                 There appeared to be only one
 or two stretchers on the pitch and one ambulance was making its way around
 from the far corner.           The supporters were chanting for assistance to be
 brought to the injured who were lying on the pitch.                        The next thing was
 that many of the supporters who were on the pitch began to tear down the
advertising boards and organise themselves             into stretcher parties.        This

all happened very quickly.


I heard     the   tannoy   appeal   for   doctors   to help.   I could   see   that    the
situation was really bad and could count six people who appeared to be dead
near the goal mouth.        I made sure that Matthew and Nicholas were safe with
Carl and that I knew where they were and made my way out down the back of

the Leppings Lane Stand.


On    the   stairs   a policeman was      attending somebody who was     injured.      The
injuries did not appear to be critical so I asked the policeman where I
should report to help.         He did not know.       I went back into the stand and
brought the boys out and down the stairs to place them somewhere safe and
in sight.      I then tried to find somebody in charge to tell me who to report
to.     I asked several officers, but none of them knew.            There were people
lying everywhere in the yard area between the Stand and the turnstiles.                  I
asked the officer who was in charge and he indicated a senior officer.                   I
approached this officer and told him that I was a doctor and asked him who
was in charge of emergencies and where I should report.             He said he did not
know and that he had just arrived.           By this stage I realised that there was
no organised response and I was angry.              I asked the officer for his number
but he did not appear to have one.             I asked for his name.     He said he was
Inspector Grace.        I left him and went to see what I could do.


All around were people either dead or unconscious, or seriously hurt.                   The
 supporters were fantastic.         They were all helping each other and trying to
 resuscitate people.        Individual police officers were also doing what they
 could.     At no time did I see anybody attack a police officer, nor did I see

 anybody who was drunk.


 I came to the conclusion that somebody needed to take an overview of the
 situation and began to go round all the casualties to appraise them.                 There
 did not seem to be any St. Johns Ambulance workers around at all.               I became
 aware that some casualties were being taken out into Leppings Lane itself
 and I went out there.         There was one ambulance.        The time must have been

 about 3.30 - 3.35 pm.

                                               4
The policje were beginning to put people into the ambulance and I realised
that a system of prioritising by triage was needed.                            So I did this.           I went
around       and    either       checked    people    myself      or    asked     the    person       who    was
attending them.               There were two or three other health workers in evidence
who    were       assessing,resuscitating            and       doing    what     they    could.            There
appeared to be no medical or emergency equipment.


The dead were            taken to one side and I allocated the                        other casualties to
category one or category two.                  I told the police who              shouldbe despatched
by ambulance next and who could wait.                         The officers were mostly very good.
They    took my          instructions      and acted on them immediately.                      By   this     time
there was a steady flow of ambulances.                         It must have been 3.45 or 3.50.                  I
became aware of a local general practitioner who had arrived at the scene.
Over    the       next    half       an hour    we worked together          as    a    team,       sorting    the
casualties and despatching them in the ambulances.                             An anaesthetist arrived
from somewhere and fire-engines came with resuscitation equipment, but all
of this was really too late.                    By 4.25 pm it was all over.                        The serious
casualties had goneto hospital and what remained were people with                                          minor
injuries,         shock and         distress and a line of dead people.                  I went to check
that my family was alright and when I came back a police officer asked me
to certify the deaths.                A general practitioner had already started this at
one end of the row of bodies.                   I started at the other.                 I think the time
was 4.27 or 4.29 and I think I certified five or six dead.                                         Only one of
whom could be identified from documents on his body.


During this whole period the public were fantastic,                               although shocked and
angry.        On one occasion              at the end a group of young men came past the
dead,       and    one    of   them expressed his             anger    at police       who were       standing
there.       I told him to "cool it", that it was not helpful and he stopped.                                   I
saw    no    other       episodes     like this      at    all,although     there       was    a    general
atmosphere of            anger at what had been happening.                  I remember thinking how
restrained everybody was.


It must have been about 4.30                   - 4.35.        There did not seem to be anything
else     for      me     to    do   behind Leppings Lane.                I checked      that    Matthew       and
Nicholas          were   alright      with Carl      and then         made my way       to    the    gymnasium


                                                          5
around the side of the ground to see if I could be of any help there.                                      I
had become aware that other casualties had been taken to the gymnasium.


At first I had difficulty finding it as nobody could give me directions.
When I arrived there I went in and found that it was all over.                                  At one end
there were       tables (I think three) which must have been used for processing
details of       the injured.         There were now no casualties in this area.                       At the
near end of the gym were rows of bodies.                       On my way past I noticed a large
display    of    photographs          and    information       on   the    wall    of    the   gym    showing
Liverpool supporters who were thought to be pickpockets, etc.


I left the gym and returned round to the Leppings Lane end to check my
family again.          They were alright.           I thought that I should go back to the
gym   to   see    if     there    would      be   a debriefing        of    people      involved       in the
emergency        response,       so    all    four of     us   went       round.      This     time    it was
difficult to get near the gym because there was a large cordon of police
around it.        I spoke to an officer and he let us through when he knew I was
 a doctor and I left Carl, Matthew and Nick safely behind them and went to
 the gym.         This    time    it was very difficult               to get in.          There wastight
 control on       the door.       I explained why I wanted to goin and was                        allowed to

 enter.


 I asked     about      a debriefing but nobody could help.                           Those who had been
 helping were being cleared out of the gym.                               Just then a senior officer
 called    all    the    officers       together     at    one      end    of   the   hall     for    a police

 briefing.        I don't know what it was about.                   I left.


 On our way back to Leppings Lane we encountered a police officer who                                   was in
 great distress and being comforted by another.                             I put my arm around him to
 comfort him as well.             He was sobbing uncontrollably and saying that now the
 police would get the blame.                  Another officer was angry and told me that he
 felt that       they had been let down by the senior officers.                                He said that
 nobody had taken charge                and that when senior officers had come they had

 been of little use and just got in the way.
We left £he ground and returned to the car to drive home.                          We must have

left the ground by about 5 o'clock.


I would like to say that I have been following Liverpool Football Club for
over 30 years and that I am familiar with the normal range of behaviour of
club supporters.          Before the match on Saturday the crowd mood was buoyant
and generally        good humoured.         I feel   that since       the Heysel    disaster       an
attitude of mind has been cultivated which regards all                     football supporters
as members     of    a    sub-human    species    to be contained.         As   a result        crowd
safety has     taken      second place.        On Saturday I believe        that this belief
about     football       supporters    contributed    to      the   apparently     slow    initial
response by the police to what was happening.                   It seemed that they mistook

the tragedy for crowd trouble.


It   is   difficult       to   know   how   many lives might        have   been    saved   if     the
emergency    response       had been    more     effective,     but   in my     opinion    on    this
occasion it was woefully inadequate.

     I am a registered medical practitioner and a chartered chem­
     ist.  My     qual i-Fications include the degrees o-F Bachelor      o-F
     Science (with honours        in pharmacology),   Bachelor o-F Medicine

     Gynaecologists together with a Joint Committee Certi-Ficate in

     Society    o-F Chemistry and a Member o-F the Royal      College    o-F
     Physicians and the Royal College o-F Pathologists.         I hold the

     and Clinical Biochemistry and Honorary Lecturer in Forensic
     Toxicology to the University o-F She-F-Field.

      This statement is intended to supplement my statements o-F 20
      April  1989 and 2 May 1989 and should be read in conjunction
      with them.

      In the process o-F analysing samples -For blood ethanol,   other
      volatile  compounds   may  be  serendipitously   detected.   The
      commonest  o-F these is acetone, although others may    also  be
      seen.

      It was apparent, in the course o-F analysing the blood samples
      obtained at autopsy -From the 94 individuals who died      at   or
      near the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April,    that many o-F them
      contained signi-Ficant   concentrations o-F acetone    and    some
      contained signi-Ficant concentrations o-F acetal dehyde.

      Acetaldehyde is a di-F-Ficult compound to measure accurately in
      blood samples. It may be generated spontaneously -From ethanol
      after   a sample has been taken, and it is quite   volatile  so
      even   i-F the sample is taken with appropriate precautions  it
      may be lost from the container in which the blood sample    has
      been placed. There are also problems with the standardisation
      o-F the assay.   These aspects of the matter are discussed more

        -Ful ly below.

        After   the ethanol concentration had been measured in the        94
        blood   samples,     an  attempt  was  made  to    quantitate    the
        acetaldehyde and acetone concentrations. The results obtained
        are presented in tabular and graphical -Form below.       Note that
        all the concentrations are presented in milligrams per         litre
        and   that where the concentration o-F ethanol is     low,   either
        less than 10 milligrams per 100 millilitres or "not detected"
        in my     original   statement,  the results   may   be expressed
        di-F-Ferently here.   Where the concentration o-F ethanol is less
        than   100 milligrams     per litre but more   than   a trace     is
        present,    I have here expressed it arbitrarily,     -For purposes
        o-F statistical     analysis as 50 milligrams per    litre.    Where
        only a trace is present I have expressed the concentration as
 f      1 milligram     per litre.   For all purposes,   other    than   the
        purely    scientific,   the results given in my statement o-F 20
        April 1989 should be used. Measurements o-F low concentrations
        o-F ethanol in blood, below 10 milligrams per 100 millilitres,
        are quite imprecise.

        Acetaldehyde  is virtually only -Found in human blood  samples
        after the consumption of ethanol.   Ethanol is metabolised  by
        the body first to acetaldehyde and thence to acetate.   Tables
        1 and 2 and figure 7 show the close correlation of the   blood
        acetaldehyde and ethanol concentrations.

        It will be seen that the concentrations of acetaldehyde found
        are   quite  high.   It is quite  unusual   to   see   substantial
        amounts   of  acetaldehyde   in  blood   samples   submitted   for
        ethanol   analysis   either in living or   dead   patients.   Peak
        blood acetaldehyde concentrations in normal subjects drinking
        ethanol   might   be as much as 2 milligrams per     litre.  After
        drugs   such  as carbimide,   which inhibit the metabolism      of
        acetaldehyde to acetate,    the concentration might rise to      10
        milligrams   per litre.   Some subjects here have     acetaldehyde
        concentrations   that   are  significantly   higher    than  that.
        (Figure 5)

        The   question obviously arises;   "could the presence of    such
        large   amounts  of  acetaldehyde in certain     samples   be an
        artifact?"    The main mechanism    by which    acetaldehyde    is
        generated in a blood sample containing alcohol is as follows:
        A   proportion of the oxyhaemoglobin in a sample is converted
        to   methaemoglobin  with  the   generation  of   a    superoxide
        radical.   This can in turn oxidise ethanol   to    acetaldehyde.
        The stochiometry of the reaction is:

        Hb02 -> MetHb + 02 -

 l£    0 a - + 2 CHjtCH2 0H -> 2 CH3 CH0 + 2 H2 0

        One haemoglobin molecule,            fully oxygenated,           contains 4 H b 0 2
        subunits.

        Blood   contains      about     2 mmol/1 of haemoglobin.              1   mole   of

S i g ne d                              Page:       2                             09-May-89
              S t atement o-F A l e x a n d e r R. W. FORREST

  oxyhaemog lobi n could    theoretically   generate    8 moles       o-F
  acetaldehyde.    Thus theoretically, the complete conversion o-F
  all the oxyhaemoglobin in a blood sample containing an excess
  o-F ethanol would generate acetaldehyde at a concentration          o-F
  16 mmol/1.     That  is    704 milligrams    per  litre.     In this
  instance,    there is likely to have been little oxyhaemoglobin
  present a-Fter death.    However, even so,    it is quite possible
  that    a substantial     proportion,    i-F not   all,      o-F   the
  acetaldehyde present in the samples could have been generated
  post    mortem    by non metabolic oxidation          o-F    alcohol,
  particularly as the samples were placed in plastic vials with
  a large dead space,     containing air,   above the blood sample.
  It   is still surprising that one does not usually          see   such
  large concentrations o-F acetaldehyde in the course o-F normal
  case   work.   The reason may be that post mortem       samples    are
  usually   submitted   in 20   millilitre    universal    containers,
  -Filled to the brim and containing little dead space,           whilst
  clinical   samples   are   submitted in    "vacutainers", with        a
  signi-Ficant   dead space albeit with a low oxygen content.         In
  both   cases   there may be less oxygen     available    to    promote
  acetaldehyde -Formation.

  The acetone concentrations -Found are probably not        arti-Facts.
  Acetone   can arise as a product o-F metabolism at       times   when
  glucose   is   not readily available to cells      or  when    stress
  hormones   mobilise    -Fat stores which   are   then metabolised.
  Normally,    the presence      o-F ethanol  tends   to  inhibit the
  production o-F acetone        -From the metabolism     o-F -Fat, its
  presence   -Favouring the production o-F beta      hydroxy-butyrate
  instead.   However there are theoretical reasons -For believing
  that,   under circumstances o-F extreme hypoxia, this mechanism
  would   not operate and acetone would be produced even in the
  presence   o-F ethanol.    It is noteworthy that there is      little
  correlation    between    the concentration of ethanol      and   the
  concentration of acetone in the blood samples examined          here.
  Acetone   can be produced in large amounts during fasting.         It
  is unlikely     that this was a significant mechanism        in this
  case.

  Conclusions:

  1)   Whilst there are theoretical reasons for    believing    that
  significant   concentrations of acetaldehyde might     accumulate
  in the blood as a result of the metabolism of ethanol       during
  severe   hypoxia,   it  is   not  possible to   state   that   the
  unusually    high concentrations of acetaldehyde found in     some
  of   the samples examined here are not an artifact   of   sample
  col lection.

  2)  The relatively high concentrations of acetone found  here
  are  likely  to  be an indication of   significant  metabolic
  stress during the agonal period.

      Note:   all  results,                including           ethanol,       expressed   as
      milligrams per litre.

      Where  ethanol  is less than 100 milligrams per litre    it  is
      recorded  as either 50 milligrams per litre,   i-F there  is  a
      trace  present,  or 10 milligrams per litre i-F it   is  barely
      detectable or zero i-F none is detected.

        NB.  Partial correlation analysis suggests that the   apparent
        association o-F acetaldehyde with age can be explained by  the
        association o-F age with blood alcohol concentration.

      This  statement   consisting of 2 pages each signed by me   is
      true  to  the best of my knowledge and belief and I make    it
      knowing that if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable
      to prosecution i-F I have wilfully stated in it anything  that
      I know to be false or do not believe to be true.

      Dated the 2nd day of May 1989.                          ______________

                                                     S ig n ed .______________ •


      I am a registered medical practitioner and a chartered chem
      ist.  My   qualifications include the degrees of      Bachelor  of
      Science (with honours in p ha rmacology),    Bachelor of Medicine
      and Bachelor of Surgery awarded by Edinburgh University,       and
      the Mastership in Clinical Biochemistry. I hold the        Diploma
      in Obstetrics    of  the Royal College    of   Obstetricians   and
      Gynaecologists together with a Joint Committee Certificate in
      Contraception and Family Planning. I am a Fellow of the Royal
      Society   of  Chemistry and a Member of the Royal      College  of
      Physicians and the Royal College o-F Pathologists,      I hold the
      posts   of Consultant    in Chemical  Pathology    to   the Royal
      Hallamshire Hospital,   Clinical Lecturer in Human      Metabolism
      and Clinical Biochemistry and Honorary Lecturer in Forens ic
      Toxicology to the University of Sheffield.

       This  statement  should   be  read  in conjunction    with   my
       statement  of 20 April 1989 concerning' the     blood   alcohol
       concentrations  found   in the blood samples handed to   me  by
       Sgt. John Turner on 18 April 1989.

       Professor   L.   Henry  asked me   to   carry   out    further
       investigations  on the blood sample he during the   course   of
       his post mortem examination of the body of Gary HARRISON    (o,
       DC12) as he had found a significant amount of atherosclerotic
       disease.

        After         centrifugation of a small portion of the blood sample
        provi ded        it was possible to obtain a supernatant of plasma,
        free        of   red blood cells. I analysed   this   for  cholesterol
        conte nt and I found that the cholesterol           concentration  was
        7.2         millimoles    per  litre.   In  life,    such   a   plasma
        conce ntration of cholesterol,         in a 25 year old man; would  be
        cons i dered        to   be significantly   elevated   and would     be
        assoc iated with an increased risk,          compared to the   general
        popul ation,        of the premature development of coronary    artery

        currently ,being undertaken with col leagues in Rotherham,       a
        cholesterol o-F 7.2 millimoles per litre is about the   average

        are corrected -For. (Blood cholesterol increases with age, and
        those dying o-F trauma tend to be younger than those dying     o-F

        Electrophoresis demonstrated a high beta lipoprotein fraction
        which  is again a -Factor predictive o-F a higher than average

   20 April 1989


  Dear Dr Popper

  I enclose herewith the results of the blood ethanol and other
  analyses carried out at your request on the 94 bloods and on
  tablet sample brought to me by Det/Sgt Turner on 18 April
  1989.

   There are some very unusual features in the blood samples.
   Many contain significant amounts of acetone, which might
    indicate either that some time had elapsed since consuming
    food, or possibly that at the time of death,          for other
   reasons,      they were ketotic. Also virtually all the samples
   that \ contain alcohol also contain significant amounts of
   acetal          . Although acetaldehyde is the first metabolic
   produce,         ethanol  it is normally present in very low
   concentrations in blood.       Certainly it is rarely,  if ever,
   present/in concentrations sufficient to be detectable in the
j ^ o u r s e of blood alcohol analysis by head space GC. I am doing
^rciore work to elucidate this and I will report back to you as
   soon as possible. My first thought is that these phenomena
   are a reflection of NADH-*- depletion due to hypoxia.

                                               yours sincerely.

This statement consisting of jf" pages each signed by me is true to the
best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that if it is
tendered in evidence I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully
stated in it anything that I know to be false or do not believe to be true.

Dated the 20 April    1989           Signed:



I am a registered medical practitioner and a chartered chemist. My
qualifications include the degrees of bachelor of Science, bachelor of
medicine and bachelor af s u r g e r y, and the Mastership in Clinical
Biochemistry. I am a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and a
member of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of
Pathologists. I hold the posts of Consultant in Chemical Pathology at
Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Honorary Lecturer in Forensic Toxicology
to Sheffield University.

On the morning of 18 April 1989 I was handed a box by an officer who
identified hims'elf to me as Sgt John Turner of South Yorkshire Police.
The box contained 94 samples of blood each in a container with an
appropriate preservative and each container being enclosed in a plastic
bag labelled with a decedent’s name and identifying numbers. The blood
containers themselves were also labelled appropriately. The box also
contained a universal container in which were two tablets. This
container bore a label stating that the tablets had been found in the
stomach of G J Roberts (identifying numbers 79 and TIB 11).

On the April 18, 19 and 20 these samples were analysed under my direct
supervision for ethanol with the results given below. Ethanol is the
alcohol present in alcoholic beverages.

The two tablets labelled ^is being found in the stomach of G J Roberts
(79 and TIB 11) contained the anticonvulsant sodium valproate. This is
commonly prescribed as "Epilim". His blood sample was analysed for the
commonly prescribed anticonvulsants with the following results*

Serum   Ualproate            7 milligrams per litre
Serum   phenytoin            not detected
Serum   phenobarbitone       not detected
Serum   carbamazepine        not detected

Serum valproate concentrations are a poor quide to the efficacy of treatment
with this drug. However, the concentration found would certainly not be
toxic.

It is very difficult  to more than make broad generalisations about the
likely alcohol consumption that would produce a particular blood alcohol
concentration in any one individual, or to predict whether or not that blood
alcohol level would be associated with intoxication. As a broad guide, an
average man who consumed two pints of average beer over 2 hours might well
have a blood ethanol concentration, at that time, of about 50 milligrams
per 100 millilitres. The state commonly recognised as being drunk is
associated with  large variations in the blood alcohol concentration. For
example whilst it is unlawful to drive a motor vehicle when the blood
alcohol concentration exceeds 80 milligrams per 100 millilitres, I have
examined individuals with few objective signs of intoxication although their
blood alcohol concentrations were in excess of 200 milligrams per 100
millilitres. Such individuals usually have problems related to the
habitually excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages.    On the other hand,
I have seen many individuals who were obviously impaired when their blood
alcohol concentration was below 100 milligrams per 100 millilitres. It
should be noted that the degree of intoxication associated with a particular
blood concentration of alcohol in a particular individual is usually greater
when the concentration is rising rather than when it is falling.

Dear Sir


I was in the Leppings Lane pen on Saturday at 3,00 p.m. but was
extremely fortunate to     havebeen helped out by     fans that
brought me over the side fence.


I am incensed by the Press and T.V. mis information since the
tragedy. I did not know   what to do or how to express my views;
so I have set out what I   did onSaturday afternoon along with
questions that I feel need answering and are pertinent to the
disaster.


I attach my statement and I would welcome the opportunity to
attend any Enquiry or Meeting.


Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,

Re: Hillsborough

I, as one of thousands, watched in total horror as the events unfolded at
Hillsborough on Saturday. As early as 2.30 p.m. I commented to my father
sitting next to me that the middle terraces behind the goal were already near
to capacity whilst the two wing terraces were no more than one third full.
By 2.40 p.m. as I am sure video recordings will demonstrate, people were
beginning to attempt to climb out of the middle terrace to the wing terraces.
Accountability is only of value if we are to learn the lessons from it and
the mistakes made. There are a number of questions that must be addressed,
and I have no doubt that the blame and the responsibility for Saturday lies
squarely at the feet of the Police. The questions posed can be as follows:


1.       Why did the Police instruct the Football Association to leave the arrangements
         as they were for the 1988 semi-final at Hillsborough? It must have
         been obvious to everybody that Liverpool Football Club have a greater
         following and should have been given a higher ticket allocation. In
         particular they should have been allocated the Kop Stand where there
         is room for some 22,000 standing people, roughly equivalent to the Kop
         at Anfield. Logic seems to escape everything the Police do in this
         respect.

2.       Why did the Police open the gates at all? If there was pressure for
         people to enter the ground then surely an announcement that the game
         was to be delayed until all had entered the ground would have prevented
         the panic for people to enter the ground when they heard the roar
         for the players coming on to the pitch.
C O N T IN U A T IO N

    * 17th April, 1989




        3.   As mentioned above, by 2.30 p.m. the middle terraces behind the goal
             were already close to capacity. Why did the Police Control Room not
             inform the Police at the gates that the middle terrace was full and ensure
             that the crowd rushing in through the open gates were directed to
             the wing terraces? This could be done by a Police line in front of
             the middle terrace entrance.

        4.   I understand that the Police were causing considerable delay on the
             A61, being the road Liverpool supporters were directed to take off the
             motorway. A great number of vehicles and coaches were stopped and
             searched, all attributing to the delay in the crowd arriving at the turnstiles
             before closing at 3.00 p.m. In addition the car parking facilities were
             a considerable distance from the ground which further attributed to
             the delay in getting to the ground. Again the Police failed to realise
             this and to take remedial action.


        It appears that all the above questions will remain unanswered as few people
        are prepared to put their hands up and accept responsibility. There is no
        doubt that failure by the Police to take the correct decisions at the time attributed
        to the death of nearly 100 Liverpool supporters. At no time did the Police
        appear to be under control for many minutes after the events which led to
        the great crush. They ignored the pleas and the shouts for help from those
        people in the middle terraces. I cannot get out of my mind the sight of
        100 or so Policemen standing in front of the North Stand in the centre of
        the pitch looking idly on at the scenes unfolding. It took a great number
        of minutes before they left that space to get involved in helping the injured
        and the dying. No blame can be apportioned to those men who were under
        orders, but blame can be put on the Police who were monitoring and controlling
        the crowd. They must surely have seen, as every other member of the ground
        had seen, the injured spilling on to the pitch. Why, oh why, oh why, do
        the Police fail time after time, after time to act with speed and efficiency
        when under pressure?

        I write to you, Sir, in the hope that you will accept the responsibility to
        ensure that the truth is told and that we never, ever see an occurrence
        such as this again. Surely in 1989 55,000 people can go to a football match
        in peace and security.

Dear Sir,

     I was present at the F.A. Cup Semi-final on Saturday as a
Liverpool supporter, and I may have information of relevance to
your enquiries from two points of view.

     Firstly, I was present at the gate at the Leppings Road end
of the ground from shortly before 2.45pm and was very close to
the main gate that opened at about one minute to 3 o'clock. When
we arrived at the turnstile the crowd was about 15 yards deep.
There was only one mounted policeman controlling this crowd and
soon an intense pressure built up at that point.       The reason
appeared to be, and this does not seem to have been brought out
in the Press or other media, that there were no people passing
through the turnstiles at this time.     The crush became so bad
that a policeman from inside the ground was helping fans climb
in.   In my view it was absolutely necessary that the gates were
opened, as serious injury was imminent especially to the less
physically robust people.      I feel the question has to be
addressed as to why these turnstiles were not moving allowing
proper filtration into the ground.
      Shortly after getting into my seat in the stand it became
very apparent that there were problems in the crowd behind the
goal, and I went down on to the pitch almost immediately and was
almost certainly the first medically trained person there.     I,
therefore, can give you information on the state of the people
coming out of the terraces.  I managed to resuscitate some of the
initial victims, but as time went on it was obvious that the
bodies being brought out of the crowd had been dead for some
time.    I would like to confirm that there was no emergency
procedure being enacted by the police.   There appeared to be no
organisation or triage and finally it was only volunteers from
the crowd who set this up. In two cases that I dealt with I feel
the lack of airway devices probably contributed to their deaths.
It seems to me inconceivable that a large football ground should
not have an emergency procedure and some basic medical equipment,
which is indeed quite cheap, to deal with an accident such as
this.

     I would be prepared to attend an enquiry.




Yours sincerely,

I am a Chartered Accountant and work

I have followed Liverpool F.C. for over 20 years, seeing on
average 20 games a season - including the Charlton, Luton,
Coventry, Derby and Sheffield games in recent weeks.
                      STATEMENT OF EVENTS

                    SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989

My ticket is Leppings Lane Standing Entrance B.      I have not
been into the Hillsborough Stadium before.      I was    meeting
friends at 1.15 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. in the Fat Cat, Alma Street,
near the centre of Sheffield to go to Hillsborough together.   I
drove south down the Ml to Junction 34 (Tinsley) arriving
before 1.00 p.m. - but then spent over 45 minutes travelling 4
miles to reach the city centre, late because of the      traffic
congestion/roadworks.


We then travelled half the journey by car parking near Hillfoot
Bridge, Neepsend Lane where Forest fans had congregated.     We
walked up Penistone Road, then up Parkside Road turning right
into Leppings Lane arriving at 2.35 p.m.     Penistone Road was
heavy with Forest fans.


In my opinion this time was comfortable bearing in mind that
the game was all ticket.    There was chaos in the narrow area
between Leppings Lane and the turnstiles.         There were 2
Policemen on horses outside the outer gate and 2 Policemen on
foot.  No other Police were in sight.    There appeared to be no
plan to the Police action when at the outer gate I noticed that
the ground gates to the right of the Entrance B were opened to
allow fans in directly.  I was separated from my friends in the
crush by the panicking horses.   In the mass of fans in the area
between the outer gates and the turnstiles, I headed for the
right of the turnstiles hoping to get to further turnstiles or
that the gates would be opened again.


The gates were opened for a second time and I entered the
ground at 2.50 p.m. without ticket inspection.   I still have
the full ticket.   In my opinion there was- not a sufficient
crush to cause the gates to be opened.  There was no evidence
of any drunken behaviour - just many anxious people trying to
enter the ground.


Once inside the gates I was opposite the tunnel under the West
Stand and could see the pitch down the tunnel.   From my ticket
map I assumed Entrance A and D led to the two corner areas
therefore I should go down the tunnel.         No Police were
before/in or at the end of the tunnel.
When through the tunnel I took to the right hand side to be
behind the goals.   It was still not kick off time.     I felt
uncomfortable as more and more fans kept coming down the
tunnel.  I kept moving to the right heading away from the main
crush.


Soon after kick off I was getting squashed but still tried to
get to the right hoping that it would thin out towards the
corner of the ground.     There were no Police at the centre
behind the goal so when the first fans escaped to the edge of
the pitch the only immediate reaction was from the Press who
merely took photos of the crush.      It was nearly 5 minutes
between the crush becoming unbearable and any Police action.


As the game stopped I came upon a crash barrier and took the
risk of going underneath, but struggled to stand up.  I managed
to move further to the right.     It was then I realised there
were fences between the perimeter fence and the West Stand.   I
was shoulder to shoulder with one fan who was next to the
fence.   He pursuaded supporters in the adjacent area to help
him climb and get over the fence.      I followed him over the
fence.   I then lay down and gradually recovered over the next
half hour.   I saw no looting or any theft.  I saw no Policemen
being attacked. The events between 3.10 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. are
well logged by T.V. so I have not covered them in any detail,
suffice it to say that there appeared to be insufficient
medical staff (i.e. St John's Ambulance volunteers/firemen) or
equipment (e.g. stretchers).

                                HILLSBOROUGH QUESTIONS


         1.   Ticket allocations were clearly wrong.  I would suggest
              they should be in proportion to the average home gate. The
              parking could have been as on match day, but Forest fans
              use Parkside Road to reach Leppings Lane end.


         2.   Why was Junction 34 off the Ml used for Nottingham Forest
              fans when there are diversions/roadworks which caused
              considerable traffic delays.


         3.   The landlord of   the pub by Hillfoot bridge, Neepsend Lane
              was interviewed   on XTV on 1’8 April. He was describing the
              vast amounts of   alcohol consumed by fans - but did not
              state that they   were Nottingham Forest supporters, instead
              he implied they   were Liverpool supporters.


         4.   Many thousands of Forest fans must have arrived at the
               Spion Kop turnstiles well after 2.35 p.m.  Can the
               electronic turnstile records show how many fans entered
               the Spion Kop in the last 25 minutes compared to the
               Leppings Lane end as the Liverpool fans accused of being
               late; in my opinion more Forest fans were outside the
               ground at 2.35 p.m.


         5.   .The Police presence outside the Leppings Lane end was
               minimal and inadequate. More officers should have been
               there to do an initial ticket check to keep fans without
               tickets well away from the turnstiles.


         6.   Why did the Police outside Leppings Lane not get the fans
               to form queues. This is surely standard practice.


         7.   When the gates were opened the Police could still have
               collected the ticket stubs as fans entered.


         8.   A better solution to cater for crowd safety outside the
               ground would have been to delay the start by 15 minutes
               to allow everyone to enter.
                                                             - 6 -


9.   The gates shown on BBC T.V. on 17 April and in the
     Financial Times on 18 April as the gates that were opened
     were not those that I entered the ground. The gates on
     T.V. were concertina metal gates to the left of turnstile
     B, I entered by wooden gates to the right of turnstile B.


10. The P.A. System should have been used to tell fans at the
    rear of the West Stand/outside that the central area was
    full. The video T.V.'s must have shown the concentration.
    The P.A. System could have given instructions how to get to
    the crowed - free areas.  If the P.A. System was
    inadequate; then the Police/Ground Stewards could have done
    it.


ll^^The ticket ground plan needs clarifying. My ticket is
  ^^Leppings Lane Standing Entrance B which the plan would lead
    you to the tunnel only. One would assume A and D have
    access to the corner terraces.


12. The tunnel was unlit and sloping downwards.     It would be
    far safer to be both properly lit and flat.


13. Why weren't the Police at either end/in the tunnel.


14. Why didn't the video T.V. show the crush and so action
    prior to kick off.


15. Why didn't the Press raise the alarm or help.


16. The Police action immediately after the game was stopped
    was very slow. Only a handful of Policemen were in the
    trouble spot.


17. Why were the fences across the uncovered standing area not
    taken down as the end was entirely Liverpool fans. The
    gates at the back of those fences should have been open.


18. Why didn't the Police have ladders or rope to pull fans
    out onto the ground fence.
19. Why was the immediate Police priority to create a Cordon
    across the pitch (approximately 100 Officers were out in
    the middle) when only a small number were assisting the
    crushed. Where were all the other Police.


20. Why wasn't the P.A. System used properly. Instead of
    telling fans to get off the pitch it should have told the
    Forest fans what was happening and also asked for medical
    people in the ground; many doctors must have been in the
    ground unaware of the crisis. The P.A. could also have
    told fans to go back up the tunnel.


21. Why did there appear to be such a shortage of medical
    staff. Why was there such a lack of any medical equipment.


22. I was annoyed by the immediate T.V./Radio comments,
    particularly from Mr Kelly. Why say the gates were forced
    by fans without tickets if you are unsure. The Police
    waited until 7.00 p.m. before admitting that they had
    opened the gates. Why the four hour delay!

FILE NOTE DATED 12.4.90



RE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST - CORONERS RULES 23



Details of conversation with Inspector Leyton.



I explained to Inspector Leyton that it was his statement

and obviously he had to decide what he wanted to present,

but subjectto that and on the understanding that any

comments I made were obviously for his decision and subject

to being correct.   I made the following minor commentss-




1. Page 2. I thought that the photographs were taken rather

later than 6.30.    He said that he had put thlw^ in after

checking the time but he was quite happy to leave it out.

Later on he uses the words "extremely sensitive".

I said that   I understood what he meant, but I personally

would have chosen a different word to " sensitive".




POPACK
I made a few minor comments where he describes the BBC

material and in particular the film without a time section,

purely to make it easier for understanding.    Later on in

his statement he talks about where identification has been

made by way of a photograph.    These have been reproduced on

a colour photocopier for use in individual deceased files.

I explained to him that the files were basically prepared

for my use and merely because something was in them did not

necessarily mean that it would be available to others, but

as a matter for me to select.    I felt it would be better if

we left out references to the individual file and this same

point also arises on the last page where he talks about the

evidence which is collectively being reproduced for the

inquest.   We decided that it would be best if we left those

comments out.


I suggested that he inserts a date when they started

looking at individual films after the completion of Lord

Justice Taylor's report.




 In the paragraph dealing with the preparation of plans for

South Yorkshire Police Officers where they had made verbal

 identifications but could not find themselves on video
                                           u
 photographs I thought it would be best if qualified this to

 make it clear that the degree of certainty varied from

 absolute certainty where, for example, an officer stayed




 POPACK
with the body all the time, to some doubt where an

officer deduced the situation.



Where he discusses his own plans andJLft he agreed that

these were not just prepared where the photographs were

not self evident but basically referred to the visual

evidence and                       photography evidence.



On the last page I thought it ought not to refer to

people dying within the pens, that was possibly a

contentious point and I thought that it would be better

to say that they had been in thoac spectators'
       C*i 10* pt/m
pens^. Inspector Leyton agreed with this, particularly in

some cases where some people were actually seen alive in

the pens.                        We discussed whether we should mention the named

individuals, with the exception of ones who could not

be located etc.                          Although I did not have any strong

feelings, in the end we decided it might be wiser to

leave them out as we were sort of accentuating them.                               -
a ............. ..............     i»rnrly .h a i r i n g m o n t   inncrl them.



We did discuss that there would have to be a paragraph in

the statement somewhere to make it clear that mistakes in

identification had been made and where possible these had

been corrected.

any    problems       of    this       nature.

         Continuation of statement of     Terence Willis Stuart

        Following the abolition of the South Yorkshire County Council (I believe

        on 31 March 1986), District Councils became responsible for the safety

        at sports grounds and became the licensing authority.                     It was about this

        time that the Health & Safety Executive became part of these working

        groups.




        On the 2 February 1981 I was transferred to Operations Division in the

        rank of Chief Inspector.        Chief Superintendent Mole at that time was the

        Superintendent in charge of the division and dealt with Safety of Sports

        Grounds Act meetings.        I would of course attend such meetings in his

        absence and from my pocket book and copy document file supplied by West

        Midlands Police, I can say that I first attended a meeting in connection

        with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on Friday 11 September 1981 at

        the South Yorkshire Fire Service Headquarters at Division Street,

        Sheffield.




        From early December 1981 I was A/Superintendent (Operations) until my

        promotion to Superintendent and transfer on 5 April 1983 .




        During the period commencing December 1981 until the 4 April 1983 I

        attended the following meetings in connection with Safety of Sports

        Grounds Act at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground.

2.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED that Hr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

      (i)-    the further calculations required by the Building
              Authority being satisfactory;

      (ii)    confirmation that adequate headroom will be
              available at the fear'af the Terrace, and

      (iii)   the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
              under police control.

 2      Ground Inspection

 A      West Stand

 •It was noted that there was light surface corrosion at the foot of the
  steel supporting pillar nearest to the North-West Terrace. .As there was
- no enclosing wing to the stand, the pillar was open to the elements.

 The possibility of spectators climbing onto the roof of the store shed to
 the rear of the stand and adjacent to the boundary wall was discussed.

 IT WAS AGREED

 (i)    That the Club wouldarrange for the foot of the steel supporting
 pillar to be cleaned andpainted andpossibly for thegusset   plate to be
 covered by a concrete haunch.

 (ii)   That the Club would consider whether any useful purpose would be
'served by retaining the store shed adjacent to the boundary wall.

 (iii) That the Club would investigate and make good the crack in the
 concrete adjacent to stand entrances "W" and "X"..

C.    Ground Inspection
      (i)   West Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area *
of the stand could be moved within certain limits if the Police considered
that this would achieve a useful purpose.                       -

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings at the front of the upper
seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
fixed to concrete wall;

(b)   that further areas of spalled concrete at the front of the upper
seated stand area should received "attention as matters of maintenance.

      (ii)   North-West Terrace

IT WAS AGREED that the advertisement hoardings erected on the upper North-
West Terrace should be securely fixed.

3.____ Ground Inspection

A.    West Stand

It was noted that, whilst the foot of the steel supporting pillar had been
cleared of light surface corrosion and its gusset plate had been covered
by a concrete haunch (as agreed at the summer inspection on 24th August,
1982), it still required to.be painted.




It was also noted that the crack in the concrete adjacent to stand entrances'
"W" and "X" had been made s ood«
The Club had also been revested at the s u ^ e r inspection on J W A u g

     3 #3   it    felt that discussion should take place regarding the
            suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
            emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand. The
            fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
            cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
            impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                          B.S.

        Further to my statement of the 1 June 1989.


        So far as the meeting of the 11 September 1981 is concerned, my

        recollection is that the erection of the radial barriers was for the

        purpose of effecting increased control on the terrace by way of

        segregating opposing fans.


        The reference to police control of the new gates at the rear of the

        terrace,            so far as my recollection is concerned, was for the purpose

        of effecting that segregation.                                                     That would, of course, mean police

        officers being at or in the vicinity of those gates.


        However, their presence would not be required on match days when

        segregation was not an issue.                                                     In other words this is a conditional

        control.


        I do not recall any specific conversation in relation to this

        matter.

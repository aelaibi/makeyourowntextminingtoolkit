            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY - REQUESTS FOR COPY INFORMATION ETC

            We have received a number of applications for copies of documents,
            videos, photographs etc, in our possession.  The Chief Constable is
            not empowered to release anything without the approval of Counsel who
            have now been appointed by Lord Justice Taylor.  In future, therefore,
            in order to avoid delays you may feel it appropriate for any requests to
            be channelled through your Solicitors directly to the Treasury
            Solicitors acting on behalf of Counsel.  Treasury Solicitors can be
            contacted through Dr D Brummell at the Home Office, Queen Anne's Gate,
            28 Broadway, London SW1H 9JS, telephone number 01-210-3109.

            Your current requests for copy information have now been brought to the
            attention of Dr Brummell and, no doubt, he will be in touch with your
            Solicitors in the near future.




                                                                                                     j

BILL ON TAYLOR OFFENCES - DRAFT INSTRUCTIONS
You copied to Mr Cogbill your note of the 19 February to
Mr Goddard endorsing Draft Instructions to Counsel: you will
be aware that the Lord President has not agreed to the
introduction of a Home Office Bill in this Session and we are
therefore left with trying to amend Sir John Wheeler's
fi^ ^ la e .
2.   The instructions clearly illustrate the conceptual and
other difficulties permeating the offence proposals.  We have
no specific comments on the Instructions except with regard to
paragraph 3.21.  As with many offences, allegedly involving a
number of participants acting in concert, it will not be easy
to establish to the necessary standard of proof the role
played by specific defendants.  However such difficulties
cannot justify importing a presumption of guilt on the basis
that the defendant was seen "opening and shutting" his mouth
at the same time as others were committing the offence.   There
will be many cases where such defendants were in fact making
wholly inoffensive comments, or indeed, orally encouraging
their companions to desist in their offensive behaviour.   Such
a presumption would be seen as oppressive in its effects and
could well lead to injustice.

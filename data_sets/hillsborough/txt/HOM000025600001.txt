Fact No Eleven

Hooliganism has reduced Football's image with the general public
to its lowest level ever.


Opinion

No scheme will redress the substantial drop                 in attendances to
p r e - h o o l i g a n i s m levels overnight. It will     take a d e c a d e at
least.

What members only has achieved at Luton is the return of the
good name of Football locally.    This was ach i e v e d o vernig ht
resulting in major investment in the Club by local people and
businesses: we can build on this.

Additionally police costs to both the Club and the rate payer
have been substantially reduced against the national trend.

The image of football needs to be considerably improved with the
non-football public.  This can only be achieved by resolving the
hooliganism problem on the way to and from the grounds. Whilst
it is a Law and Order problem, nev e r t h e l e s s it has had a
debilitating and negative effect on the game.    Football needs to
tackle this problem now, not leave it to others.

segregation of supporters.
T.TTTniy TOWN FC ATTENDANCE SURVEY


The following is a commentary on the market research carried out in
association with DJC Marketing. It reflects anecdotal evidence which supports
and explains the statistical findings of the main report.

1. Ve are satisfied that the sample is accurate and reflects a cross-section of
support in terms of age, socio-economic groupings and geographical spread. It
was decided to split the support into three categories. Comments relating to
category B, those attending between 3 and 6 matches, are valuable because this
represents a group of people who are getting out of the habit of watching
matches.

2. It is significant that most people attend matches with at least one other
person, a relative or friend, or in a group. When one person cannot attend, the
likelihood increases that his companion<s) will also miss the match.

3. We were interested to note that 13 of those members sampled had yet to
attend a match. A number of these were wives of supporters who no longer
attended, or girlfriends who had split up with supporters, which further bears
out point 2.

4. Question 3 of the DJC survey indicates supporters plan well ahead (in some
cases right at the start of the season) and short term marketing of individual
matches this season would have little effect.

5. Question 4 was extremely revealing. School half-term commitments were a
factor in non-attendance but one which could have been overcome had the
fixture been more attractive.

Most important is the assertion by some 40 per cent that they were working.
This reflects a general upturn in the local economy (among respondents,
Vauxhall employees, builders and store warehousemen said they now had an
opportunity for overtime). Secondly, the rise in mortgage rates provides a
strong incentive to work overtime.

6. Category B are particularly selective about matches and several factors have
led to their not attending this match.
a. The successful Littlewoods Cup run (played at times more convenient for
Saturday workers) have satisfied their desire to attend a limited number of
matches«
b. The fixtures computer has left the club with a less attractive run in to the
season. Specifically there is a negative attitude to Middlesborough.
c. The deterioration in League form.




more follows
7. Attitudes towards LTFC.

Erratic form and lack of atmosphere are strong negatives. There is a latent
wish for visiting supporters     ona controlled basis. While views on the
synthetic surface are divided, thisis a deterrent factor which other clubs do
not have to face.

8. Question 7 indicates that there is no obvious marketing-based answer to the
decline in attendance


                              SURVEY CONCLUSIONS

The opportunity and financial    needto work is a big factor in the decline.   It
shows up particularly in those    who say    they are terrace supporters.

Excluding the hard core support, members have become increasingly selective
about which matches they attend. It would be wise to check these findings
regarding overtime with the Chamber of Commerce. If they are confirmed, the
Club should base its calculations on an average gate of about 8,000.

The attendance decision is affected by the ability of companions to accompany
them.

This decision is taken well in advance.

The decision has been based on the quality of the opposition and re-inforced
by the decline in the Town's League form.

However, price is not seen as a big problem, apart from family groups. As an
aside, a price increase in line with inflation, would not appear to be a
problem for next season.

                                  SUGGESTIONS

There is a fund of goodwill for the club among supporters. We would suggest a
strong public appeal to supporters to get behind the team to help the
relegation battle. This would help to put some additional meaning into the
remaining League programme.

For next season we would propose an early and planned campaign to market the
less attractive fixtures. This idea would depend on the ability to sell tickets
well in advance of the match.

To take the rest of this season as an example, the biggest gate is likely to
be for the Spurs match, therefore the Club's best opportunity to persuade
supporters to attend the Charlton and Derby fixtures. We would suggest that
supporters at this match be offered the opportunity - for this day only - to
tfythe same ticket for the Charlton and or Derby fixtures at a discount.




more follows
Next season precise details would depend on the fixture list. But we would
foresee   the ability to pre-purchase       tickets for small groups of less
attractive matches at a discount. Pre-booking would provide interest earnings
to partly offset the discount.

Growth of the new supporters club would have some impact on the reluctance to
attend alone, since supporters club members will have a wider circle of
acquaintances. As has long' been recognised, a more exciting atmosphere would
also make matches more attractive spectacles.

OBJECTIVE OF SURVEY

To ascertain the reasons for non-attendance at the League Division 1 Match
- Luton Town v Middlesbrough - February 18th, 1989.

SURVEY METHOD

By telephone interviews based on an agreed questionnaire         (see attached).
Season Ticket holders were excluded.

Names to be selected at random from membership forms supplied by Luton Town
F.C.

Interviews carried out in the evening from 3rd to 14th March, 1989.

POPULATION FRAME

Assunptions Made

     Total Membership Population                19,000
     Season Ticket Holders                       3,500
     Match Attendance                            8,000

Based on the assumption that all season ticket holders attended the game
the total non-season ticket members who attended is 4,500 fans, out of a
total potential of 15,500 fans - 29% of non-season ticket holders.

Actual Sample Frame Used

A total of 90 members were contacted of which five refused to           co-operate.
(Those not available are excluded from the figures).

     Total Sanple Frame                                    No. of Members

     Those who attended Middlesbrough match                      24

     Those who did NOT attend match but have:

        Attended 7 or more home league matches                   13
        Attended 3 to 6 home league matches                      21
        Attended less than 2 home league matches                 14

    Attended no league games at all                              13


                                                                 85

The tables analysing the results are subdivided          into   three   attendance
categories:

    A     = those   attending 7 or more home league matches
    B     = those   attending 3 to 6 home league matches
    C     = those   attending less than 2 home league matches

The findings are also commented on by category.

The 13 members who attended no leagues matches at all were        excluded    from
the detailed survey.
ACCURACY OF SAMPI£

Given a total population available of 15,500,         a   sample   of   50   is
statistically sound to provide an accuracy of +/- 5%.

To check the accuracy of the sample each respondent was asked to    indicate
which matches they attended.

It was then assumed that the percentage of sample which attended each match
equalled the percentage of the total percentage of non-season ticket
holders who actually attended.

A forecast was then made of the total aggregate population who would have
attended based on a forecast from the sample, against the actual aggregate.

Season ticket holders are excluded.

Total Forecast from Sample            68,900
Total Actual attendance               66,200
Forecast v Actual % difference        + 4.1%

Comment

40% indicated watching the match had no views on whether it would make them
more likely to attend Middlesbrough match.

Of the 54% who indicated it would, none attended.

Conclusion

'Live' TV coverage had little or no impact on attending             next   match.
Equally had marginal impact if any in keeping fans away.

QUESTION 4 - Potential Reasons for Not Attending
             (See over page for details)

Comment

Category A - Those who have attended 7 or more matches

Half-term holiday commitments accounted for 31% of non-attendance in            this
category.

2 out of 5 did not attend because of work commitments, mainly 'overtime1.

There has to be a suspicion       that   some    agreed     to work   because    of
unattractiveness of fixture.

15% could not attend because of family commitments.

Of the 31% who did not attend because of holiday claims, 3 out of the 4
people thought that if the match had been more attractive (say Liverpool)
they would probably have attended.

It is calculated that half-term holiday commitments probably accounted          for
200 likely attendees not attending.

Category B - Those attending 3 to 6 matches

By far the largest single reason given          for   not   attending was    work
commitments - 43% of category.

The second was unattractiveness of fixture.

The third was 'selection of matches'.    This is an important group - fans
who support Luton but are now out of the 'habit' of attending every match.

The match is not number one priority on many Saturdays.

Category C - Those attending 2 or less matches

In this category there is ahard core -    around 40% who because of work         or
sport commitments are unable to attend    Saturday fixtures.

This is illustrated by a number who attend mid-week cup matches and         other
games.

It is calculated that of the Membership List approximately 6.5% on any
Saturday are excluded because of long term commitments - 1,250 potential
attendees who would be more likely to attend mid-week.

The balance of 60% of this category are either:

          supporters of another team
          select matches very deliberately
          not 'excited' by prospect of Middlesbrough

Conment

85% of respondents     thought Luton an exciting team, the    games worth
watching.   Only 6%    considered Lutona defensive team.      However, 85%
considered the team's performance erractic this season.

The 27% who indicated Luton only watch watching against 'big name'    clubs
reflects answers to Question 4.

Although only 20% commented on cost, it is significant that all who   made
this point attended as a family or group.

Lack of atmosphere- over 50% of those who attended 7  or more matches
criticised the lack of atmosphere. Anequal percentage of the 3 to 6 game
attendees agreed.

Regular attendees who had views were equally divided on the merits of the
plastic pitch.    Those who attended less than two matches were the most
critical, 55%. In total 35% of those who did not attend the game (and who
expressed a view) were negative.
QUESTION 7

Finally, respondents were asked to indicate any single action     the   club
could take which would have persuaded them to attend the match.

With regard to the specific match, none made a suggestion, however, general
comments were made about persuading them to attend more matches.

                  FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS MEMBERSHIP CARD SCHEME:

                                   THE LUTON TOWN EXPERIENCE




  Introduction

  In Augu st 1986, L u t o n Town FC p l ay ed its first ma t c h with
  visiting supporters excluded from the Kenilworth Road ground.
  Throughout that season the home fans only rule applied for all
  the Club's home matches in the League and FA Cup.                              During the
  f o l l o w i n g 1 9 8 7 / 8 8 s e a s o n , t h e r u l e w a s r e l a x e d for C u p
  competitions, as a condition of participation.

  The following report details the experiences of the Club and our
  neighbours in the community over the past two seasons.

  Background

  Some of the wor st d i s t u r b a n c e s ever seen in B r i t i s h football
  occurred at Kenilworth Road in March 1985 during a televised FA
  Cup Tie against Millwall.               The incident ended with 47 injured,
  i nclu di ng 33 police, and d a m a g e totaling £70,000.                             Whilst
  g r a b b i n g the h e a d l i n e s ,  t h i s i n c i d e n t o v e r s h a d o w e d the
  persistent, but not less serious, football related violence that
  had been afflicting the area.                   For example, during the 1985/86
  season, four visiting supporters received serious stab wounds in
  separate attacks, quite apart form the high level of hooliganism
  and criminal damage.

  The Members Only Scheme

  The root cause was the presence of rival fans, with even innocent
  visiting supporters providing a target for local troublemakers.
  It was decided to control access to the ground by a card entrv
  system. This prev en ts the mass of v i s i t i n g s u p p o r t e r s from
  g a i ni ng admission, but also d i s c o u r a g e s troublem ak e rs from
  attending because they fear identification.              It also promotes
  good behaviour from supporters who might otherwise lose their
  right to admission.
The 1986/87 Season

D u r i n g the 1986/87 season, 30,000 cards were issued.                   Later
analysis indicated that there was an active membership of about
22,000.         However, two factors account for the discrepancy: in the
initial enthusiasm many people joined as a gesture of support for
the principle rather than to attend matches; and, secondly, the
m e m b e r s h i p c o mp ut er kept an a c c u m u l a t i v e total, inclu di ng
replacements for lost, damaged, or faulty cards issued throughout
the year.

Inside the ground, the atmosphere was transformed.     During 24
matches, there were no arrests.    This can be compared with 190
arrests in 1984/85 and 102 arrests in 1985/86.

The St. Joh n A m b u l a n c e B r i g a d e treated just 16 people, for
accidents or illness, compared to 96, including many victims of
violence, in 1985/86.

The reaction of supporters was overwhelmingly favourable.                       The
scheme was accepted totally by supporters of visiting clubs, only
a hand fu l of w h o m t r av el le d to Luton.       In a s u r v e y of home
supporters, 98 per cent said they approved.                    Home support
increased by about 5 per cent and attendance figures included the
hig h p r o p o r t i o n of 26 per . cent c h il d re n and p e n s i o n e r s -
indicating the sense of security which had been created.

The 1987/88 Season

There was a perceived need to increase gate income substantially
after several seasons of unchanged prices.                 Sharp increases in
the cost of both membership and match tickets (now substantially
r eversed), to g e t h e r w i t h n o n - r e n e w a l by those m e n t i o n e d
previously, for whom membership was a symbolic gesture, resulted
in a drop in membership to 18,000 and reduced gates.

D u r i n g Leag ue m a t c he s under the home fans only rule, the
atmosphere remained entirely peaceful - with no arrests for the
second successive season (there was just one arrest outside the
ground for a drugs offence, unrelated to football).

The statistics indicate a marked difference for Cup fixtures,
when visiting supporters had to be admitted.    During these eight
FA, Littlewoods, and Simod, Cup matches police made five arrests
inside the ground, and 29 elsewhere.    The majority on a single
occasion were well away from the ground itself.

The St. John A m b u l a n c e r ep o r t e d only 39 cases of illness or
accident at the 20 League matches, but reported 21 at the 8 Cup
Ties, including: seve re l a c e r a t i o n to the bac k of the head;
p u n c t u r e wound s in chest; am m o n i a in eyes; n e c k' an d shoulder
injuries to policeman hit by a missile.
Appraisal

a)   The statistics indicate the value of the scheme in terras of
      the fight against hooliganism - the most pressing Droblem
      fac in g football and s o c ie ty in general at this" time.
      Moreover, the police report that known troublemakers who
      were not seen at those matches without visiting supporters,
      returned when visitors were present.

b)   After initial caution, police were able to progressively
      reduce officers at League matches by the end of the 1986/87
      season to a quarter of the previous level.              This caution
      meant Lut on Town's p o l ic e costs per head of atten da nc e
      remained the First Division's highest that year.              However,
      in 1987/88, and despite increased hourly charges, Luton Town
      paid less than £32,000 for policing 20 League matches.              This
      c o mp ar ed to pe a k ex p e n d i t u r e of more than £ 7 6, 00 0 in
      1985/86.

c)   Those police released from football duty have been deployed
      elsewhere in the county, to the benefit of the community in
      general.

d)   D e s p i t e technical d if f i c u l t i e s r e su lt in g in occas io n al
      delays to admission, and occasional c o m pl ai nt s about a
      change in match atmosphere, there is no indication                      that
      supporters wish a return of rival supporters on a regular
      basis.       Indeed, there is no evidence that Luton supporters
      are themselves more willing to regulate                     behaviour within
      the crowd and to complain about foul language or other anti­
      social activity.

e)   The residential and shopping streets closely surrounding the
     ground c on ti nu e to e nj o y their return to n o r m a l i t y on
     matchaays.      Householders no longer fear assault or damaged
     property.      Retailers do not need to close up and, in fact,
     a r e a b l e to p u t ou t p a v e m e n t d i s p l a y s . The nearby
      secretarial college was able to re-open its Saturday courses
     b e c au se the girl students no longer felt f ri gh te n ed and
     harassed.     Publicans are able to trade normally.

f)   The town's major shopping centre initially reported a 40 per
     cent increase in trade, and continues to e nj o y normal
     Saturday shopping.

g)   The computerised membership list allows the Club to maintain
      individual contact with its supporters, to carry out opinion
      surveys and p e r s o n a l i s e d mailshots. A m e m b e r s h i p card
     engenders a close, personal affiliation between supporter
     and Club and man y compan ie s have been pr e p a r e d to offer
     discounts to card carriers.
h)   Local business is now more closely               involved with the Club
      through both local sponsorship and corporate entertaining.
      This is a direct result of the efforts "made by the Club to
      r e m o v e the b u r d e n of S a t u r d a y h o o l i g a n i s m f r o m the
      community.

i)   The new public perception of total safety has assisted our
      programme of community involvement.    In particular, many
      teachers have said they were only prepared to bring school
      parties to matches because of the membership scheme.

j)   The membership scheme has also led to a compete turnaround
      in relationships with the local authority. A few years ago,
      as a direct result of hooliganism, the council viewed the
      Club's presence in the town with distaste and trepidation.
      Now Luton Council is instrumental in moves to secure our
      long term future.

In Conclusion

Controlled admission through membership has some disadvantages.
The Club's investment in equipment and administration, together
with its loss of income from visitors are considerable, while
l a w - a b i d i n g football s u p p o r t e r s suffer some inconvenience.
However, the benefits to Luton Town FC and the local community,
with which the Club must co-exist, cannot be denied.

□ear Mr. 9palding,




uje met during the European Conference on Football Uiolence in April 1987,
but I d o n ’t blame you if you d o n ’t remember me. I am the Dutch scientist
studying Cfootball) crowds by direct observation. At the moment. I am in
the Final stage of my research, busy writing my report. In this report For
the Dutch Ministries of Justice andithe Interior I would like to refer to
the very interesting remarks you made concerning the situation in Luton.
If I remember correctly your comments were as follows:

Following the introduction of the membership scheme by which away fans
were excluded from visiting matches in Luton
- violent confrontations between fan groups ceased to occur;
- Luton groups of violent-prone fans desintegrated;
- on match-days, people do not avoid going into the city centre or
shopping area anymore;
- no displacement of violent outbursts could be noticed.

Could you please let me know whether
- my memory is correct in this respect;
- I may quote you.

I would be very grateful for your reply and for any additional information
you might have concerning effects of the ’’Luton approach".


Yours sincerely,

     Dr. Otto Adang,
     Sweelincklaan 3,
     6815 BH ARNHEM,
     The Netherlands.




     Dear Dr. Adang,


     Thank you for your letter dated the 1st November,   1989 concerning
     the Luton Football Club.

     Enclosed is a paper which was prepared after the first season of
     the new policy.    I have not updated the paper, since the situation
     remains the same.    We are now enjoying the fourth season of First
     Division Football under the new policy and I am pleased to report
     that there have still been no incidents or hooligan-related arrests
     in the whole of the period concerned.   The policy at Luton is over­
     whelmingly supported by the Local Authority, commerce and industry,
     the public as a whole and the Police and yet it has not been adopted
     elsewhere in the United Kingdom, because it remains unpopular with
     the football industry.

     The facts that you recall from the European Conference are correct
     and remain correct and I certainly have no objections to those facts
     or those included in the enclosed paper being quoted.

     Best wishes with your research.


     Yours sincerely,




     G. SPALDING,
     Acting Assistant Chief Constable.
                   THE: LUTON TOWN      F.C. EXPERIENCE




      Fo llowing serious public disorder especially            prior, d u r i n g and

af te r a home match      against Millwall in March 1985,      Luton    T o w n Football

Clu b recognised the need to combat the hooligan element.                    Th at

p a r tic ul ar match,   attended by over 8,000 Millwall su p p o r t e r s      (some

3, 00 0 more than the Club's average home attendance)            r es ul ted     in 47

pe op l e including 33 Police officers being injured and a to ta l of

£2 5,000 worth of damage in and outside the ground.               A dd i t i o n a l l y

Br i t i s h Rail estimated damage to trains on that night, a m o u n t e d to

£45,000.




      Three hundred       and sixty Police officers were eith er on duty or

w e r e called out to deal with the disorder.




       Although hundreds of persons were involved,           due to the p res su re

placed on the Police, only 2b arrests were made.               Law a bi di ng

sup po rte rs and many people in the town were put in e x tr em e fear.




       Following a series of consultations between Luton T ow n F.C.                       and

the Police,     the Home Only Supporters Scheme was born.




The Scheme




       The intention of the scheme was that no admittance to the ground

wou l d be permitted except for Luton supporters,           their guests,          plus

directors,     officials and bona fide guests of visiting team players.




                                                                       /Contd.
     It was hoped this would lead to an increase in heme s up po rt which

wo u l d off se t the loss in income from visiting supporters and that

po li c i n g costs could be lower as a result of manpower reductions.            A

m e m b e r s h i p scheme was devised which involved the issue o f a personal

i de ntity card upon which was printed a computer bar code.            Ca r d s we re

not issued personally but were sent by post to increase the l ik elihood

of the authenticity of the application.           Entry to the g r o u n d was to be

obt a i n e d only through computerised turnstiles and the s y s t e m was

des i g n e d to identify the card holder,    the point of entry and therefore

the area of the ground to be used.           The scheme received wi de publicity

in the media,   nationally and locally.         All football clubs were

inf or me d and notices were displayed at railway and bus stations.




     M e m b e r s were to be permitted to invite up to 3 guests to atte nd a

mat ch but applications for these guest tickets were to be m a d e at least

24 hours befo re kick-off.       All members were told that they were

r es po ns ib le for the behaviour of their guests and that m i s c o n d u c t by a

guest could lead to membership cancellation.




      Some instances have occurred of Away supporters a t t e mpt in g to

attend matches but such- attempts have been rare and have oft en resulted

in the person failing to gain entry to the ground or being subsequ ent ly

identified and ejected in accordance with the terms of the Ground

Saf et y Certificate.




                                                                   /Contd.
     Physical segregation of spectators is now no longer necessary.

This has not caused any problems and there may be a potential benefit,

should some emergency occur requiring the evacuation from a section or

the whole of the ground.




The Apparent Results




     Duri n g the 1984/5 season 190 persons were arrested for offences

directly related to football fixtures.      In the 1985/6 season in spite

of an increased presence of Police officers, the number was 102.         In

1986/7 there were no arrests    and no reported assaults on either members

of the public or upon Police    officers.




     From the inception of the new policy it was noticeable that groups

of youths who in previous seasons had gathered with the apparent motive

of attacking visiting supporters, ceased to congregate in Luton.        These

youths had in the past rarely attended football matches but during the

game tended to drift into shopping areas and cause disruption and fear

to shoppers.




     In confirmation of the Police perceptions,    it is interesting to

note that during the 85/86 season 97 persons were treated by St. John

Ambulance Brigade officers at Luton home matches, many later receiving

hospital treatment.    During   the 1986/87 season, the St.    John Ambulance

Brigade did not treat anyone    within the football    ground for aserious

injury.   28 persons received treatment but none as a result of a

violent incident.




                                                              /Contd.
Manpower Requirements and Cost




     During 1985/86, 3,308 Police officers were required to perform

duty at the 18 Home League fixtures, an average of 183.77 officers per

match.   The net cost of this operation to the Police Authority after

deducting charges made to the Club, was in excess of £84,000 to which

must be added nearly £20,000 incurred'in policing Cup matches.




     The first three matches under the new system had to be heavily

policed to combat the potentially unknown situation of visiting team

supporters who might attend in anticipation of beating the system.        As

it happens only a few arrived in Luton.      Police attendance was then

gradually reduced in four separate phases.     For the last three matches

of the 1986/87 season only 50, 50 and 69 Police officers were on duty

at the ground and in the town.    These reductions were planned prior to

match days but in addition, Operational Commanders released personnel

shortly after kick-off to complete their tours of duty in their normal

locations.    Therefore during 1986/87 2417 Police officers were

required to perform duty at 18 Home League Fixtures, an average of

134.27 officers per game.     The net cost to the Police Authority and

rate payers has reduced from £104,000 to just over £32,000, a saving in

excess of £72,000 over the previous season.    There has also been a

saving in the reduction of the number of vehicles used and this saving

it is believed has been reflected in an improved service to the

community.


                                                    /Co n t d ....
     With reduced tension in the stadium, football club stewards have

been able to take on a more effective role and havo no longer had to

avoid areas of confrontation, which have ceased to exist.             This year

stewards have controlled a well-behaved crowd leaving the Police to

cover potentially vulnerable areas where visiting fans might attempt to

penetrate the system.




Trading Benefits




     Unlike previous seasons, complaints of assaults, damage, rowdyism,

and theft in the immediate- area of the football club and the town

centre itself have been negligible.




     The total crime recorded which can be directly related to the

Home Football fixtures for the 1986/87 season amounts to two cases of

theft from motor vehicles.      There were no offences of assault.




     One retail outlet for example, reports an increase in trade of up

to 40%.      During previous seasons the Police sought the co-operation of

licensees to either close or provide door security at public houses in

the vicinity of the ground.      This has not been necessary during

1986/87 and local licensees report increased takings and an absence of

problems.




Conclusions




     The first season of the new Away Supporters Scheme at Luton Town

Football Club has been a success as far as Bedfordshire Police is

concerned.      A calmness has returned to the town on home match days




                                                       /C o n t d .

      and citizens   are no. longer afraid to shop in the town.     Families are

      returning   to watch the football.    At a joint press conference it     has

      been announced that the experiment should continue for a further

      season in respect of Football League Matches.




6.1          Those who are concerned in reducing the level of hooliganism at

      football grounds should study the Luton initiative in greater detail

      and examine the facts which I believe speak for themselves:-




      FACT 1         In the 1984/85 season there were 190 and in 1985/86

                     season there were 102 football related arrests.      During

                     the 1986/87 season there were none.




      FACT 2         There-were no ejections from the ground for disorderly

                     behaviour.




      FACT 3         There was an absence of obscene chanting by spectators.




      FACT   L       There was no segregation of spectators, nor barriers

                     preventing them from getting on to the pitch.




      FACT 5         Parents and children attended in safety.




      FACT 6         Attendance was only marginally lower than in previous

                     years.




      FACT 7         There were no reports of criminal damage which could be

                     described as football related.




                                                                  /Contd ___




                                                                                     j
FACT S     There'was no displacement of hooliganism in the vicinity

           of the ground or elsewhere in the town.




FACT 9     There were no cases of street robbery or robberies

           committed against shopkeepers in the vicinity of the

           ground.




FACT 10    There were only two cases of theft from motor vehicles

           which could be described as football related.




FACT 11    The holders of local liquor licenses were no longer under

           pressure to close their premises.




FACT 12    Local residents and shopkeepers no longer lived in a state

           of tension.




FACT 13    The fears of attack upon shoppers by gangs of hooligans in

           the town centre disappeared.




FACT 14    Numbers of Police officers deployed at the ground and its

           surroundings were gradually reduced to a quarter what it

           had been the previous season.




FACT 15    The remainder of the county was better policed.




 FACT 16   Approximately £70,000 was saved in policing costs.




                                                     /Contd.
        Ic has been acknowledged throughout with genuine regret that

hundreds of well behaved supporters were penalised by this scheme.         It

is hoped that eventually Away fans can*be introduced but it is believed

it is    zoo early   yet to run the risk of jeopardising the scheme with

such a variation at this time.




        In my opinion the benefits outweigh the disadvantages to such a

degree that it is incredible that anyone with a genuine wish to

eradicate football hooliganism could ignore the Luton experience.

Sear feUow-Laton Town fan,
M ay I, as p re sid en t of the new Luton,
T o m Supporters Club, take the liberty of
congratulating you on supporting the b est
team in the land.
Form ed only last autumn, w e are still in
our infancy, but w e have already enjoyed
sev eral splen did functions and have
m ade our p re s e n c e felt within Luton
Town FC. T here has b e e n a series of
m eetings at the Club with guest speakers
and discussions and most recently, of           O ur ticket office team: (left to right) M ark
c o u rse w e held our superbly-success& l      Burnage, C h erry N ew bery (Ticket
first end-of-season presentation night.         Supervisor), Sallyanne B edw ard and
I think everyone enjoyed that very much         Simon Crathorn.
indeed, particularly all the players and
staff from the club who w e re our guests
for th e evening. It was a night which fully
I c /s ^ u p to our am bitions of providing a
I       lin k b e tw ee n the club and the
p iu /S is and the fans.
The club in turn are helping us to try and
find a home for the future so that as w e
grow and gam in num bers - which w e
have done rapidly u n d e r the guidance of
chairperson Pam Gray - w e can hold our
m eetings in our own perm anen t base.
W e would also like to set u p satellite
clubs withm the Hatters’ catchm ent area
and to help in the arrangem ent and
provision of transport for fans in these
outlying areas. This would help us in one
of our other aims which is to boost
attendances at Kenilworth Road,
Another thing w e a re looking at is the
possibility of a 'park-and-nde' schem e on
m atch days. This w ould b e terrific for
those who drive in and find it difficult to
p ark and would again help to increase the
crow ds supporting the team in action.
The authorities are going to b e consulted
on this idea.
Clearly, with so much already going on
and so much m ore to do, th e re is every
re a so n for all H atters fans to join the
Supporters Club. It is a sure way of
keeping in touch with everything and not
missing out w hen the really big events
com e along.                                        Ticket.
Join me...and I look forward to seeing you          Office
at one of our next meetings.

Yours in football,
NICK OWEN

1.                         INTRODUCTION




Following serious public disorder prior, during and after a hone

match against Millwall in March 1985, Luton Town Football Club

earnestly considered ways in which they could combat the hooligan

element who attended their heme football fixtures.



The visit of Millwall produced what was possibly the most serious

incidence of disorder connected with a match in this country.    Over

8,000 Millwall followers, sore 3,000 more than the Club's average

home attendance travelled, ta Luton. It became obvious from their
                  *                _•1
early arrival and behaviour that a larger number of these people

were intending to cause as much trouble as possible for both the

Police and local population.



The violence and disorder has been well recorded and viewed by

the majority of people in the country on a number of occasions

over the last 18 months.   At the end of it, 47 pecple, including

33 Police Officers, had been injured, damage inside the ground

is estimated at £15,000, an estimated £10,000 worth of damage

was caused to property outside the ground.   British Rail estimate

damage to trains returning Millwall followers from Luton to London

to be £45,000.



In addition to these costs, allowance has to be made for 360 Police

Officers who were either on duty or were called out to Police the

situation.
Although hundreds of persons were involved in the disturbance
         \                      •• '                  i


only 24 arrests were made due to the pressure placed on the Police

to protect the ordinary people of Luton.     Some Luton supporters

left the ground well before the end of the match through fear.

Those who remained did so long after the final whistle, afraid

to leave while the Millwall fans remained in the area.



Thg Luton Town Chairman and Board of Directors were determined

that scenes which occurred* that nightwould not happen again at

Luton.       After consultation with other   bodies       outside football,

and in particular with the full co-operation      ofthe Police, the

hone only supporters scheme was- bom.
2.                            THE SCHEME



Intention      ,                                  •

To provide facilities at all hone matches for Luton supporters

and their guests only.   No away supporters would be admitted except

for the Directors, Club Officials and bona fide guests of the

visiting team players, far which 50 complimentary tickets would
                                                                   \
be issued and these guests would be seated in the wing section

of the main stand.



It was anticipated by Luton Club Officials that the home support

would increase and offset the income provided by the visiting

supporters in previous seasons, together with lower costs for

Police manpower present at matches.



Operation

Persons living in an area around Luton, designated the catchment

area (Appendix A) or persons who live in other parts of the country

who could prove they were genuine Luton Supporters were invited to

apply for membership of the Club.     The cost of the application was

£1.   On receipt of the application the Club issued a membership

identity card on which an individual identity number and computer

bar code was printed.    This card was posted to the applicants

address to ensure the authenticity of the application.     The member­

ship card only permits entry to the ground through computerised

turnstiles, admission payments are made once entry to the ground

has been approved via the computer. Season ticket holders and

patrons of the executive boxes enter by separate turnstiles.
Prior to the commencement of the no away supporters rule

on the 16th August 1986, Club Officials took the opportunity

at all times to publicise the ruling through the media both

nationally and locally.     At railway and 'bus stations affecting

all first division clubs, posters were displayed advising

football fans of the ban.
                                                                \




Members may invite up to three guests to attend a match.

Application for these tickets must be made at least 24 hours

before the date of the match in question.    Members applying

for guest tickets are responsible for the guests behaviour.
                 ?.»     *
Misconduct by a guest could lead to the cancellation of the

members registration.

                                                      4



Although not inpossible for away supporters to attend matches,

the number attempting to do so has been minimal.     Those identified

by Police are shown in Appendix 'J '.    These persons were prevented

from entering the ground, or were identified and ejected in accor­

dance with the ground safety certificate.     There are no facilities

for segregation of supporters, except those guests of visiting

officials and players.    The scheme has made it possible to completely

remove the fencing at one end of the ground, which has now been made

into a fully seated area.     At the opposite end, a standing terrace,

the height of the fencing has been substantially reduced, in contrast

with a number of other grounds where the height of the fencing is

being increased.   This fence is now the only one in existence at

Luton's ground.

Attendance

Figures for 1985/86 and 1986/87 are shown in Appendices 'D' and

'E'. These show that there was not a significant reduction in

overall attendance resulting from the introduction of the scheme.
                ’     POLICING THE NO AWAY SUPPORTERS POLICY

3.    ADVANTAGES - POLICE


3.1   LESS PUBLIC DISORDER AND CRIME



      During the season 1984/85, which included the Millwall match,

      there were 190 persons arrested for offences which were directly

      related to football fixtures when Luton hone matches were played.
                                                                      *


       In the 1985/86 season 102 arrests were made, these were right

       across the spectrum of offences, from serious assaults to

       obstruction.    In addition to these figures there were 68 incidents

       in 1985/86 which were related to the home match but did not result

       in offenders being arrested.    Some of these incidents caused injury

       to Police Officers and members of the public.    A breakdown of these

       figures is shown in Appendix 'B'.    IN 1986/87 THERE HAVE BEEN NO

       ARRESTS, NO INCIDENTS AND NO ASSAULTS ON THE PUBLIC OR POLICE.

       Fran the outset of the new policy it became noticeable that groups

       of youths, who in previous seasons had gathered with the sole motive

       of attacking visiting supporters, ceased to exist in Luton.        These

       youths rarely went to the football matches;     during the game they

       tended to drift into the local shopping centre.. Reports received

       by the Football Intelligence Officer at Luton show that a small

       number of these youths have attended matches in London on Luton

       Town horns match days.   It is also known that a few of these youths

       do attend Luton away fixtures and have been involved in violent

       incidents either before or after the match.     (See attached report

       Luton News 16th April 1987, Appendix 'L').    Arrests made at home

       football matches from 1980 to 1987 are shown in Appendix 'K'.



       Records maintained by the St. John Ambulance who are in attendance
                                   7




     at all Luton home fetches, show that 97 persons were treated by

     their officers in the 1985/86 season.    Many of the injuries were

     serious cuts, believed caused by coins being thrown, persons being

     knocked unconscious following disorder between rival supporters and

     in one case anrnonia being sprayed into the face of a person attending

     a match.    Many required hospital treatment following initial first

     aid.   THROUGHOUT THE 1986/87 SEASON THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERIOUS

     INJURIES.    St. John Ambulance personnel have treated 28 cases of

     a minor nature.    None of which can be attributed to a violent,

     incident but fall into the category of fainting and sprains,

     which are to be expected at any large gathering of people.



.2   LOWER MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS AND COST
                             i          —
                     *


     For the 1985/86 season 3308 Police Officers were required to perform

     duty at the 21 Luton Town home league fixtures.     An average of 125.71

     Officers per match.    The net cost of this operation to the Police

     Authority after deducting charges made to the Club was £84,683.87.

     Added to this was £19,760.27 incurred in policing six F.A. Cup

      and Football League Cup fixtures.    A total of £104,444.14.   In

      addition to these costs it was necessary to hire a bus to bring

      Officers from outside the Division to perform duty at Luton, and

      there were running costs for an average of 6 support vans at each

      fixture.

      The first three matches in the 1986/87 season for the visit of

      Southampton, Newcastle and Arsenal, were manpower intensive (250

      Officers being on duty for each match) following press reports that

      visiting team supporters had obtained membership cards or intended

      to attend the match without cards.     These reports were unfounded and

      very few visiting supporters arrived in Luton.     Appendix 'J' shows
                                       - 8 -




      the number of visiting supporters identified by Police arriving

      in Luton for the whole season.

      Following the success of the initial three home matches the Policing

      operation was scaled down, with caution, for the next four matches.

      Since these matches the Police commitment has been reduced in three

      further phases.    For the last three matches against Coventry,

      Sheffield Wednesday and Oxford, 50, 50 and 69 Officers were on duty

      respectively.     These are total figures for the whole police operation.

      Numbers of Officers actually inside the ground are minimal.          Appendix 'F'

      gives visual display of the reduced manpower level working through

      phases 1 - 5 .    The ratio of spectators per Police Officer on duty for

      both seasons in comparable matches is shown in Appendix 'H'. Fran the

      fifth match it has been possible to reduce the manpower even further

      after kick-off time.     The number of Officers retained on football duty

      following the reduction is shown in Appendix 'G'. The Officers stood

      down have returned to their own Division to complete their tour of duty.


      With the reduction of Officers on duty during the 1986/87 season, net

      cost to the Police Authority and ratepayers has reduced to £32,070.87,

      a saving of £72,373.27 over 1985/86.     See Appendix 'I'.        There has

      also been a saving by the reduction of the number of support vehicles

      being used, and following the scaling down of. manpower      tihe   cancellation

       of the 'bus to transport Officers from outside Luton.       There has never

      been a separate budget for policing football matches and this saving

       is reflected in an irrproved service to the conrcnunity.



3.3    L.T.F.C. - STEWARDS                                          (



       With the decrease in Police manpower it has been seen tljat the match

       stewards appointed by Luton Town Football Club have taken more
responsibility.    They were given training before the comencement

of the season by the Police and they have been more positive in

their actions.    Last season, 1985/86, it was anticipated that often

when most required, the stewards moved away from areas of possible

trouble, in particular areas where visiting supporters were housed.

This year they have controlled the crowd, leaving the Police to

cover more vulnerable areas where visiting fans may attempt to

penetrate the system.

4.    ADVANTAGES- - PUBLIC/TRADE

4.1   LESS CRIME AND DAMAGE



      Luton Town Football ground is. located in a residential area to the

      west of the town centre. The main A505, Luton to Dunstable Road
                     i
      is the main approach, and this contains a busy shopping centre.

      The majority of houses and shops are owned by members of the

      ethnic minority corrmunity, mainly of Asian origin.    Prior to'the no

      away supporters scheme both housing and shops were regularly

      subjected to acts of criminal damage, particularly broken windows.

      These offences were often not reported to the Police and very rarely

      were offenders detected or arrested.     Store owners were subject of

      harassment from groups of supporters and acts of pilfering took place.

      Some store managers/owners employed additional staff1,to act as

      security to prevent the theft of more expensive items on horns match

      days. The occupiers of premises in a small open air shopping precinct

      adjacent to the A505 road reported that teenage Luton supporters

      gathered in the loading areas of the precinct to attempt an ambush

      on away supporters walking through without a Police escort.

      The main shopping area in the town centre, the 'Amdale Centre', a

      large covered precinct was constantly the focus of atte ' '     for

      young away fans, who were aware that this area was a meeting place

      for Luton fans.     The Amdale Management and shop proprietors were

      concerned about the effect football matches had on trade.      It was

      noticeable that Saturday afternoon shopping was greatly reduced on

      match days;      local people leaving the area to shop in other nearby

      towns to avoid the risk of any confrontation between rival supporters.



4,2   TRADING BENEFITS

       Throughout the 1986/87 season, there have been no reports of damage

or theft which can be attributed to football supporters,

and the possibility of violent confrontation between rival groups

has been eliminated.

Since the away supporters ban was imposed the local residents and

shops have benefited.    ONE OWNER REPORTS AN INCREASE IN TRADE OF

UP TO 40%.* RESIDENTS NO LONGER FEAR FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY OR THE

POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO THEIR PROPERTY.

Some comments from the local traders and residents are as follows

Arndale Management      "We no longer worry when football matches are

played, in fact we do not now know when Luton are at home.       We are

unable to comment on increase in trade by the shops, but there is

a definite increase in persons using the Centre on Saturday

over the whole day as opposed to shopping in the morning.       No more

problems with supporters entering shops and causing disruption, no

problems of smashed windows etc. as before"

National Electrical Store       "No longer have to be alert and worried

about problems or put barriers up at windows"

Fast Food Chain      "Takings up 30-40% because families attending

football and coming in to eat.       Other stores in our chkiri have to

shut for an hour after football, e.g. Leicester, this is not a

problem in Luton.    Now people seem to stay in the area after the

match as opposed to leaving early to get away from possible trouble"

Selection from Asian Shop Proprietors        "People leave match and stay

 in area to shop.  No further problems with disorderly, youths, no
                                                        i
 need to close down as before ban. Saturdays are enjoyable and no

 longer dreaded by staff.     No further instances of crintirial damage.

 Takings marginally better"
"Takings up 10-15%, all stock can be left out and not taken

inside.    Shutters on windows no longer needed.       More people shop

on Saturday afternoons"

"People shop all day, public no longer comment on having to shop

on Saturday mornings.     We no longer have to close shop or have

damage caused"


During the previous seasons it was necessary for the Police to seek

the co-operation of licensees to either close or provide door

security at Public Houses in the vicinity of the ground in an attempt

to prevent supporters attending the match worse for drink.        This

has not been necessary during 1986/87 and the local licensing trade

report increased takings and far better atmosphere amongst their

clientele. •        * '

DISADVANTAGES - POLICE



COMPLACENCY

In previous seasons, particularly following the Millwall match in

1985, the Police Officers on duty at football matches were prepared

for and ready to respond innmediately to possible or actual areas

of confrontation and likely trouble caused by football supporters.

With the tranquility that now surrounds Luton heme matches, Senior        '

Officers must be aware of the risk of complacency among the Officers

performing duty at the ground.     It would be so easy to suppose that

incidents even of a minor nature, will not occur and the Officers,

as well as being greatly reduced in numbers, may not be ready to

respond.                                                  1



MEMBERSHIP CARDS                                       ’ ^

Luton Town Membership Cards issued for the season 1^86/87 did not
contain a photograph of the holder.    This caused it to be

difficult to positively identify the holder when circumstances

have required a check to be made.     Recommendations have been

made to have this rectified in future seasons.
CONCLUSION

The first season of the no away supporters scheme at Luton Town

Football Club has been very successful for Bedfordshire Police.

It has not been necessary to deploy any resources to a football

related incident.   The manpower commitment has been greatly reduced

benefitting the Police Service and public.    There is no separate

budget for football therefore the saving in costs to the Police

Authority has been used to service the community.

Crimes, particularly assaults and criminal damage involving

supporters are no longer a cause for concern, particularly among

tjie residents and shop owners in the vicinity of the ground.

A calmness has returned to the town on home match days.     Women are

not afraid to shop in the town and 'families are returning to watch

the football knowing they will not be subject to abuse and obscene

chanting.



Following a report in the Police Review, dated 24th April 1987,

headed "No Solution Since Heysal", the Chief Constable of

Bedfordshire Police, wrote a strongly worded letter to the

publication, expressing his concern over the coverage given to

the Luton Town Scheme and listing sixteen facts in support of

the Football Club and their policy.   Letter reproduced in

Appendix ’M ’.                            ^


In a letter to Luton Town Football Club, written by Chief

Superintendent, Glyn Spalding, Divisional Commander at Luton,
                                                       i
the Bedfordshire Police strongly reconrnended that the policy

of no away supporters should continue, Appendix 'N'.    J



Immediately at the end of the season 1986/87 negotiations
were held between Luton Town Football Club and the Police and

it was agreed to continue with the policy for a further season

in respect of Football League matches.   As a result a joint

press conference involving the Club and Police was held.   Copy

of the press release is shown at Appendix 'O'.



It has been acknowledged throughout with genuine regret that

hundreds of well behaved away supporters are being penalized by

this scheme and from the outset it was hoped that eventually-away

fans could be re-introduced starting in a carefully controlled manner

It would be too early yet to jeopardize the scheme with such a

variation.

THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT

IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT ANYONE WITH A GENUINE WISH TO ERADICATE

HOOLIGANISM COULD IGNORE THE LUTON EXPERIENCE.

Dear Sir,

May I refer to your report in the Police Review dated
24th April 1987, headed, “No Solution Since Heysel"
and express my concern that such scant cover was
given to the initiative taken at Luton, details of
which were presented at the conference by Chief
Superintendent Glyn SPALDING, who is in charge of
the Luton Division of this Force.

You may recall that during the 1984/85 football season,
a serious disturbance occurred at the Luton ground
during a cup fixture against Millwall F.C.  In the
following season, visiting supporters were stabbed
on four separate occasions, either before or following
matches.  A number of police officers also received
serious injuries and there was a great deal of major
public disorder and criminal damage in the town.
Local residents and shopkeepers were consistently
placed in great fear.

To the great credit of Luton Town F.C. and with the
full co-operation of Bedfordshire Police, a 100%
membership scheme and a complete ban on away supporters
was adopted for the 1986/87 season.  With the season
almost at an end, I feel it is time that those of
us who are concerned in reducing the level of hooligan­
ism at football grounds should examine the Luton
initiative in greater detail and not dismiss it as
an unworkable solution.

The following facts speak for themselves    :

FACT 1        In the 1984/85 season there were 190
              and in 1985/86 there were 102 football
              related arrests.  THIS SEASON THERE
              HAVE BEEN NONE.

FACT 2            This season there have been no ejections
                  from the ground for disorderly behaviour.

FACT 3            There has been an absence of obscene
                  chanting by spectators.

FACT 4            There is no segregation of spectators,
                  nor barriers preventing them from getting
                  on to the pitch.

FACT 5            Parents and children now attend in_
                  safety.

FACT 6            Attendance has been only marginally
                  lower than in previous yea r s .

FACT 7            There have been no reports of criminal
                  damage which can be described as football
                  related.

FACT 8            There has been no displacement of
                  hooliganism in the vicinity of'the
                  ground or elsewhere in the town.

FACT 9            There have been no cases of street
                  robbery or robberies committed against
                  shopkeepers in the vicinity of the
                  ground.

FACT 10           There have been only two cases of theft
                  from motor vehicles which can be described
                  as football related.

FACT 11           The holders of local liquor licenses
                  are no longer under pressure to close
                  their premises.

FACT 12           Local residents and shopkeepers no
                  longer live in a state of tension.

FACT 13           The fears of attack upon shoppers
                  by gangs of hooligans in the town centre
                  has disappeared.

FACT 14           Numbers of police officers deployed
                  at the ground and its surroundings
                  has been gradually reduced to a quarter
                  of what it was last season.

FACT 15           The remainder of the county is now
                  better policed.

FACT 16           Approximately £70,000 has been saved
                  in policing costs.


These facts, I believe, speak for themselves and,
whilst it *is acknowledged that many well behaved
visiting supporters are being precluded from following
their team, the initiative taken at Luton Town Football
Club has been such a success that I find it incredible
that anyone with a genuine wish to eradicate hooliganism
from football, should give the Luton scheme such
scant attention.

The Football Club and the Police knew from the outset
that the scheme would attract opposition, but its
implementation has been so successful that ways are
being considered to allow some visiting supporters
to attend, albeit in a carefully controlled manner.

This bold and brave decision by the Football Club
sublimated and profit motive fo'r the love and good
of the game and its spectators.   In my opinion its
imagination and innovation deserves greater recognition.


Yours faithfully,




Chief Constable

Dear Mr. Smith,

At the conclusion of the current football season it is
our intention to make public our views on policing Luton
Town Football Club since the current Hate Only policy
was introduced. However, in view of our forthcoming
discussions on future policies of the Club, it is
appropriate for me to document our feelings at this
stage.

It must be doubtful whether anybody from the Club or fjrom
the Police could have possibly predicted how successful
your scheme would be in terms of preventing football
hooliganism. As you know, there were 102 arrests last
season which we classified as being football related and
the season before there were 190. This season there have
been none. Not only have there been no arrests, the whole
atmosphere at the ground and in the town has been totally
different and there has been no incident of any consequence
on any match day. There have been no assaults on Police
and no assaults on supporters. In the previous season
there had been serious assaults in both categories. Local
traders ranging from the small shopkeeper in Bury Park to
the major store managers in the Arndale Centre and publicans
throughout the town have been glowing in their praise of the
system. Some of the major stores have claimed an increase
in match day trade of as much as 40%. Whilst I- cannot
confirm or deny this level of increased trade, it is beyond
doubt that a very significant increase has occurred in the
number of shoppers coming to Luton town centre on match days.
The majority of trouble that we used to experience was caused
by youths who rarely actually went to the football matches
and yet their motive was to cause trouble, and in particular
to attack away supporters. This pattern of behaviour gave
them a reason for existing. Because this reason has been
removed, the gangs have disintegrated completely and as a
result Luton is a better place seven days a week not just
on match days.                                             1

We are conscious that because of our joint determination tihat




                                                                 /Cont'd.
Mr. J. R. Smith                                  19th March 1987


the scheme would get off to a good start policing costs were
high in the early days. Since then we have been able to
reduce the manpower levels three times and have every
confidence that further reductions are still possible. You
are now benefitting from a saving in Police charges and so
is the Police Service itself. Our budget has never provided
any additional finance for policing football matches and
therefore the money now being saved can be used to provide
other Police services to the conrnunity. Whilst it cannot
be denied that the majority of travelling football fans are
decent, well behaved members of society, it is an unfortunate
fact that even the well behaved were liable to attack from •
local hooligans. The decent away supporter is certainly
penalized by current policy but when one bears in mind that
the Luton fans feel more comfortable and safe on match days
and a growing number of people are gradually gaining the
confidence to cote back to football, there can be no doubt
that as far as the public as a whole are concerned the
advantages of your policy far outweigh any disadvantages.

From these comments it must be clear that the Bedfordshire
Police would be pleased to see your current policy continuing
in the future.

Yours sincerely,




G. Spalding
Chief Superintendent

                   PRESS RELEASE


         FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM - THE LUTON SOLUTION


     In the 1984/85 season Luton was subjected to the infamous
Millwall fixture and riot. In the following season visiting
fans were stabbed on four different occasions either before or
after matches. A number of Police Officers also received serious
injuries as a result of assaults. When Luton hosted Manchester
United in the same season there was serious disorder and criminal
damage in the town.

     This was the situation before Luton Town Football Club, with
full agreement of the local Police, adopted a 100% membership
scheme and a complete ban on away supporters for the current .season.
Many individuals and organisations were opposed to the principle of
the scheme and sceptical about the possibility of enforcing the
restrictions. The scheme has now been in operation for a full season
and it is time that.those with a genuine interest in this problem took
note of the effects of this experiment.

     A variety of factors influence arrest statistics but the
following.information cannot be ignored.

      IN THE 1984/85 SEASON THERE WERE 190 ARRESTS in Luton recorded
as being football related. There were 102 in the 1985/85 season.
THIS SEASON THERE HAVE BEEN NONE. Not only have there been no
arrests, there have not been any incidents which have looked
remotely as if they would result in an arrest. There have been
NO ASSAULTS ON THE POLICE, NOR ANY ATTACKS or interference with
ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC whether football fan or not. There has
NOT BEEN ONE REPORT OF CRIMINAL DAMAGE in the town in relation
to football matches. It was widely suggested that if the scheme
successfully prevented football hooliganism it was inevitable
that the violence and disorder would be displaced. Quite the opposite
has been the case. The majority of Luton's public order problems
were initiated by a loosely knit crowd of local youths. Their
one established reason for existence was to create problems on
football match days. By removing the away fans, who were their
targets, they lost their reason for being and disintegrated.
Not only has the experiment resulted in a more orderly town on
football match days, it has without doubt had a beneficial effect
every day of the week. Through the fear of attack or at least
intimidation by large groups of youths, shoppers by the thousand
were fearful of attending Luton's main shopping precinct on a match
day. This is no longer the case and an area that already measured
customers in tens of thousands report an INCREASE IN TRADE on match
days of up to 40%. Local PUBLICANS NO LONGER HAVE TO make the
decision whether to CLOSE and lose trade or to take the risk of
havoc being created in their bars. The area surrounding the football
club is inhabited predominately by residents of ethnic minority
origin. They no longer live in a state of tension on Saturday
afternoons and shop-keepers can be seen standing at the entrance of
 their premises as the crowds leave the ground savouring the new
relaxed atmosphere. Most important of all is the fact that LUTON's
 POPULATION of 170,000 NO LONGER FEEL IN ANY WAY RESTRICTED THROUGH
 THE THREAT THAT USED TO BE APPARENT IN THE TOWN ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

                               -2-

         Initially, policing levels were high with the full agreement
    of the Club in anticipation that some away fans would attenpt to
    beat the system. Although there have been isolated half-hearted
    attempts by a few away supporters, these attenpts have been of no
    real significance. The effectiveness of the whole policy has been
    such that POLICE MANPOWER LEVELS HAVE BEEN REDUCED FOUR TIMES since
    the start of the season. The latest matches have been policed with
    less than a third of the Officers involved in the identical fixtures
    in the previous season. Despite the early high levels of policing,
    the net savings to the Police after taking into account the charges
    to the Club will amount to approximately £70,000. Since there is no
    separate budget for policing football matches, this represents an
    ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC in
    other ways. This applies to the whole county and one effect is more
    Police resources to tackle our main objective this year which is to
    reduce the number of domestic burglaries. The charges to the football
    club are also reduced. If the experience of this season is repeated
    in the next then even greater savings will be made, particularly by
    the football club.

         It has been acknowledged throughout with genuine regret that
    hundreds of well behaved away supporters are being penalized by
    this scheme and from the outset it was hoped that eventually away
    fans could be re-introduced starting in a carefully controlled manner.
    It would be too early yet to jeopardize the scheme with such a
    variation.

         The whole caimunity of Luton has benefitted from this radical
    initiative although it is probable that many have still not regained
    the confidence to come into the Town Centre on match days. This is
    also reflected in the fact that attendances at matches have not been
    as great as had been hoped for. Unless the local community give
    support the Club are paying financially for their achievement for
    the community and eventually this could put the schema at risk.

         THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES TO SUCH A DEGREE
    THAT IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT ANYONE WITH A GENUINE WISH TO ERADICATE
    HOOLIGANISM COULD IGNORE THE LUTON EXPERIENCE.

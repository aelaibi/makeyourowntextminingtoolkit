                 At 9.45 am on Saturday,                     15 April   1989,    I attended at Hillsborough

                  seats      167 and 178 where               I carried out a check of the personnel who

                  briefing was carried out by a number of senior officers                         including

                 Chief Superintendent D U C K E N F 1 E L D , Superintendent MURRAY and Inspector

                  SEWELL who all                  spoke on a dedicated public address system to the

                  assembled duty team.                    A detailed briefing took place covering.the

                  general aspects of crowd safety and logistical arrangements.                               Further
information aboofctrtclividual aspects of the              two groups of visiting

supporters and their behaviour               was given by Detect ive Sergeant

C B A R L E S W Q R T H , Divisional Crime   Intelligence Officer.

I have served as a Sergeant at               *P * Division for eight years and five

months awd have attended many such occasions.                 I would estimate that

I have performed duty at the ground at well                in excess of 150 football

matches during my service,            including a number of semi-finals.              I have

been in charge of serials engaged on various duties                  in all       parts of

the gound and have an overall wide and varied experience of all

aspects of crowd control at Hil lsborough Stadium.                There     is no doubt

in my mind that the system of crowd control which has evolved over

many years at the gorund,            is one of the most efficient and well                tried

in the country.         There have been problems of public disorder which I

can personally       remember over the y e a r s , but we have always             coped

admirably.                                                                    \

After    the initial     briefing,      I collected snack meals for my serial*

from the gymnasium,         returned to the North Stand and distributed the

meals to my officers.           At this point     I liaised with my Sector

Commander,      Inspector SYKES and arranged to rendezvous with him in the

enclosure behind the West Stand at              11.00 am for a further mure

detailed briefing by him,            regarding the specific duties of my s e r i a l .

I instructed officers under my command regarding ktae i r conduct and

individual      roles during the forthcoming afternoon.                 ^

At 11.00 am as arranged,           I went with my serials to the enclosure at

the   rear of the West Stand, where            I met   Inspector SYKES.       The Officer

spoke to members of his sector about the task                in hand,   including

evacuation procedures and their search duties at thfe turnstiles.                           My

serial were      responsible for turnstiles 9 to 16 of entrances                   "A * and

"C ' which provide access to the North Stand and the West Stand.

Their    brief was to ensure that spectators entering the ground did not
possess    items prohibited by the ground rules,        such as weapons,

banners,    missiles and alcohol.     They were to maintain order,       ensure

orderly queues were formed and give advice and assistance to

spectators where possible.     All were    provided with labels and black

plastic bin liners for property which they confiscated and plastic

dustbins were provided at each of the turnstiles for this purpose.                 I

noted that there was a police property post located in a caravan in
                                                                                  ■‘
                                                                                   ■si
the enclosure behind the West S t a n d , together with other cabins for

the sale of match programmes,       souvenirs and refreshments.

Officers of Serial    18 were retained in this area initially,          on

standby,    prior to the build up of supporters.         They were   instructed

on the appearance of the tickets which would be produced at that end

of the ground,    primarily brown coloured ones for the North Stand,           red

for the West Stand seats and purple for the West Stand t e r r a c e s . .

They were deployed on their points at approximately           11.30 am and all           ,

the turnstiles we re open by 18 noon.

There was some activity outside with early arrivals and I saw th-at

Police hprses were deployed on the Leppings Lane concourse.              I

remember two coaches     and a double deck South Yorkshire bus arriving

and being off-loaded.     This was apparently contrary to the planned

reception arrangements,    because visiting     coaches were to be unloaded

on Peni stone Road North and Halifax Road.           Nevertheless,   further

coaches,    vans and double-deck buses continued to arrive at Leppings

Lane throughout the early afternoon.         '■,'v

I remember seeing several    people who were the worse for drink arriving

early at the ground.     Many asked for directions to .the nearest

licensed premises,    several were drinking from cans of lager and beer,

Others from large plastic bottles of beer.            I personally advised a

number of people that they would not be admitted to the ground if

thty were    considered to be intoxicated.      The activity of the Leppings
Lane concourse b#cartie busier as the afternoon progressed.                There was

a lot of confusion regarding tickets and entry to the correct part

Of the ground.          t was constantly questioned by people throughout the

afternoon about this problem.

The weather was fine and warm with bright sunshine.                  There was a

happy carnival atmosphere at this stage.             People were purchasing

programmes f r o m vendors outside and numerous         people were eating and

drinking as they milled about.             I noticed that there was an

inordinate volume of litter scattered about at various                 locations

consisting of food wrappers,         tins and empty bottles which people were

discarding all over the area.             Many people were standing about      in

groups waiting to meet friends and making no effort to enter the

ground.          These were being continually dispersed by mounted and foot

off ic e r s .

During the course of the early afternoon,            I remember Police Constable

2902 ROBERTS arresting a ticket tout.             I am not sure of the correct

time,     but believe that this occurred about        1H.30 pm.       This marv was in

his early twenties,         tall and slim with blonde hair.          The officer took

him through concertina gate         "A'   where he detained and spoke to himi

I joined them there prior to the officer taking the man to the Police

Room.       I saw that PC ROBERTS     had taken a large amount of money from

him and eleven or twelve tickets for the Liverpool              end of the

ground.          These were all the purple coloured ones for the terraces and

some discussion took         place with a Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

Official         in that vicinity, as to whether they were forgeries.          I

returned to the turnstiles and rejoined my serial after about ten

mi n u t e s .

I witnessed several         people having    intoxicating   liquor   confiscated

from them by Inspector SYKES and other officers.               These    containers of

alcohol were         placed in the dustbins adjacent to the turnstiles.            CID
officers were present on the concourse on covert observations for

pick“ pockets.

X was approached by numerous       people asking for directions.   It was

evident that several Liverpool       supporters had acquired tickets for

t h C S f i o n H o p terrace and were asking whether they would be admitted

there.     It was pointed out that a section of that end of the ground

had been reserved for that eventuality.

The volume of people entering the ground through the turnstiles which

I was supervising was moderate until approximately E . 10 pm when I was

called away temporarily.       At that time   I was approached by a n off-duty

police officer from Lincolnshire Constabulary and three friends of

his,    two males and a female.    That officer stated that his wallet,

containing £40,00 cash and four football        tickets had been stolen from

his rear trouser     pocket.    I informed Inspector SYKES about the

incident and conducted the Lincolnshire Officer to the gymnasium in.

order that he could report the theft to C1D personnel.         I waited at

that    location until   this had been done and then escorted him and his -} ^

friends back to the rear of the West Stand where I gained them

admission to the terraces.

As I walked along the corridor beneath the North Stand,        making my way

back to the West, Stand and turnstiles,       I distinctly remember hearing

a message on talk-through,      made by Inspector SYKES.    There was a lot

of background noise,     but I heard him ask for more men to be sent to

Leppings Lane urgently.        I only heard the message being passed once

and there was other      radio traffic being passed constantly at that

time.     I had changed my radio battery in the gymnasium whilst       I Was

there,   because   I was having trouble   receiving the signals from Police

Control.     I believe there was a fault,     because I noted that Whenever

they tried to use the radio themselves,       the transmission was broken

and the operator's voice was spasmodic.        Messages from officers on
     the ground v?©re lQUdi and clear on the talk-through facility*              At

   about the same time as this message was passed, I saw Inspector WHITE
/"v/
   and another officer escorting a prisoner along the corridor which I

     was using,    back towards the Police Room and I acknowledged the

     officers.

     On arrival    back there, at about E.30 pm. I was confronted with an

     alarming situation.      The crowd had obviously built up and there was
 ■                      ■                     ,V ':'

     serious congestion outside the turnstiles.              I saw several youths

     climbing over the walls      into the enclosure and this was a new

     experience which I had never before seen.              Police Officers were

     attempting to discourage this and attempting to remove them from the

'*walls«        I looked through the turnstile gates          'A' to ’G* of entrance

     ’B* where    I saw a crush of people outside.           Many were distressed and

     shouting for assistance.        They were screaming for help and many

     appeared to be injured, amongst them women and teenage youths.                   I

     climbed onto one turnstile gate and encouraged them not to push.                     I

     remember youths hav i ng their      legs pushed with considerable force

     against the bars of the turnstiles and they we re obviously in great

     pain.     There was a pandemonium of noise and together with other

     Officers,    amongst whom was Inspector BENNETT,          I attempted to calm the

     situation    inside the enclosure.     I was approached by several men who

     were    clearly angry,   they began to jostle me and grabbed hold of my

     uniform anorak shouting      into my face,        "Do something,   people are

     getting    crushed out there.    Open the gates."         As they spoke I became

     aware of the concertina gate to my left being opened by stewards.

     This was gate    *C’ , I believe,   around the side of the enclosure,

     immediately adjacent to the car park driveway and river.                There were <

     couple of horses outside who were attempting to regulate the flow of

     people being pushed through the opening.             The mood of these people

     appeared to be quite aggressive and it was obvious that many were
intoxicated.     I could smell drink on their breath.        I stood in their

path and attempted to push in the opposite direction, shouting for
     ■■ ■ ' 'V.
order ^nd discouraging their headlong Surge but without success.   I

was thrown aside and saw several      people   lose their feet,   being

trampled by the crowd.     I do not recall any injured being left in

that    location after the surge had subsided.      This was not a dramatic

influx of people but    I believe no more than 200 entered at this time.
                                                                        •-  "V"
1 forced my way outside after the      initial onslaught, where     I joined

colleagues by the side of turnstiles at entrance B.

There was an extremely large crowd of people,        densely packed into the

area in front of the turnstiles.       I would estimate in excess of 4,000.

This area is enclosed by railings and gates at the entrance,          a sheet

steel    fence and concertina gate   *8 ’ on the left,    turnstile walls   in

front and a continuous steel bar on the        right with supports spaced at

regular    intervals along its length.     Together with inspector WHITE

and Inspector PURDY,    I went to the side of this bar and began pulling-

people underneath in order to relieve the pressure.           I also saw

Inspector DELANEY at that location.       We moved dozens of people In

this manner,    pushing them under the bar by their heads.        Women and      ^

youths    in considerable distress were    pulled from the crowd.     Some men

resisted our attempts to rescue them,       fearing that they would lose

their places    in the crowd and be denied entry.        Many were the worse

for drink and unruly,    failing to obey instructions not to push.

As the people    repeatedly surged forwards,    chanting and shouting,      I

heard cries of pain as people were       crushed against the bar and walls ;

of the turnstiles.     Mounted officers    in the middle of this were just

pushed about    in the throng.   At one stage   I saw a horse go down at

the back end,    obviously lifted from its feet by the pressure of

bodies.    There was a very real danger of serious        injury or even death

being    caused in this area.
r recall that youths     continued to climb the walls and fences,          over

into the enclosure at the back of the West Stand and at this Stage I

also saw Inspector BENNETT on top of one of the turnstile walls,

trying to prevent this practice,

I s<|w concertina gate    ’B ’ being opened and after the number of people

had built up on the driveway where         I was standing,   together with

other officers   I took these    people through concertina gate      "C* which

was opened a second time.       I must    point out that people appeared to

be aggressive and   in a state of haste, obviously concerned that            the

game was about to   start before they were able to gain entry.              1 am

quite satisfied that the decision to open the gates           in order to ease

the congestion outside was soundly based and was necessary in the

circumstances.    There was imminent danger of serious         injury to:

supporters throughout that time.

As the crush of people dispersed,         there was a lull   in the situation

outside and 1 was able to rejoin officers of my serial.            The majority

of these were distressed and had obviously been crushed against the

turnstile walls themselves by the sudden influx of supporters.               There

was still a great   many people standing in groups       in Leppings Lane on

the bridge and at   various positions on the concourse.          A lot    of these

looked dejected as though they were         resigned to missing the game.

Suddenly -I heard a radio message being passed by Police Control,

which was   repeated several times.        The voice on the radio was that of

Police Sergeant GODDARD and from his tone         I gained the   impression

that he was upset about something.          He said "All available assistance

onto the perimeter track.       Peo,ple are   invading the pitch".       I believe

he repeated this message several         times.

I immediately alerted members of my serial, who were all           present and

together outside the turnstiles where they had been working.              We all

ran inside through one ;of the turnstiles and made our way round to
■* ■ '
         “tbf:.gate at:; the rear   of the Police Control Box;    I remember that a          {

         ma n had climbed onto      this gate and he was   pulled down bodily to

         facilitate the opening of the gate. He caught the sleeve of the denim

         jacket which he wore,       on one of the spiked railings and damaged the

         material,   at which point he began complaining vehemently.           He was:

         pushed aside and together with the other          police officers,    I ran down

         the first gangway of the South Stand open seated section on my left.

         As I did so I saw Superintendent MURRAY walking towards me*.            His face

         was ashen and he was       obviously deeply shocked,    he said "Do what you

         can."     I made my way    over the wall onto the perimeter track      in front     of

         Leppings Lane terraces.        I witnessed an horrific scene, which I shall

         never forget.     People were being pressed up bodily against         the

         netting of the pen fence at this location.           The pen was bulging under

         the pressure which was being exerted by the crush.           I could see women

         and male youths with their eyes open,       tongues extended through their

         mouths,    their skin was    cyanosed and there were blue coloured arms,           .

         faces and necks,    pressed against the netting.        Some had blOod seeping

         from their mouths and noses which were bubbling with mucus.              Officers

         were frantic    in their efforts to pull    people over the fence and I saw

         several    people escaping by this means.     Others were being pulled onto

         the track through a small gate       in the fence.     I saw people    climbing

         up into the West Stand seated area above the central          pen.     It was

         obvious to me that the people       pressed against the fence at this

         particular section were,       in the majority of cases, already deceased.

         Although they apparently appeared to be standing against the fence,

         their   position was being maintained upright by the unrelenting

         pressure of the spectators behind them.           There were numerous    police

         officers gathered on the pitch and track.           Some were giving first aid

         others attempting to rescue spectators.           I saw some spectators

         climbing over the dividing railings       into the adjacent    pens Or being

1 remained there only a few seconds and during that time                                           lost contact

with members of my serial,                         the majority of whom were busying

themselves tending the injured.                             1 quickly realised that                I would be

able to achieve very 1itt1e if I remained on the track.                                            A lot: of

officers were standing                         looking at the scene in stunned disbelief and I

attempted to motivate some of them.                                     I approached several and ordered

them to follow me.                          Roughly six or seven responded,                  although it was

difficult to communicate above the din.                                     I noted that the main crush

was   in the southern section of the central                                  pen and I decided to enter

that pen from the tunnel at the rear,                                    in an effort to disperse the

■fans by that             route.             I ran back the way I had come and went

immediately to the rear of the West S t a n d .                                I saw that       it was

practically deserted in the enclosure behind the Stand at this time

and I entered the tunnel which runs beneath the Stand giving access

to the central                pen of the terraces.                      The situation was calm inside

the tunnel and there was no egress of people.                                     The ones at the back

were not pushing,                   but merely trying to look over the tops of heads in

front.        Three         police officers were standing at the back of the crowd,

two females and a male, who were totally unaware of the incident                                                      in

progress.            I shouted for them to begin evacuation as a means of

relieving the pressure on the bodies at the front.                                           I said “There are

dea$ bodies            in there."               1 entered the crowd to the right of the

£ (Mitral dividing railings and began moving                                  individuals back,              down the

tunnel behind.                  I was obliged to grab each person and haul                             them

backwards,           just shouting               "Get out." to each one as I progressed

towards the front.                      Many were     in deep shock and resisted me,                         pulling

 I eventually reached the front where                      I saw several supporters tending

the dead and injured.               I was asked to help many individual# by thes#

people*        I heard shouts of "Come on mate this kid's dying. Help him«'<

and "Give us a hand here.               Do something"

 I saw a pile of bodies             lying waist deep at the bottom of the terrace

steps against the wail.               Three or four people still alive were

trapped up to th e i r hips           in bodies.           I spent a long time with:

spectator* trying to free these people? without success at first.

There was vomit and mucus              in people *s hai rt a^td on their clothing ,

there were shoes,              coats, money, Liverpool               scarves,               hats and

paraphernalia scattered all around.                       I gave heart massage and mouth

of dead and dying males and females from the pile,                                          but it was Just

th® small gate,        over the bodies,   to get inside.

 commendable efforts to resuscitate         casualties and carried the dead

and injured away.

I was concerned about one young boy with blonde hair, aged about                   10

years, who was     lying with his face pressed against the wall,            but who

showed signs of life.           I tried to work him free and cradled his head

in my hands to prevent him grazing his face on the wall.              He seemed

to be breathing but only with shallow panting breaths,             although his

skin was still     pink in colour.

I tugged at be 11s , c1o t h i n g , arms and any other places where        1 could

get a firm grip.        I was assisted by other police officers and

civilians.     the bodies began coming free and I carried three or four

back down the tunnel       into the rear enclosure with other policemen.                I

also   carried injured back there.        I left them to return to the

terraces as there was much work to be done.           There was a lot of

jostling and confusion and I lost my footing on the steps,                tripping

over people and being pushed.

As time passed there was some success         in breaking down the fences

behind the goal    to the left of the pile of bodies.          Police personnel

and civilians did this by kicking and pulling the wire from its

supports.     As this opening appeared,      bodies were handed out to others

on the track, with a comment as to whether          I thought they were alive

or dead.     Several    times   I repeated "This one's alive",    "This o n e ’s

dead."     I finally managed to free the      10 year old boy and passed him

through the hole.        I remember shouting to the person I handed him to

"This o n e ’s still alive".       I lost contact with him after that.         I
remember sweating and my mouth being very dry.           The clothing under my

anorak was wet with perspi ration.

1 saw an ambulance drive     round the perimeter track from the direction

Of the gymnasium and stop on the pitch near the goal          posts at the

Lepipings Lane end.

Eventually the bodies were cleared from the terrace arid I climbed out

through the hole,     where I,began tending to people who were lying on

the grass.     I attempted mouth to mouth and heart massage with some of

the bodies,    but without any success.     I did not persist with any

particular, one but went from one to the other trying to help other

police officers.      I assisted in loading hoardings which were being

used as makeshift stretchers.      I carried three or four bodies from

that end of the field to      the other end where I laid them on the

grass to be teftded by ambulancemen       and firemen.   I remember one   of

these was a boy of about 12 years but        I cannot describe any of the

people whom I. carried.

1 remember several Liverpool supporters on the pitch were still

aggressive and abusive,     passing comments such as " Y o u ’ve killed these
                '                  '  1 ' v .:            '
poeple."     Their aggression was also directed towards the Nottingham

forest crowd.    Looking   round the ground I saw a large number of men

and youths running towards the Spion Kop shouting and swearing.

Others   I saw climbing into the North and South Stand of the pitch,

where Sporadic fighting broke out amongst su p pp rt er s.     Ppr this

reason I believe that a cordon of police officers was farmed or» thi-

half>*way^3tine fey Chief Superintendent Nesbit.

There appeared to be a lull     in the activity on the fi e l d for a short

time.    I had a drink from the groundsman who was carrying a bucket #f

water as my throat was so dry and I was sweating profusely.           I

remember speaking to Detective Constable CLARKE on the pitch.             I also

spoke to and tended a number of individuals who were wandering about

                  brother at this stage.         I went back to him, explained the sit'Uation

                  and I then obtained a hot drink for him and sat with him for a iwhile.                    ’

                  I then began to assist        loading injured people f rom boards o n t o ; ^ m p e r :.

                  cots which I carried and wheeled with ambulancemen.                I alsovassi%ted

                  several Hulking patients to the emergency vehicles wh ich were arriving

                  at the scene      continually.

                  There was a debrief        in the North Stand,    where I joined my serial>       -I      4

                  gave them instructions on the compilation of their notes re ga r di ng               •

                  the incident and then completed my debriefing sheet which X handed to

                  Chief   Inspector BEAL.       We were then stood down.

                  I. remember going back to the gymnasium and assisting several officers

                  with their duties.        These included PC 420 Davies, PC         11741 Horsfield,

                  DC 1531 Pont, PC        1212 Goulding.    This concerned the handlirig of the

                  corpses,    loading them into body bags and recording property.              I was

                  not directly involved with any of the deceased for continuity pur po se s.

                  I finally retired from duty at about 6.'00 pm.

Dated                 021089                                                           Si gned


           Further to the evidence which I provided concerning my part in the

           events of Saturday 15 April          1989 at Hillsborough Football Stadiym,

           Sheffield,    I have been instructed to document my recollections of the

           1988 FA Cup Semi-Final.

           This event took place at the same ground on Saturday 9 April              1988

           between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest Football Club

           My memories of the match and the Police Operation on the day are

           extremely vague,       due primarily to the fact that nothing        remarkable

           happened.

           I reported for duty at the ground at 9.45am and a formal             briefing was

           held in the North Stand.          Chief Superintendent MOLE was in overall

           command,    but my recollection of the various Sector Commanders and

           structure of the Police Operation is indistinct.             I was   in charge of

           Serial    1, the perimeter track detail,       the great majority of whom were

           Community Constables from 'FI' Sub Division.           I believe my Sector

           Commander was       Inspector HOWLAND,    although I have not consulted the

           Operational Order.         The   identities of the individual Police

           Constables under my command,          together with their respective     positions

           around the perimeter track, are          likewise unknown to me.
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             R267A

Serial    1 were deployed to their       positions at 10.30am and remained in

position throughout the three phases            of the match.    Officers were

released at intervals throughout           the event in order to    take

re f re shm en ts.   Phase   1 comprised of the build-up preceding the actual

game of football       until 5 minutes after kick-off?       phase 2 consisted of

the game until       10 minutes before     the final whistle and phase 3

thereafter until       crowd dispersal     had been achieved.

During t h e   course of phase 1 of th® Operation,         I ensure that Officers

under my command were sufficiently aware of their responsibilities

with regard to crowd behaviour.           I confirmed that they were spaced

equidistant around the perimeter track and,             during the course of the

afternoon,     I made frequent excursions around the ground,          ensuring

that there were no operational          difficulties.

I must stress that the officers performing duty on serial               1 were

vastly experienced and totally familiar with their              role at major

football matches.        The majority had worked this detail for a great

many years and were fully conversant with crowd control              procedures at

Hillsborough Stadium.

Throughout phase 2 my role was to stand in the mouth of the players

tunnel,    beneath the South S t a n d , preventing access by unauthorised

people preserving security of the playing staff,             coaching staff,

management of the two opposing t e a m s , and the officials who were

refereeing.      Part of my duties      concerned supervision of the track

serial    regarding thei r response to a stoppage or interruption of

play.     In this     situation,    I would signal   to other officers on the

track to stand        and face the crowd from the seated position they

normally occupied,       by merely walking forward onto         the perimeter track

from the mouth of the players tunnel.

I was present also,          to discourage disorderly behaviour by players and

management who occupy the          "dug-outs"   during the match.    This was
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              R267A

particularly    relevant during the 1988 semi-final,        because     I remember

that due to previous misbehav i our by Brian CLOUGH,          he was ordered by

the Football Association,       not to sit in the    'd u g - o u t ’ during the

g a m e , but to positin himself in the South Stand s e a t s .      This

arrangement caused a lot of fuss amongst the crowd when he appeared

from the dressing       room at the beginning of the match.        There was some

jeering by Liverpool       supporters and cheering by Nottingham Forest

fans, which was all very light-hearted and good humoured.                I recall

that I had some difficulty controlling the rush of photographers from

newspapers and television,       who were eager to record the phenomenon.

Another    incident which I remember quite vividly was the ejection of

two Nottingham Forest       supporters sitting behind the Liverpool           ’dug-

out' .    They we re being abusive towards Kenny DALGLISH whenever he

stood to give    instructions from the sidelines.         The i r terms of abuse

related to the possibility of people having sexual            relations with his

wife, whilst he was watching the game.           I caused Officers      in the

South Stand to eject them from the ground,          but they re-gained entry

later and were promptly arrested for public order offences.

During the course of the match, whenever the black Liverpool                player,

John BARNES,    was    in possession of the ball,    there were     loud sounds

similar to those made by an ape,       from certain individuals amongst the

Nottingham Forest      supporters on the Spion Hop.       This was accompanied

by the waving of a giant       inflatable banana.     I considered this to be

extremely offensive and decided to stop it.           I therefore walked to

the Kop end of the ground and entered the crowd,           recovering the giant

banana from the terrace steps.        I removed it to the gymnasium where

it was dealt with as found property.        As   1 walked along the track,

there was a great deal of booing, whistling and derogatory remarks by

the entire    crowd.    A photograph was taken by the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club photographer,      Mr. E-LL.IS, which later appeared in the
                                                                                  PAGE     4

         Fruit Traders Magazine,

         The only other    incident which gave cause for concern was at the end

         of the game,   as players were    leaving the pitch.     There was an invasion

         by large numbers of Liverpool      fans from the North Stand and Leppings

         Lane terraces.       Reserve Officers from other serials had been deployed

         in the players tunnel and various strategic points around the

         perimeter track,      to deal with this eventuality.     Together with

         members of my serial,      I was involved with sweeping the pitch clear of

         supporters and encouraging      players and management from Liverpool        to

         leave the field of play.       They were intent on receiving the accolades

         of the crowd and      were causing some hostility,    but this   problem was

         resolved successfully without any serious        public order problem.

         During the 1988 semi-final      I was not aware of any overcrowding on the

         terraces and find myself unable to comment about the behaviour of

         fans seeking entry prior to the match,        I am aware that several

         arrests were made at the event and that there was drunkenness.               I

         did not have cause to visit the Leppings Lane terraces,           the West

         Stand,   or any of    the concourse leading to this area of the ground

         during the day.       I am unable to offer any   constructive observations

         about the Police Operation in that      loc ali ty.

   MEETING 3RD MAY - HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP (HFSG)

   I enclose, as requested, briefing material for Lord Ferrers to
   meet the HFSG. I gather that the meeting will take place in the
   'television interview room' at the House of Lords; and that
   pre-meeting briefing will be 1000 here in QAG.   I shall attend
   both meetings as will Mr Smith, F8. Mr Mould will accompany me
   at the meeting with the HFSG.

   2.   If Lord Ferrers is content perhaps we can deal with the
   police issues first at the 1000 meeting.

BACKGROUND BRIEFING


MEETING - 3 MAY: WITH HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP


INTRODUCTION


Lord   Ferrers    will   recall   that Mr       Robert Hughes    MP wrote      to
Mr Brandon       Bravo   asking    Home        Office    Ministers    to     meet
Mr Trevor Hicks and members of this group.               Lord Ferrers replied
(see Annex A ) .


MR HICKS


Mr Hicks lost two teenage daughters at Hillsborough.                       He has
since been active in the Hillsborough Family Support Group of
which he is the chairman.


Annex B is a newspaper article which provides more background
information      about   Mr   Hicks.      Our    limited    contact   with    him
suggests he is a sensible, level headed individual deserving of
a sympathetic hearing.         He gave evidence to Lord Justice Taylor
(see Annex C) .


HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP (HFSG)


This Group has had a number of meetings with MPs               at Westminster
including the Leader of the Opposition.


The HFSG is understood to be voluntary group tohelp               victims and
their families,     and to lobby for them.              The objectives of the
group are     summarised      at Annex    D.     Secretary to    the HFSG      is
Mr Barry    Devonside who       is understood to have          lost   a son    at
Hillsborough.      He will accompany Mr Hicks as will Mrs Sefton and
a Mr Pemberton on whom we have no information.
ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION


No advance information is held about specific issues which the
group    wish   to   raise.    They   may   however    be    critical   of    S.
Yorkshire police and Chief Constable Wright.            The group are also
likely to raise


        a)    what the Government is doing to achieve all seated
              accommodation at football grounds;


        b)    the arrangements for setting up the Football Licensing
              Authority;


        c)    safety standards, particularly pitch perimeter fencing.


CORONERS INQUEST


The subject of the inquest may be raised.            Lord Ferrers may wish
to know that the present stage of the Inquest will be adjourned
on 4 May, when the medical causes, place and time of death of
the victims will have been established.               The inquest will not
risk prejudicing police inquiries.            (Mr Hicks should be aware of
this). Details of the police investigation are described below.


POLICE INVESTIGATION


Line to take


Hillsborough tragedy shocking for everybody - terrible loss for
the bereaved, who all have our deepest sympathy.


In relation to the main inquiry all questions of blame must be
very carefully investigated - that I am afraid takes time and
must be completed before any comment can be made.


On   the     specific   complaint   against    Mr   Wright    I   gather     that
Mr Sharp visited you (Mr Hicks) and Mr Devonside and Mr Hammond
within the last week to explain his conclusions.               I do hope this
was helpful, and that it indicated the care and thoroughness with
which all this must be examined.


Background note


The main policy inguirv, by West Midlands Police, centres on any
possible criminal actions by South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield
Wednesday      football   club,     Sheffield     city    council   and   their
advisors,    or disciplinary matters        in relation to the police.
While   each    element   is being    examined     in its     own   right,   all
aspects are inter-related and there is close co-operation between
the police conducting the investigation, the Director of Public
Prosecutions, and the Police Complaints Authority.


The initial     (very detailed)      assessment of evidence is nearing
completion and interviews with those directly involved on 15
April 1990 will shortly begin.            No conclusions on criminal or
disciplinary matters are likely for some time - perhaps three
months or more.


Separate     police   inquiries     are   being    pursued     personally     by
Mr Sharp, Chief Constable of Cumbria, concerning the involvement
of senior police officers of ACPO rank (Assistant Chief Constable
and above)     — ie Mr Jackson,      the then ACC        (operations)   and the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Mr Wright.                Consideration of
Mr Jackson's actions may be on a similar timescale to the main
inquiry.     Mr Sharp has also recently take charge of all police
investigations related to Hillsborough.


Mr Sharp     has   however   just   completed his        investigations      into
alleged remarks bv Mr Wright which were reported in the press
as being critical of supporters, eg for being drunk.                    This has
cleared Mr Wright of any impropriety in this matter: essentially
because the press reports were exaggerated from the more cautious
words spoken by Mr Wright - a tape recording of the interview,
by the journalist concerned, was crucial in establishing this.
Although entirely outside his obligations, Mr Sharp decided (with
the agreement of Police Complaints Authority) to visit Mr Hicks,
Mr Devonside and Mr Hammond who had made the complaint against
Mr Wright — all three are from the Hillsborough Family Support
Group - to explain why Mr Wright had been exonerated.                      These
visits took place in the last few days.                A bland statement in
writing along might well have been painful to the complainants
and hard to understand.


The suggestion for the visits was compassionate and touching,
and    Mr   Hicks   greatly   appreciated     this    initiative     (Mr Sharp
visited him on Monday 3 0 April) .           He agrees that no blame for
the press reports lies with Mr Wright.                 Indeed,    he commented
that this was the first time he had been "treated like a human
being"      (by officialdom).      This may therefore be an opportunity
for Lord Ferrers to emphasize that those investigating the case
are very      sympathetic     to   the   bereaved,    but   are   also   tightly
constrained in what they can say until their work is complete.


ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION


The Group's view on all seater stadia is not known but it is
likely to be favourable.


Line   to    take: the   Government      support     the recommendation      for
football league grounds and see all seated accommodation as a
significant step towards           improving conditions      for spectators.
We expect clubs to make the first steps.              The Football Licensing
Authority will monitor the position and the provisions of the
Football Spectators Act 1989 will be used to enforce the changes,
if that proves necessary.


FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY


The concept of the FLA is likely to be supported by the Group
who may well press for early implementation.
Line to take o n ;-
a)    responsibility for the FLA is likely to become a Home Office
      responsibility now that the national membership scheme is
      not to be introduced;


k>)   functions of the FLA will be:


      (i)     to   issue   licences     under   the    1989    Act     which     will
              contain,     as   necessary,    conditions       directed     by    the
              Secretary of State on seated accommodation; and


      (ii) to keep under review safety certification by local
              authorities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
              with power to amend safety certificates;


c)    commencement: the FLA will be set up on or after 1st June
      although it will be a little longer before it becomes fully
      operational;


d)    membership:- FLA membership is not finally decided but we
      envisage that it will comprise some people with relevant
      knowledge      or    technical     background      (eg     in    particular
      engineering, fire safety, policing of football matches) , and
      others with knowledge of the professional game or with other
      skills felt to be of value;


e)    staffing:      the FLA will also have an inspectorate.


SAFETY STANDARDS FOR FOOTBALL GROUNDS


The   group    may   press      for   government    action     to     set   minimum
standards at football grounds and the removal of pitch "barrier11
fencing.


Line to take:        Finally the FLA will keep under review safety
certificates       and . will    have   its   own     power    to     direct     that
particular conditions should be included in them.
The Green Guide is being revised in the light of Lord Justice
Taylor's recommendations;


When that has been done we will ask Parliament to consider an
order   under   section    15A   of   the   1975   Act   to   implement
recommendation 24 of the Final Report, and which will require
local   authorities   to   address    particular   matters    in   safety
certificates;


Background Note: Recommendation 24 says that the Secretary of
State should exercise the power available to him so that safety
certificates must contain terms and conditions about the maximum
number of spectators, entrances/exits and crush barriers.


Pitch Perimeter Fencing


Line to take:- understand the concern.      The Final Report did not
recommend its removal.     The need for such fencing is for local
decision by the club in conjunction with the police and local
authority.   If it is not necessary to prevent disorder, it is not
required for safety purposes.

 You wrote to Martin Brandon-Bravo, the Home Secretary's
 Parliamentary Private Secretary, on 13 February enclosing a letter
 from Mr Hicks about comments attributed to the Chief Constable of
iSouth Yorkshire in the Sheffield Star. The Home Secretary has had
 a similar letter from David Alton and he has asked me to reply to
 both.  I think that you know that my responsibilities at the Home
 Office encompass both police issues and the safety of sports
 grounds.

I have assumed that, in writing to you rather than to the South
Yorkshire Police Authority, Mr Hicks was not seeking to make a
complaint about the Chief Constable's conduct to be investigated
under the police complaints procedure.  That avenue is of course
open to him should he wish to take it.

I have read the comments which were attributed to the Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire in the Sheffield Star.  It seems to
me that, in the article, the Chief Constable has not questioned
Lord Justice Taylor's conclusions about the immediate cause of the
incident, but that he has said that he finds it difficult to come
to terms with the view that the drinking by fans had no effect on
the events.  In this, he was not rejecting Lord Justice Taylor's
conclusions, but reflecting the views of some of his officers.

I would not wish to add to the controversy about the part which
drink played at Hillsborough.  Clearly this is an occasion which
is fraught with grief and distress from every angle.  I think,
though, that it is proper to point out that Lord Justice Taylor's
interim report, at paragraph 196, considered particularly whether
drunkenness among fans was a major factor in the crisis at the
turnstiles and that his conclusions on the causes of the tragedy
are summarised in Chapter 16 of the report.



                                              /I have noted....


 Robert G Hughes Esq MP
    I have noted with interest the 6 objectives of the Hillsborough
    Family Support Group.  Only 3 come specifically within the area of
    responsibility of the Home Office.  I am sure that Mr Hicks and
    his friends will already have seen that the Government has
    announced that it intends to act on each of them.

    The Football Licensing Authority, which the Government expects to
    appoint within the next few months under the Football Spectators
    Act, will be given the responsibility of reviewing the way in
    which local authorities carry out their responsibilities for
    safety at sports grounds under the Safety of Sports Grounds
    Act 1975.
    The Home Office already has in hand the revision of the "Green
    Guide" on safety at sports grounds to incorporate recommendations
    made by the Taylor Inquiry, and some other changes, and will
    shortly be setting up a working group to consider the revised
    guide before it is sent out for wider circulation and comment. We
    shall also be considering an order under Section 15A of the Safety
    of Sports Grounds Act 1975 which will have the effect of requiring
•   local authorities to include specific terms of conditions in
    safety certificates.

    The question of "no fault" compensation is for the
    Lord Chancellor's Department, rather than for the Home Office.

    You said that Mr Hicks had approached you about the possibility of
    meeting with one of the Home Office Ministers.  If Mr Hicks would
    like to see me with representatives of the Support Group Iwould
    be happy to see him, and I suggest that he contacts my Private
    Secretary on 273 2468 to arrange a date and time.

I   if that proves difficult to arrange, and since the particular
    objectives of the support group are already being addressed, he
    might find it helpful as an alternative to have a detailed
    discussion with the Head of the Division within the Home Office
    who has responsibility for taking these issues forward. His name
    is Mr Peter Bolton and his telephone number is 273 3322.

    I am sending a copy of this letter to David Alton.

2.15 pm From there, he had a view o f the centre pens. He kept an eye on them as they filled up since he knew his
daughters to be there.

   2. His evidence was th a t by 2.50 pm he could see people were in distress. At about 2.55 pm he and others
called to a senior police officer at the top o f the steps to the control box to draw his atten tion to the crushing. Mr
Hicks was only a b o u t 10 feet from the officer. He described him as wearing a flat cap with gold or silver braid
an d a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer who stopped the m atch. M r G reenwood, who
did stop the match, was certainly not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on the video.

   3. M r Hicks says that he a n d others sfaSputed several tim es to this officer in attem pts to alert him to the
distress in the pens. T here was no reaction (although M r Hicks believes the officer m ust have been in earshot.

   4- " ^ a t officer descended from the steps a n d two c a m eram en w hom Mr Hicks believed were from
television cam e a n d ap peared to direct their cam eras towards the pens. Another senior officer appeared two
steps down from the platform . He was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap but with black braid. M r Hicks
says that he a n d two or th re e others tried several tim es to capture this officer’s attention w ithout success. Then
M r Hicks says he sho uted F o r C hrist’s sake! C a n ’t you see w hat’s going on? We can, a n d you have c a m e ra s”. The
officer is said to have replied dismissively “Shut your fucking p ra ttle ”.

  5. W hen the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. Victoria was put in an am bulance a n d Mr
Hicks a c c o m p a n ie d her to hospital where she was fo u n d to be dead. Sarah died at the ground.

   6. M r Hicks was an impressive witness and, despite his grievous loss, remarkably stoical. He gave his
evidence clearly a n d w itho ut rancour. He was certainly m istaken abo ut M r Greenwood being one o f those on
the steps a n d it has not been possible to identify either officer from M r Hicks’ descriptions. He may well also
have been imprecise as to tim ings. Nevertheless, I see no reason to do ub t that what he described did occur in
relation to two officers. As M r Hicks generously said himself, the dismissive abuse from the second officer
(although reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied with trying to see w hat was happening at
pens 3 a n d 4 a ro u n d kick-off tim e.

The Goalkeeper and Gate 4
   7. M r Barnbrock, a Liverpool supporter, said he w ent through the tunnel. He would have liked to have
tu rn ed back when he saw how crow ded the pens were. H e went with his father an d 13 year old brother Stephen
towards the front o f pen 4. He saw the team s com e o nto the pitch. Conditions at the front were, he said, alright
until ab ou t 2 m inutes to 3. T h e n the pressure in the pen increased a n d he and his father becam e separated. His
feet cam e o ff the ground. H e shou ted to police officers through the fence to get th em o ut a n d help them . The
police d id not react. The Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce G robbelaar, spoke to a policem an on the track. T h e gate
was then opened by a blonde policew om an a n d a b o u t 25 to 30 people went through it. T hey included the
witness s father a n d his b ro th e r Stephen who had a broken arm . A police Constable shut the gate. It was then
reopened by the sam e policew om an, the witness thought, a n d he got out.

    8. M r Eccleston, a male nurse a n d an impressive witness, was sitting in the north stand. He noticed pens 3
a n d 4 were full a n d realised som eth in g was wrong w hen fans started coming over the p erim eter fence but did
not invade the pitch. He said the Liverpool goalkeeper ap p e a re d to notice this too.

  9. M r G robbelaar was o u t o f the country d uring the Inquiry a n d was therefore not called. However, he
m ade a statem en t which was p u t in as his evidence. In the course o f it he said:-

    Kick-off happ en ed a n d we got into our stride pretty quickly - we forced a corner pretty e a r ly on an d the ball
  came down to my en d - I rolled it out to the full back once an d play went on until Peter Beardsley hit the
  crossbar o f the N o ttin g h a m Forest goal from a corner a n d cam e back into play. I rem em ber just after that
  there were shouts a n d screams tro m the cro w d ju st beh ind me, it was different; not the ord in ary crowd noise
  and I tu rned a ro u n d to look. W hat am azed me first was the con centration an d squash o f fans in the centre

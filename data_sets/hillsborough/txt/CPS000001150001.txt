Dear Ms Adlington

RE: HILLSBOROUGH: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY

As I explained by telephone yesterday, my report on the above case has been sent to the
Chief Crown Prosecutor for Central Casework prior to being considered at a higher level.

I am now able to inform you that the new Director of Public Prosecutions will not be
involved in decisions over whether the Crown Prosecution Service should take over
proceedings in the Hillsborough matter, because of his previous personal involvement in the
case. The matter will, however, be considered at a very senior level in the Crown
Prosecution Service.

You have asked about our intentions concerning disclosure of material in our possession if
the prosecution was allowed to proceed. As I have previously indicated our policy is to give
voluntary disclosure whenever it is in the interests of justice to do so. Our consideration of
this disclosure is being deferred until my report has been studied and a decision made. If
the decision is that the proceedings for any offence should be allowed to continue then
voluntary disclosure of our material will be given even-handedly to all the parties. This is
of course subject to a separate consideration of material that may attract public interest
immunity or legal privilege. Voluntary disclosure of the material in the possession of the
South Yorkshire Police is, of course, a matter for the Chief Constable. However I would
be informing him of the exercise of our discretion.
I regret that I am not able to give you a definite date when our decision will be announced,
although I am told that it is hoped to make it by 7 December 1998.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Metcalfe

RE: HILLSBOROUGH: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY

Enclosed is a copy of my letter to the HFSG explaining the current position of the Crown
Prosecution Service in relation to our review of the case papers.

I have sent similar letters, without the discussion on voluntary disclosure, to both the
solicitors acting for the defendants and to the Clerk to the Justices.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Holland

RE: HILLSBOROUGH: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY
    LEEDS MAGISTRATES’ COURT 30 OCTOBER 1998

Enclosed is a copy of a letter to one of the defence solicitors in this case. It explains the
current position as regards the Crown Prosecution Service review of the papers.

Similar letters have been sent to the private prosecutor and to the other solicitor.

Any application for an adjournment of this case is, of course, a matter for the court and the
parties to the private prosecution. However I hope that our indication of a timescale is of
assistance to the court.

Yours sincerely

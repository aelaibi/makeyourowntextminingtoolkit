             At     1 000      hours    we     arrived        at    the N i a g a r a       Sports      Ground        where        at    1045

             hours        a briefing           was    held     by     Inpector           Hand-Davies,            My    duties           were     in

             football           special        train     to    the .ground,,

             At     1 130      hours    Inspector          Hand-Davies              familiarised myself                  and       oth e r

             officers           with    the      geography          of    the    Hillsborough             Stadium.            We    then

              left       the    area    of     the    ground and           made       our      way    along     Halifax        Road       where

             the        train    was    due      to a r r i v e .        I was      instructed           to    patrol        the    area       of

             Hal if ax R o a d         in    company with             Constable           6278       Lurit.     1 saw        that^fhe

             vast        majority       of     Liverpool           supporters            were    consuming           inpa-si c a nts         from

              cans.         They      were     sitting        on the       grass         verge       outside     the     Halfords

             store        and    surrounding           area        in H a l i f a x      Road?       they were        w ell    behaved

             and        in g o o d    spirits.

             At     1 400      hours    the      football          special       arrived         in H a l i f a x     Road,        carrying

             approximately              550      supporters.             The     fans       alighted          from    th e    train and

were      grouped         together          on the       pavement             in H a l i f a x        Road.         I positioned

myself, at         the     head       of    the    escort          with       Inspector              Wilkinson.

Mr.    Wilkinson           moved       off       and    I followed              after          a suitable           gap.       We

proceeded          down Halifax              Road       towards           the    Lepping             Lane     end    of

train      arrived         at    the       Leppings          Lane       end     of    the       ground        and    t hey were

directed         towards         the       turnstiles.               Isaw        a    very        large       group       of    peo p l e

waiting       to     enter       the       ground,       they       were        not       in q u e u e s ,     but    j u st        a

l a rge    mass      of    people.           Fans       outside           the    turnstiles             were        climbing             the

walls      and     fences        into       the    ground.

In L e p p i n g s    Lane       l a rge     groups          of    supporters              were       standing        on       the

pavements          consuming           alcohol,          they were              in g o o d        humour       and    well

behaved.           Constable           Lunt       and myse lf             were       directed          by     Inspector

Hand-Davies           to    clear          these       groups        of     people         from       the     pavements             and

directed         towards         the       ground       turnstiles.                  Most       fans    responded              to       our

requests,          while        others       needed          to    be     told       two       or t h r e e    tim e s .        F a ns

who    were      drinking         were       told       to    stop        and    put       the       cans     down which                they

did.       Constable            Lunt       and    I made          systematic              sweeps       along        each       pavement

in    turn    moving        fans       towards          the       turnstiles.                  The    area     we    co ve red was

between       the     turnstiles             in L e p p i n g s         Lane     and       the       traffic        lights          at

Catchbar         Lane.          All    Liverpool             supporters.approached                          from Catchbar

Lane      contrary         to    our       briefing.              However,           as    we     cleared       an a r e a          of

fans      it w as     immediately                filled       by a r r i v i n g          supporters.               Liverpool

supporters           in L e p p i n g s      Lane      were        w el l     behaved,            I only       had    c a use           to

speak      with>dfne        supporter             regarding             his     behaviour.

At    1430\<nours          it w a s        becoming          apparent           that       the       situation        outside                the

turnstiles           was    becomi ng .uncontrollable                           due       to    the    number        of

supporters           attempting             to    enter       the       ground.            I moved          towards        the

turnstile          area     and       took       up a .position a g a i n s t                   the    bridge        w all      in

Leppings        Lane       using          my    horse       to       stem       the    flow        of       people        along       the

pavement,            I was       joined          immediately                behind           by C o n s t a b l e         Radford.               I

beckoned Constable                    Lunt       who       was       further          up L e p p i n g s          Lane       to     come     down

and    ass i s t . .      We    positioned             a    line       of       horses           in a       cordon           a c r o s s the

front     of    the       gate       leading          to    the       turnstile             area.

The    area     immediately                in f r o n t         of    the       turnstile              was    crammed             full      of

people        only       the    heads          and    shoulders             of       the          people          c o u l d be      seen.        The

noise     in L e p p i n g s         Lane       was    very          loud and           I        am     unable         to recall

hearing        any       radio       message          from       the       t ime      I took           part       in s e t t i n g        up the

cor d o n .

The    people, we          were       holding          b ack         with       the     cordon          seemed          to. h a v e       spnly

one    aim which           was       to    get       into       the    ground          at        any    cost,          they were            both

abusive        and       threatening             and were             all       p u s h i n g ;f o r w ^ f d .          In o r d e r        to

communicate              with    them          I had       to    shout          at    the        td'p of my            voice.         Fans

were     crawling          between             the    horses          legs       in firder             to    by     pass       the     cordon

and    join     the       main       crowd       in f r o n t         of    the       turnstile.                  It w a s        impossible

to    reason        with       the    people          in the          crowd.           A Lan^over                   was      brought         up      to

the    cordon        fitted          with Public                Address          equiu/ent              an    Inspector

the    turnstiles,              his       pleas       fell       onXjjiraf e ars.                  After          some       time      it

seemed        that       the    cordon was             taking          effect,              the    crowd          began        to    thin.

Supporters           were       allowed          to    trickle             through           in the          centre          of     the

and    the     bridge          wall.           I then       heard          the       tanno«/at              the     ground          appealing

to L i v e r p o o l      fans       to    stop       pushing          forwarj^and                 those          at    the       b a c k .of

was    then     instructed                by    Inspector             Hand-Davies                 along       with        Constables,

I took        the    two       outermost             turnstiles,                the    turnstiles                 were       c l o s e d a n d we

                           At     06.00 hours on Saturday.                15th Aprii,        1989.    I
                   paraded        for duty at the stabies Greenhill                      Road as a member
                   of a mutual             aid contingent           to assist South Yorkshire
                   officers         at     the policing of the F.A. Cup semi-final
                   footbail         match between Liverpool               and Nottingham Forest.


                            At     10.00 hours we arrived at the Niagra sports ground
                   where at         10.4 5 hours a briefing was held by Inspector
                   Hand-Davies.              My duties were,           in company with other
                   officers,             to escort Liverpool           supporters ffiojn tne-footoa;.
                   special        train to the ground.


                            At     11.30 hours Inspector Hand-Davies familiarised
                   myself and other officers with the geography of the
                   H i ll sb or ou gh Stadium.              We then     left the area of the grounc.
                   and made our way along Halifax Road where the train was
                   due to arrive.               I was      instructed to patrol           the area of
                   Halifax Ro ad            in company with Constable 6278 Lunt.                      I saw
                   that the vast majority of Liverpool                        supporters were
                   consum in g           intoxicants from cans.            They were sitting on the
                   grass ve rge outside the Halfords store and surrounding
                   area     in Halifax Road,              they were well behaved and in good
                   spi ri t s .


                            At     14.00 hours the football               special arrived in
                   Halifax Road,             carrying approximately 550 supporters.                        The
                   fans al ig h te d from the train and were grouped together on
                   the pavement             in Halifax Road.           I positioned myself at the 1
                   head of the escort with Inspector Wilkinson.                                               %

         Hr - .Wilkinson moved off and I followed after a
s u i ’.abie gap.    We proceeded down Halifax Road towards the
Lepping Lane end of Hillsborough.


         At   14.15 hours   the escort of Liverpool           supporters
from the special        train arrived at           the Leppings Lane end c
the ground and they were directed towards                   the turnstiies.
I saw a very        large group of people wait ing to enter the
ground,        they were not in queues,            but just a large mass or
people.         Fans outside the turnstiles were climbing the
walls and fences        into    the ground.


         In    Leppings Lane large groups of supporters were
standing on the pavements consuming a i c o h o l , they were                   ir
good humour ?-nc: well         behaved.       Constable Lunt and myself
were directed by Inspector Hand-Davies to clear these
croups of people        from the pavements and directed towards
the ground turnstiies.            Most       fans responded to our
requests,       while others needed to be told tttfq.or three
times.        Fans who were drinking were told to stop and put
the cans down which they did.                 Constable Lunt and I made
systematic sweeps along each pavement                   in turn moving fans
towards       the turnstiles.      The area we covered was between
the turnstiles        in Leppings Lane and the traffic lights at
Catchbarn Lane.         All Liverpool          supporters approached fror.
Catchbarn Lane contrary to our briefing.                    However as we
cleared an area of fans           it was       immediately filled by
arriving supporters.            Liverpool         supporters In Leppings
Lane were well behaved,           I only had cause to speak w i t h ;or
supporter regarding his behaviour.


         At   14.30 hours   it was becoming apparent           that the     .
 situation outside the turnstiles was becoming
uncontrol able        due to the number of supporters attemptlftt
 to enter the ground.           I moved towards the turnstile area?
and took up a position against                 the bridge wall    in Leppirif
 Lane using my horse to stem the flow of people along
 pavement.       I was joined immediately behind by Constable |

Lepp.ncs    Lane to corae down and assist.         We positioned a-
line of b-rrses     in a cordon across the'front of the gate*
leading to the turnstile area.        '                                      ’


        The area   immedlately   in front of the turnstile was
crammed full of people,      oniy the heads and shoulders o f f
the people could be seen.         The noise In Leppings Lane w a s ;
very    loud and I am unable to recall hearing any radio                     -•
message    from the time I took part          in setting up the ■        ,■ i
cordon.                                   .                              '" j

        The people we were holding back          with the cordon
seemed to have oniy one aim which was to get             into the
ground at any cost . they were both abusive a n a ’ threaten!n-;
and were a 1 i pushing     forward.    In order to communicate
with then I had to shout at the top of my voice.              Fans
were crawling oetween the horses          legs in order to by pass'
the cordon and join the main crowd in front, ,of the
turnstile.      It was   impossible to reason with the people ,:

fitted with Public Address equipment an Inspector                   '?X\
attempted to communicate with the crowd to get them to

ears.      After some time it Seemed that the cordon was                          '
taking effect,      the crowd began to thin.         Supporters were
allowed to trickle through In the centre of the cordon ahc
I permitted fans to pass one at a tine between ray horsey
and the bridge wall.        I then heard the tanof at the *grounc
appealing to Liverpool       fank to "itop pushing forward a n d ’
 those at the back of the t©braces to move back and
relieve the pressure on t h # front.            I was then tnstracff
by Inspector Hand-Davies along with Constables, Gru
Hal pin and Lunt      to close the turnstiles on Leppings Lane-
 I took    the tw o outermost    turnstiies,     the turnstiles wet|
closed and we stood with the horses hindquarters to thej
 turnstiles.       Shortly after:we closed the turnstiles peopi*
 started    to emerge from'a gate situated around the c or ner ­

                                                                     'll!

many    of     rhert were    seriously injured and some or them were
dead         As    tney were carried out they were     like   Mac Bci:s
and    ap p ear ed     to have no feeding in their iimfcs.


        We then went out         into Leppings Lane where we remained
until"we were            instructed to patrol   the ground perimeter
until we were stood down and returned to Niagra.


        At     io.3C hours we were stood down and returned to

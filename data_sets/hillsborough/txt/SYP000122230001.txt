                                         I am a Chief                    Inspector         in the M e t r o p o l i tan Police,                  a 11 a c he d

                                         The H i l l s b o r o u g h             tragedy,          after     the      initial        s t o c k , gave me

                                         hope         for     the        future.          This      hope was          that     the    behaviour            of

                                         fans         in L e p p i n g s       Ln»       which      I recognise            as a not       unknown

 are    close      to    * H * , ’J * and         *K ’ and      likewise         on    level     ground.



I saw the         first L i verpool           supporters           on my way           into W e m b l e y

at S t o n e m o re Broadwav.            some       six m iles        f rom     the S t a dium,        where

a number were            sitting        in the       pavement jdfci<nj^ng^ca.ns                 of. beer

or    lager,      at about                        j^gO) .



The    closer      to W e m b l e y , the more            fans     I saw who wer e              drinking

in the      s t r e e t , often       carrying         m ore    cans w i th t he m .



I a r r i v e d at W e m b l e y S t a d i u m at about               10.30 a.m.          (’1030)      and

saw that a         large       number      of fans were            already        on the        complex,

perhaps as man y as                 10,000.         Again,     man y     of them        nad     cans       of

d r i n k , i.e.      beer     or    lager w i t h       them.        I was      dismayed        to find

that many         of those          present       did not       have     tickets        for     the

game.       My advice          to them to           leave      the a rea went           for     the most

p a r t ,inheeded.



On    inspecting         the area        I f ound that at T u r n s t i l e               *H'    a small

s e c t i o n of fencing,            secu r e d     by s c a f f o l d    clips,       had been

sl a c k e n e d so     that a s i g n i f i c a n t      breach         of the       fence     could       be

made,     giving        access       to the       circulating            corridor.         From       the

enq u i r i e s   I made       it a p p e a r e d    that      this      had been done           by fans

during      the night,          no doubt          intending        to a p p l y       pressure        at

the    right moment            to gain e ntry to               the Stadium.



I n f o r m a t i o n was     passed to o f f icers             under my         command        by    an

u n i d e n t i f i e d Liverpool        Pol i c e Officer,              that    he had heard

fans    planning         to    rush the       *H* , ’J * and             ’K ’ turnstiles.              Trti s
                                                                                                      PAGE             3
                                                                                                      R95

confirmed         by own view that                   these were          the most       vulnerable

areas     and the r e f o r e           the most       likely       to    be a t t a c k e d .



As time       progressed,               I noticed       that       there were more               poeple           in

that a r e a s u f f e r i n g          the    ill    effects       of alcohol          and      tension

was    beg i n n i n g      to    increase-           This    culminated           in a number               of

fights at         the       5 pinch      point %       the    n a r rowest        point    of the

c o n c o u r s e , outside         the S t a d i u m Offices.              The       fights         were

caused a p p a r e n t l y         by the       sale    of tickets           by    't o u t s ! .

A l t h o u g h well        k nown touts were            not       evident,       there         s e e m e d to

be a number            of    people       selling       one    or    two     tickets.            The       fans

were    keen      to at t a c k         such    people       and yet also             to buy         the

tickets      at    i n f lated          prices.



By    12.30pm      (1230),,         the       crowd was       building          up generally,                but

especially         so outside             turnstiles          "H* » ’J ’ and           "K ’ .        Because

this a rea        is     confines,            I had to       put    in a cordon of

police      horses ana             foot       police    b e t w e e n the T.V.          compound

and t u r nstile            'H*    to    prevent       the    danger       of     crushing.



Outside       of the         cordon,          There    were more          outbreaks        of d i s order

among     fans     who       had been d r i nking             and    I personally               r e c eived a

blow    to the         head whilst             assisting       one       of my offic e r s            in

making      an arrest.



The    t u r n s t i l e s were         late    in opening          because       a    lorry was

still     carry!ng           out    some work          in the       ci rculating          corridor.

     open and a lot of effort                            was       requi red to              prevent          a       large

     number       of         11 legal     entries         to       the Stadium.



     Once     the      tur nstiles             a pened,        I       expected           the    crowd        to ease

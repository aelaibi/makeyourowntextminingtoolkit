apeared           to    be     alive.             I then              continued                 in    assisting                 fans     who       were

tightly           packed        that         it     was         almost impossible                          for       one        officer           to     pull

I    previously              described             and          realised               that          the       woman        nad       gone        blue       in

the     f a c e ? her          eyes        appeared              glazed               and       she       was f ro th in g             at     t he

moutn.            It    was     obvious            that          she         was       deceased.                    Her     partner            was also

vomitting              from     the        mouth          but         appeared              to       be    alive.               I then        looked

squashed           and       appeared            to       be      losing              total          consciousness.                         T h e r e was

no    way      that       we    could         get         to     any         of       them.           1 then             noticed         that          the

■fencing r t h e             actual          wire          meshing, was                    beginning                 to     buckle           and

gradually              get     worse         and          buckle             to some thing                like       6     IE     inches.               We­

ther.       had    the       problem          of      a       p u d   I ic       order          situation             on        the    pitch           itself

still        in    there        and        was     suffering                     from       asthma.                 1 told        him        to    stand

back        and, a l l o w      us      to    get         as     many            people          as       we     c o u l a . out       but        in    the

gst     to     the      gate       to      get     to         his      sister.                  However,             this        did     nothing             more

than        hamper        the      police          officers                  who       were          trying          their        best        at       that

   stage,,            I then             remember             seeing           a    man       who        I    presume           was       with          his    son       at

   the      front          of       the       fence.              He     too       had     his arm s               pressed           up       against          the

   fence         trying             to       protect          his        son       who     w a s in a             very       distressed                  state.

   However,,              still,         there          was       no     way       that           we c o uld       get       to      these          people.

   The      only          way       to       get    to       them        was       t h r o u g h the          gate        and        a    few       over       t he

   top.          However,                itw       as    ail       so     obvious             or     appeared              obvious,                that       had

   more         bodies          climbed             onto          the     fence          to        try       and     pu ll      them          up    this       could

   have         led       to    the          fence       collapsing                 into           the       crowd        and      causing              even       more

   deaths            and       injuries.                 At       this      stage          although                we     could          see       people          were

   dying         and       p e o p l e -£jo i n g            under         the      crowd           and       losing          sight           of    them       it

   did      not       appear             from       the       gate         that       1 was          at       that        there          was       anyone

              LLSBOROUGH DISASTER - SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989

At 8.00 am Saturday 15 April 1989 I reported on duty a^tearnsley
Police Station to attend the Hillsborough Football Ground|p^ere the
Semi-final for the F.A. Cup between Liverpool and NottingjjA Forest
was to be played.     I paraded on at Barnsley Police Staijln where
we were briefed by PS Swift who was in charge of I t r Police
contingent from Barnsley who was attending from 8.00 Ifei.          This
contingent consisted of PC Packer, PC Taylor, PC Mackenzie, P|C
Phillips, PC Hooson, his probationer, WPC Akred and we yere later
joined .by 2 police officers from a squad from Sheffield Heart(Jtiarters.
From Barnsley we attended at West Bar Police Station at approximately
9am where we were briefed by Chief Inspector and Superintendents
regarding our duties for the days.        These were to ibnsist of
reception of both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Fans at ife Midland
Railway Station at Sheffield where they were to be diverted to 2
lots of PSV buses which were to be waiting for them at separate ends
of the Station. Two officers were then to be delegated to each bus
to travel up to the Hillsborough Football Ground where buses would
be emptied and fans directed into the ground at the appropriate ends.
We were also instructed to make searches of fans as they came from
the Station.

Approximately 10.15 am this date, along with other officers, I
attended at the Sheffield Railway Station to commence duties as
instructed.   However, once at the Railway Station the serial which
I was attached to were instructed to take up position outside the
main entrance to the Railway Station to intercept any fans who
managed to slip the police net within the station and attempt to
go into the town with a possible chance of causing trouble.    This
we did and on a number of occasions has to divert fans back to the
buses which were being laid on for them.       Most of these fans,
although were noisy, were well behaved and no violence occurred and
there was very little suggestion of drink.

At approximately 2.30pm this date all fans had arrived by trains
and along with other officers we travelled up to Hillsborough on
a PSV. The route which was taken was through Hillsborough village
itself on Middlewood Road and then into Leppings Lane.           Whilst
travelling along Middlewood Road I noticed that there was a number
of fans still walking towards the ground.        We then turned into
Leppings Lane and I noticed that there was a large volume of fans
well into the number of thousands still waiting to get into the
ground.   The area in front of the turnstiles was packed to capacity
and the crowd was spilling out onto the road itself.        There were
a number of police officers who were at the scene who were attempting
to control the crowd. As we were travelling towards this part of
the ground, I noticed 2 separate fans who, in my opinion, were
extremely drunk and    were having to be carried by 2 friends, one
under each arm.    I also noticed a youth who appeared to be
approximately 25 years jumping in and out of the road putting his
fists up to passing     vehicles.   In my opinion from the view I had
from the PSV's there    appeared to bea number of fans who were drunk.
As we passed the      turnstile area,I also noticed a       number of
supporters climbing     onto the top of the walls and turnstiles

                                                                             'V^




obviously entering the watch either without producing tickets or
tryjwj to enter without ^tickets at all. The officers who were on
dutgjttt this point in no^rfay could stop these youths doing what they
wer!|%sloing due to the circumstances of the refft of the crowd which
wer^j fibbviously pushing    obtain entry as quick as possible as the
tima fat this point was ;approximately quarter ,to three.      We then
tra#e*led from the turnstiles along Leppings Lane towards the
roufftabout at Niagara.   Ail alnng this road there were still hundreds
of fans stilfl walking towards the ground.    We then travelled to the
Nottingham Forest side of the ground which was on Penistone Road
Nor#*!* Entrance and this was a totally different scene. There were
ver|| few supporters awaiting to obtain entry and everything was
qui«|t.    We were instructed to go to the gymnasium as we were a
re^irve serial for the match itself and there we obtained a drink.

About 3.00 pm this date, we were instructed by Sergeant Swift to
attend with him onto the perimeter track in front of the Leppings
Lane track. We had been in the ground approximately one minute when
we were given these instructions. We walked on the perimeter track
to the Leppings Lane end where we were instructed to take up
positions along the track facing the^Leppings Lane end.           I walked
up frowarde- tke— ContPO-l to- the end ofLeppings Lane w « nearest to
the police control room.         There I remember being stood with PC
Packer. At this time it was obvious that there was a large number
of people in the crowd in the central section and there were a number
of people who were being pushed against the fencing.            There were
screams coming from the crowd but at this time it appeared that it
was just a 'push' that was being made by fans from behind and it
was not evident to myself the enormity of the incident.            I saw a
number of youths open the 2 sngll emergency gates and burst onto
the track.    Officers then pushed them back into the crowd as it was
felt that they were trying to invade the track itself. This sort
of action is normal procedure at a football match.         However, within
a very short space of time I am unable to say what, but I would
estimate about 30 seconds to a minute, I think all officers realised
that the position was more serious.        I did not see at this time any
deceased persons but it was obvious that the people on the front
were gradually having more pressure put on them.        The 2 small gates
were then opened and fans were pulled out of the crowd.        The initial
fans which came out were, although short of breath and some were
suffering slight crush injuries, were well and appeared to be
alright.   I began to direct these fans into the side enclosure under
the police control box and still not realising the enormity of the
incident.      I remember onefan stood on the track jumping up and down
shouting    and watchingthe game from the track and not making any
attempt to go to the other gate.       I got hold of this lad and pushed
him towards the side enclosure.         This continued for a short while
and then we began to realise that the problem was more serious at
which stage we began to take the advertising boards down which were
on the pitch itself to allow more room to bring spectators out on
to.    During all this time I began hearing the fans screaming for
help andshouting for       us to do something.    We were also being spat
at from     the crowd.     We   then continued dragging    people out and
gradually they appeared to be more seriously injured but still there
were no persons deceased that were pulled out.

'While we were stood at the fencing I saw a womai I believe with dark
 hair, in a red anorak pressed up against the         ence and either her
 husband or boyfriend was stood behind her also Ln a red anorak with
^his arms up to either side of her head pressing against the fence
 in an attempt to shield her from the pressure. At this stage this
 woman appeared to be alive.     I then continued in assisting fans who
 were being pulled out by officers at the gate          the gate was only
 sufficiently wide enough for one fan to be pull ;d out at a time and
 only sufficient at the maximum of 3 offiders to be at that gate
 pulling them out any more officers at thdt gate would just have
 blocked it off totally.      I therefore stood b^ck and assisted in
 getting casualties onto the pitch.     We were ,joii ed by other officers
 immediately and some officers began climbing o} the fencing in an
 attempt to pull people out of the crowd.       HowevSer, people were that
 tightly packed that it wai^i§!possible for one. officer to pull persons
 up although some officers did manage it. People then began climbing
 on top of each other in an attempt to escape and all were in total
 panic.   I then remember turning and looking at the couple which I
 previously described and realised that the woman had gone blue in
 the face, her eyes appeared glazed and she was frothing at the mouth.
 It was obvious that she was deceased.     Her partner was also vomitting
 from the mouth but appeared to be alive.      I then looked further back
 into the crowd and I could see an old man who was being squashed
 and appeared to be losing total consciousness.          There was no way
 that we could get to any of them.      I then noticed that the fencing,
 the actual wire messing, was beginning to buckle and gradually get
 worse and buckle to something like 6-12 inches.          We then had the
 problem of a public order situation on the pitch itself and I
 remember one youth screaming and shouting- that his sister was still
 in there and was suffering from asthma.       It told him to stand back
 and allow us to get as many people as we could out but in the panic
 and emotion, which one cannot blame, he continued to try and get
 to the gate to get to his sister. However, this did nothing more
 than hamper the police officers who were trying their best at that
 stage.   I then remember seeing a man who I presume was his son at
 the front of   the fence.   He too had his arms pressed up against the
 fence trying   to protect his son who was in a very distressed state.
 However, still there was no way that we could get to these people.
 The only way   to get to them was through the gate and a few over the
 top.   However, it was all so obvious or appeared obvious, that had
 more bodies climbed onto the fence to try and pull them up this could
 have led to the fence collapsing into the crowd and causing even
 more deaths and injuries.  At this stage although we could see people
 were dying and people going under the crowd ar^d losing sight of them, y -H\eX-
 it did not appear from the gate that I was^with t©- be- a»y popo&ns       “ ^
 deceased being pulled out.     However, the enormity of the incident <J
 was becoming more and more apparent and police officers were
 desparate in trying to save people.        Supporters both on the pitch
 and in the crowd itself were shouting at officers and spitting and
 trying to get them to do more but there was no way the officers in
 this area, including myself, could do any more. Then as more fans
 were trying to get out the gate itself got blocked by the enormous
 number of persons trying to get through ^£&St* small gap at once.
 I remember at this stage that a large man who I believe had a white
 top on was trapped with the top half of his body lying on the track




                                  - 3 -
on his back and f m m his waist downwaijls was trapped withirf the
terracing over the egtrance of the gate.     Along with other officers,
I attempted to pulljl||, his arms to pull & m out while other officers
were frantically shf^Skirig at us to do this. We were tried but cwere
totally unsuccessful j Jfend this was due a the amount of pressure on
his bottom half by £t*e fans Jajr the gate'. This caused a larger jam
at the gate for w h ^ •'seemed an eternity    one appeared to be coming
through this gate. ®                        .
                    i-       1   '
I do remember PC Taylor stood Ranging from the fencing attempting
to pull persons out#dff the crowd itself.  At this point I stood back
and looked at the \Jpole scene and I could see that fans were being
pulled up to the tc^ of the seating area by other fans and fans were
climbing over the £|ide fencing assisted by the supporters. There
were a number of fafes swearing and shouting at us on the pitch and
both from the terracing and the youth I mentioned earlier as trying
to get his sister had to be chastised on a number, of occasions by
officers although the officers appreciated the situation he was in
and no attempt was made to lock him up even though there was
sufficient evidence there.    Whilst all this was going on a number
of officers, including myself, was trying to wave at fans to tell
them to move back out of the stand itself but I remember seeing
a small crowd just jumping and cheering as though nothing was going
off.   However, I do feel that anybody with a bit of common sense
would have known there was a serious problem at the front of the
pitch.   There were a number of senior officers who were trying to
organise the officers but there was a large number of fans milling
in and out of other police officers which hampered instructions.
However, along with other officers, we made two lines either side
of the gate and we began to drag people out, twog|>fficers per person
and dragging them on to the pitch with instructions to commence
resuscitation. This was commenced and then we began to try and form
a conveyor belt and sls deceased bodies were being pulled      passing^
them along the line onto the pitch itself in the hope that medical
attention could be given to them immediately.     However, as we were
pulling these people out it was quite obvious that they were deceased
this was due to the colour of the face, the smell and it was obvious
from looking at the clothing that they had lost all bodily functions.
The terrace suddenly appeared to become almost empty and I could
see a number of bodies piled up and a crush barrier collapsed.    Part
of this crush barrier was thrown by a fan at the police officers
who were on the fencing attempting to save lives.       I believe the
barrier did hit a police officer.     The people that I had seen at
the front of the terracing had just disappeared and I have no doubt
that these persons fell to the floor when the pressure was taken
off. I remember during the incident, although I cannot say at what
point, I saw approximately 4 or 5 fans seem to step backwards among
the crush shouting hysterically that there was a dead man at their
feet. This was approximately at the location of the crush barrier.
We then had to move bodies which were on the pitch further in in
an attempt to give us more room for the other bodies which were being
pulled out so that any first aid that was possible could be given.
Once all the bodies were out I instructed 3 or 4 fans with an
advertising boarding and I placed a man on the boarding and began
running towards the Penistone Road end of the ground where other
people were being taken for treatment. The     manthat was on ^his was
obviously dead at this stage. However ,«Lt was in an attempt to get
him to the medical team hoping that sogfcsing could be done       him.
When I got to that end there was a lFp^e "number of bodies at that
corner and I placed the man down and 3b#t- him for the medical staff
to check him. I then ran back to the ^*ppings Lane end in order to
fetch further people from there. Howeve#p-oft my return all tl^ bodies
and casualties that were to be moved* had been.       I then took up
position on part of the fencing that had beei]i pulled away on the
instructions of a senior officer to ftop people going in and out
of the crowd.                          ^

Sometime later Sergeant Swift rounded^p as many of our serial* as
we could find and he walked us off      the Penistone Road end. We
were taken round near to the gymnasiaf and sat down.   Also at the
start of the incident when we began moving advertising boards we
were also forced to remove journalists away who were insistent on
getting pictures.

In conclusion, one of the main problems onto the track area was the
size of the door at the 2 gates. It was only possible to pull one
person at a time through these gates and with the terracing being
below the level of the pitch itself it made it that persons had to
be pulled up as well as out and this caused the wedging that occurred
at the gates.    Had the terracing been level it would have been a
matter of pulling persons straight out and I believe more could have
been saved.

                    F r o m the time of the early arrival                     of supporters,               it was    evident      that

                    a r o u n d w ith them in single>-<f^our and six                      packs.      This was as            early as

                    10.30-sjm (1030).           The area     of patrt)! was            g e n e r a l l y being      ’o c c u p i e d ’ by

                    no reports        of any form of trouble              for       some    c o ns id er ab le      time.      Duri ng

                    resp ec ti ve     parking areas.            At no time did             I see any a l c o h o l i c        drink     in

                    any    coach or mini-bus,            nor did     I hear         of any such            incident     over     the

                    radio.



                    Most    of the s upporters were m aki ng                  for    public houses,             shops a nd                  y

                    m o rn i n g a nd early a f t e r n o o n    passed,       it was       obvious        that m an y were

                    or were      becoming       the worse       for drink,          a l t h o u g h not     in a n asty sort of

officer,           but was    ins ta nt ly hemm ed      in by L iv e rp o ol    s u pp or te rs who were

s h o u t in g abus           ~      '     ny way t hr o ug h the     s u pp or te rs a nd was then

approached           by    _______         ho a s k ed me   to take     him into the ground.                   I

escorted                   rough     ’A ’ Gate and via the           lower N S t a nd      level;      took

him to the gymnasium.                    The h os t i l i t y of the Live rp oo l      s up po r te r s was

indescribab le.              I was threatened,          v e rb a l l y a b u s e d and spat    upon.         On

e n t e ri ng      the g y m na si um w ith the doctor          1 was    h or ri f ie d to see        very

m a ny dead bodies.               I left the g y m n a si u m a nd as       I did     I saw three young

m en   carrying what              looked    like a girl.        She a p p e a r e d to be dead.            1

went     to assist a nd was              told,    “D o n ’t touch her you m u r d er i ng          b as ta r d. "

They     carried he r/ hi m          into the gymnasium.



I then went           down the       ramp onto the g ro un d          and saw that m an y dog,

h andlers          had been d e p l oy ed a cross       the    pitch,    toge th er w it h a cordon of

foot     officers.           I. r ealised the       p o s si b il i ty of a m aj or    public order

situation,           so   I went     round e very dog hand le r to make sure                  he knew

wTT&sc^h^is partner was,                 in case they had to leave             the ground

quickly.            1 then went out onto P e n i st o ne R d N w here               I saw POL PC 3 3 3 &

            w ho had been left to                look a fter    the dog    vans.      She was

looking a fter 2 young                c hildren     in a car v       T h e y were   d o ct or 's    children.

POL PC G I B B I N was o b v i o u s l y very shaken. ^ ^ S l H ^ o o k e d           terrible.          She

told me she had been t hr e a t e n e d by a crowd of                      Live rp oo l            supporters.

We were         joined by other            police officers.           POL PC G I B B I N           t ook me in

her van round the block                    to L eppi ng s Ln.



On arrival           we were      conf ro nt e d by L iv e rp o ol    s up po r te r s who were

extremely           hostile and threatening.                I sent PQL PC G I B B I N back to

P en i s t o n e Rd N a n d I w a l k e d down L e p p i n g s L n .       The h o s t i l i t y of the

L iv e r p o o l    sup pr te rs was       immense.     V er y m a n y were    very m uc h the worse

for drink.           I was s hoved and           pushed,     t h r e a t e n e d with viole nc e a nd spat

upon.         I had to ignore         them,      even those who         came    right up to me to

spit    in my face.           T h ey stank of boose.              I h e lp e d to get two fire

e n gines and some a m b u l a n c e s          t hroug h the m o b , there        is no other word

for them.



I saw a y outh_____ .                                                                   .I went    towards       him

was    immed ia te ly s u r r o u n d e d      by Live rp oo l    fans.      I told him to get            down

as what       he was     doing w o u l dn 't m ^ k ^ things a n y better.                 T h re at s   to kill

me were made.            I aifr^certain that had             I t ried to a rrest          that y o ut h    I

w o u l d have    been s e r i o u s i V assaulted.



I went along i^eppings Ln and                    put dog hand le rs         in groups      of 4 a nd 6         fa r

s a f e t y a nd told them that               they must     not   react     to the a c ti o n s     of the

fans unless          they were a b s o l u t e l y forced.           I did this w it h e very

o ff icer      I came across,         w he t h e r dog h an dler      or not.          1 will     say this,

that    under     the most       hostile,        a b us iv e a nd t h r ea t en i ng   crowd      I have ever

seen    in 29 and a half years                  of service,       the offic er s       on L ep p in g s L n ,

w h et h er   foot    off i c e r s , t raff i c offi c e r s , m o u n t e d off i cers or dog

handlers,        were m a g n i f i c e n t    in their     conduct,      a nd by such conduct

p r e v e nt e d what    I be 1 ieve was a m ajor            public order s i t u at i on arising.



To say that          I was    frightened         is putting       it mildly.           I was    in genuine

fear of being s e r i o u s l y ass au lt ed ,            if not killed,         such was         the hatr ed

being displayed.



1 have        it on my c onscience             that   I did not      stay    in the g ro un d to help.

I believe        that at      that    time      there was e n ou g h help        in the g ro un d and

k no wi ng what was          likely to happen outside                c on si d er e d that      to be my

It is my o pinion that this t fagedy was                      caused by the veryN^iany

L i v e r po ol    supposers        who^^th^me w it h ou t t i c k e t s , w it h one       i n te ^t io n - to

get    into the g round an^vjay that they                  could.       If the gates              hadn't    been

opened?       they w o ul d have        f orced them      i r re sp ec ti ve    of how m a n y       people

they    put       in danger.       There was a complete            d i s r e ga r d for the s a fe ty of

others a n d t h em se lv es         by this element.           T he y a c h i e v e d their        objective.



As    I have       said I have 29 and a half years                 serv ic e a nd the m a j o r i t y of

these years          have   been spent working            the H i l l s b o r o u g h Division.

L iv e rp oo l     s upporter s have       never e n d e a re d t he ms e lv e s      to me and as far

back as       I can remember           there has a lways        been a n element            bent on taking

a dvantage.          I can go back to the early,                m i d d l e and    late     1960's

(000060),          long before fences were thou gh t of a nd find a long                             line of

L i v e rp oo l    suppo rt er s    history.



I have      p erfo rmed duty at major             football      m at c he s    t hr ou g ho u t    the S

Y o r k s h i r e a r ea as a Constable,          S e r g e an t a nd   Inspector,        but have         never

e x p e r i e n c e d a nything     like the     15 April      19S9     (150489).



I have been            a sk ed on several         occa si on s w hy     I did not use P o li c e           dogs

to clear          the turns ti le s area.         My reply to that             is that      if I had been

a s k e d to do so in those             circumstances,         I w o u l d have flat ly            r ef used to

do so arid I            w ould     not have    cared who gave the order. To have used

dogs     in such a ti gh tl y          pressed    crowd w o u l d have         been     the height         of

s t u p i d i t y and w ou ld have e nded          in complete mayhem,              if not a riot.

positions where they               can be clearly seen.               S Y o r k sh i re   offic er s are

paired w ith officers              from other Police Forc es and s u p e r v i s o r y

s e rgeants are        placed      in such posit io n that            their      loca ti on forms a

square a r o u n d the g round area.              W h e r e ve r    possible,      S Y or ks h ir e

o fficers are         s t a t io ne d at   locations w h i c h they are well               conv er sa nt

with.



T hese men outside           the S h e f f i e l d D i v is i on s are     put    into m ai n     road areas

on w h ic h their        primary     role    is the e s c o rt i ng of supp or te rs            coaches

etc.       Each    is able     to give      back up to the other and                is in radio

contact w it h F orce Control               as well    as G r o u n d Control.            I see   no reason

to alter any of these               locations     or duties          for any future         football

m at c h e s   played at Hillsb or ou gh .



E v e r y dog handler        is a wel l- gr ou nd ed ,      experienced           police o ff icer      in

w ho m a very great deal             of faith     is put,          due to the      role they      carry out.



If I were to b riefly s ummarise                the events           of that day,         it w o u ld be to

say that        initially the m ood was good,               but w i t h an unde rl yi ng

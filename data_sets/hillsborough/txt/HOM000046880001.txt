VISIT TO LIVERPOOL: STATEMENT BY LORD JUSTICE STUAR-pSMITH



Lord Justice Stuart Smith, who is carrying out the Hillsborough scrutiny, was
in Liverpool today to meet families from the area who want to put their cases
to him.


The scrutiny is not a public inquiry, but an examination by Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith of fresh evidence that may be relevant. It will not be open to the public
or the press.


During the three day visit, the judge will also meet 16 families in a series of
private sessions held at the Merseyside Maritime Museum near the Albert
Docks, Liverpool.


Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said:


          “I am pleased to have been able to come up to Merseyside and hear
          from all the families and individuals who want to put their cases to me.


          “I realise it must be an extremely harrowing experience for them to
          relive the terrible events of 15 April 1989, but I want to have as full an
          opportunity as possible to hear from them and ascertain whether there
          is any fresh evidence that is relevant to my scrutiny.

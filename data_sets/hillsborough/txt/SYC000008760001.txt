    Dear Sirs

    Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


    If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
    of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
    on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
     due course.

     I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
     evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
     coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
     inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

     Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
     under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
     witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
)    this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

     Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
     to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
     appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
     consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

     May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
     attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

     I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
     names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
     to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

     I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
                                       nber I will assume you have no names to
      submit

     Yours /faithfully,




      H.M.Coroner

Dear         Sira,

Rei                      Q. Rimmr fdeoeaaea),                 Ho.4.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S .L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

1 iefer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

Dear Detective Superintendent Beechey,

Bo; HTLLSBOROUGS DISASTER - BODY FILES.


As agreed with Mervyn Jones, I am contacting you in connection
with any detailed amendments which I think perhaps should be
made to the files.

I have already mentioned to Inspector Tobe that the summaries
are fine, my only reservation being because they are in the
third person and do not contain quotes may give rise to perhaps
some extra questions from solicitors. However, as the format
has already been settled, and I believe that the majority of
cases have already been drafted, I do not think that there is
very much we can do about it at this stage.

 I have now managed to read through several files and would
 like to draw the following points to your attention:-




                                                                                           cont1d

Deceased Reference Ho.4. David                                   B-immoT. v /

In the summary Paragraph 2, I think we should specify the time
when they entered the Pen which appears to have been at about 1438
(see Page 10).




For the next few days I will not be at the Medico-Legal Centre
but you will be able to contact me at mv home where I will be
a good bit of the time.


Yours sincerely,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

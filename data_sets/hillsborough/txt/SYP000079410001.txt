                 I am writing         to put on record for your own                        internal    enquiry several

                 important       factors w hich            I am sure will        not       be overl oo ke d by your se lv es

                 and      I hope that       comment        from outside the           force will        not be dismissed.



                 I a t t e n d e d the match           on S at ur d ay   15 April         1989   (150489),      and whilst       I

                 am e m o t i o n a ll y   involved        I have e nd e av o ur e d to be as objective as

                 possible.          I shall      not     comment     on the ticket allocated,                as      I am sure

                 the Yor k s h ir e Police will               properly justify the decisions                    to the

                 enquiry.        However, 1 feel bound to report the following.



                 Something       very ob vi ou sl y went wrong              outside         the ground      in the L ep pings

                    n         well     before     the start        of the game            on S at ur d ay afternoon.           Last
.   °iS(?
                 year,      the same teams             played at the same venue with the same                         ticket
                                                                                                       PAGE          2
                                                                                                       S2367

allocations.            When myself and my friends a r r iv e d at the ground then,

at about 2 . 40pm           (144U)      for   gates A to the N orth Stand?                the area was

quiet and          clear and we entered the ground without                        difficulty.          Last

year,       as with this,            I had met up with friends             near G lo s so p and

tra v e l l e d towards S h e f f i el d on the A57,              resulting       in the need to            park-

near       the N ot ti ng ha m       section of the ground.



Last year we were               p re vented from using the           side       residental       streets

from Penistone Rd to                  reach Leppings Ln for          crowd       control       reasons.

This year,          arriving at a similar             time,    we were a l lo we d to do so,                but

were       told by Police we might as well                  not    bother       because    of the      crush

of    people       there.



Last       year,    despite      the entrance area being             cleared,       we were       c h ec k e d

for tickets well               before    reaching /U'ie t u r n s t i l e s .     This    time,      despite

passing        through two Police             barriers at each end of the side                    street,

there was          no check on t r i c:ket/s .



The    number       of people         in the Leppings Ln area a t Z / % 0 pm <1440?                   was

quite       unbe 1 ievalbe .         However,     there was       very    lijjrtle p o l i c i ng.     For

the    several       turnstiles         to Gate A for the N orth S ta nd seating                     there

were       two moun t e d      police and      perhaps    only as many as four or five

other       officers.          The    crush of people was          quite     terrifying.          Further

over       to the    right,      at Gate B for the terraces,                 the s ituation was worse.

1 decided to stand aside                  from the      crush.      The    police were unable               to

achieve any order               by way of a queue.            I stood to the            left of the

turnstiles,          near      the    large blue     concertina exit            gates    for    the North

Stand.         At 2. 5 0 p m    (1450)    I was    convinced that          the start       of the      game

w ou l d    be delayed with so many thousands                     still    outside the ground.                   I

        assume     that       the m aj or it y         had tickets.            M uch of the sp ec ul at io n of

        S un d ay and this morn in g               has been that the gates were opened by the

        police     to    relieve a problem of ticketless                            fans outside        the ground.       I

        do not believed this              to be s o .



        E xp l an a ti o ns    of the    cause           of the       crushing on the terraces have              centred

        on the exit           gates    besides           turnstiles B being opened by the                  police.

      po 1 i c em e n/javai labl e to help.              Ha ny stood a r 9u n d wa t c h i n g .        This    is not

      a c riticism of them.                  I am sure        if they believed they coud help or

      knew what         they should be dojrng, they w ould have                        been active.          The

      d i r ec t i o n and       leadership i / f      this    skilled arid competent            resource

      ava il ab le      is questionable,



      iiiNo      public a nn ou nc e me n t were ff^de.                 It had been obvious         for      some

      time     that    there were           fatalities,        with fans       carrying the dead awa y on

      a d v e rt i si n g   hoarding        boards     to the other end of the ground,                  wit h their

^0^   heads      covered.          Whe n the goal        netting was          pulled down,       with    police

      assistance,           to     a llow    better access        tothe worst area,           it incited taunts

      of h o ol ig an is m         from the N o t ti n gh a m fans,          who did not know any

      better.         You    can    imagine      the    reaction this           caused from the uninjured

      Liverpool        fans who had escaped onto the                       pitch.      A surge    of fans      down

      to the N ot ti n gh a m end followed,                   w hich    could have d eveloped           into a

      totally different               unfort un a te     incident.          As a consequence m an y hundred

      police were           uryfie ces sar i ly lined up as a human barrier across                        the w idth

      of the      p i t c h / to    prevent any further                enc ro ac hm en t   by the Liverpool

      fans.       Su re ly whilst           young    people were         still    dying     on the terraces,

      this    was a total waste                of an essential            resource.

      Childhood.            I shall      not    be walking away from              it now.      I have a four

      year     old L i ve r po o l - m a d son,        who was yet to see the team play live.

      Pl ea se    give me         the   confidence        in your        findings that       I might    be able          to

was    barricaded,          and tickets were            checked twice.              This was    not the      case

in 1989       (000089).

(ii)    The P o li c in g       outside       the    turnstiles at L ep pi n gs Lane,              Gate A.

Not s u f f i c i e n t    or an y organisation,              1    only saw two moun te d

officers,          I was a m az e d at the            number       of Police       inside    the turnstiles,

they w ou ld have           been better           deplo ye d outside.

(iii)      Po li ce    d i d n ’t realise         the extent        of the    crushing and trea te d the

s i t u at i on as a pitch           invasion.         This       caused    c on fusion on both Police

and fans,

<iv)    As the        people were           coming    over the       perimeter       fencing    1 did see a

Poli ce wo ma n,      strike       out at a male         colleague who was by the                  perimeter

fence      behind         the   goal.        I was    in the N or th S ta nd at the time.                At the

time    I thought          it funny,        but     of course       later    it had s i gn if ic an ce      that

the P o l i c e w o m a n w a n t e d   the    perimeter          gate   open.

(v) A public a n n o u n c e m e n t          should have been made for                i nf or ma ti on of

both Police and fans.                   The    cordon the Police             put across      the    pitch

didn't       help matters,          if the        public a dd re ss        system had been used,

c on fu si on w ou ld have          been alleviated,               and better       uses made      of

resources available.

(vi)    No    o r g a n i s a t i o n of the      e mergency services,             firemen were arriv in g

w i t h no    cutters       to get the         perimeter          fences    down.     Once   the    sit ua ti on

had been       realised,         1 must add that a l t h o u g h            I have made      criticisms,
                                                                                                         PAG E
                                                                                                         S 2 3 6 /A

             Police,         firemen,     fans all   performed h e r o i c a l l y   to   preserve   life,   as

              best    they       could.

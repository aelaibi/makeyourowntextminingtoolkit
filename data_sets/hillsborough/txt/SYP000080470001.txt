     on the morning            of the match.



     At about         11 am    (1100)     on the morning           of the game             and     I left home

     did not have          change stations.               I did not     notice any other           supporters

     on the train at this                loca tion a l th o ug h there were a small                number      of

     them entering            the train at various             stops    on route.       The train        left

     s e p a r a t i o n of s u pporters at this             point was working          very well       and there

     a p p e a r e d to be no a n e m o s e t y between the            police and supporters,

     and    I decided         not to go         immediately to the ground so we w al k ed to a

     public     house w h i c h was more             or   less opposite       the station.          I dortt know

     the    name of      it but      it was aver a ge         size w ith black doors and shutters




     W hilst we were           outside         the R a i l w a y stat i on there were      not too m any

     s u p p o r t e r s about and       I w o uld estimate         there were about         ten

     L iv erpool       coaches and about             ten N o t t i n g h a m Forest    coaches.        The

coaches were          local S h e f f i e l d    coaches and those for Liverpool

suppo rt e r s were to the              left and the N o tt i n g h a m          coaches    to the       right.

On arrival         at the       public       house at about        1.35     pm    (1335)    I can say that

there were about               twenty    people       in the bar of which only about                     six were

L iv erpool      supporters,           the    rest being        regulars.         We    consumed two       pints

of beer and          left at about 2.2 0              pm    (1420).     During         the time we were on

these     premises           nobody else entered.



On    crossing       the      road to the       railway station             I d i scovered that          the   last

Liv er po ol     coach had        left       aowith        the agr ee me nt      of a Po li ce     officer we

boar de d the        last N o t t i n g h a m Forest         coach, J f T saw that this             coach was

full    of supporters who were                  of a m i xe d^ ag e     group.         During     the jour ne y

to H i l l s b o r o u g h    I formed the o p i n ^ m          that the younger           element of these
                      -r&C-                                                                        '
supp or te rs      had been drinking aurfci some were                   drunk.          There was a small

element        who were a b us iv e an d         chanting        various      comments against

L iv erpool      s upporters        in general,            a l t ho u gh there were       no such

suppo rt er s      on the       coach.        There was only a small               element       doing    this

and    I was     not unduly w o rr i e d by them.                 Whilst      on this      journey       1 did

not    notice any            persons    on the     coach drinking alcohol                 and whilst

looking        through the windows              I did not notice any               incidents       of violence

or fighting          in the street.             The fans a p p e a r e d to be well              s eg re ga te d

and    I did not see opposin g                 supporters        in each others           presence.        I

think     there were           three or four uniform Police                   officers      present       on our

coach.        We a rr i ve d at the ground at about 2.4 5                     pm (1445)      and the        coach

s t op p ed    in P e nn i s t o n e Rd at      the    rear of the S pion Kop.               We got       off the

coach and wal ke d along P en ni s to n e Rd towards Leppings Ln and at this

time    I saw      large groups          of N o tt i n g h a m Forest        supporters      but there was

no    conge st io n and what            I w ou ld have        expected       for a m at ch of this

size.         We were able        to walk       freely along          the    road and      I did not       notice

any    incidents        of drunkeness,           violence        or fighting           in fact    it seemed

very    peaceful.



Whe n we      reached the j un ct io n of P e nn is to ne Rd and                       I think F ie ld in g Rd

I saw that           there were m ov ea bl e              barriers across        the     road.    There was a

p o liceman on a horse at                       this    location and      it was at this time             that    I

sensed there was so m et hi ng                     unusual.       This    is hard to describe             but as       I

have    said that           prior      to this,          there had been noticeable               police

presence and e v erything was                          being   conducted very well          but    now the

presence was             not a p p a r e n t and         instincts     started taking over and              I felt

uneasy.        The       crowd           this      point was very sparse and when we                  reached

Leppi n g s    Ln we w^re            c onfr onted with a heavy flow of Liverpool

s upporters wj^fking towards                       the ground.         A l t h o u g h there were    large

numbers       ofsupporters               they were moving            freely and we were able               to join

in wit h them.              My    instinct         took over at this          stage.       I felt    u neasy and

I felt      there was            something          lacking.   On refl ec ti on I now realise that
                            P o ru iC ^ G L .      /V-p      L. l •
there was a d i st i nc t/ la ck                  of police presence and there was no crowd

control.            As we reared           the entrance          to the ground to a point             I have

m a r k e d as A1        on the      plan of the H i ll s b o r o u g h ground which               I now

produce Exhibit              no.           ref no,        my feelings      changed from one          of

u nea s i n e s s    to one of fear               for our      safety.     The    crowd of s uppo rters           had

built     up to such an extent                     that the whole         of the    road was       packed.        We

w ere able          to   change d ir e c t i on but            I w o u l d n ’t say we    could do    it freely,

I thought           very s tr on g ly at this              point as to whether we should aban do n

going     to the game and a g a in my                     instinct     told me something was              going to

happen.                   and     I m a n a g e d to walk across           the    road through the          crowd

to a small           wall    w hi ch     I have m ar k ed A2 on the              plan.     I did this       to

make    sure he was              safe and         I reentered the         crowd to decide whether                or

not    to turn back.



My tickets were for                  the West           stand seating and they were m a r k ed              to

                 enter at turnstiles m a r k ed               1 - 16 on the        plan.     I started to     look for

                 a policeman who            could direct me to where we should enter                   the ground

                 and    I even t u a l ly     found one at a point m ar ke d A3 on the plan.                      I saw

                 that    there was a p o l i c ^ j e e p at this             location and      I saw what     I
                                     3£>?             officer       speaking     on a loud hailer.      He was
                 p resumed to Be seru^

                 a sking     people M T be          calm and stated that           the kick off had been

                 delayed.         This officer a pp ea r ed to be nervous and was                   pleading with

                 the    crowd as oppo s e d to firmly directing                    them.     I identify this

                 officer as the one who                has    been on the t el ev is io n and the officer                in

                 charge      of the L e pp in gs Ln end of the ground.                     I a sked advise    from an

                 officer       near to him and he directed me to the turnstiles                        on my        right

                 I went      back to                and then we follo w e d the       i nsjj&trft i oris given to me

                 by the officer.            By this      time    it was s.bokSX ^ ^ '5 / pm (1455) and the crowd

                 had  increased to such an extent that we were being jT^rried along as

                 gates           ’
                                 ~e were      p o licemen on horses          on either      side of the gate.            We

                 hadVfeen        pushed some         ten yards         passed these    gates when    I noticed we

                 were    going      to the wrong         enclosure.         We tried to change       d ir e ct i on and

                 as we did so a police officer                      tried to stop us but when he          realised we

                 were     in the wrong         queue     he a l lo we d us past.



                         and     I then a p p r o a c h e d   the      correct   turnstile and suddenly           I felt

                 that    there was a l U f l e         more     room and the       pressure was     not so    intense.

Ca    t          J had     previousLjf seen a number                   of supporters    climbing over a wall             next

                 to gate c
                 there were masses             of    people waiting         to get    into the ground     I

                 w ou l d say that         there was a feeling a n xi o us n es s          dis pl ay ed but   I did not

                 see any       instances       of d r u n k e n es s    or violence.



                 We e v e n t u a l l y   passed     thro u g h our      correct   turnstile and we handed our

tickets      to the steward.                I did not see any u n au th or is ed entry being

gai n e d at this         time and        I did not see any             police    presence d ir ec t ly      in

front     of me       inside tjTg«^round.                 I firmly believe       that there was a

distinct        lack ofyo^olice           p r e s e nce    in Leppirtgs Ln and       in the turnstile

entrance a r e ^ t o           cope w it h the       large numbers         of supporters.



O nce    inside       the ground       I was able           to walk     freely between the

s uppo r t e r s and we made           our way to the stairs               leading    to the West

stand.       I had no problem               locating        these stairs and        I did not    pay any

a t t e n t i o n to what was         h ap pening         in the are a of the tunnel          under    this

stand.


                                    Ca t
We    climbed the stairs an d as we e n t e r e d o n e                   seating area       1 regretted

going     in as       I could see         that there were           far too m any      people   in there

to a cc o mm o da t e     them.       All    the seats were           full,   the   isles were     packed

and there was            no space at all.                 Whilst we stood        in there,    there were

people     trying        to    leave an d      in particular          one man was      leaving w it h his

son who was           crying.       I felt      this       sit ua ti on was   very dangerous,         we

a b a n d o n e d all    hope     of getting        to our a l l o c a t e d seats and we       deci de d to

stand at the back               of the      stand.        There must      have    been three    people       to

every two seats and                if there       had been any          panic or violence       there

wo ul d have      been        c o ns id er ab ly more       deaths.      I don't    think we w ou ld have

been able        to     leave     if we had wa nt ed to.              I did not notice an y        police

or stewards           in the stand a l t h ou g h they may have                  been and    I couldn't

see     them.



As we w al ke d towards             the     baclj/'of the stand          I looked towards       the    pitch.

I saw a number            of s pe ct at or s      climbing       over    the fence and       I p re sumed a

                 “'"*e stand       (A4)   I could s e e ^ ^       s q \i   c e officer a p pa r en t ly on top of

           the    Fence at         point A5 ajnj^rhe a p p e a r e d to be stopping                   fans getting           over

  AT       the fence         by k i c k l n ^ ^ u t   at them and           pushing        them back.    ~At    this     time

           I do not know whether                  or not the       players       had       left the    pitch.



           I was     very       concerned for         the safety of my son and myself                     now and        I

           paid more a t t e n ti o n to this              than who what was                happening    on the      pitch

           or at     the fence.           The     next time       I looked a nd took notice was whe n                        I

           saw    police        offices a nd s upporters             pulling an d hacking at the wire mesh

           fence     in an effort           to free the s upporters who were                     packed       in to pens 3

           an d 4.         I then obser ve d          dying and      injured      persons       being taken

           onto    the edge         of the      pitch.        I am unable        to describe any of the

           d e c e a s e d or     injured    persons.



           I e v e n t u a l ly        t the      ground at about 4 .20               pm    (1620)    after    hearing           the
                     t a    w-yoV
           tannoy sy^tyri telling                 people      the m at ch had been a b a n d o n e d .          As   I

           w a l k e d out      I saw a number          of bodies          under a canvas        sheeting w hi ch had

           been erected over               some    railings       in the u n co ve re d enclosure at the                     rear

           of the      stand.        It was at         this    point       I realised that how serious and

           d e vasting       the    irtcidentytfad been.             I c a n ’t describe any of these

c ^ r      people.          Whilst     I h%<f been in the stand                 I could hear          people were

           p penly boasting           tjirfat they had got           into the ground without                  tickets.

           In c o nclusion          I w ou ld     like to emphasise             the    fact that       in my opinion

           there were far too               little      police officers           in L ep pings Lrt and the fans

           without      tickets       should have been stopped m uc h earlier                          than the

           turnstiles           entrances.



           In a d d i t i o n fans        should      not have been a l l o w e d to enter              the West         stand

           w ith o u t a ticket a u t h o ri s in g           them to do so.               I am unable to describe

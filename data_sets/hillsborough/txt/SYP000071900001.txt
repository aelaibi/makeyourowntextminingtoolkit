            I am a married man and I reside at the above address with my family.

            On Saturday April               15th 19/9 (1504895,        I travelled to Hillsborough to

            s§fi the FA Cup Semi— Fin^fl between Notts Forrest and the team I

            support, Liverpool.
                          I /          I.


            My friend,                              and I arrived outside the Leppinos Ln entrance

            to t p ^ ground at 1440 h o u r s .              As w e / t f p p r o a ch ed , there were many people

            trying to gain entrance.                      1 notedr that there were two policemen on

                orses who were trying de s p e r a ^ l y to control the crowd.                    There were

            other policemen on foot but \^e numbers seemed woefully inadequate.
                                              ”
            One senior policeman was trying to co-ordinate his men but with little

            success.

            The crowd was packed very tightly into the confined space from the

            road to the turnstiles.                  People were climbing the walls of the ground
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                   *                 S1616

in an attempt to escape the crush.               I was p f   the opinion that there

was a serious chance of fatalities at tfo ip , point outside the ground.

The police presence was not enough to push the crowd back onto the

road,    if that is what they were trying to do.

I couldn’t understand why the police h a d n ’t chosen to stop people as

they approached Leppings Ln and started their control from the road

instead of attempting to do so at the turnstiles.

Fearing that the situation could develop into a tragedy, my friend and

I moved away from the crowd and watched from the bridge opposite                       the

ground.

We felt that we would not get into the ground until                    1330 at the

ear 1 ie s t .

From our vantage point we were able to assess the mood of the crowd.

They seemed in good spirit although some were unhappy^with                    t»ne

aggressive attitude shown by the police on hand. /

I did see one or two drunken fans, who were not causing any trou b l e ,

but I catergorically refute any suggestion that there were                     hundreds

of drunken fans" trying to gain admission.                   Several fans were looking

for tickets but were not trying to push               their way     in.

After watching the BBC cameraman get his five minutes of "glory” and

quickly disappear,           we decided to see if the crowd had thinned out.                 By

this time,       the teams/were out on the pitch, as we had heard the

cheer in q.      To o u r A u r p r i   the crowd had thi nned out enormously.         We
                         /          y vuj qtuxx.
did not realise /,hat the gate% had been opened or by whom.
                                                                               T      —
                                                                               1 he police

now seemed hapVy to get us into the ground as quickly as pos sible.                          I

gave a portion of my ticket to the gateman who said,                    "He didn't    care

what bit he got."

The lad behind said,             "I d i d n ’t need this then," as he waved his

complete ticket          in the air.     By now the   match had started so we         wanted

to find a good spot to watch from.

                 There were no police or stewards around to tell us where the entrances

                 onto the terraces were.     I could not see any signposts although,

                 admittedly,    my main concern was to watch the match,

                 We went to the toilets and followed the crowd \j#raugh the tunnel which

                 appeared to be the only way onto the terraces.           I ventured up the
T O N t ^ 6 jU
                 steps at the end of the tunnel which ^led onto the terraces that were
K/££>T
                 immediately behind the goal.

                 One    look told me that the numbers/in this section were dangerously

                 high and so we turned around t o ^ r y    to find another way onto the

                 terraces.

                 People were still    coming down the tunnel and we had to push our way

                 through.     We noticed the entrance to the West Stand above the

                 terracing where two stewards were standing.          They told my friend that

                 if we continued right we would find anolmer entrance.                This we did

                 and,   once onto the terracing,   found tfarfat there was much empty space

                 around us.    We looked down on the se/tions behind the cioa 1 and could

                 not believe the numbers    in there.     A t was   obvious that there would be

                 many people hurt and we couldn't understand why the police had not

                 moved people to our section.

                 By then it was probably too late as 1 assumed that people were being

                 killed either as we first entered the ground or minutes after we had

                 turned back down the tunnel.      Like most pieople we thought that the

                 first person onto the pitch was trying to cause trouble.-               It d i d n ’t

                 take    long to see that we were wrong.      The police,    Sj/fowever, could n’t
                               CAT    feucd                          +   +
                 see this and were trying to push anybody that at^empteu to climb over

                 the railings back onto the terraces.

                 When the match was stopped we expected the police who came onto the

                 pitch to give immediate assistance.         They instead concentrated their

                 efforts on standing two deep across the half way line.                Another group

                 of police did the same by the goal        line.    It was the fans who escaped

           the crash who were helping the others and carrying the hart and the

           dead.     Some police did help but most      continued to stand around and

           watch.     We felt helpless and sickeried at what we saw but d i d n ’t try to

           get onto the pitch as we thought if t would only add to the chaos,

           besides    I still felt that the polAce,      being the professionals,        would

c o m k & T help.    Most did not.

           I watched photographers taking photos of people lying hurt or dying

           rather than helping.      When we saw one or two bodies we d i d n ’t have the

           heart for any football     so we decided to leave.         I estimate the time

           then to be between 1543 and 1600 hours.

           I have never felt so upset,       f rust r a t e d ^ a n g e red and sickened than then,

           In my opinion,    the only people who canire from this with any credit were

           the fans, who,    on the whole, acted im a thoughtful          responsible manner.

           Again,    for the main part,   the police, who showed little or no control

           inside or outside the ground,       dijf much to cori^ibute to the disaster

           but   little to help.

           One other major contribution to the disast f r         which should be mentioned

           is the ticket allocation by the F o o t b a l ]\/ssociation.        It was

           thoughtless and ill-conceived to give the Liverpool fans the smaller

           of the allocations which was obvious when looking at the spaces on the

           terraces at the opposite end of the ground.            1 have tried to be as

           objective as I could in writing this and would be prepared to stand up

           in any court and give my account which,          as far as I am concerned,        is

           honest and accurate.      (sgd)

    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.

 Dear Sirs,

 Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


 If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
 of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
 on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
 due course.

 I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
 evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
 coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
 inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

 Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
 under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
 witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
 this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

 Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter,I am writing to   you
 to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
 appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
 consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

  May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
  attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

  I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
  names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
  to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

  I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
  heard from you by the end of September I will assume you   have no names to
  submit.

  Yo^r S / j f aithfully

       QUESTIONS (please keep these
       brief and confine them to
       matters arising from the
       Summary and Post-Morton
       Report only).
       Generally our clients are concerned about the timing of the pronouncement of death
       bearing in mind the number of rumours which have been circulating to the effect that
       bodies were placed in the temporary mortuary which subsequently showed signs of life.
       The questions our clients want to raise are as follows:-

       1. The frontest piece of the report shows that death
       was pronounced at about 16.00 hours. There is nothing
       in the body of the report to confirm that timing. Why
       is there reasonable certainty about the time of death?

       2. Please confirm what time Philip arrived at the hospital.
       Presumably the hospital can confirm that.

       3. Can the hospital confirm how'he arrived at the hospital.
       Was he brought by ambulance?

       4. At what time was the body removed frcm the hospital and
       taken to the temporary mortuary at the ground?

       5. Can arrangements be made for our clients to be shown the
       visual evidence referred to by Police Inspector Michael
       Layton in paragraph 15 of the report?


       If you have queries to raise please ensure that this form is returned to us
       and copied to H.M. Coroner, Medico-Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield as
       soon as possible and in any event no later than 10th April 1990.

      ^   Sear        Sirs,

( )       Res         PHILIP STKEluE (BECEASED) No,82.

          As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
          Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
          be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
          on the 15th of January 1990.

          I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
          has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
          behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
          Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

          I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
          Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
          he may wish to undertake.

          I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
          or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
/         matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
^     a     substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
          on this matter further.

              I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
              is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
              fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

              Yours faithfully,



              S.L.Popper,
              H.M. Coroner.

QUESTIONS (please keep these
brief and confine them to
matters arising from the
Summary and Post-Mortem
Report only).
Generally our clients are concerned about the timing of the pronouncement of death
bearing in mind the number of rumours which have been circulating to the effect that
bodies were placed in the temporary mortuary which subsequently showed signs of life.
The questions our clients want to raise are as follows:-

1. The frontest piece of the report shows that death
was pronounced at about 16.00 hours. There is. nothing
in the body of the report to confirm that timing. Why
is there reasonable certainty about the time of death?

2. Please confirm what time Philip arrived at the hospital.
Presumably the hospital can confirm that.

3. Can the hospital confirm how he arrived at the hospital.
Was he brought by ambulance?

4. At what time was the body removed from the hospital and
taken to the temporary mortuary at the ground?

5. Can arrangements be made for our clients to be shown the
visual evidence referred to by Police Inspector Michael
Layton in paragraph 15 of the report?


If you have queries to raise please ensure that this form is returned to us
and copied to H.M. Coroner, Medico-Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield as
soon as possible and in any event no later than 10th April 1990.

           Dear Sirs

           RE: PHILIP JOHN STEELE - DECEASED

           I am in receipt of your letter dated 20 April 1990 in respect of the
           questions you raise in relation to the summary of evidence concerning the
           above-named deceased.

            In relation to question (1 ), it will be seen from Paragraph 6 of the
            summary of evidence that Dr Calder believes he assisted to treat Philip
            Steele together with Dr Duncan, who eventually pronounced life extinct.      Dr
            Duncan is unable to identify which patients he certified dead. Both
            doctors do not state or record the times they dealt with patients.

            Dr i~  n in her statement of evidence states that at approximately 1600
            hours, Saturday, 15 April 1989 she confirmed life extinct on a number of
            bodies, including Philip Steele, which were in a plaster room being used as
            a temporary mortuary at the hospital. This is the first actual positive
            certification of death in respect of Philip Steele.

            In relation to question (2) there is no evidence or record to confirm the
            time Philip Steele arrived at the Northern General Hospital.

            In relation to question (3) the hospital cannot confirm how Philip Steele
            arrived at hospital. It can only be assumed that he arrived by ambulance.



                                                                             Cont...


    PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
                                    -   2 -




Despite inquiries with ambulance personnel it has not been possible to
establish who conveyed Philip Steele to the Northern General Hospital.

In relation to question (4) research shows that the bodies transported from
the Northern General Hospital to the temporary mortuary at the gymnasium,
were taken between 2000 hours and 2100 hours, 15 April 1989.

In relation to question (5) the visual evidence, as included in the file,
will be available to your clients on the day of the Inquest. However, should
your clients wish to view full visual evidence (video films and
photographs) this unfortunately will not be possible on the day of the
Inquest due to prior commitments by the video team. Should your clients
wish to view full visual evidence arrangements can be made with the West
Midlands Police Video Section on a suitable date convenient to your
clients.

Yours faithfully

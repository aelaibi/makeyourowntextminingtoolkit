                   /U
Thank you for your letter of 6 December on behalf of other members of your
family about the tragic events at Hillsborough and the calls for the inquiry to be
reopened. I would like to say first of all how saddened I was by this terrible
disaster and I fully understand your desire to reach a better understanding of
how your father died.

I have seen the Hillsborough programme and found it deeply moving and
harrowing. In the House of Commons, I gave an undertaking to consider
carefully the representations that have been made to reopen the public inquiry. I
emphasised that I would not take the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but
would need to be convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so.

I explained that in coming to a decision, I would consider whether there is any
new evidence, and, if so, whether that evidence appeared to be of such
significance that had it been put before Lord Taylor or the coroner, either the
outcome of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
different.

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide me with a
detailed report of all the points raised by the programme. I will reach a decision
on any further action to be taken as soon as I have been able to consider all the
issues. Meanwhile I would like you to know that my thoughts will be with you
and all the bereaved families.

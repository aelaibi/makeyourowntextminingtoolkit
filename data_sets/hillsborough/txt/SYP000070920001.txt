                        For the past twenty nine years I have been employed by the BBC and for

                        the last eight of these         I have worked at the                    ide Broadcast



                        On Saturday 15th April        1989,       I formed part of an outside broadcast

                        team covering the FA Cup Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham

                        Forest at Hillsborough Sh e f f i e jtfa . My specific task on this day was to

                        work alongside                                        who was using a portable       camera at

                        the side of the pitch. We were filming shots of all twenty two players

                        which were to be used at a future date.                        I travelled to the ground

                        from a nearby hotel and arrived at about                       10.00am on the day of the

                        match. Between 10.00am and 2.00pm I was                       inside

                        the ground available       for any recording that was                  required.

                        At 2 . 0 0 pm along with              , I walked around the track to our filming
                                                                                                                          PAGE              2

     position which was at the West Stand End of the ground behind the

 white     line which denotes the press area behind the goal to the right

 hand side.

 At this time I noticed that the Spion Kop was quite full. The                                                           pens on

 the ext remet ies of the West stand appeared relatively empty but

     pens 3 and 4 behind the goal were quite full,                                                       pen 4 in particular as             I

 re cal1 .



 After about 2.30pm I began to see fans in the West Stand climbing                                                                 from

 pens 3 into pen 2. At no time did I see any Policemen or stewards                                                                 in

 Pens 3 or 4.



 Between 2.30pm and 3.00pm I noticed that more and more                                                           people were

 climbing out of pen 3 these                                                     people had obviously been crushed and

 when they had got out they appeared very re.l ieved. During this                                                         period

Pens 3 and      4 became extremely full and I saw Police                                                       leading about       a

 dozen fans     around                               track behind                          the goal.    I assumed that these

 people had     come /Form pens 3 and 4. Many of them were crying even

 though they were fully grown men.



The game kicked off and there was a deafening noise from the crowd.                                                                     I

 became aware that more and more                                                        people were    climbing out of pens 3 and

4 a n d spilling onto the pitch. Eventually one fan fell on the ground

 in front of us. Then several more began to lie down on the                                                           pitch.

Many of them had torn clothing and others were breathing very heavy.

By this time it was apparent that something was terribly wrong.

           and myself decided to turn our attention onto what was

 happening    in Pens 3 and 4, and we L e gan filming.                                                      I could see the

 people at the front of Pen 3 bei/g                                                        crushed against the wire mesh o f

 the fence. Many of them had t\y/i r faces jammed tightly against the

mesh. People were being          pulled out of the pen but those     in the first

three     rows could not be removed.        I saw a frantic Policeman trying to

rip the mesh away with his bare hands.             I. saw a Policeman and

Policewoman gesturing to the people at the rear of the pen to move

so u nd s.



We had moved away from the fence because a Policeman wearing a flat

cap had told us that we would be arrested if we did not move away.

          and myself then moved to a point by the players tunnel              on the

half way where we had a camera and communication system that                 linked us

up with the control        vehicle outside the ground.      I spoke to the

producer and then asked the to control vehicle and handed over the

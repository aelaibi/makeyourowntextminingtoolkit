           At S »30am    (0830)    o n Saturday     15 April     1989 (150489),             I commenced duty

            at Hackenthorpe Police Station?            Sheffield,       in connection with duties

            to be performed at Hillsborough Football Ground,                         where the Semi-Final

            was to be played.



           My duties for/ that day were uniform foot patrol, in company with PC
                ,0 SSVy/                                                    ^

            Stand around the a/ea of tfye P l a y e r s ’ Entranee                    This duty was as

            described    in the/operational         order,     Serial 4, under the supervision of

           PS 266 JACQUES/ (If 0 1 / PS 2 6 6 ) .



           At about 3.05pm        (1505)   that date,     shortly after the match started,                      I

           was aware of a disturbance           inside the ground.                  This fact was
                                                                                       PAGE

         communicated via the stewards on the South Stand gates and tannoy

         announcements    I was not      in possession of a personal    radio and did not

         hear any radio messages,



         I remained in the vicinity of the P l a y e r s ’ Entrance throughout the

         incident and assisted      in the control    of persons   leaving the stand and

         ensured a free flow of traffic for emergency vehicles arriving and

         leaving the ground via that route.



         Following the crowd dispersing I resumed with PS JACQUES and attended

         as a serial at the Road Traffic Garage,        C l a y w h e e 1s Ln, Sheffield,   from

         where we obtained transport to Hackenthorpe Police Station to go off

         duty at S.00pm   (0S00)    that date.



         At no time during the incident did I go into the; ground or was

         involved in dealing with any of the injured or d e a d .

Dear Sirs,

Re:    Anthony David Bland, deceased
       Inquest - 21st December 1993

Your letter of the 8th February is to hand today and your request is noted.

The Coroner has asked me to enquire as to your interest in this particular case and the
reason for your request. The Coroner also asked me to draw your attention to Rule 57 of
The Coronersâ€™ Rules (1984) so that you may make any representations upon which he can
base a decision as to whether whoever is instructing you is a "properly interested person".


Yours faithfully,




Administrative Officer

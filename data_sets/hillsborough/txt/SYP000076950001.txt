               I w ou l d    put myself        as a s upporter               of football            rather     than a football

    the S p i o n H op end of Hi 11 sbo r o\t^h^whi ch was                      o cc up ie d by Notts Forest

    fan^x.       This year        I a lso    got two tickets              t h ro ug h             wife    for    the

S p i o n ^(o^> a nd        I paid £ 6 . 0 0      for each ticket

O n S atur day            15thX>H"'" i 1 1*989 a long w it h my fo dr teen year                     old son

    I got        into the       ground at about            o ’c l o c k .     We took up a m id kop

    p o si ti on just       to the       right    of the      goal    posts       looking onto           the    pitch.

At        that     time    I had quite a bit of body space a ro u n d me but as kick off

    t ime neared          the    crowd    built      up and    by 2 . 3 0      prn I felt quite

    uncomfortable           because       people were         so    compact a r o u n d me.           Anot he r    thing

    jthat struck me w h e n            I got     into the ground was                the a b s en ce      of Liverpool
/
    Fans    in the L ep p i n g s        Lane    terraces,         the West and N o rt h S ta nd seats

    s ee m e d    pretty full       of Liverpool         Fans       but     other       than behind       the goal at

    that    end there           didn't    ap pe ar    to be m an y Liv er po ol            fans    standing.           This

    stuck out b ecause             I expect Liverpool               fans     to out sing a nd be more

    n oisy g e n e r a l l y X t h a n Fo re st fans but this w a s n ’t happening at this
                                        O     z  ,  W
    time.    The s i d e \ o f the L ep pings Lane terraces did not fill up as kick

    off a p p r o a c h e d a l t n t m g h the sections            beh in d the goal          seemed to b e
                X
    q uite c o nd ensed in numbers.              At this            time     there       d i d n ’t appear      to be

    any    problems        in the gr ou nd a l t h o u g h         I was a ware of some Forest                   fans

    coming        into    the gro un d      late a nd o bv i o u s l y       the worse        the wear         for drink

    The m a t ch ki ck ed off on time an d just a fter                          kick      off Forest       had a

    couple of        corner       kicks     down at the L ep pi ng s            Lane      end and at that          time

    there s ee med to be a lot of a c t i v i t y by the L iv erpool                              fans    behind that

    goal.         I put this       down to them being               co nc er ne d about Liverpool                being

    under        pressure.       S h o r t l y after    that B e a r d s l e y hit the Forest                  bar a nd   I

    then became aware              that at the other               end that         being L ep pings Lane end

Li ve r po o l       s u pp or te rs were        climbing      over the fences and onto                    the    pitch

    going        up to the       players whilst         the game was            still      being    played.

W i t h i n the next            four     or five minu te s          it g r a d u a l l y u nf ol de d that more

    a n d more      people were          getting     onto the        pitch.         I saw a police officer

run on the           pitch to the           referee and then the game was                   stopped.

E v e r y o n e at the Ho p end thought                that     it was a crowd invasion by the

L i v e r po o l    fans a nd    in fact       one young L i v e rp oo l         fan    ran the      length of

the      pitch to the Ho p and a p p e a r e d           to taunt         the Notts Forest             fans     in an

a g g r e s s i v e manner.          I was    aware    that some Forest             fans    near me were

b ec o m i n g     i nsensed    by this       behaviour,        he was     e v e n t u a l l y a p p r e h e n d e d by

a police           officer who        rugby tacked him m uc h to the a pp la us e                    of the Hop

end.       S h o r t l y after       that an e l d er ly Liver pool           f an a man of about               fifty

y ea rs w a l k e d up the Ko p end an d he too                    s t a rt ed taunting         the Forest

fans,      but he w a l k e d off w he n a p p r o a c h e d        by police.           It was      now obvious

to me      looking      down to that           end that       lots of      people were          receiving

first a i d treatment                from every on e that was             down there,          it was at        this

time      that      I became a ware          that at    least      one    person had died beca us e                 I

s aw a policeman           put a       coat over a body w h i c h was               lying on the            pitch

midway       b etween the goal              are a an d the half way           line to the          right      hand

side as          I looked at         the    pitch.     I then saw an a mbulance ar ri ve                     on the

pitch from the Ko p end of the ground.                             I then     realised that            the match

would      not      restart     so    I said to my son that we                should       leave,      at    first

he w a n t e d to stay but             I insisted we          leave      so we    left the ground at

3 . SO    pm.       W hen trying       to    1eave    the ground         I had to       insist     to the

gaternan that          he ope ne d the         gate    because at first             he said he         c o u l d n ’t

open      it until      half-time,           after    I e x p l a i n e d to him what was            happening

on the       pitch he op en ed             the gate an d we        left onto Pen is to ne Road.

As we      left the gr ou nd           I saw a unit        of    police      officers       standing almost

to a t t e n t i o n on the          central    re se rv at io n of P e n i s t o n e R oad exac tl y

o pp o s i t e     the mai n Kop       turnstiles.       I went       over    to these         p olicemen and             I

r e co g n i s e d one of the m who            is a dog         handler      that      lives    local       to me       in

                                           , although    I dont know his name.                    I said to him

    lads are         overrun'.              He    offe re d    no.c om me nt     to me at all

    a nd a p p e a r e d    to be s m i li ng           in a way that he was              glad to be out of            it.

    I w a l k e d ar ou nd the              police      line and across the              road and         I saw about

    three or four m o u n t e d                  po 1 i c ^ & f i cer-S in thejt-ayby.           I said the same

    sort     of things           to them a nd got the same                     response as before,            at this       I

    t ho ug ht      to myself          if        they    c a n ’tbe b ot he re d then        I 'mNgetting      awa y as

    q u i c k l y as      p&ssible. At this stage                  I      was a p p a l l e d by tire lack of

    response         ts^'om trn^ offic er s             because        I c o u l d n ’t believe they were            just

    s ta nd i ng a b o i N ^ w hi 1st all              hell was        going    on inside      the ground.

    We got        back     to th.e car and              s wi tched on the         radio     to hear that        five

    people were            dead,       knowing         that my wife w o u l d         be w o r r i e d    I phoned    home

    to    reassure         her    that we were alright.

    I was        driving     home,          w he n quite       close     I was    flagged down by a man who

    w a n t e d to go to the ground.                      He    told me that          he was a St.          Johns

    A m b u l a n c e m a n and    I was aware            that they had been asking                      for v olunteers

    to a tt e n d on the           radio.            I d r o pp ed my son off          home,     then w it h my

    h az a r d    lights and h ea dl i g h t s            on    I drove        the man to wi th in half mile                of

    the    gro un d because             I        was    unable to go a ny further.

    Since        that day        I have          thou gh t a     great deal a bout          it and have strong

    f e e li ng s about          the    f ollowing        things?"

    I think         that    the gr ou nd tanoy system and s c o r e b o a r d                    could have         been

    used to         inform e ve ryone what was                   going     on and that         the police

    o f f ic er s    standing a r o u n d outside                 should have been brought                  into the

    g r ou n d to assist           the       other      people     in dealing w ith the disaster.                     The

    o v e rr i d i n g    thing    is that there               d i d n ’t app ea r    to be any e me rgency

    proc ed ur e         to follow only a normal                   o c c ur re nc e   procedure.

    I would         be will in g        to a t t e n d at the enqu ir y to give evidence                       if

    req ui re d to do so.

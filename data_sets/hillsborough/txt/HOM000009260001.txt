HILLSBOROUGH:   LETTER FROM MR ROY EDEY
Miss Bannister's note of 30 August said that the Home Secretary
wanted further consideration to be given to the correspondence in
the Times from Mr Roy Edey and Mr Grayson at the meeting on
September 7 .

Mr Edey has now written to the Home Secretary, the Prime Minister
and Lord Justice Taylor direct.   Neither we nor the police know
anything about him.

I attach the correspondence, for which Miss Bannister had asked
for a P/S reply, together with a draft which might provide a
basis for the further discussion.

Incs
Thank you for your letter of 24 August to the Home Secretary with

which you enclosed an extract from "The Times" and a copy of an

article written by you on safety of football ground.



May    I take this          opportunity to refute the accusations made in

your letter to the Home Secretary and to The Times newspaper that

the Home Office has been guilty of dereliction of duty by failing

to    issue       regulations       or    give     guidance         as   to     the     terms      and

conditions to put into safety certificates for sports grounds.



Can     I   say     that     since       1975,     Home    Office        guidance          to    local

authorities         has    been   that      in     imposing        conditions         they      should

follow the principles             set out in the Guide to Safety in Sports

Grounds       (the Green      Guide).            Since the Guide necessarily deals

with a variety of circumstances, it does not, in itself, provide

a     satisfactory        basis   for      enforcing       safety        standards:             it was

never intended that it should. The main instrument of control is

the certificate itself.



Until last year when it was extended to apply to sports grounds

generally,         the     Safety    of     Sports        Grounds        Act    197 5      specified

particular           matters        which        should       be     included           in      safety

certificates          for    stadia.             The   Home    Office          has    also      issued

statutory         guidance     on what to          look    for in safety              inspections.

But the general principle of the legislation is that the precise

terms       and     conditions       of     a     safety      certificate            are     for   the

determination of the local authority, who are required to consult

the police and, as appropriate, either the fire authority or the

 building authority before issuing or amending a certificate.
Ministers have hitherto been of the view that to prescribe the

detailed     conditions         of safety certificates          by regulation would

only     fetter    this    discretion.         There    is     no   such   thing   as   a

standard      safety      certificate:        they   are     unique    documents   each

relating to the conditions in the sports grounds to which they

apply.



The Home Office is monitoring,                through the police and the Fire

Service,     the extent to which the interim recommendations of the

Taylor report are being implemented.                   The Department has already

indicated in a circular letter to local authorities, police and

emergency services and to football clubs and other sports or

organisations,          that     notwithstanding       the     reservation    to   which

I have      referred,     consideration       is being given to any necessary

enforcement        of     the    Report's     recommendations         by   means   of   a

Statutory      Instrument.           This would be implemented under section

15A    of    the   Safety       of   Sports   Grounds    Act    197 5 thus    requiring

safety      certificates        to   include mandatory terms          and conditions.

Preliminary reports do not give g*- grounds to believe that such a

measure will in fact be necessary.



The    circular     letter       also took the opportunity to remind               local

authorities of their powers under section 10 of the 197 5 Act for

use if there is judged to be a serious risk to spectators in any

 part of the ground.



 You may      be aware      from Recommendation          14 of the Interim Report

 that local authorities have been urged forthwith to ensure that

 all designated grounds within their area should be issued with a
safety      certificate.             We   have    asked   those     involved    in   the

certification process to take urgent action on this, as with all

other recommendations.               The responsibility for ensuring that such

grounds     have a safety certificate rests with local authorities

under section 1(3) of the 1975 Act.                  The Government is conscious

that the Act does not empower any central authority to supervise

the way in which local authorities carry out these regulations.



Lord Justice Taylor has indicated that he will consider whether

there should be some national                 oversight or inspection of local

authority responsibilities in relation to safety in sportsgrounds

in stage 2 of his Inquiry.                 You will probably have seen that the

Government has already amended its Football Spectators'                         Bill so

that,      if   it   is   considered       appropriate,      this   supervisory      role

could      be   given     to   the    proposed    Football      Licensing   Authority.

Whether further measures are necessary to secure improvements in

public safety at sportsgrounds will be a matter for decision when

Lord Justice Taylor has published his final report.



I   hope    that     this      reassures    you    that   the   Home   Office   is    not

complacent about th> issues identified in the Hillsborough tragedy

or those which preceded it.

Dear Home Secretary/

     I enclose a copy of letters from Mr Grayson and me published
in "The Times" last Saturday. I also enclose a copy of an article
I have written. Your duty is clear. • It is to take control
of safety at British football grounds. You have the right and
the duty to guide local authorities as to the contents of safety
certificates. You should at once issue regulations in this
regard in the form of a statutory instrument.

    It is your duty to see that all 92 league football grounds
have valid safety certificates in accordance with your regulations.
You must also draw the attention of local authorities to their
right to issue Prohibition Notices in respect of any ground
or part of a ground they consider unsafe for spectators and
that you expect them to exercise their powers to ensure that
any unsafe accommodation is not used until it is made safe.
No terraces £&£& perimeter fencing should be used unless it
can demonstrably be shown that immediate access to the pitch
is available without resort to cutting equipment.

    I would be glad to know that you are remedying the situation
as if nothing is done and a further tragedy occurs I for one
will hold you responsible.

    I enclose a copy of a letter I have written to the Prime
Minister and a letter I have written to Lord Justice Taylor
for your information.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Prime Minister,

    I enclose a copy of letters from Mr Grayson and me published
in "The Times" of last Saturday. I also enclose a copy of an
article I have written on the situation surrounding safety at
British football grounds.

    I have asked the Home Secretary to take immediate action
in providing regulations giving guidance to local authorities
as regards Safety Certificates. I have also asked him to ensure
that all the 92 league football clubs have valid and up-to-date
certificates in accordance with his regulations. If local authorities
are not satisfied that grounds or any part of a ground is not
safe to spectators the Home Secretary must direct local authorities
to issue Prohibition Notices as provided by legislation.

    Should another tragedy occur I will make it very clear to
the British people that it is entirely due to failure of Government.
I would be glad to know that this matter is receiving your urgent
attention.

    The second worst disaster was at a Scottish Football Ground.
Can you therefore please explain how it is that the identity
card scheme by which you set such great store is not to apply
to Scotland? In any event I believe such a scheme to be unworkable
as has just been found to be the case in Holland.

    I enclose a copy of a letter I have written to the Home
Secretary and a letter I have written to Lord Justice Taylor
for your information.

Yours sincerely,




Roy Edey.

The Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Taylor,
50 Queen Anne's Gate,
London.
SW111 9AT.


Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

     I enclose a copy of a letter of mine published in last Saturday's
"Times" for your information. I also enclose a copy of an article
I have written. I find it surprising that in your report to
the Home Secretary you have not drawn his attention to the Prohibition
Notice procedure set out in Section 23 of the Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sports Act 1987. It is right that you should
also see letters I have written to the Prime Minister and the
Home Secretary and so I enclose copies.

     I was horrified but not surprised to see the result of a
survey carried out at football grounds by "The Sunday Times"
last Saturday. Football management has always been,and allowed
to be^,irresponsible. That, as you know, is why I have pressed
for the Director^of Sheffield Wednesday to face judge and jury
on charges of manslaughter. I have little doubt that when the
matter has received full consideration by the Director of Public
Prosecutions charges will be laid accordingly. There is in my
opinion      overwhelming prima facie case to be answered.

     This season I have been at Lords and the Oval cricket grounds
when an appeal for a doctor to go to the pavillion "if one is
in the ground" has been broadcast. At the Oval whilst they had
a first aid post it was not manned. It seems to me ludicrous
that large stadia such as these should have no doctor of their
own and so far as the Oval was concerned no manned first aid
post. No doubt you will take these comments into consideration
in your final report.

Yours sincerely,




Roy Edey.

                safety at football grounds




     Football is big business. Manchester United has just been
sold for 20 million pounds. Pools promoters make vast profits
and the Government receive 40 million pounds a year in revenue
from the pools.    Millions are paid in transfer fees for top
players.   That many games should continue to be played in
substandard stadia with third rate amenities and without regard
to the safety of the paying spectators is a national disgrace.

     250 people who have been predominately young have lost
their lives in four separate disasters at British football
grounds in the last 40 years.    Mr Douglas Hurd has been Home
Secretary when the terrible fire occurred and 56 lives were
lost at Bradford and when the worst disaster of all took place
at Hillsbrough Stadium on the 15th April. Two days after both
disasters he told Parliament that he had set up inquiries under
Mr Justice Popplewell and Lord Justice Taylor respectively.

     In his report to Mr Hurd in January 1986 Mr Justice
Popplewell said: "I have to say that almost all the solutions I
have proposed have been previously considered in detail by many
distinguished Inquiries over a period of 60 years."    In other
words if it had not been for inertia on the part of successive
Governments to exact statutory provisions for safety of
spectators at football grounds no tragedies would have occurred
and no inquiries would have been necessary.

      There was a perfectly good blueprint for safety laid down
by inquiries going back to 1924 following crowd disorder at
Wembley Stadium at the first cup final there on the 28th April
1923.    That inquiry recommended that the club was responsible
for the safety of spectators inside the ground and that the
police were responsible for the preservation of law and order
and for no other purpose.

     After 1924 there was no further inquiry until 1946 when 33
people lost their lives at Bolton Wanderers Football Ground.
50.000 spectators were expected and 85,000 turned up and as a
result because of the press of people in an enclosure two
barriers collapsed.      It is    interesting to note that the
previous best crowd at Bolton of 43,000 hadbeen amply policed
by 60 police officers but 103 officers was inadequate to police
85.000 spectators.    There was no hooliganism in those days!
Mr R Moelwyn Hughes      KC who took the inquiry called for
legislation to ensure implementation of the safety measures he
recommended. He said: "The legislation should empower the Home
Secretary to issue general regulations for different grounds
and the broad conditions necessary for safety."      Absolutely
nothing was done following his report.

             In 1971 66 people died at Ibrox Park as a result of
        massive crowd surges on a gangway towards the end of the match.
        This tragedy led to the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 and
        introduced a system of Safety Certificates.    Section 6 (2) of
        that Act enabled the Home Secretary to make regulations for
        safety at sports grounds.   No such regulations have ever been
        introduced.   Yet it is vital that there should be uniform
        minimum requirements laid down for Safety Certificates. In his
        report   Mr  Justice   Popplewell said,    "There   is a   real
        responsibility to ensure that those people who attend sporting
        events can feel confident that all reasonable steps have been
        taken to ensure their safety in case of emergency."        That
        responsibility has still not been discharged by the Home
        Secretary.

             Following the Bradford fire the Fire Safety and Safety
        Places of Sports Act 1987 was put on the statute book. In the
        main it dealt with fire safety and safety of stands at sports
        grounds and did not deal with terraces. It did however, under
        Section 23, enable local authorities to issue Prohibition
        Notices when they are of the opinion that admission of
        spectators to a ground or any part of a ground involves risk to
        them so serious that until steps have been taken to reduce it
        to a reasonable level admission of spectators ought to be
        prohibited or restricted.

             The Act was supplemented by an updated Green Guide issued
        by the Government as a Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.
        Incredibly after three major disasters already it says on the
        back that it provides "Voluntary guidance to ground management,
        local authorities and technical specialists on measures for
        improving spectator safety at sports grounds."       Instead of
        implementing the Popplewell recommendations in legislative form
        the Home Secretary considered it was sufficient to introduce a
        guide on a voluntary basis!

             Paragraph 215 requires perimeter fencing gates to have a
        minimum width of 1.1 metres.    It goes on: "Provision of such
        gates as access points is particularly important to allow full
        access to the playing area for use as a place of safety in an
        emergency."   Most of those who died at Hillsborough were
        crushed against the perimeter fencing. Lord Justice Taylor
        finds at Paragraph 258 of his report: "The perimeter gates in
        the pens were not designed as exits."     In other words in an
        emergency those penned in were to have no chance of escape.
        Paragraph 264 is damning of the Government's Green Guide.   It
        says: "Even if the width of Gates 3 & 4 had complied with the
        present Green Guide standard, they would have been wholly
        inadequate to relieve pressure and release spectators swiftly
        on 15th April. Moreover the Green Guide says nothing about the
        number of gates required for a pen of given size."
    .What is Lord Justice Taylor's response to this wholly
unsatisfactory state of affairs?     In my opinion he makes a
fantastic interim recommendation. It is to the effect that all
league football grounds which still have perimeter fencing
should have suitable and sufficient cutting equipment available
"to release numbers of spectators if necessary."    Decision as
to use is to be made by a nominated senior police officer at
the ground.   Yet in Paragraph 77 of the Taylor report there is
the stark comment on Hillsborough: "If no relief came in four
minutes there would be irreversible brain damage; if longer,
death."    It would probably take more than four minutes to
identify a serious emergency had arisen and by then it would be
too late.

     The other criticism I have of Lord Justice Taylor's report
is that he has ignored precedent.      He has accepted that the
police had assumed a role for safety of spectators on the
terraces.   He should not have done.    The Green Guide as have
all previous inquiry recommendations placed responsibility for
safety of spectators inside the ground on football club
management.    Lord Justice Taylor refers to club and police
responsibility as a very difficult grey area and an interim
recommendation is that there should be a written agreement
between   club   and   police  setting   out  their   respective
responsibilities for crowd safety and control. Lord Justice
Taylor has confused the issue and created a very grey area
which did not previously exist.         The Home Secretary by
statutory instrument should make it clear as to the division of
responsibility between club management and police and I hope he
will preserve the status quo before the Taylor Report muddied
the waters.    He must also issue comprehensive regulations for
safety at sports grounds.

     The Taylor Report shows that Sheffield United although a
designated club has operated for years without a safety
Certificate.    The Home Secretary must ensure that all
designated clubs are operating with safety certificates which
are up to date in every particular. Local authorities must be
directed to provide accordingly and those grounds or parts of
grounds   which they consider unsafe must      be  closed by
Prohibition Notices until they are made safe.     No terraces
should be open with perimeter fencing unless the club can
demonstrably show that immediate access to the pitch is
available   in an emergency, without the aid of cutting
equipment.

     Victoria Hicks    was 19 reading chemistry at Liverpool
University, Sarah Hicks was 15 at Haberdasher Askes School.
Trevor   and Jenny Hicks lost two beautiful daughters at
Hillsborough and their lives will never be the same again.
They had no need to die.    Jenny has told me she would never
have allowed Sarah to go on the terraces had she known they
were not to be stewarded.       She cannot understand why the
Governments Green Guide was voluntary and did not have the
force of law.    This unsatisfactory situation still subsists
today and must be remedied without further delay.

     The Home Secretary owes it to Trevor and Jenny Hicks and
all the bereaved and the hundreds who have been injured
physically and mentally in these disasters to ensure that
grounds are safe and that such a tragedy never happens again.

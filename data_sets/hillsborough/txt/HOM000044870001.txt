Home Secretary


HILLSBOROUGH: FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE FAMILY
SUPPORT GROUP


Issue


Letter (attached) from Mr Trevor Hicks, Chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support
Group, about the terms of reference for the Scrutiny.


Timing


2.          An early reply would be helpful.


Summary


3.          Mr Hicks sets out at length concerns about the way in which the terms of
reference for the scrutiny seem to be being interpreted. Underlying the concerns is
the Support Group’s sense that the scrutiny is not coming to the conclusions which
they would like, and a veiled threat that they will decry the whole exercise if the
outcome is unwelcome. They feel that too much of the burden is being put on them
to produce new evidence which would have affected the outcome of any of the
previous proceedings. Answers can be given to some of their concerns about the
nature and purpose of the scrutiny, but it is not likely to overturn the outcomes of
previous proceedings in the ways which they seek.

Recommendation


4.         A draft reply to Mr Hicks is attached.


Consideration


5.         The concerns of the Support Group are difficult to capture concisely, but they
come down to five broad issues:


            (i)        They question whether Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has the power to
                       overturn the findings of the Divisional Court or order a fresh hearing.


            (ii)       Their understanding of what constitutes new evidence is different from
                       that of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.


           (iii)       They believe that the CPS have closed minds about the possibility of
                       further proceedings.


           (iv)        They ask whether a limited form of public inquiry might be possible,
                       acknowledging that a full inquiry starting from scratch like the Taylor
                       Inquiry would not be right.


           (v)         They feel that they are being asked to prove too much too quickly and
                       without access to all the information.


(i)        Powers o f the Scrutiny


6.         In 1993 the Divisional Court considered and refused judicial review of the
verdict of the inquests.            Although Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is a Lord Justice of
Appeal, he is not acting in his formal judicial capacity in carrying out this scrutiny and




f:\oppu\hou\longsub\pp0469pd.doc
has no power to overturn the decision of the court. Nothing other than a decision of
a higher court could do that.


7.         Mr Hicks suggests that that gives the families no hope of overturning the
inquest verdicts, which they regard as so unsatisfactory. Their particular concern is
the decision by the coroner to impose a 3.15pm cut off time in considering evidence.
One of the major issues which the judge is considering is whether there is fresh
evidence which bears on that decision - it is one of the central issues in the scrutiny.
Although he does not have the power directly to overturn the decision of the court he
is considering whether there are any grounds for the Attorney General to consent to
an application to the High Court for a new inquest. That would be the route by which
the Support Group’s objectives might be achieved.


(ii)       New evidence


8.         On the issue of what constitutes new evidence, it is inevitable with any major
disaster that over the years new information emerges which was not known at the
time. You made clear in announcing the Judge’s appointment that the purpose was
to establish whether there was any material evidence which was of such significance
that further inquiries would be justified or which would be relevant to the statutory
functions of the Attorney, the DPP or the Chief Constable.         In order to justify re­
opening the previous decisions, evidence would have to be material not simply new.
It will be for the judge to report whether in his view there is material evidence, but the
decision about the outcomes will rest with you and the others who have statutory
functions to perform.


(Hi)        CPS views


9.         On the role of the CPS the support group are concerned that they have not
seen all the papers held by the DPP and are particularly unhappy about a letter
written from a chief crown prosecutor on the day you announced the scrutiny. ( A
copy of that letter is attached to Mr Hick’s letter.) That letter reiterates the point



f:\oppu\hou\longsub\pp0469pcLdoc
 which you made in your oral statement that the view of the DPP at that time was that
 the material so far presented to her would not justify fresh criminal proceedings. The
 letter goes on to stress that the CPS will consider very carefully anything which
 emerges from the scrutiny. The letter was intended to be reassuring, but Mr Hicks
 seems to have interpreted it in the opposite sense. The CPS have not “closed” the
 book on Hillsborough and would consider anything which might emerge.


 (iv)        A limited inquiry


 10.         On the issue of a limited inquiry, that is in effect what the scrutiny is intended
to be. Its purpose is to establish whether there are sufficient grounds for a wider-
 reaching investigation. But Mr Hicks can be reassured that no possible outcome has
 been ruled in or out.


(v)          “Burden o f proof”



11.         Their concern about what they call the burden of proof is perhaps the biggest
misunderstanding.                   They seem to believe that it should be the purpose of the
scrutiny to act in effect as the families’ advocate, seeking out all possible areas
where some shred of new material might exist.                    However, this would turn the
exercise on its head. The origins of the exercise lay in claims originally made a year
or so ago that there was new evidence which called into question the previous
findings. The scrutiny therefore started by asking anyone who believed that there
was new evidence to bring it forward for consideration. The judge has approached
the task by looking at what was alleged and following that up to establish the
substance of the claims. Given the extent to which Hillsborough has been examined
in previous proceedings, there would have to be some clear cause for overturning all
that. There is in that sense a burden of proof on those who remain unhappy about
the previous proceedings to show good cause why they should be set aside - there
does need to be some reasonable doubt that the previous outcomes were wrong.




f:\oppu\hou\longsub\pp0469pd. doc
 12.        On timing, you announced the judge’s appointment at the end of June and he
requested written submissions by the beginning of September. Those submissions
were then used for the basis of discussions with the parties during October and
 November. As you have made clear, it is open to the judge to take as long as he
likes, but to be fair to all those concerned it should not be allowed to drag out any
longer than necessary. At some point a line has to be drawn.


Handling


 13.        It is difficult to be critical of the Family Support Group without appearing
insensitive - indeed it would be impossible to be publicly critical. Given what they
have suffered, it is entirely understandable that they should use every possible
means to further their case.             But I cannot help feeling that their current
correspondence is deliberately disingenuous on some issues and seeking to delay
the completion of the scrutiny. You may want to discuss this with Lord Justice Start-
Smith when you meet him on Thursday 11 December. We will put forward briefing
for the meeting under separate cover.


14.         Mr Hicks said that he has not released his letter to the media “at this time” but
it must be likely that he will do so and that your reply will similarly become public.

        Rt Hon Jack Straw MP -Home Secretary
        Home Office
        Queen Anne’s Gate
        London SW1 9AT


        30th November 1997


        Dear Mr Straw,

        re: Hillsborough Scrutiny

        You will recall that in our letter of 9th November, we said we would write to you to highlight the
        Group's concerns relating to the Terms of Reference of the Hillsborough Scrutiny.

        At the outset I would point out that this letter is not intended to undermine the appointment and/ or
        foie of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. Indeed, we are pleased that he took the time and trouble to meet
        the families in Liverpool and you are aware that we have accepted, admittedly with some reservation,
        his apology for the offensive gaffe about latecomers.

        I trust you will concede that this is in keeping with the responsible attitude our group has always
        adopted and that our forbearance should not to be seen as weakness or diminution of our resolve.

        We remain committed to assisting the Scrutiny, however we have considerable disquiet at some areas
        o f the Terms of Reference and /or the interpretation that appears to have been adopted.

         This letter seeks clarification of these areas and places on the record our deep concerns.

         The families' initial reaction to your statement to the House of Commons on 30th June was positive and
         we felt that you seemed determined that the Scrutiny would be a thorough and just one. Our view was
         based on the wording of your statement, your demeanor and responses to questions both on the floor
         of the House and during our meetings.

         We felt that your statement was balanced, gave a clear commitment and culminated by “saying it all”
         in the last few words:-

         In our view it represented a huge step in the right direction and understandably raised within the group
         a legitimate expectation of the eventual attainment of justice.

    Sadly that view is changing and we are now concerned that the “legal small print” rather than the spirit
    of your statement is being applied. It may be that our expectations were too high or that our treatment
    over the last eight years has jaundiced our judgement but we would respectfully suggest that Lord
    Justice Stuart-Smith's practical interpretation of the Terms o f Reference of the Scrutiny appear to us to
    be at variance with your stated intentions.

    There are five major areas of concem:-

            1)      Relationship with the Divisional Court/ Judicial Review

            2)      Definition o f “new” evidence

            3)      Attorney General i Director of Public Prosecutions

            4)      no “limited” Inquiry

            5)      prima facia case /burden of proof

    1) Relationship with the Divisional Court

     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has repeatedly stated that he is not a Court of Appeal of the Divisional Court
     and that he cannot reverse their findings even if he thought they were wrong.

     If this is the case, it presents us the families with insurmountable difficulties and with no prospect of
     remedy. It effectively renders the whole scrutiny a waste of time and money.

     As you are probably aware, the Judicial Review proceedings involved only six of the families and to a
     very great extent concentrated on the legal process at the court of first instant. It also took place
     before much of the current evidence was in the public domain and/or the families possession.

     However, the Divisional Court made certain findings which arguably could be deemed to apply to all
     families. For example, the Court upheld the coroners imposition of the 3.15 cut-off time and as you are
     well aware that is one o f the major issues which continue to concern families. The Coroners decision
     may have been lawful but it is manifestly unjust and has denied us the opportunity to investigate critical
     life or death actions (or non action!).

     It seems manifestly unjust that the whole of the Hillsborough Family Support Group now appear to be
     saddled with that decision without the Court having heard any details relevant to these other cases.

     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has on occasions conceded that if there is fresh evidence that puts a different
     complexion on the decision of the High Court then the matter may have to be reconsidered.

     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has also said that he does not have the power to order either a fresh judicial
     inquiry or a re-opening of the Taylor Inquiry. Neither is he a Court of Appeal. What then is his role?
     What does he have the power to do?
     Obviously, there is a great deal of confusion and we are at a loss to say with any certainty just what
     families can hope to achieve out of this Scrutiny.

     We are of course unable to take legal advice on this confusion as the Scrutiny is unprecedented.
01/12 '97 08:51     FAX 01729 840602                 TREVOR HICKS                                          @04




  We trust you will agree that this is a major problem and is a clearly a matter upon which families (and
  in our view, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith!) require and indeed are entitled to urgent clarification.

  21 Definition of “New Evidence”

  In your statement to the House you said:

          (Para 18) We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other
          evidence which has been submitted. He will also consider any further material which
          interested parties wish to submit.

   It is our belief that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith seems to be restricting the Scrutiny to a definition of
   “fresh evidence” much narrower than the above statement. From the many comments contained in the
   transcripts of meetings we believe he is only really considering anything which could have affected:

   i)     the outcome of Lord Taylor's Inquiry;
   ii)    the verdict of the jury at the inquest;
   iii)   the decision o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions not to take criminal proceedingsagainst any
           person in connection with the disaster; or
   iv)    the decision not to pursue disciplinary proceedings against any police officer.

   It is the Group’s submission that such a narrow interpretation is fundamentally flawed for the following
   reasons:-

   a)     This does not satisfy the Terms of Reference (page 9 line 13): - “To ascertain whether cny
           evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15thApril 1989 which
          was not available; ”

   b)     It is not consistent with Terms of Reference (page 9 line 26):- “To draw to their attention any
           evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to their respective duties:.”

   c)     It seems to disallow the final sentence(page 9 line 2 8 ) “ and to advise whether there is any
           other action which should be taken in the public interest. ”

   It can be argued however that this definition is entirely consistent with (page 9 line 37)

            “First to advise me whether any evidence not previously available is o f such significance as to
           justify establishment by the Secretary o f State fo r the Home Department o f a further fu ll
           public enquiry;....

   Does this last statement indicate you have therefore already ruled out a limited form of public inquiry?

    In our meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith on 30th September he indicated (transcript p3 lines 10-
    11 & 20-21) broad agreement with our concession in the written submission that it may not be sensible
    or even practical to re-run a full public enquiry and/or full inquests after all this time . We made that
    observation in the spirit of sensible compromise but are now concerned that it will be used against us in
    an “all or nothing” decision process.

    Which is it to be and will Lord Justice Stuart-Smith be the final arbitrator ??

                                                                                            Page 3 of         9
01/12    '97 08:51   FAX 01729 840602                  TREVOR HICKS                                          @05




  In the context of new evidence and/or its interpretation we would like to add the following comments:-

  i)          The outcome o f the Taylor Inquiry

              As you are aware, Lord Taylor was only concerned with events which happened at the
              Ground. Therefore, his Inquiry did not deal with, for example, whether or not facilities at
              the Northern General Hospital were adequate.

               This is of major concern to families as subsequent to the inquest it emerged that failure to
              activate the major disaster plan earlier meant that only a few staff had to cope with a large
              clinical workload in addition to implementing the major incident plan. This information was
              contained in an article in the British Medical Journal and is completely at odds with evidence
              given to Lord Justice Taylor.

              Although it may not have affected Lord Taylor’s principal finding (that the primaiy cause of
              the disaster was loss of police control) in itself it merits further investigation in the context
              of not only safety at sporting events, but emergency planning as a whole.

   ii)        The verdict of the jury at the Inquest

              This is the area which is causing the greatest concern to families.Such a narrow
              interpretation of your Terms o f Reference could potentially undermine the credibility o f the
              Scrutiny. If the verdict is the only aspect o f the Inquest which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is
              examining, then in effect he is empanelling himself as a twelfth juror which cannot be right.
              Further, this approach ignores the function o f an inquest which is to seek out and record as
              many of the facts concerning the death as the public interest requires.

               Families are deeply embittered by the 3.15 pm cut-off time imposed at the inquest. This
               single act, almost by itself, was sufficient to vitiate the legitimacy of the inquest as it
               prevented any meaningful examination o f the response of the emergency services.

               Surely the public interest requires that such an important aspect requires vigorous scrutiny.
               Whilst Lord Justice Taylor considered some aspects of the response of the emergency
               services, in the main he attributed any failings to the feet that the police were slow to
               recognise the extent of the disaster. He may be forgiven for perhaps presuming that this was
               a matter which would be more thoroughly investigated at the inquest but the fact of the
               matter is that it was not.

               Therefore, a major aspect of the disaster has never been fully examined. This will remain the
               case unless Lord Justice Stuart-Smith can be persuaded or instructed to widen his
               interpretation of the Terms of Reference.

               The Judge's insistence that he will only be persuaded by new evidence which would lave
               resulted in a verdict of unlawful killing fails to acknowledge families' expectations at the
               inquest that all the circumstances related to their loved ones deaths would be investigated
               and relevant questions answered, irrespective of the verdict.

    iii)         The decision o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions not t£ take criminal proceedings against
                 any person in connection with the disaster.

                 In relation to the above the HFSG is particularly concerned that it is not in a position to say
                 how any new evidence could affect the decision of the DPP not to prosecute as we have
                 never had access to the documentation upon which the DPP originally reached his decision,
                 neither do we know what possible charges were considered by the DPP. For example, did
                 he consider the common law offence o f misconduct in public office?

                 We are also concerned with the content and implications of Dru Sharpling’s (Chief Crown
                 Prosecutor - Crown Prosecution Service) letter written to us on the 30th June 1997- the
                 very day you announced the scrutiny!!

                  A copy is attached for we draw your attention to the phrase

                  “ At this stage the CPS takes the view that the material so fa r presented does notjustify
                  asking the police to re-open the investigation "

                  The timing and content hardly inspires us to believe in an open and fair appraisal by the
                  scrutiny. The CPS already seems to have an entrenched position and we seek assurance that
                  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will not be limited by them.


    iv)           The decision not to pursue disciplinary proceedings against any police officer

                  The Group's concerns here mirror those outlined at iii) above insofar as we do not know the
                  nature and extent of the evidence before the PCA. Nor are we aware o f any "defence"
                  advanced by Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.

                  We are only too aware that Duckenfield was allowed to retire on ill-health grounds and
                  Murray was not proceeded against- despite neglect of duty charges being initiated against
                  them both. The “evidence” was irrelevant to these decisions and the reasons they were
                  taken.

                  Paragraph 10 of your statement dealt with the Police Complaints Authority preferring
                  charges for neglect o f duty against Duckenfield and Murray and the lack of proceedings
                  ultimately.

                  The robust cross-party interventions and questions at the end of your statement clearly
                  illustrated the universal dissatisfaction that exists with Police Discipline matters in practise.
                  Our view is that the whole thing has became a travesty of farcical proportions !

                  Clearly, in the absence of relevant information, it is difficult for us to see how we can
                  evaluate any new evidence with a view to telling Lord Justice Stuart-Smith how this would
                  have affected either section iii) or iv) above. The CPS letter and their track record todate
                  does not inspire confidence and the total lack of information moves this into the distrust
                  zone. We are therefore totally dependant on the freedom to investigate and the robust
                  intentions of Lord Justice Stuart Smith. Please make sure he feels able to look at, comment,
                  and make recommendations, if required, in these areas.

    31 Attorney General/ DPP

    We feel the comments within (2) above clearly show our concern and we need say no more, other
    than to reinforce our concern and incredulity at their letter o f the 30th June.

    4) No limited inquiry

    Again, we merely repeat what we said earlier under (2c)

    SIPrima Facie Case/ Burden o f proof.

    We cautiously welcomed this scrutiny in the belief that its task was to examine whether there was a
    prima facie case to be answered. We accepted the methodology and timetable in this belief.

     It is o f great concern that we feel that the “burden o f proof’ placed upon us is now “beyond all
     reasonable doubt”. We feel that the families are being expected to prove everything, with minimi
     access to information, information that is being/ has been subject to delays by South Yorkshire Police,
     who unlike the HFSG seem to have infinite resources throughout this scrutiny, which, from the
     families point of view is proceeding with undue, almost indecent, haste. The task started late through
    I no fault o f ours, the burden has been shifted to being upon us and yet it is expected to remain within
     the timetable drawn up in June .

        Again, we seek clarification for ourselves (and perhaps Lord Justice Stuart Smith!) Is this a scrutiny
        prior to the proceedings or are these the proceedings ??

        I apologise for the length and complexity of this letter but trust you can understand our concerns
        having considered the above comments. It is important that these matters are dealt with now lest we
        have to cry “foul” later and the whole process is a waste of time and resource, achieving nothing but
        heightening the acrimony that already exists. We looked to new Labour for justice at last, please don’t
        let administrative convenience, inter-departmental wrangling, political dogma or fear of loss o f face
        affect the aims of this process.

        I close with a repeat of your words-

                   “ We owe it to everyone touched by the tragedy, but above all to the fam ilies o f those who
                   died, to get to the bottom o f this matter once andfo r all.

   HILLSBOROUGH

   Although we have not corresponded personally in the past, may I take the opportunity to
   express my deepest sympathy for your tragic loss in the Hillsborough Disaster.

   I am aware that you have been in contact with my colleague George Croston in York and I
   thought it appropriate to write to you to let you know the up to date position. As you know,
   the Crown Prosecution Service has been considering very carefully papers and tapes in
   relation to the disaster. In addition, we have examined the material supplied by you on behalf
   of the Hillsborough Family Support Group in your letter addressed to the Director of Public
   Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills QC, together with material supplied by Ms Adlington in
   her letter of 4 March 1997.

   I know you have heard the announcement by the Home Secretary that there is to be an
   independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any evidence which was not
   previously available relating to the Hillsborough Disaster. The terms of reference are:

           To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
           Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

                    (a)    To the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

                    (b)    To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                           purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                    (c)    To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                           disciplinary matters;




                           Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests of justice
01/12   '97 08:51   FAX 01729 840602               TREVOR HICKS                                       @12




            And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
            such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
            Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
            attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
            their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
            be taken in the public interest.

    It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
    help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
    responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
    England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are
    responsible for investigating offences and for deciding whether or not to charge or summons
    an offender.

    In recent months, senior lawyers within the CPS have examined large quantities of material
    arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of considering this material was to
    ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to start a criminal prosecution. If the
    evidence was sufficient, the CPS would invite the police to conduct a further formal
    investigation and prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges against named
    individuals.

    At this stage the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far presented
    does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

    In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute an independent scrutiny, the
    CPS will consider the matter again when the outcome of that scrutiny is known. I can assure
    you that the CPS will assist the independent scrutiny in whatever way it can and we will
    carefully examine its findings before making any further decisions.

    There are two outstanding issues upon which you await a reply, they are:

            •       the request for a meeting (as mentioned in the opinion of Alun Jones QC dated
                    3 March 1997); and

            •       a considered reply to your fax of 8 April 1997, enclosing your comments on
                    the statement of South Yorkshire police dated 1 April 1997.

    In relation to both of these, the Home Secretary’s announcement means that you can be
    assured that there is to be an independent scrutiny to establish whether material not
    previously considered might have an impact on decisions to be made, as well as whether
    there should be a further public enquiry. I imagine you will be inviting those responsible for
    the scrutiny to examine the material referred to by Alun Jones QC as well as your comments
    in relation to the South Yorkshire police press statement of 1 April 1997. I think the proper
    course would be for these issues to be considered by the independent scrutiny before any
    meeting is held with the CPS. I am particularly anxious to avoid any suggestion or
    impression that the CPS has in any way pre-judged die outcome of the independent scrutiny.
    I am sure you will appreciate the importance of ensuring that everything is done properly and
    in the right order. I will write to you again when the outcome of the scrutiny is known.

    I have sent a letter similar to this one to Ms Adlington.

    I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

                         Hillsborough: Oral Statement by the Home Secretary
                                       Monday 30* June 1997

1      3)         With permission Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the Hillsborough
2                 Stadium disaster
3
 4     4)         Ninety-six people lost their lives as a result o f the Hillsborough disaster, which happened
 5                on 15ihApril 1989. That was more than eight years ago but no one who saw the news
 6                reports on that dreadful Saturday will have forgotten those terrible events. For those who
 7                lost loved members o f their fam ily, the pain is ever present. Following Hillsborough,
 8                members o f this House were united in their determination to do all in their power to prevent
 9                anything like that ever happening again.
10
11      Public Inquiry
12
13      5)         Madam Speaker, after the Hillsborough disaster, a number o f inquiries and investigations
14                 took place, looking at aspects o f the tragedy. Perhaps the most thorough and wide ranging
15                 was the Public Inquiry led by Lord Taylor. The terms o f reference o f that Inquiry
16                encompassed not only inquiring into the disaster itself but also making recommendations
17                about crowd control and safety at sports events.
18
19      6)        Lord Taylor’s Inquiry took oral evidence from over 170 witnesses at public hearings
2 0               during May and June 1989 and considered many hours o f video evidence from different
21                sources. In his interim report in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that the disaster had a
2 2               number o f causes. He did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or person, but in
2 3               paragraph 278 he made clear that: " the main reason fo r the disaster was the failure o f
24                police control”
25
2 6     7)         In that interim report Lord Taylor made 43 immediate recommendations. His final report in
27                January 1990 made a further 76 recommendations. The developments which have taken
2 8                place since then in safety atfootball grounds and in the policing offootball matches have
29                 been based largely on those recommendations. Football in this country has been
30                transformed since the Taylor Report. To a large extent that is due to his wide ranging and
31                 soundly based conclusions.
32
33      Coroner’s Inquest
34
35      8)        The deaths which occurred on 15thApril 1989 were also the subject o f inquests conducted
36                by the Coroner o f the western district o f South Yorkshire.
37      9)        The jury at the Coroner’s inquest, after examining the evidence, found in March 1991 that
38                the cause o f death o f those who died at Hillsborough was accidental death. ”
39
40  West Midlands Police Investigations
41
42  10)     A further investigation was conducted by the West Midlands Police, supervised by the
43          Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any grounds for criminal
44          proceedings, and to consider whether any police officer should be subject to disciplinary
4 5         proceedings.

1      9)          That investigation involved the taking o f over 5000 statements and the scrutiny o f all the
2                  material which had previously been examined by the Taylor Inquiry After that investigation
3                  the evidence was sent to the Director O f Public Prosecutions, who concluded that no person
4                  should be subject to criminal proceedings. ”

6      10)         The Police Complaints Authority decided that the chief superintendent and superintendent
7                  in charge on the day shouldface disciplinary charges fo r neglect o f duty. In the event, the
 8                 chief superintendent retired due to ill health in advance o f a ruling by a disciplinary
 9                 tribunal under the police discipline rules. A disciplinary hearing cannot proceed when a
10                 police officer retires before the hearing takes place. The Police Complaints Authority later
11                 decided that disciplinary proceedings against the superintendent should be withdrawn
12                 because the retirement o f the chiefsuperintendent meant that what, in effect, was a joint
13                 allegation o f neglect o f duty could not be fairly heard in the absence o f the more senior
14                 officer.
15
16      Continued calls for further investigations
17
18      11)         Madam Speaker, Hon members will be familiar with the unhappiness o f the families o f
19                 those who died, about the inquest. They later appliedfor judicial review o f the coroner’s
20                 proceedings. In November 1993 the Divisional Court ruled that none o f the matters raised
21                 in the judicial review proceedings justified intervention by that court in the verdict o f the
2 2                inquestjury.
23
24  12)             The events surrounding the disaster have therefore been subject to investigation on several
2 5                 occasions. But concerns have remained about whether the fu ll facts have yet emerged. I
2 6                 have met relatives o f the Hillsborough victims whose suffering is exacerbated by their belief
21                 that there are unresolved issues which should be investigatedfurther.
28
29      13)        Representations were made to my predecessor and have been made to me, to the Attorney
3o                 General and to the Director o f Public Prosecutions. A Granada television programme in
31                 December last year dramatised the disaster and raised a number o f issues which in the view
32                 o f the programme makers, represented new evidence. This promoted an adjournment
3 3                debate led by my Hon Friend, the Member for Liverpool Walton, to which my predecessor,
3 4                the Rt Hon and Learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe, responded. Since then further
3 5                material has been submitted on behalf o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group. Those
3 6                representations have related in particular to video evidence o f the disaster and medical
37                 evidence about the time o f death o f the victims.
38
39      14)         Madam Speaker, my Department, the Office o f the Attorney General and the Crown
4o                  Prosecution Service have considered very carefully all the evidence which has been put
41                 forward in recent months.
42
43      15)         The Director o f Public Prosecutions has taken the view that the material so fa r presented to
44                  her would not justify fresh criminal investigations. The then Attorney General also took the
45                  view, again on the material presented to him, that any application to the High Courtfo r a
4 6                 new inquest would not have any realistic prospect o f succeeding.
47
4 8 16)             Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families o f those who died at Hillsborough and
4 9                 many others, including Hon members o f this House are very concerned that unresolved

                                                                                                  Page 8 of          9

1                 issues remain. I am determined, to go as fa r as I can to ensure that no matter o f
2                 significance is overlooked and that we do not reach a final conclusion without a fu ll and
3                 independent examination o f the evidence.
 4
 5      17)        1 can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General, The Director O f Public
 6                Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is in the public interest that there should be an
 7                independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new evidence relating to the
 8                disaster which was not previously available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a
 9                senior Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal, for that purpose.
10
11                His full terms o f reference are:-
12
13                        To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
14                        Stadium on 15* April 1989 which was not available:
15
16                        a)     To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
17
18                        b)     To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General fo r the purpose
19                               o f discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
20
21                        c)     To the Chief Officer o f the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
22                               disciplinary matters;
23
24                        And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is o f
25                        such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State fo r the Home
26                        Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
27                        attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
2 8                       their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should be
29                        taken in the public interest.
30
31                 la m today placing a copy o f these terms o f reference in the Library.
32
33       18)       We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other evidence
34                 which has been submitted. He will also consider any further material which interested
3 5                parties wish to submit.
36
37       19)       Lord Justice Stuart-Smiths task will be twofold. First to advise me whether any evidence not
3 8                previously available is o f such significance as to justify a further fu ll public inquiry. His
39                 advice to me will be available to the House and the public. Secondly, he will identify fo r the
40                 Attorney General and the Director o f Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable o f South
41                 Yorkshire any evidence which might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously
4 2                been considered.
43
44       20)       I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively whether or not material
4 5                evidence about the causes o f the Hillsborough disaster has been overlooked. I f it has I can
4 6                assure the House that I will take whatever action is needed. We owe it to everyone touched
47                  by the tragedy, but above all to the families o f those who died, to get to the bottom o f this
4 8                matter once and for all.

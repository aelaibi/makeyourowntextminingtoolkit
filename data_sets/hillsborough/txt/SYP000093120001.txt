                    While I was in the pen which I now know to be pen No 4, as I was being

                    pushed by the crowd past a metal barrier on the right of the pen about

                    10 feet from the front,            I saw a man who 1 am sure had died after being

            A   '   °    shed against the barrier I was jjfassing.              He was facing towards the

 vtvJ^                        and his front was to the/liar r ie r .          I was for a short time next

 \JT Jp             to him, he was not breathing & his face was blue,                  I am sure he was

                    dead.     I would describe t j f f i s   man as white,    50/60 yrs well build in fact

                  give no further description,         on an advertising board.

                   e took him in and put him in the area whej^T the dead were             laying.        I

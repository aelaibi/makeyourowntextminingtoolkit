            I am a married man living at the above address and am a partner in a

                                   bus i n e s s ,

            Sheffield.          I am also a voluntary Special Police Constable with the S

            Yorkshire Police Force based at Penistone P s t n , having joined in 1981

            Also      I was a Special Constable with the W Yorkshire Police between

            1962 to 1970.



            I have a lot of experience                   in working football matches though most of

            my duties have          involved traffic point.             On Saturday 15th April,    1989

            (150489)         I started my tour of duty at 9.30 am              (0930 hrs) at Penistone

            Pstn where we were allocated our duties for the FA cup semi
                             /       /                                 /V
            between L i^erp^ o 1 apra Nottingham Forest. Together with

            and SC                           [ went to the junction of the A628 and A6              nown
                                                                                        PAGE          2
                                                                                        S1S2S

          as the Flouch crossroads arriving there at           10.00 am (1000 hrs).       We

          did not attend the briefing at Hillsborough Stadium.



          We were to work traffic        point at this junction ensuring the free flow

          of traffic to Sheffield.           I have worked at this junction many times           in

          the p a s t , approximately for the last five wears.        I   worked     at the

          same junction for the 1988 FA cup semi-flr$Jr between the same two

          teams.     The mai n t raf f i c f 1ow is \raoi the A628 which we direct onto

          t he A616 into Sheffield.          The vast majority of this t raf f i c would be

          Livrpool    supporters.     At first the traffic flow was very quiet up

          until    11.00 am (1100 hrs) after which it steadily built up.              In the

          past the traffic has been a constant flow,           however,   this year    it was

          intermittent with heavy traffic for approximately fifteen minutes

          foil owed by a gap of fifteen mi nutes before the next group.               I late r

          discovered that this was due to traffic lights            13 miles back along the

          A628 into Derbyshire which apparently had been stuck on red.                 I would

          say that although the traffic was intermittent there would have been

          approximately the same amount as last year.            The traffic consisted of

          a number of coaches minibuses and c a r s .



          One   incident   I recall   is that at approximately 1.30 pm (1330 hrs) a

          car .parked j*yar the junction on the A616 displaying a sign stating
Cvyr      tl^f ey ' T.yc ke t s required*.    I saw a car pull up some time later and two
T\at£r\
          '          wire j^tfrchased by the men in the first c a r .      Then at
TOUT3
          approximately 2.23 pm (1423 hrs) a red Rolls Royce parked near the

          first car and another ticket was purchased from the occupants of this.

          The first car then drove away.           I do not know what types of car or any

          of the registration numbers

                                                                            81828

stopped at the junction approaching us from the A616 heading towards

Sheff ield.     All the occu

with full     pint glass,




The traffic was heavy until approximately 2.45 pm (1445 hrs) when

although there was till some football         traffic   it had lessened

sufficiently enough for us not to be required for traffic control.



One other     incident worthy of mention was that at approximately 2.25 pm

towards Penistone.          Some fifteen minutes   later they came back to our

junction this time turning onto the A616 towards Sheffield.               This

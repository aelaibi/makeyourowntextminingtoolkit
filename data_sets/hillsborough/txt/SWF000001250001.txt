1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 This booklet is a guide to measures for improving spectator
safety at football grounds ie at Rugby Union and Rugby League
grounds as well as at soccer grounds. It is a voluntary code and has
no legal force.

1.2 Guidelines on measures for improving the safety of spectators
at sports grounds first became available on a more or less com­
prehensive scale when the Wheatley Report on Crowd Safety at
Sports Grounds was published in 1972. The recommendations in
the appendix to that Report were extended to include fire pre­
cautions and means of escape from an emergency situation such
as a fire, and then formed the basis of the Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds (which became known as ‘the green code’). The application
of those guidelines to football grounds during the next few years
brought to light a need for the advice to be amended in certain
respects. Furthermore, since the safety of spectators can be affected
when crowds are disturbed by hooliganism, it was felt that the
recommendations o f the Working Party on Crowd Behaviour,
which were made known to the Football League clubs in 1975,
should be incorporated in any comprehensive guide to safety at
football grounds. This booklet is the outcome. Since this new guide
is aimed at football grounds, as distinct from sports grounds in
general, it has been named accordingly.

1.3 The problem of crowd safety at football grounds is complex
and cannot be solved simply by ensuring that each component of
a ground, such as stairways, passages or sections of terracing, is
satisfactory in itself. The inter-relation of components is essential:
they should be compatible and combine to form a balanced unit.

1.4 Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without
necessarily detracting from the overall safety of the ground. A
flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the par­
ticular circumstances at individual grounds.

1.5 Although new work or reconstruction at football grounds
should not be to a standard lower than that set out in the guidelines,
it should be borne in mind when using the guide to assess whether
existing situations provide adequately for the safety of spectators
that the criterion is that of a reasonable degree of safety. It would
be unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute
safety of everyone attending a ground.

1.6 The advice given in this guide is without prejudice to the operation
of the Building Regulations 1972 for England and Wales (in Inner
London the London Building Acts and Constructional Bye-Laws),
the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1971-73 and any
other relevant legislation.



2. THE PROBLEM
2.1 There are essentially three types of safety problem to be con­
sidered within a football ground and in its immediate surroundings.

2.2 The first concerns hazards affecting individuals which cause
tripping, slipping and falling. The guidelines for general construc­
tional features of a ground are intended to deal with this type of
problem.

2.3 The second type is far more important. When large crowds are
present and densities are high, pressures build up within the crowd
either through motion or swaying which make it difficult, or even
impossible, for individuals to control their own movements. Under
these conditions crowd pressures can escalate to a dangerous state
and if a person stumbles or falls the crowd cannot adapt to avoid
him or stop to help. Since this type of danger arises from crowd
pressures its remedy lies in their removal or restraint within safe
limits. These dangers arise in particular on terraces and in exit
routes, and so careful attention must be paid to restraining surges
and similar pressures on the terraces and to ensuring free movement
throughout the exit systems. Such free movement is dependent
upon the capacity of all the various sections of the exit systems
and interactions between them.
2.4 The third type of safety problem cannot be divorced from the
second and in some ways is an extreme version of it. The danger
arises from emergency situations which can develop following, for
example, an outbreak of fire or hooliganism. The orderly evacua­
tion of large crowds may under emergency conditions become a very
serious problem, particularly in respect of stands where spectators
are in effect on the roof of a building, the materials and construction
of which might themselves constitute a fire risk.


3. GENERAL CONSTRUCTION
3.1 To meet the requirements of safety in a ground, all components
and installations, e.g. terraces, stands, stairs, barriers and pylons,
should have the strength and durability, and be maintained in such
condition and arranged in such a manner as to perform safely their
required functions. The design and construction of these com­
ponents and installations should be in accordance with good
engineering and building practice, especially as set out in all relevant
British Standard specifications and codes of practice.

3.2 All electrical installations should comply with the current
edition of the Regulations o f the Institution of Electrical Engineers.

3.3 When walls and fences are to withstand crowd pressures they
should be designed to withstand such pressures safely and allowance
should be made for forces simultaneously and independently
induced by other factors, e.g. wind forces or attached installations.

3.4 Precautions should be taken to prevent people from climbing on
roofs, pylons, hoardings and the like. Where possible such struc­
tures should be provided with unclimbable devices, e.g. stout
barriers or close boarded enclosures. Spikes and barbed wire
should be installed only above a minimum height of 2-4 metres from
the base.

3.5 All parts of the ground used by the general public, and especially
the exit routes, should have a minimum headroom of 2-4 metres or
such height as required by the appropriate Building Regulations.

3.6 Where the natural lighting in any section of the ground accessible
to the public is deficient, adequate artificial lighting should be

                                                                      3
provided. If the ground is intended for use during the hours of
darkness, all parts accessible to the public should be provided with
means of lighting adequate to enable them to see their way into,
within and out of the ground. These provisions are particularly
important in relation to exit routes and stairways used by the public.


4. INSPECTIONS AND TESTS
4.1 A detailed inspection o f the ground, including all components
and installations, should be carried out annually to ensure compliance
with the guidelines in this code.

4.2 Following each event, a general visual inspection of the ground
should be made for signs o f damage which might create a potential
danger to the public. Particular attention should be paid to the
condition of terraces, viewing slopes and stairways. Crush barriers
and balustrades should be examined for deformation or any other
overt signs of weakness.

4.3 Testing of crush barriers should be carried out in accordance
with Appendix C of this code. When the guidelines are first
applied to a particular ground, a representative sample of barriers
o f all types from all areas o f the ground should be selected for
testing. Further testing o f barriers should be necessary only at
intervals of several years unless circumstances arise which raise
doubts as to their strength.


5. INGRESS TO THE GROUND
5.1 Where admission to a football ground or parts of it is controlled
by turnstiles, these, by their number and location, control not only
the rate of admission but, to a large extent, the dispersal of
spectators within a ground to their chosen sections. Turnstiles
should be of such numbers as to admit at a rate whereby no unduly
large crowds are waiting for admission and yet at no faster rate
than the arrangements for distributing spectators within the ground
permit.

5.2 Dangerous overcrowding can be caused if spectators are able
to force their way into a ground already full to capacity by scaling
or breaking through boundary fences. To avoid this danger such
fences should be of appropriate height and strength.
6. EGRESS FROM THE GROUND
6.1 Recommendations relating particularly to egress from stands
are given in paragraph 8. Advice on the calculation of the capacity
of exit systems is contained in paragraph 15.5

6.2 It is generally recognised that the period of greatest risk to
crowd safety at football grounds is at the time of leaving. Pressures
can be set up within a departing crowd by impatient people and
these incipient pressures can and must be contained by careful
attention to the detailed design of barriers, stairways, gangways
and exits.

6.3 The aim should be to provide a smooth and unimpeded passage
through an exit route to the outside. This may be achieved by
controlling the crowd flow at the entrance to the exit route so that
the departing spectators are held back in a relatively safe place
e.g. on the terrace.

6.4 There should be no ‘funnelling’ effect causing people to converge
on a narrow means of access or egress. A narrowing in the exit
route is acceptable, however, when it is preceded by an open space
or reservoir area where the holding capacity is sufficient to contain
safely the spectators held up because of the difference in the flow
rate into and out of the reservoir area. This situation should not,
however, be permitted within 45 metres of any building within the
ground having a combustible structure, e.g. a timber stand, or
within 15 metres o f any building within the ground having a non­
combustible structure. The capacity o f reservoir areas should be
calculated using the appropriate flow rate given in paragraph 16
and the recommended exit time given in paragraph 6.5, a packing
density of 54 persons per 10 square metres of the area available
for standing within the reservoir area being the maximum allowable
for safety.

6.5 Recent research has indicated that when it takes more than
7 minutes to vacate an area o f spectator accommodation the
crowd flow tends to become turbulent. In these conditions in­
dividuals can lose control over their own movement and the rate
of flow may be reduced. It is therefore suggested that the exits
from each area of spectator accommodation should be so designed
that the spectators can, if desired or required, leave that area in
8 minutes or less.
6.6 A comprehensive system of signposting which clearly indicates
routes to various parts of the ground should be provided. Directional
signs should be placed to encourage crowds in any particular
section to flow in one direction when leaving the ground.

6.7 So far as possible, exit routes should be free from obstructions.
In particular, no kiosk or lavatory should be situated in such a way
that it or any associated queue obstructs an exit route.

6.8 Although the minimum width for any section of an exit route
should be 1.1 metres the required width for any particular section
is dependent on the crowd flow it will be required to carry.

6.9 Where there is a simple exit route every part of that route should
be able to accommodate the flow from the terrace or stand exit.

6.10 For a more complex exit system combining a number of
exit routes and/or offering a choice o f alternative routes to exits,
however, the system should be analysed in the form of a network
in order to check that the capacity o f the exit from the terrace or
stand is such as to ensure a free flow of spectators to the various
exits from the ground. Where branching of routes gives departing
spectators a choice of paths, the proportion of the crowd likely to
use each path should be derived from local knowledge.

6.11 Where there is not a free flowing system, the width of the
restricting element should be increased and/or the width of the exit
from the stand or the terrace reduced.

6.12 Where there are gross deviations in design or construction
from the recommended guidelines so as to create a manifest danger,
that section of the exit system should be closed (and a reduction in
the capacity of the section of the ground which it serves should be
made) until remedial action has been taken.

6.13 Care should be taken in the planning of exit systems to ensure
that crowds have access in an emergency to alternative exit routes
in the event of their normal exit route being obstructed.

6.14 Exit doors
6.14.1 All doors on an exit route should be capable of opening
outwards in order that crowds can escape in an emergency. This
point is of particular importance in the case of doors within stands
and at the foot of stairways. Where exit doors have to be secured
against outside intruders they should be fitted with panic-type
bolts.

6.14.2 Where it is impracticable for exit gates from a ground
to open outwards for normal use since to do so would cause, for
example, an obstruction on a public highway, the gates should
be resited within the exit route they serve, or provision made
for two-way opening. Sliding or roller-shutter gates are not
recommended because they are incapable of being opened when
pressure is exerted in the direction of crowd flow and have mecha­
nism or runways which are vulnerable to jamming.

6.14.3 All doors on an exit route should be secured in the fully open
position before the end of play.

6.14.4 When open, no door should obstruct any gangway, passage,
stairway or landing.

6.14.5 There should be no obstruction in an exit e.g. no change
in level at exit doors.

6.14.6 All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground
is used by the public so that they can be opened immediately in an
emergency.

6.14.7 Facilities should be provided to enable people to leave the
ground at any time. For this purpose a number of reversible
turnstiles or doors so operated as to limit the openings to the passage
of one person at a time might be considered.



 7 TERRACES
 7.1 Terraces are recognised as presenting a special safety problem.
 In addition to the incidental dangers of standing for long periods
 on steep terraced slopes, crowds are subject to excessive pressures
 generated by spectators straining to see the event, by excitement, or
 by surging deliberately induced by a certain type of spectator.
7.2 Failure to provide spectators with an unobstructed view invites
them to stretch and.strain and so generate dangerous pressures
within the crowd. For this reason it is desirable to provide a mini­
mum distance between the front o f the terrace and the touch line
or goal line on the pitch (see paragraph 14).

7.3 Arrangements should also be made to encourage even distri­
bution of the crowd on the terraces to provide ease of access and
egress, to facilitate movement particularly should a local emergency
arise during the event, and to contain pressures before they reach
dangerous proportions. The following provisions will assist in
achieving these conditions.


7.4 Terrace s t e p s
7.4.1 The surface of terrace steps should be of a non-slip material
with adequate drainage provided to prevent deterioration from the
action of rainwater.

7.4.2 A terrace step should be not less than 280 mm or more than
380 mm wide, w ith. a preferred dimension between 355 mm and
380 mm.

7.4.3 The height of risers should be within the limits of 75 mm and
180 mm, the lower limit of 75 mm being related to the minimum
width of 280 mm. If the riser height is greater than 180 mm it is
desirable that a crush barrier should be provided at the top of the
riser.

7.4.4 Excessive variations in the gradient of a terrace should be
avoided. Gradients steeper than 1 in 2 could be dangerous.


7.5 Gangways
7.5.1 The aim should be to ensure that every spectator on the terraces
is within 12 metres of a gangway or of an exit. This may be achieved
by a pattern of gangways (not less than 1*1 metres wide) linked to
the exit system, the following points being borne in mind:

7.5.2 Spectators would be discouraged from standing in lateral
gangways if these were sunk 100 mm to 200 mm and if crush barriers
were provided behind but not immediately in front of them.
7.5.3 Radial gangways which are relatively long and uncontrolled
downward paths through terraces are difficult to keep clear especially
when sited in popular viewing areas, for example behind the goal
areas. It is helpful to sink them 150 mm to 200 mm and to interrupt
an otherwise continuously descending gangway by turns along,
say, lateral gangways. As with other forms of stairways the going
should be uniform and the step dimensions as defined in paragraph
9.3.4.


7.6 Division o f sp e c ta to r accom m od ation
7.6.1 A ground should be divided into sections to prevent major
migrations by spectators. For example, each end or side of a ground
should be self-contained with its own entrances, exits and toilet/
refreshment facilities. There should be no access from one such
major section to another except in an emergency.

7.6.2 Railings, fences, etc. dividing sections of the ground should
be of the strength of the handrails dividing stairways into channels,
described in paragraph 13.

7.6.3 Each of these major sections should be sub-divided by such
means as gangways and crush barriers so disposed as to minimise
sway and surge of spectators. Recommendations on the siting of
gangways and the spacing of crush barriers are given in paragraphs
7.5 and 12.


7.7 Crush barriers
7.7.1 Much of the hazard on terraces can be eliminated by the
provision of well constructed, correctly positioned and properly
mounted crush barriers.

7.7.2 The maximum spacing of crush barriers will be dependent
on the gradient of the terrace or viewing slope. Paragraphs 12 and
13 give recommendations for the spacing and strength of crush
barriers.

7.7.3 Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along the full
width of a terrace with gaps only at the radial gangways.

7.7.4 Where barriers are not continuous between radial gangways,
the alignment of gaps in succesive rows o f barriers on a terrace
should form an angle of less than 60° to the barriers. There should
not be more than 2 consecutive gaps in any line of gaps (see
Appendix B : Fig 1).

7.7.5 Where there are gaps in the line of crush barriers these should
be at least 1-1 metres and not more than 1*4 metres in width.

7.7.6 In order to locate the top rail against that part of the body
most able to tolerate pressure, the height of crush barriers should
be between 1-02 metres and 1*12 metres above the nosing of the
step immediately behind the barrier, with a preferred height of
1-1 metres.

7.7.7 Crush barriers should be designed so that there are no sharp
projections or edges. Although a barrier with a top rail of 50 mm
internal diameter tube has been adopted at many grounds, research
has shown there would be advantage in the use of a flat rail of
100 mm vertical depth.

7.8 V iew ing s lo p e s
7.8.1 The surface of this form of terrace should be covered with a
non-slip material e.g. packed ash.

7.8.2 The desirable maximum gradient for a viewing slope is
1 in 6.

7.8.3 Viewing slopes with a gradient greater than 1 in 6 should have
continuous crush barriers between gangways.

7.8.4 The spacing of crush barriers should be the same as for
normal terracing (see paragraph 12).

7.9 Pitch perimeter fe n c e /w a ll
7.9.1 This fence should be designed to keep spectators off the pitch
but gates or other access points should be provided for use in an
emergency and, at those grounds where a perimeter track is used
as part of the exit system, for the departure of spectators at the end
of play.

7.9.2 Access points should be controlled, so that immediate access
to the pitch or perimeter track can be ensured in the event of an
emergency.
7.9.3 If spectators can lean on the pitch perimeter fence it should be
deemed a crush barrier and fulfil the conditions of height and
strength specified in paragraphs 7.7.6 and 13, although if the fence
is of solid construction its height may be more than 1*12 metres.
This is because the pressures acting on a person forced against such
a fence are distributed over a large area of the body, unlike the
situation with a normal crush barrier, where the pressures are
localised.



8 STANDS
8.1 There is generally a less hurried departure from stands at
the end of a match and furthermore, spectators are induced by the
layout of the seats to form orderly queues. However, the general
safety considerations are similar to those for terraces and in this
regard attention should be paid to the following points:

8.2 Every stand should be provided with sufficient exits to allow
for the orderly evacuation from the stand of all spectators likely to
be accommodated.

8.3 Evacuation time, which will depend largely on the fire hazard
present in the stand, should be within the following limits:
a. 8 minutes where a stand is of non-combustible fire resisting
   construction, the interior use and contents present a low fire
   risk and the exit staircases are not vulnerable to a fire occurring
   within the stand; and
b. 2-5 minutes for stands of a lower standard.
The conditions at a particular ground may call for interpolation
between these times.

8.4 Seats and gangways should be so positioned as to provide
ready access to exits. No person in any part of a stand should have
to travel more than 30 metres to the nearest exit from the stand.

8.5 All seats should be securely fixed in position. The use of tip-up
seats allows more circulation space, the automatic type being
preferable.

8.6 The minimum area allotted to each seated person should be
460 mm wide and 610 mm deep, but for comfort these measurements

                                                                   11
should be 550 mm and 760 mm respectively. To enable people to
move freely between rows of seats there should be at least 305 mm
between perpendiculars from the foremost projection of one seat
and the back of the seat in front. (This minimum of 305 mm is
included in the 610 mm or 760 mm depth measurement of the
seating area).

8.7 The number of seats in a row should not exceed:
a. 14 seats where there is a gangway at one end only, and
b. 28 seats where there is a gangway at both ends.

8.8 Gangways should be of sufficient width for the seats served but
in no case of less than 1-1 metres without projections.

8.9 The seating area should be separated from the remainder of the
stand beneath it by a construction having a fire resistance of not
less than half an hour.

8.10 Walls within stands and ceiling linings beneath the stand
seats should have a flame spread classification of not less than
Class 1, when tested in accordance with British Standard No 476
Part 7.

8.11 A common feature in the construction of stands which is a fire
risk is the provision of voids under the seating. These voids become
the resting place for paper, cartons and other combustible materials
which can be ignited, unnoticed, by a carelessly discarded cigarette
end. Wherever possible such spaces should be excluded but where
they exist they should be sealed off so that paper etc cannot find its
way into them.

8.12 Balustrading
Those sections of balustrading which lie at the foot of stairways or
gangways within stands should have an equivalent strength to that
of crush barriers of the stronger type (see paragraph 13).



9 STAIRWAYS AND RAMPS
9.1 This is an area which calls for particular attention since the
construction and disposition of stairways play a vital part in
achieving the desired aims of smooth and unimpeded egress for
spectators under all conditions set out in paragraph 6. The aim
should be to provide stairways which limit hazards to the minimum
by such features as uniform going, secure footing, not too steep a
gradient, and a width sufficient to allow free movement but narrow
enough to provide everyone with access to a handrail. The head of
the stairway should be so designed that flow is uniform across its
width and crowd pressures cannot easily be generated. In addition
flights should not provide long, unrestricted paths down which crowd
pressures and surges can be created. Adequate separation between
channels in multi-channel stairway arrangements should be provided
 so that there is no overspill from one channel to another.

9.2 Stairways should be carefully positioned to take advantage of
natural lighting and ventilation. Where the natural lighting is
deficient the stairway should be adequately lit by artificial light.

9.3 Construction o f sta irw a y s
9.3.1 The width, rise and ‘going’ of the steps should be uniform on
any stairway.

9.3.2 Stair treads should be provided with non-slip surfaces and
durable edgings. Adequate drainage should be provided.

9.3.3 Open risers should not be used.

9.3.4 On any stairway the preferred going of treads should be
305 mm but not less than 280 mm and the preferred height of risers
should be 150 mm but not more than 190 mm.

9.3.5 Stairways should be without winders, should be in flights of
not more than 16 or fewer than 3 steps, should have not more than
two successive flights without a turn, and, if there are more than
12 steps in a flight, should have not more than one flight without
a turn. The going of the landing between flights should be not less
than the width of the section or channel of the flight.

9.3.6 Every person on a stairway should have access to a handrail.
Accordingly the minimum width of a stairway should be 1*1 metres,
stairways wider than 1*8 metres being divided as far as possible
into channels having a width of between 1*1 metres and 1-8 metres.
The strength of the handrails (including supports) used to divide
a stairway into channels should be as described in paragraph 13.
9.3.7 Handrails projecting not more than 100 mm should be
provided on both sides of all stairways, steps and landings at a height
of not less than 840 mm, measured vertically from the centre of
the step, or the surface of the landing.

9.3.8 Protection should be provided on both sides of all stairs
and landings. Where next to open wells, or spaces, such protection
should be enclosed and should be not less than 1*1 metres in height
measured vertically from the centre of the step, or the surface of
the landing. The protection should have a strength equivalent to
that of the crush barriers of the weaker type, described in para­
graph 13.


9.4 A c c e s s to sta irw a y s
9.4.1 To ensure a free flow of spectators the access to the head of
stairways should be controlled along the following lines:

9.4.2 Where a stairway is divided into channels the access should be
designed to secure a uniform flow down each channel.

9.4.3 The approach to the head of the stairs should be level, and
should be so arranged that the spectators converge on the stairway
from the front and/or the sides only. There should be no approach
from behind, involving movement around the ends of the balustrades
or side walls of the stairway, except where this approach is already
controlled by physical means such as by the gangways in the seated
areas of stands.

9.4.4 The extent of the approach in the direction of the stairway
should not be less than 1-1 metres and preferably not more than
3 metres.

9.4.5 Where restrictive elements such as barriers or gateways are
installed in the approach to a stairway in order to meet the fore­
going provisions, the total width of the passage formed by these
elements should be not more than two-thirds the minimum width of
the stairway.

9.4.6 For an application of these principles to a multiple stairway
leading direct from a terrace, see Appendix B Figure 2.
9.5 Discharge from sta irw a y s
All exit stairways should discharge either:
a. at ground level and lead directly to a place of safety in the open
   air; or
b. on to walk ways or concourses of adequate dimensions at any
   level provided these also lead directly to a place of safety in the
   open air.


9.6 Fire protection for sta irw a y s
9.6.1 The surface finish of walls and ceilings of all escape stairways
should be of a standard corresponding to Class “O” (as defined in
Regulation E.15 of the Building Regulations for England and
Wales 1972, as amended by the Building (First Amendment)
Regulations 1973, and of the Building Standards (Scotland) Regu­
lations 1971-73).

9.6.2 Where a stairway passes through a stand it should be in a
fire-resisting enclosure separated from the remainder of the stand
by a structure having afire resistance of not less than one hour. Such
stairways should discharge via a protected route of the same
standard to a place of safety in the open air.

9.6.3 Any door forming part of the enclosure to a stairway should
be self-closing on to 25 mm rebates and have a fire resistance
of not less than half an hour.


9.7 Ramps
9.7.1 The gradient should preferably be constant and not broken by
steps.

9.7.2 The shallower the gradient the better. The maximum gradient
acceptable will depend on the particular ramp’s length purpose
and usage but a ramp subject to heavy crowd flow should preferably
not exceed a gradient of 1 in 10.



10 FIRE PRECAUTIONS
10.1 New structures will conform to current Building Regulations
and therefore have a reasonable degree of structural fire protection.
10.2 Existing structures vary considerably in age and the materials
used in construction. The qualities of combustibility and fire
resistance have an important effect on the standard of fire precau­
tions required to ensure reasonable safety. It may be difficult
in many cases to improve the fire resistance of a structure to any
significant extent but this should be done wherever practicable.
Where it is not possible to bring about such improvements, it may
be possible to achieve an acceptable solution by the provision
of other safeguards such as sprinklers and/or automatic detection.


10.3 Fire warning s y s te m
10.3.1 All buildings in the ground to which public or staff have
access should be provided with a fire warning system to alert the
staff in case of fire. In major grounds it would be an advantage
if an indication of the warning and preferably its location could be
given in the central control point, (see paragraph 17.2).

10.3.2 The central control and other selected positions where
necessary should be provided with suitable facilities for calling the
fire brigade and other emergency services.


10.4 Emergency lighting
10.4.1 For use in the event of failure of the general lighting,
emergency lighting should be provided in all parts of the premises
accessible to the public and along all exit routes, with the exit signs
clearly illuminated. Preferably, this system should be completely
separate from the general lighting system, although a one-circuit
system incorporating staggered sub-circuits would be an acceptable
alternative. Otherwise than in the exceptional case where two
entirely independent supplies can be obtained from outside sources,
the emergency circuit should be connected to a source of power
located on the premises, e.g. storage batteries or a diesel generator,
with a delay of not more than 10 seconds.

10.4.2 The system should be capable of maintaining the necessary
level of illumination for a period of 3 hours from the time of
failure of the normal supply.

10.4.3 The emergency lighting should operate automatically on the
failure of the main lighting.
10.5 Fire fighting equipm ent
10.5.1 In major grounds it may be necessary to provide a suitable
water supply for fire fighting in the form of statutory or private
fire hydrants.

10.5.2 For first aid fire fighting by members of the staff hydraulic
hose reels should preferably be provided. These should be sufficient
to provide adequate protection to the whole floor area, and should
be installed in suitable positions by entrances, exits and stairways.

 10.5.3 Where hose reels are not provided portable fire extinguishers
should be installed in sufficient numbers to give adequate cover.
The number and type will depend upon the size, layout, fire separation
and risk in each building. Fire extinguishers should conform to
the appropriate British Standard specification and be maintained
in good working order.

10.5.4 Where high fire risk areas such as large storerooms and
enclosed or underground car parks are situated under stands
consideration should be given to the installation of an automatic
fire extinguishing system such as sprinklers, or, alternatively, an
automatic detection system.

10.5.5 Advice should be sought from the local fire authority on
the type, amount and siting of fire fighting equipment required.


10.6 Housekeeping
One of the potential causes of fire in football grounds arises from
the accumulation of waste paper, programmes, packets and other
combustible materials which are dropped by spectators. As stated
in paragraph. 8.11 this can present a particular problem in stands.
Every effort should be made to reduce this hazard. All parts of
buildings should be inspected before and after every event and
accumulations of combustible waste cleared as quickly as practicable
or stored in a safe place pending clearance.


10.7 Emergency procedure and s t a f f training
10.7.1 It is essential that plans should be made for dealing with
emergency situations. Joint consultation between the management
of the ground, police, fire, ambulance and other emergency services
should be held in order to produce agreed plans of action.
10.7.2 While the public are in the ground an adequate number of
staff should be maintained to cover entrances, exits and other
strategic points.
10.7.3 All such staff should be trained in the use of the fire fighting
equipment provided and in the action to be taken in the event of
a fire.

11 ACCESS FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES
11.1 Adequate roads for emergency vehicles such as fire appliances
and ambulances should be provided so that speedy and direct access
can be obtained to all buildings within the ground. Wherever
possible, these access routes should be separate from those used by
spectators entering and leaving the ground.
11.2 The local fire authority should be consulted about the width,
clearance height and supporting strength required of access roads.
11.3 Wherever possible access roads should provide for the parking
of emergency vehicles so that exit routes used by crowds are not
seriously obstructed.

12 SPACING OF CRUSH BARRIERS
12.1 The location and spacing of crush barriers will be major
factors in the safety of spectators on a terrace. Column A in the
following tables provides the maximum distances between barriers
conforming to the greater strength requirements of crush barriers
in paragraph 13. Column B provides the maximum distances
between barriers conforming to the lesser strength requirements
of crush barriers in paragraph 13. Interpolation may be made
between these figures.
12.2 A distinction is made between barrier intervals required in
(i) ‘peak viewing areas’; and
(ii) ‘other viewing areas’.
The term ‘peak viewing areas’ describes the most popular parts of
the terraces where there is a tendency for spectators to crowd
together and become so emotionally involved in the occasion that
their reactions can cause additional pressures to be set up in those
sections of the ground. The peak viewing areas are typically behind
the goal areas, although other parts of the terraces known locally
may come within this category.

13 STRENGTH OF CRUSH BARRIERS AND HANDRAILS


13.1 Existing barriers and handrails
Existing crush barriers and handrails should be capable of resisting
the forces indicated in the ‘existing test load’ column below when
applied in a test as described in Appendix C. Where existing crush
barriers and handrails fail to meet these test conditions, they should
be replaced or strengthened in such a way as to do so. Barriers
and handrails so strengthened should be retested in accordance with
Appendix C.


13.2 N ew barriers and handrails
All new crush barriers or handrails should be designed to resist
safely a horizontal force as indicated in the ‘new design force’
column below, applied as a static load acting on the top rail of the
barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal axis. The
foundations of new barriers or handrails should be designed to
resist the overturning moments and sliding forces, induced by the
forces described in the ‘new design force’ column below, with a
factor of safety of 2.

                                                                           19

14 TERRACE TO TOUCH-LINE DISTANCES
The minimum recommended distance from terrace to touchline
or goal line is 3 metres where the terrace gradient is 30° or steeper.
Where the gradient is shallower it may be advisable to increase
this distance so as to enable spectators to obtain a clear view.


15 ESTIMATION OF SAFE GROUND CAPACITY
15.1 The foregoing sections of the code recommend guidelines for
individual features of a ground in isolation. This section suggests
a method of calculating the number of people that can be safely
accomodated when taking into account interactions between these
individual features and when there are deviations from the guide­
lines. To facilitate the calculations, a plan of the ground should
be available with such details as exits, stands, terraces, stairways,
passages, kiosks, seats and barriers. A scale of 1:200 would be
convenient for this purpose.

15.2 The method assesses:
a. the holding capacity of a terrace (that of a stand being determined
   by the number of seats when the stand conforms to the guide­
   lines); and
b. the capacity of a given exit route from a terrace or stand.
15.3 The number of people that can be safely accommodated on a
terrace, however, is either its holding capacity or the capacity of
the exit system from it (assessed in accordance with paragraph 15.5)
whichever is the smaller.

15.4 Terraces and view ing s lo p e s
 15.4.1 The capacity of a terrace or viewing slope should be assessed
from the area available for standing (that area of the terrace or
viewing slope from which the whole of the playing area can be seen,
excluding gangways) by allowing a packing density o f between
54 and 27 persons per 10 square metres, depending on the condition
of the terrace or slope. For this purpose the extreme allowances
are:
a. 54 persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or viewing
    slope is in good condition (as defined in paragraph 7); and
b. 27 persons per 10 square metres when it materially deviates from
    the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible
    hazard to individuals closely packed.
It may be necessary to interpolate between these figures where
conditions fall between the two extremes.
When the positioning and width of gangways do not meet with the
recommendations of paragraph 7.5.1, an appropriate reduction
should be made in the area available for standing.

15.4.2 When crush barriers conform to the recommended guidelines
on spacing (see paragraph 12) the capacity of the terrace is calculated
by multiplying the area available for standing by the appropriate
packing density. The following formula may be used:
                                            A
           Capacity (number of persons)=— x 2 7 or 54

Where A is the area available for standing in square metres.

15.4.3 When the spacing o f crush barriers does not conform to the
guidelines, the capacity is calculated from the provision of crush
barriers in the area available for standing (as defined in paragraph
15.4.1) as follows:
a. Where a terrace contains either ‘peak viewing areas’ (*) only or
   ‘other viewing areas’ (*) only -j- by multiplying the total length
   of crush barriers by the appropriate distance between barriers
* See paragraph 12.
   (as given in paragraph 12) or the existing distance, whichever is
   less, and multiplying by the appropriate packing density.
b. Where a terrace contains both ‘peak viewing areas’ and ‘other
   viewing areas’ — by multiplying the total length of barriers by
   the appropriate distance between barriers in a ‘peak viewing area
   or the existing distance, whichever is less, and multiplying by the
   appropriate packing density.
15.4.4 Crush barriers which do not meet the guidelines on strength
set out in paragraph 13, should be ignored for the purpose of these
calculations.

15.5 Exit s y s t e m s
15.5.1 General considerations to be taken into account when
assessing the adequacy of exit systems are set out in paragraph 6.

15.5.2 The capacity of an exit system can be obtained by assessing
for each element in the system (ie each gangway, doorway, stairway
etc) the number of persons that can pass in 8 minutes or, in the
circumstances indicated in paragraph 8.3(b), in 2*5 minutes. This
calculation is made by multiplying the width of the element by the
appropriate flow rate in paragraph 16.
15.5.3 Where an element in an exit system is less than 1*1 metres
wide, that element should be omitted from the calculation.

15.5.4 Flow-restricting elements of the kind described in paragraph
9.4.5 should be ignored for the purposes of these calculations
(see Appendix B Figure 2).


16 RECOMMENDED FLOW RATES
16.1 From the stands a flow rate of 40 persons per minute per unit
of exit width, ie 550 mm, should be used.

16.2 From the terraces and the ground generally a flow rate of
60 persons per minute per unit of exit width, ie 550 mm, should
be used.


17 COMMUNICATIONS
17.1 Precise requirements for communications within a particular
ground should be determined after consulations with the police.
The following are examples of the arrangements likely to be needed
at large grounds.

17.2 A central control point, preferably a room, should be set
aside for the use of the supervising police officer and the club
safety officer.

17.3 There should be intercommunication between the central
control and all turnstiles or banks of turnstiles, and all entry and
exit gates used by the public.

17.4 Metering systems to record all admissions should be installed
at turnstiles and, so as to ensure that ground capacities are not
exceeded in any section, arrangements should be made for central
control to be informed immediately a predetermined number of
spectators has been admitted through each turnstile.

17.5 Public address equipment should be installed so that broad­
cast messages can be heard under reasonable conditions by all
persons of normal hearing in any part of the ground to which the
public has access. Preferably, the system should be capable of
being controlled from the central control point. The power supply
to the system should be such as to enable it to continue to operate
in an emergency such as a fire, or a failure of the mains supply.

17.6 Loud hailers should be available for the use of stewards
and police in directing or instructing spectators.

17.7 Any police radio facilities available for the maintenance
of law and order should augment and not supersede the club
communications system.

17.8 Consideration should be given to the need for a special room
where persons detained by the police may be taken to have their
particulars recorded.



18 RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING
   PARTY ON CROWD BEHAVIOUR
18.1 Crowd movement on terraces should be severely limited in
order to give the police the fullest opportunity for crowd control.

                                                                  23
Less problems occur where the terraces are divided as far as possible
into sections by the use of railings or barriers, both radial and
lateral. Ideally, each section should be self-contained and should
be serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshment facilities and
toilets, (see paragraph 7.6).

18.2 ‘Home’ and visiting supporters should be segregated. It
should not be possible for spectators to transfer from one end of the
ground to the other.

18.3 Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as possible
in normal circumstances while, at the same time, providing the
police with proper access to the terraces for the purposes of crowd
control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event of serious
emergency. One alternative to fencing is the construction around
the pitch of a wall with a smooth surface which should be not less
than 4 feet in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
have gates or access points to the pitch which could be manned
by the police or stewards. A walkway between the boundary wall
and the terraces, which would be solely occupied by police, first
aid and official club personnel, has been found to be effective as
regards safety and security. In order to achieve this, it might be
necessary to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect
the walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers, so
designed as to discourage access to the walkway except at authorised
points. The access points from terrace to walkway should be
reasonably near the access points from walkway to the pitch, (see
paragraph 7.9). Where a walkway system is in use, sliding gates
may be installed at the access points from the walkway to the pitch,
ie where there can be no crowd pressure against them, (see paragraph
6.14.2 regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the
pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing
area.

18.4 Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be served in
plastic containers.

18.5 Home clubs should consider, in conjunction with the police,
each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. So far as the
terraces are concerned, any allocation should have regard to the
manner in which the terraces are divided so that policing arrange­
ments can be effective.

18.6 The home club should, as a general rule, make it their policy
not to issue tickets for announced all-ticket matches to away
supporters on the day of the game. However, the local police
will be best able to assess the situation and their advice should be
followed, but it is important wherever possible to discourage
supporters from travelling to all-ticket matches without tickets.

Appendix C




TESTING OF CRUSH BARRIERS AND HANDRAILS
1. For crush barriers the test is to consist of the application of an
   evenly distributed force of either 6-0 KN/metre width (400 lbs
   f/foot width) or 4-3 KN/metre width (290 lbs f/foot width) of
   barrier as mentioned in paragraph 13.


2. For handrails the test is to consist o f the application of an evenly
   distributed force of either 4-3 KN/metre width (290 lbs f/foot
   width) or 2-74 KN/metre width (188 lbs f/foot width) of handrail
   as mentioned in paragraph 13.


3. The force is to be in the form of a static load acting on the top
   rail o f the barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal
   axis and applied in about ten equal increments.


4. The force to be applied for three consecutive periods, the full
   force being maintained for 5 minutes each period. The interval
   between applications to be as short as possible, ie to enable
   complete unloading and reloading only. A record should be
   kept of any deformation during the loading periods, during the
   periods of maintained loading, or during the recovery period.


5. If on the removal of the force for the third time the recovery of
   deformation is at least 75 % the barrier or handrail may be deemed
   to have satisfied the loading requirements.
   If this requirement is not met but the recovery is more than 50 %
   then the test should be repeated and if on retest the recovery is
   at least 75% the barrier or handrail may be deemed to have
   satisfied the loading requirements.
   If the recovery is less than 50% on the first test or less than 75 %
   on the retest, the barrier or handrail shall be deemed to have
   failed to meet the loading requirements.
6. If during any test, even though the barrier or handrail satisfies
   the above loading requirements, doubt should arise for any
   reason (including such matters as cracking of the terracing or
   distortion of connections) as to the safety of the barrier or
   handrail, a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless
   the results of this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety
   of the barrier or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case
   may be, should be deemed to have failed the test.

7. A record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails tested
   and of their performances during the tests.

    18 .      Recommendtions of the Torkin.r Pnrtv on Crowd

    18.1 -    Crowd movement on t e r r i e s should be severely limited ir.
              order to give the Poli:e the fu lle st opportunity for crowd
              control. Less problem; occur where the terraces are
              divided as f “-r as possible into sections by the use o f -
              railings or bnrriers, *:cth raui.il and la te r a l. Ideally,
              each section should be self-contained and should be
               serviced by i t s own en~ancc/e:d.ts, refreshment f a c ilitie s
             'and to i l e t s , (see para. 7*7*)
    18.2      "Home" and visiting supporters should be segregated. It
              should not bo possible for spectators to transfer from one
              end of the ground to the other.
    18.3     Access to playing pitcees must be made a s 'd iffic u lt as
             possible in normal cirrumstancas while/ at the same ti:ae,
             providing the Police with proper access to the terraces for
             the purposes' of crowd ccntrol c:vd enabling the pitch to be
             used in the event of serious emergency. One alternative
             to fencing is the cone~ruction around the pitch of a wall
             with a smooth surface vhich should ba not less than 4 f —t
             in height on the te rra :2 side. TI1 1 3 boundary wall should
             have gates or access prints to the pitch which could be
             manned by the Police cr stev/ards. A wallcw.iy between the
             boundary wall md ths terraces, which would be solely
             occupied by Police, First Aid and o ffic ia l club personnel,
             has been found to be effective; as regards safety and
              security. In order to achieve this, i t wight be necessary
              to remove one or t.vo rrws of terracing mid to protest the
             walkw&v froa ths terrrre by c. coullnuous line of barriers,
              g o designed as to dis-:‘-rags access to the walinwey except
              at authorised pointa. The access points from terrace to

     a    bundle       of       copy    documents           extracted from         the Firm's           files

     which        accompanies          this        statement.          when        referring           to     an

     individual          document,        I shall      add     the relevant          page     number in

     the bundle.



     4.       I      have      been    involved        with      football          stadia         inducing

     Hillsborough               for     many        years. My        first            contact               with

     H il l s b o r o u g h      was    in    the     late     1950's whilst         I was        a    Senior

     L e ctur er       at       Sheffield          University.         I advised them             on     minor

     matters.           My major involvement with football stadia came when I

     joined          Husband      &    Co     as    Managing     Partner.            That         firm       were

         c onsulting          Engineers       to     the     Club,    Sheffield            United           F. C. ,

         So uthampton F. C. , Nottingham Forest F. C. , Swindon Town F. c. and
                                                                                             IV


     Rotherham       United F. C.            whilst at Husband t Co I took particular

     res pon sibi lity           for     their         work    at    these        grounds     and      I    was

     involved       in the construction of new stands                               at both Nottingham

     Forest F.C.          and Swindon Town F. c.                    During this period there was

     the disaster at Ibrox Park.                        In the aftermath of this disaster,

     I was     involved in liaison with the Police concerning capacity

     of     football       stadia.            Handrail!- "and             crush     barriers       were      the

     subject        of    much     discussion            and    I    designed       equipment       to      test

     c r ush barriers which was used at the stadia of the six football

     clubs mentioned above.



■i   5.      It must be remembered that all this took place before the

      1975    Act    and the           1976 Guide.             Both the      1975     Act    and the         1976

     Guide were a product of the -Wheatley Commission'                                      of 1972 which

     was     set    up    to     examine         the    safety of sports             grounds       following

      the Ibrox disaster.                  Sir Walter Winterbottom,                   former Manager of

      the    England       Football          Team,       chaired      a working          party    to       advise

      the    Wheatley       Commission.                That working party spent                   a day with

      me discussing safety at football stadia.

the       Club      and       Liverpool          on    14th January           1989.        I    attended the

 Greater London, where the "building authority" and "local authority"
 are synonymous’ the local authority is not required to refer safety
 n^rtificate applications to the building authority or consult it
 a h o u t the terms and conditions of a certificate. Similarly the
 building authority in these areas does not have the status of
 "interested party” and has no need of the right to authorise entry
 and inspection of a sports ground because these powers are vested in
 it     as   the      local    authority.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Background

Wheatley Report

1.    The terms of the Inquiry extended to sports grounds generally but because the
immediate concern at the time related to soccer grounds, its Report concentrated
on crowd safety in such grounds, and included Rugby Union and Rugby League grounds.
Lord Wheatley had no doubt, that the then existing controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate.    He found that the voluntary system of certifi­
cation of grounds introduced by the Football Association some years previously laid
down no requirements as to the competence of persons who carried out the annual
inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines to assist those persons in
their assessment.of safety standards.    Moreover, a review of the statutory provisioi
relevant to the safety of spectators at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley
that the law also fell short of providing proper and effective control over
football grounds as a whole.     The building regulations, for example, provide for
the basic structural safety of new buildings within a football ground but they do
                                                                not apply to existing

buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor do they apply to a
ground as a whole.    In any case, most football grounds were built before national

 building regulations were introduced.


 2.   Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme could
 ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests of safety and he
 recommended a statutory licensing system.    He proposed that these controls should
 be introduced by stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly speaking,
 being dealt with first.   Lord Wheatley also recommended that there should be a
 right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision of the licensing
 authority.   The Report showed Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile
 the paramount aim of ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonablt

 and practicable for the clubs.


 3.    Lord Wheatley also provided, as a technical appendix to his report, guidelines
 to safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the local authorities

 in their task of enforcement.
Consultations on the Report

4            When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including the
i o c a l     authority associations and the football authorities, -ere consulted about
Lord Wheatley's proposals.          The football authorities made it clear that the, were
apprehensive at the financial Implications for the clubs, but there was genera
agreement with the proposals themselves,           tetailed confutations were held on the
guidelines contained in the technical appendix to the Deport and these, duly
amended, were finally published by the Home Apartments in November            m3    as a
 special booklet, "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds” .         It was revised in
 in the light of practical experience of its application and specifically targeted

 on football grounds.


    Guide to Safety at Sport. Grounds (Football)

    5         The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.   Its primary
    purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local authorities will
    no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.        The Guide therefore deals
    with matters such as the provision of adequate entrances and exits, means of
    escape, the slope of terracing, the strength and siting of crush barriers, the

    construction of staircases, and measures to ensure the safe —             t «
    both under normal and emergency conditions.        The Guide is not a set of
    to be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances.        As Lord Wheatley
    recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum flexibility in any system of
     control so as to take account of the differing circumstances at individual groun s.
     factors such as age, size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to

        ground


        b       While the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to all sports
        6
        stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports other than football are
        s
        involved.


        General Approach to the Act
        7       The main Instrument of control under the Act is the safety certificate issued by
        the local authority.      A safety certificate is needed in respect of every stadium
         which is the subject of a designation order, made by the Secretary of State.       The
            certificate enables the local authority to impose such tern, and conditions as
            are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the stadium in question.
8.      The approach to designation was based on a phased programme so that the more
important grounds regularly attracting the largest attendances were dealt with''
first.     The international stadia at which soccer and Rugby Union were played plus
stadia used by soccer clubs in Division 1 of the Football League were designated
in 1976.     This was followed in 1'979 by designation of stadia of clubs in
Division 2 of the League and thereafter on promotion of a club to Division 2.
Following the     fire   at Bradford City FC in May 1985 all the remaining stadia
liable to designation used by clubs in Divisions 3 and 4 of the Football League,
and qualifying stadia of clubs in Division 1 and 2 of the Rugby League were

designated.


Substance of the Act

9.      The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under the Act, that
is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local authority for the area in
which the stadium is situated, which is required for every sports stadium desig­
nated for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.


10.     Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate any sports
stadium having accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators as requiring a
safety certificate.      Safety certificates are of two kinds, general and special.
A general safety certificate is the main continuing form of control and is issued
for an indefinite period in respect of a specified activity or activities
 regularly taking place at the stadium.     A special safety certificate may be issued
 at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other circumstances
 not covered by the general safety certificate.      Such an event might be an evangel­
 istic rally which might call for special arrangements if, for example, seating were
 provided for the congregation on the playing area.      A special safety certificate
 can be issued only in respect of a sports stadium for which a general safety

 certificate is already in force.


 11.     The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2 .     The local
 authority is empowered to include in the certificate such terms and conditions as
 are necessary to secure, at the stadium in question, a reasonable degree of safety.
 Without prejudice to this general power, the section requires certificates to conta
 terms and conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, mear.a c
 escape in emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush barriers, and the
 maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.
 To remove any possibility of doubt, sub-section (3) makes it clear that a certifica
 may include a condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance a

     the maintenance of safety-                                                     ^   _
12.     An earlier Bill, introduced in 1973, H a l t e d the terms and conditions
imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary to secure       a reasonable
degree for Members of the public."      There was some difficulty over this tern
because it night have excluded, for example, members of supporters' clubs.          This
particular problem was by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is,
any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.        On the other hand,
it seemed      right that all the peole present on the occasion of a match or other
activity for which a ground has a certificate should be taken into account for the
purpose of the safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or
other facilities at the ground.       Accordingly, the general power of the local
authority under section 2(1) to include in a safety certificate such terms or
conditions as are necessary omits any reference to people and speaks only of
securing "reasonable safety at the stadium", (although the terms "safety", as
 defined in section 17, does not include danger arising from participation in a
 sport).      Certain provisions must, however, be specifically linked with spectators
 (who are, after all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will
 be greatly in the majority).       Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate to state

 the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted.




 1         Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to be fallowed when a local authority
 receives an application for a safety certificate. , It requires them to determine
 whether an applicant is, in their opinion, a qualified person, ie a person likely
 to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions imposed
  in the certificate.      If so, they are then under a duty to issue a general safety
  certificate to him.      In this respect, the general safety certificate is different
  from the fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971:         the latter
  is issued only after necessary safety works have been completed, whilst the
  safety certificate under this Act can be issued almost from the outset, and is an
  instrument of continuing control.        The issue of a special safety certificate,
  however, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already explained,
  because'only they can judge whether it is appropriate to issue it for the special

  occasion in question.


     1H.    In Metropolitan Counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
      authority is required to send a copy of any application for a certificate to the
      police and the Fire Authority, and must consult them about the terms and conditions
to be included in the certificate.    Elsewhere a copy must be sent to, and
consultation take' place with, the police and the Building Authority.    The need
for such consultation is self-evident:     there must be close co-ordination of the
interests of the different authorities directly concerned with different aspects

of safety at football grounds.


15.    Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer, surrender and
cancellation of safety certificates.     It is of primary importance that a local
authority should have power to amend a safety certificate where it appears
appropriate for them to do so, for example, if they find in the course of a
routine inspection that a part of a ground has become so dangerous as to demand an
immediate restriction on its use or some other necessary safeguard.     Again, they
must have power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements

have been carried out to make this possible.


16.    Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against decisions or
requirements of the local authority in connection with safety certificates.      Appeals
lie to.the Secretary of State, who has power to set up a formal inquiry.


17.    Section 6(2) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to
the safety of spectators at sports grounds.     This is in the nature of a reserve
power which could be used, for example, to give backing to requirements of the
local authorities which in the light of experience had been shown to be essential.
This section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for various
other purposes .connected with the Act.     To date no regulations have been made

under this sub-section.


 18.   Section 7 provides for some supplementary matters on determinations and
 appeals. Sub-sections (1) and (2) provide for the deemed withdrawal of an applica­
 tion for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate when a local authority
 determines that a person is not, or has ceased to be, qualified to hold it.        The
 section also provides for the suspension of a condition in a certificate pending
 determination of an appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a
 court, on the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition
 remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.




                                       v
19.    The holder of a general safety certificate is required by aection 8 to
notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or extension of a stadium.
The purpose of the clause is to guard against any alterations being made, without
the local authority's knowledge, which might affect the safety of spectators.


20     Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act "with other legislation

which may affect sports stadia.


21.    Section 10 is an important power which authorities should not feel inhibited
from using where the danger to spectators are such that use of the ground, or part
of it, should be prohibited or restricted.     Should a magistrates' court, on the
application of a local authority, consider that the risk to spectators at any
sports ground is so great that their admission should be prohibited or restricted
until remedial action has been taken, the court may make an order accordingly.
This power applies to any sports stadium or ground, whether or not it is designated
as requiring a safety certificate. - Where a general or special safety certificate
is in force, local authorities may prefer to remedy an unsatisfactory situation
by amending the certificate, in cases where there is sufficient time to do so.
In respect of sports grounds and the smaller stadia, consultations between the
local authority and the club would usually be expected to secure, on a voluntary
 basis, a reasonable standard of safety; however, where management appears to be
 unwilling to undertake the necessary measures’or is slow to act on advice, this

 additional power can be used.


 22.    Section 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons appointed by the
 local authority and others involved in the task of ensuring crowd safety at sports

 grounds.    Section 12 deals with offences and penalties.


 23.    Section 13 deals mainly with civil liability.   Its purpose is to make clear
 that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of action in respect of a
 contravention of regulations or of conditions in a safety certificate, the existing
 rights of a spectator injured at a football stadium to bring an action for negli­
 gence against the occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.


 24.    The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to classes of
 sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the Act as are not
 already expressed to apply to them.     For example, it enables the Secretary of
 State by order to extend the safety certificate procedure to such places as
race-courses.   Only a class of sports ground may be the subject of an extension
order under this clause:   an individual sports ground (other than a stadium)
cannot be designated until section 1 of the Act has been applied by an order
under section 15 to the class of sports ground to which itbelongs.     Todate,
the powers under this section have not been used.


25.   S ection 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications, to the

Crown.   Section 17 deals with interpretation.


26.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations,exceptcommencement     orders,
made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution procedure.       It also
imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before making any orders or regulations
except commencement orders or orders relating to the Isles of Scilly, to consult

with such persons as appear to him requisite.
                                                                      ANNEX C


SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.      The-Saf4ty of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 provide that any application
for a safety certificate shall be made in the form contained in the Schedule to
the Regulations or a form to the like effect.         An application should be accompanied
by detailed information as to the structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, includ­
ing plans of the stadium, certificates relating to the testing of crush barriers
and evidence of the applicant's status.         It is, however, open to a local authority,
under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, such further
information of this kind as it may consider necessary to enable it to determine

the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.


2.      On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and con­
 ditions to be imposed in the certificate.         If it considers him to be such a person
 the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
 In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
 paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.
 In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general
 safety certificate would be made by an unqualified person.         There is, however, a
 right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is

 not a qualified person (see paragraph 1 0 ).


 3.      In Metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
 authority is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of any appli­
  cation for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
  Officer of Police and the fire authority, and must consult them about the terms
     and conditions to be included in the certificate.      Elsewhere in England and Wales
     the local authority must send a copy to and consult with the Chief Officer of
     P&lio^»nd..ttee..fc«Udins>auy^i^.^I=uXramiJig.SMC^.CQtidi.tions. local authorities

     will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in the
     Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.       In this connection local authorities are
     reminded that, this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be
     rigidly applied regardless of individual circumstances.       The maximum flexibility
     should be maintained to take account of the different circumstances of individual
     grounds deriving from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of con­
     struction.   In this regard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that th




                                          i
                                                                                   a     o
terms and conditions should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reason­
able safety" and it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek
the absolute safety of everyone attending the sports stadium.                          %


4.   It Is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the
local authority and the stadium representatives in the process of drawing up the
certificate conditions.     In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is
rarely filled to capacity, the local authority may consider it proper to base its
requirements on actual levels of attendance over a given period rather than on
maximum capacity.     On the rare occasions on which a capacity crowd could be
expected, separate provision might be made for this contingency on the lines
indicated in paragraph 7 below.     Again, if a stand were found to be structurally
weak, the local authority might, in consultation with the stadium representatives,
offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works carried out or of restrict­
ing admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.


5.   As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the indivi­
dual case.     Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.
It must however contain full details 'of the terms and conditions imposed including,
in particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have annexed
to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be
framed.    The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which
can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate.     The local
authority may find it convenient to list, in a covering letter to the certificate,
such modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the.form of a state­
ment of the increased spectator capacities’ to be allowed for the separate sections
of the ground when the various stages of any future .works programme

agreed with the stadium authorities ar'e' completed.    This arrangement, by

•excluding* from’the certificate itself proposed conditions which would
aDpl^. only.,to .future works* should serve to obviate confusion.   At the same tine,
however, care must be taken not to exclude from the certificate any restriction
germane to current conditions, since section 5(3) of the Act provides for an
interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State against the inclusion of
anything     in, or the omission of anything from, a safety certificate, and these
rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form of the
certificate.
6.        As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the
Act provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different
activities.         Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­
ball ground, in cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other
events it would be desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special
safety certificates, if the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were
to be included in the general certificate.         It is suggested that any such events
for which it is considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided intc

2 classes:-


          1.   those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
          stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;


          2.    those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
          concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given
          over to    spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and conditions
          will have to be devised.     It is not, of course, necessary to provide for
           these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium

           authorities.


 7.        There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
 to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
 special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected           attract signi^
 ficantly more than the usual attendance.          In the case especially of cupreplays
 these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which-it wculc
 not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate tc
 the grant of a special safety certificate.          In order to overcome this difficulty,
 it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek
  to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which
  might be appropriate to such occasions,, eg the admission of increased numbers to
  certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
  notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their

     incorporation in the general safety certificate.


     8.     Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­
     tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­
     ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of
     the certificate or of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and wi*l
     presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the
original certificate.     It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities
and clubs /stadium authorities for a close liaison to be maintained after the
 issue of the certificate and certainly while any further works of safety measures
 are being carried out.    It is likely to be in the stadium operators' financial
 interest to get the safety certificate amended as soon as possible after work
 has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure that the local authority
 is kept informed of progress.    For   its part the local authority will no doubt
 wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion of the
 work, the certificate can be amended without delay.


• 9.    After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
 transfer of the certificate to another person.      Similarly, while a local
 authority is considering an application for a certificate and before the certifi­
 cate has been granted, It may be asked to substitute some person other than the
 original applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.        These
 are    however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certifi­
  cates, where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club or a stadium
  organisation by an authorised official of the club or representative of the
  organisation.   However, if it does happen, the local authority will be required in
  both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified person.
  Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations to
 • giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply together with
  any necessary appeals procedure.      In the second case, there is no reason why the
  local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new applica­
  tion in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had already

  reached.


   10    In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
   certificate against the d o m i n a t i o n that he la not a qualified person (see
   paragraph 2 above), which, of course, appllea also in the case of a proposed
   transfer of a certificate, the Act provides a further right o£ appeal to any
   "interested party" (which tern includes the holder of the safety certificate)
   against the inclusion of anything In or the omission of anything from a safety
   certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.           The
   regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of
   any such appeal shall be given within 26 days following receipt of a notice of
   the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,
   the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating

    in the locality.
11.    In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or
amending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.
It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of
advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition
which it provides of "interested party", no other Beans could be found of ensuring
that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the
meaning of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority,
decision, and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a
denial of their rights of appeal or of a hearing by the Secretary of State.     For
the same reason a similar obligation has been imposed on an appellant .(by
Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing to
appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under Section 5(4) of
the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.


 12.    Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
 appeal.    It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation
 8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it
 wishes to oppose the appeal.    With any such notice, the local authority is
 required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state
 whether it wishes a hearing under Section 5     of the Act.   (The procedure govern­

 ing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)


 13.    It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
 order a public inquiry under Section 5 (6 ) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
 In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation 12.

  14.    It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
  practice of copying to the Home Office newly Issued or amended safety certificate
                                                                          ANNEX




SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate sha
be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a fora to
like effect.     Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in
case of applications for special safety certificates.     In any case where an
application for a special safety certificate ia not made by the holder of the
general safety certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the appli­
cant's status.     Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seat
arrangements for spectators should be provided, together with such further
information in support of the application as is considered necessary to enable
the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act.     However, it is
open to a local authority, under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notic
in writing, any further information of this kind which they may think it
necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions to be
included in the special safety certificate. ‘


2.   -A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificate
is that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant ia a quali­
fied person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory,
whereas the issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion.
But an applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a
refusal (see following paragraphs for details).


3.    An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made a
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority ha
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied
that the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser per
eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.      On receipt of an
application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to b
in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be i=poa
in the certificate.     The local authority ia required by regulation 5 to ma*e
this determination within 14 days of receiving the application.      There is a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant
is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5, the
applicant must be furnished with the reasons for such a determination.
                                                                                                  4




            H.         It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
            on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.        This
            decision must, in accordance with regulation 6 , be made within 28 days of the
            receipt of the application, not only in cases where the local authority has
            determined.that the applicant is a qualified person but also in those where
            it has determined that he is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to
            be considered.        There is also a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds
            other than a determination that the applicant is not a qualified person (see
 A          paragraph 9).        In the event of such a refusal, therefore, the local authority is
            again required, under regulation 6 , to give the applicant the reasons for its

            decision.


             5.                 When the first 2 stages have been completed, should it have been decided
             that a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority in
             metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) is required, by
             section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the Chief Officer
             of Police and to the fire authority and to consult them about the terms and
             conditions to be included in the certificate.         Elsewhere in England and Wales
             the local authority must send a copy to, and consult with, the Chief Officer of
            • Police and the building authority.        The special safety certificate must, in
• ;■        -accordance with regulation 6 (2 ), then be issued not less than 28 days before

             the proposed event is due to take place.


                 6.     The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
                 according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
                 certificate would not be appropriate.      (In suitable cases, however, regard may
                 be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
                 (Football) on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of.the paper relating to the
                 "Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates".)      Any
                 special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms
                 and conditions imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in
                 section 2(2) of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where
                 appropriate by reference to the plan attached to the general safety cartificate.


                  7-     Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the deter­
                  mination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal
                  amendment of the certificate.     This may be on the application of the holder of
 Ig^,-            the certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2)
LjgWfc~-.         or the Act). Thi*        =»r,                   in the case of a special safety
certificate, otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has
been issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.     Any such amend­
ment must, however, be publicised as in paragraph 10 below.


8.      Considerations of time render the transfer of'a special safety certificate
to another person an equally unlikely contingency.     Any possible difficulties
in this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the
general safety certificate applies for the special certificate.     Nevertheless,
should an application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide
within 14 days if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it
decides to.the contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating
to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will
the appropriate appeals procedure, should the need arise.     In the case of an
application for transfer before a special safety certificate has actually been
issued, there is no reason why the local authority should not treat the applica­
tion in all respects as a new application in the terms of the original and pro­

cess it from the point already reached.


9.       Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against-a deter­
mination that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against
 the refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4).     In addition the
 Act provides (in section 5(3))a right of appeal to any "interested party"
 against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
 certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.
 The regulations provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, not!
 of any such appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice
 of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not
 notified, the publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper

 circulating in the locality.


 10. As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
 local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so
 to amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also
 to advertise its action in the press.      A similar obligation falls on an appells
  (under regulation 8 (7 )) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person vis!-
  ing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under sectior
  5(4) of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement
     (The reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph   11 of the
     paper relating to the 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety     ^
11.     Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of a p p e a l , accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.     It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation
8(9),    to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.     With any auch notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to
state whether it wishes a hearing under s e c t i o n ^ * ) of the Act.   (The pro­
cedure governing the conduct of all such hearings ia Bet out in regulation 1 0 . )


 12.    It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary,
to order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any
 appeal.    In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in

 regulation 1 2 .


 13.     It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
 practice of copying to the Home Office any special safety certificates issued.

 Dear Mr. England,
               Mr. Whitehead very kindly let me have a sight of
 the prints which he had obtained from Husband & Co.                                    Even
 though these do not contain all the information we would
 require,they give sufficient to make the task relatively
 easy so far as the North stand and West stand are concerned.
 I have now returned the prints to Mr. Whitehead but we have
 taken photo-copies to keep on our file.
               If you wish to go so far as making an application for
a Certificate we shall still need to survey the South
 stand and Spion Cop.                                  But as I said in my letter last week,
for an expenditure not exceeding £500 we would be able to
take the survey sufficiently far to let you have a report
on what would be involved (if anything) in bringing the
ground up to standard, and alternatively, what would be the
likely effect on the ground capacity in any Certificate if
you do not carry out any improvements for the time being.


                                                                     Yours sincerely,

     apologies of the Ci-air:nan. Mr. «. E. Mc'oce. i-r. Whitehead stressed that the
•    Club wished to ?<zh the SraoiM       ior bi* matches as regularly as possible.

     During the cc>';v>c o- tic rase vision the fell owing points were maoe:~

      (a)    the Stadium had been used for many capacity matches over the years and
             its saf«*y w r.v d -vis the equr-1 of any Lr the country;

      C«)     if tne Code of Practice -vcre to be applied literally, then there would
              probably be minor discrepancies such as in the width of the steps on the
              Spion Kop and in the width of the gangways and exits in the Stands;

        would requi            be t e s t e d initially, w ith up to 20% t e s te d annually
        thereafter;

(d)    it was likely that the fire risk in the North and West stands would be
        minimal, but the main stand would probably require more detailed
        attention: however, only a detailed inspection by the Fire Service would
        reveal the crue position;                ~

(e)    the police vi’ould be happy with the existing position of the Police Control
        Centre, but felt the present structure would not meet their requirements;

(f)    the North and West Stands were modern structures, but the main stand
       had originally been built some 50 years ago and there were now no
        records, which would mean that a complete survey of this would be
       necessary;

(g)    the only activity which normally took place at the Stadium other than
       football was the Annual Jehovah's Witness Rally, and an endeavour would
       be mad-r’ to make provision for this in the General Safety Certificate so as
       to obviate tht- -.eeo for the Special Safety Certificate procedure;

        the Chief Executive to the Club before any formal progress could be made on
        the application.

At the invitation of the Club, the Working Party took the opportunity of carrying out
an informal inspection of the Stadium in company with the Club's representatives.

I thank you for your lettar datad 22nd December, 1573, and the ccoy
i*ttsr cf tha Euilcing surveyor of the Sheffield Metropolitan
District Council.

It would saem essential that the officers.of the County Council and
Mgt- 3 -ol’tan District Council involved in the production of the
c»naral'safety csrtificate racuirad by tha Sheffield ii/adnascay
       aii club under ths acove Act, undertake a comprehensive survey
ciTtha crcund.    I faal sure that it would be beneficial to ths Club
. - initially, each department acced in unison in this respec-
         than separately and I would make tha necessary arrangam«ni. 3
Hith"my_offi_cers for, this to b e jchiBvad^    ___

f- --py of the roport of each department'should‘be provised to aach
*'nvclv»d dsoartmant to enable problems to be discusssd so that an
accsptad approach might be determined and ccnsolidatsd into a single
rsport which should be forwarded to the Club.

This rscort, tcgstnar with that of Dr* Eastwood, would fern ths
basis of a further masting with officials of tha Club as cifrsrar.css
cf opinion, if any, would have hsen identifiad.

It <s my opinion that the r.scessary comprehensive survay could not
ta undertaken satisfactorily without plan drawings.   In t m s raspac.
I rsfsr to paragraph 1.3 af tha ‘green cods’:

"Tf-3 p-oblam of crowd safety at football grouncs is complax er.d
c -~rot b° solved simoly by ensuring that each cocpor.ont cf a grouns,
such a- stairs, passages or sactjons of terracing, ia satisfactory
in itself. Ths intar-rslaticn cf cor.pcr.sats is essential:    ...-y
should be compatible and cc.r.bina to fora a balar.cad uni,.1.

Following tha receipt cf drawings I suggast that Officers msso to
arrse on identification procedures.    In ordsr that each derar^men.

uould'prefor to hava stands and terraces claarly idantifiad, exit

ourselves in consultation with the Club. following the submission
cf*Cr. Eastwood’s report with limited information this could
prove unfortunate in the long term.

        Dear Sirs,
                                  Certificate of Safety - Interin Report
                    We have now progressed sufficiently far with our
        survey and assessment to be able to submit an Interim report
        covering the probable ground capacity and the likely costs ol
        improvements which will be required by the certifying authority.
                    The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
        culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
•       will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendation, in the
        guide.        Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of
        the fire officer and the police.


        Standing Accommodation
         (a)        Spion Kop
                           The general layout of Spion Kop is good.                                It
                    has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
                    well below the maximum laid down in the guide.   The
                    slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements for
                     good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                            The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                     of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
                     permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of


                                                                                                         0

          the exits.
                  Where the barriers'are adequate in strength
         and spacing, the guide recoaaends that, the number
                                                       2
          of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10a       of plan
          area.    Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
         Kop is approximately 3120m2 which would provide
          accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                  Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
          standards.    Category A must.be able to withstand a
          test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
         and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
          Is 1973 you had tests made on all the barriers by
         Toft and Brocklebank Ltd.        Of the 101 barriers on
          Spion Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb
         and a further 15 carried the load but had some actual
         or incipient defect which needed attention.         Most of
          those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
         would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
         On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of
         a long barrier which was weak.        The general situation was
          satisfactory compared with most grounds.
                  Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
         barriers up to a uniform category A standard.         it
          should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
          the tests and there will have been some deterioration
          due to rusting.    Host of the barriers are made from
         2§" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
          inches when new;    Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield's
         atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers -axe subject
          to more rusting than others and we must expect some
          increase in the number needing attention.
              -     "Prdvldeti' a barrier can withstand 6kN/m, the
         maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
          guide, varies between 5a for slopes of only 5° to 2.9a

                                                                              tttlT 3.

                 for slopes of 30°.      These figures apply to 'peak
                 viewing' areas.      Spion Kop has an average slope
                 of about 17° for which the recommended spacing is
                 3. 6m.
                           In calculating spectator capacity each barrier
                 is assumed to cater for an area of ground immediately
                 behind it which is either 3.6m vide or up to the
) xi
                 next barrier, whichever is the smaller.       We have
                 surveyed the Kop, and our drawing 1610/1 attached
                 shews the proportion of the Kop which will be
                 admissible in the spectator calculation if all the
                 barriers are brought up to category A standard.         It
                 vill be immediately apparent that the great majority
                 of the available area will qualify.       Our calculation
                 shows that the permitted number of spectators should
                 be about 13,900 i.e. the number o f ’places 'lost* will
                 be almost 3,000.
                           If you wish to retain most >of. these extra places
                  (aiming for a ground capacity of at least 50,000
' )              say) then new barriers could be constructed at positions
                 shown by the red lines on the second copy.of drawing
                 1610/1.      The capacity would then be 16,000.
                           In proposing the extra barriers we are mindful
                 that in some cases they will possibly hinder the
                 close packing of spectators.       Clearly, there is no
                 point in spending money in order to achieve a large
                 permitted.ground capacity, if ’that-numberrcaanot
                 then be packed in.      However, we think that even with
                 an uneven distribution of spectators it will still be
                 possible to accommodate 16,000 spectators.
                           You may wish to consider whether the cost of
                  these extra barriers wiIT"be justified by the additional
                  income they might generate over the years.       It is

             likely that new barriers, which will require fairly
             massive foundation and anchor block* will cost between
              £50 and £60 per metre run.             Thus the extra 235 metres
              of barrier will cost about £5.00 per extra standing
              place.
                       Spion Kop is not ideally catered for by exits.
              A very adequate gangway system feeds to only three
              exit points.         The total width of these three exits
              at their       narrowest   points is.12.5m.     The guide assumes
              a m a x i m u m flow rate through these exits of 60 persons
              per minute for each 550ma of width.              Thus the
              theoretical time to discharge 16,000 spectators from
              Spion Kop would be ll$minutes, compared with a maximum
              of 8 minutes indicated by the guide.
                     The exits at each end of the terrace are reasonably
              f r e e from hazards,      except the one at-the North end p a s s e s
              under a bridge with a headroom well below the recommended
              value of 8ft.         This defect could be removed by lowering
               the floor level, but I would argue strongly that it is
               far from essential to have such a large headroom, and
               the cost of modification is not justified in an existing
               structure.
                      The exit at the back of Spion Kop is likely to
               raise most difficulty.              The ra«p i« steep and It M s

                If no works are to be requested.             My f l i n g is that
                continuous handrails will be required, splitting the
                ramp into say three separate lanes.
                       There may be considerable pressure to increase

          the total exit capacity.    _-We can argue that the
          eight minutes allowed for complete evacuation is only
          really valid for stands where there might be a risk
          due to fire, or explosion^ or structural failure.        In
          the case of terracing it is only the impatience of
          spectators which might create danger.      Tor an interim
          period, at least, this should be acceptable.
                 Any changes or additions to the exit arrangements
          should take account of a possible future decision to roof
          over Spion Kop.     It would be possible to incorporate ia
          such a scheme a 'squaring o f f   at the top which could
          increase the area available for spectators.      However,
          this would probably mean that additional entrances would
          be needed, possibly by tunnelling through the bank at
          lower level.      This would certainly make it easier to
          pack the crowd more uniformly..     However, this is a
          matter for the future and is unlikely to be part of the
          present exercise.
   (b)    t>. west Terrace (including Lo.«r U t t l »t Korth T«»t Comer)
                  Tbe west terrace is not quite so well endowed with
          barriers as Spion lop.      The present layout is shown on the
          attached drawing 1610/2.      Our measurements show a total
          area of 1480m2 but there are no gangways.      We feel that
           some allowance should be made for circulation space as
           spectators have to move quite considerable horizontal
           distances to achieve good packing.      The full area would
           justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
           probably be appropriate to allow 10% as     the equivalent
           of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.   The
           barriers should be designed to match this figure approximately.
                  The shaded area on drawing 1610/2 is that which
           may be counted if the ex listing barriers are of class A.
           About 15 of the. existing barriers are likely to need
                                                                       SHUT   6.

            strengthening to achi«ve this .standard.      Even with
             this strengthening only 4,300 spectators could be
            accommodated, representing * loss of nearly half _
             We presume this would be unacceptable.
                    The extra barriers required to achieve
             approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
             second copy of drawing 1610/2.      You may feel that
             some of the proposed new barriers which are close
             to the entrances might restrict the passage of
             spectators undesirably.      In that case they could
             be omitted.
                    The three exits have a total width of about
            ... U . 5 o which would permit about 1250 people per minute
             to ieave the ground.      Thus the stand could empty
l: V ”y      in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                     The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
 '^          should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.      There    are
              no gangways and some spectators will be 25* from an
              exit.     But we feel this is of no consequence as
              movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
              and quick.

              1610/2.      The gross area available (there are no gangways)
              is about 565 «2 .     Thus if the crush barriers were
              adequate and the whole area is included the number of

             have examined the drawings of these barriers and
             in addition to the weakness of the rails and posts,
             the holding down arrangements appear to be very
             inadequate and might be treacherous.       A sudden
             failure of a bolt, and they are very highly stressed,
             could lead to a collapse without warning.       These
             barriers need major strengthening as a matter of
             urgency.
                    Assuming that the barriers are strengthened
             it will be seen from the drawing 1610/2 that they
             also need considerable supplementation.        The scheme
             shown   on the second copy of this drawing does not
             quite justify the whole area being taken in the
             calculations.  But it would be reasonable to count
             say 2900.    This would bring the total standing at
             the Leppings Lane end to 10,100..
                    The exits serving this part of the terrace are
              very adequate, but there may be requests for central
              handrailings to be provided.


       Seating Accommodation
       (a)    The North Stand
                     The form of   construction of this stand is such
              that   it presents a minimum fire hazard. The exit.
              are numerous and .paced so that they satisfy the
              recommendations of the guide.
                     Two nutters might cause concern.        The first,

               are the same In the other .stands the total number of
               seats lost would be 1,041.        Tbis is almost unthinkable
               and must be resisted strongly.
                      Fortunately, the timing of spectators leaving                 _
               the ground on 6 January showed that a peak of 80 per
               minute passed through one exit.        This is the figure
               quoted by the guide for a 1.1m gangway.       With 18 exits
               for 10,000 people the average would be 556 per unit.
               Thus the stand would empty in about seven minutes,
               which is within the recommended limit of eight minutes.
                      Our observations on 6 January showed that everyone
               had left this stand, apart from a few people who were
               in no hurry,in about six minutes, although we also counted
               about 40 per exit who left before the final whistle.
               The overall picture appears very satisfactory and
               encourages the hope that this stand will be accepted
                as not needing any significant modification.

      (b)       The West Stand
                       This stand is very similar to the north stand
                in its construction.     We were not able to accurately
                assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
                January because there were many seats which were unsold.
                However, there is every reason to believe that there
                will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
                eight minutes also.     There should be no need for
                significant modifications.

                The South Stand
                    -- The structure-has been surveyed and appended           ...
                are prints of our drawings 1610/3, A and 5, which
                 show the plans and cross-section.       Also attached is
                 a sfefc'ti'ng p-Ian; drawing No. 1610/6.
                           The upper part of'the stand (the covered area)
                 has 5710 seats.    These are served by 10 exits (excluding

                                                                     sutrr   9

          those serving the directors box) so that an average
          of 570 people need to pass through each exit.      The
          count on 6 January shoved an average of just over 70
          per minute passing through one exit which corresponds
          to an emptying time of about eight minutes.      Indeed
          there were very few. people still trying to get out six
          minutes after the final whistle.      A few had no doubt
          left early and a few were still standing around, but
          the stand had substantially emptied In about six minuter.
                    Having left the top of the stand the spectators
          have to make their way from the first floor landing via
          one of three staircases.      Two of these are 3.6m wide
          and the other 2.4.      This is equivalent to 17$ 'lanes'
          of 550mm.      At 40 people per lane, 700 people pass per
          minute.      To discharge 5710 people (less those in the
          directors box) will therefore take almost exactly 8
          minutes as permitted by the guide.
                 The fire officers were clearly very interested
          in the first floor.      There is very little 'fire load'
          on this floor - the snack bars and the office/lounge.
          But quite a small fire might fill this area with smoke.
          We suspect that there might be a request for it to be compart­
           mentalised by fire doors.
                  At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
           almost straight to the open air,, through a compartment
           which is separated from the main part of the building.
           The third staircase .is not so well separated and some
           structural work may be needed.      Apparently the paint
           store is beside this staircase.      This may not be wise.
                    There may well be requests from the fire officer
           for cQnsiderable extra precautions and structural...
           alterations in this building.
                  The front, open-air-part of the south stand is

           If it is required to increase this capacity at some
    time in the future Spion Kop could be 'squared off' at the
   back using a steel framed structure and perhaps a further
   4OOO places could be provided.                    The Kbp could also be
    roofed over, of course.

                This total should not at this stage be taken as
     .ore than a broad guess.        We may have pleasant surprises
     but there could be shocks.          The total does not contain
     any allowance for the local authority, charges In
     connection with the issuing of the licence or for our
     professional fees.


     F u ture   Action
                Subject to your approval we suggest that the next
     steps might be as follows .-
     i          we should pass copies of all drawings to the police,
                the fire brigade, the city Building Surveyor and the
                County Council.      In addition to drawings showing
                 the results of our surveys of the Kop, the Leppings
                Lane terrace and the south stand, we are preparing
                 suitable drawings of the north and west stands,
                 measuring from the photo-copies of Husbands drawings.

      2.        We should make firm proposals to the police and the
                 fire brigade for the new crush barriers, together
                 with our computation of the number of spectators, and
                 invite comments including any suggestions of further
                 measures which may be needed.
         3      At the same time we should make detailed drawings and
                 specifications for the strengthening work on the
                 barriers which are known to be weak, andfor the con­
                  struction of the new barriers, and obtain tenders.

     A Meeting with The Club
            You may feel that another meeting to discuss this
     report and the suggestions for further action, should be
     held shortly.    Dr. Eastwood will be out of the country
     for three weeks from 22 January so that the week beginning

                                         REPORT ON GROUND CAPACITY


                This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
  which is attainable.
                It deals in broad terms with -the necessary strengthening
  and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
  calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
                Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
  the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
  made at the end of the third round'cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                The green guide has been used as a basis fo3r our cal­
  culations, although as with probably all existing grounds,                                                   it
  will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
  guide.           Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the

            Standing Accommodation
            (a)       Spion Kop
                             The general layout of Spion Kop is good.                It
                     has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
                     ▼ell below the maximum laid down in the guide.                 The
                     slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
                     for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                               The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                     of the cruBh barriers to Justify * high number of
                     permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
                      the exits.
                               Where the barriers are adequate in strength
                     and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                                         2
                      of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m              of plan
                     area.   Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                               2
                     Kop is approximately 3120m which would provide
                      accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                               Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
v.    !              standards.        Category A must be able to withstand a
^                    test load of 6kN/metrewidth (400 lb/loot approximately)
                      and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot)
                      In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
                      and Brocklebank Ltd.           Of t he 101 barriers on Spion
                      Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400             lb   and
                      a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
                      incipient defect which needed attention.               Most of
      . -            those which failed the test, failed so badly tha-t- they
                      w o u l d - probably-not   .satisfy category B standard, either- ..
                      On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
                      long barrier which was weak. It should be emphasised
                      t h a t t h e general-situation was satisfactory compared-

                      with most grounds.
                             Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                                               SHtrr   3.

                            Spion Kop           has     three        exits,       one near          each
                 end    and       one at        the     top.              The    total w i d t h      of
                 these       three          exits at         their        narrowest          points     is 1 2 . 5m.
                 The    guide          assumes a ma x i m u m              flow rate          through       such
                 exits       of    60 persons               per    minute        for    each    550mm of
                 width.            Thus       the      theoretical              time    to d i s c h a r g e
                 16,000          spectators            from Spion Kop would                    be    ll£ minutes,
                 compared with                a maximum            of     8 minutes          indicated by             the
                 guide.            We       do n o t    consider           this    to be a          serious            —      )/, u vj
                 matter.               Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very                                               ...

                 fire,       or explosion,                  or    structural           failure.            In    the

                 which       might          create      danger.            We believe          that     for an

            Seating Accommodation
            (a)     The North          Stand                                                           .

                                   The      form of construction of this stand                               is
                     such       that       it p r e s e n t s a m i n i m u m f i r e hazard.*               _ The
                     exits       are numerous and                spaced        so   that    t h e y .satisfy
                     the r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s of        the    guide.
                                   The      exits are very marginally below                            the „
                     recommended              1-lm width,         but we        do not c o n s i d e r           this
                     to be       of great         consequence.

                                   Gangways are            only 640mm wide for mu c h of                          their
                     length        (they widen round                the exit).              This       is well
                    below        the green guide                recommendation.               However,             it
    ^               is clearly, a p p r o p r i a t e             to t a k e    into a c c o u n t the
                     general         n a t u r e of the         stand,     the      number as well                as
                     the w i d t h       of    the gangways,            and above all           t h e .ease a n d
                    speed         with which spectators                    can evacuate            the       stand.
                                   On 6 January we               counted       the number          of       spectators
                    leaving          in successive minutes after the final whistle.

                      average Is 556 per exit.      Thus the stand would
                empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
                recommended limit of eight minutes.
                          Our observations in company with the fire
                officer^ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
                had left this stand, apart from some people who were
                in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we also
                counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
                whistle.       The overall picture appears very satisfactory
                and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
                as not needing any significant modification.

      (b)       The Vest Stand
                       This stand is very similar to the north stand
                 in its construction.      We were not able to accurately
                assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
                 January because there were many seats which were unsold.
                 However, there is every reason to believe that there
                 will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
                 eight minutes also.      There should be no need for
                 significant modifications.

       (c)       The South Stand
                        The structure has been surveyed and appended
                 are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
                 show the plans and cross“section.        Also attached is
                 a seating plan, drawing Ho. 1610/6.
                        The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
                 has 5710 seats.      These are served by 12 exits (excluding
                 those serving the directors box) so that an average
                 of 476 people need to pass through each exit.           The
                 count by the fire officer’s staff on 6 January showed
                 an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
                 exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
                 seven minutes.      Indeed there were very few people

                      still trying to get out six minutes after the final
                      whistle.        A few had no doubt left early and a few
                      were still standing around, but the stand had
                      substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                                Having left the top of the stand the spectators
                      have to make their -way from the first floor landing
4)                    via one of three staircases.        Two of these are 3.6m
^                     wide and the other 2.4.        This is equivalent to 17*
                       ’lanes’ of ,550mm.      At 40 people per lane, 700 people
                      pass per minute.        To discharge 5710 people (less
                       those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
                       exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                              At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
                       almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
                       which is separated from the main part of the building.
                       The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
                       will probably need three sets of self closing fire
                       doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
                       The club intends to move the paint store from the

?                       space behind this staircase.
                                   The front, open-air part of the south stand is
                       well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
                        one passage.       This passage has a theoretical capacity
                        of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
                        This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.       Because
                        the stand is open to the air and there is very
    -     '             rea.dy access to the pitch »e do not think this rather....
                        long emptying time is of any great consequence.

        will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
        further visit.   We would like to be present when any
        further inspection is made^ and would appreciate contact
        being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood’s absence
        which will extend to 15 February.
               If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
        post they would like, this can be considered by the club
        and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
               A meeting to discuss all aspects   of the application
        mightbe held around say 16 February.
               In the meantime Easttrood & Partners will be checking
        the various electrical services   so that we shall be in a
        position to discuss these at the meeting.


        Future Ground Capacity
               Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
        out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
        ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows :
               Seating approximately                24,000
                Standing on Spion Kop               16,000
                Standing at Leppings Lane end
                (total including N.W. corner)       10,100
                                                    50,100

                It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
         has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
         be admitted to the ground,- .this-involved of-the^owJex-of-
         19.000 - 20,000 spectators being -on Spion Kop.     ..Indeed., ..it
         is'believed* that in the days when crowds of approximately
         70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
         Kop probably approached 30,000.-                                            ""
                It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
         excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

        (a)    General

        It was recognised that the c r ite ria set out in the Home Office "Guide to
        Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)" required new work o r reconstruction
r   .   to be”to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
        Ln existing situations the criterio n was that of a reaso n ab le degree of safety.
        A s the Guide stated, it wouid be unreasonable, even if it w ere practicable,
        to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

        With these factors in mind, both the F ire Service and the Police felt that
        the flow of spectators was the most Important c r i te r i a to be adopted.
        Whilst not disagreeing with this Viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
        it would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recom m endation in the
        Guide that gangways should not be le s s than 1.1 m e t r e s wide. The County
        Council AGREED to try to find this information out, and the F ire Service
        AGREED they would contact their colleagues in o th er a r e a s who had been
        Involved in the Certification pro cess to a s c e rta in how n e a rly the 1.1 m etre
        gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations Ln their
        respective a re a s .

        At the req u est of the F ire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
        and find out If there was any general recom m endation on reduced
        adm ission If a ground were used a t a night time instead of during the day
        time.

        (b)     F ro n t Cover                                                      '

        Whilst it was probably a typing m istake, It was AGREED that the wording
        on the F ro n t Cover should read "REPORT TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
        COUNCIL" and not "REPORT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE! COUNTY COUNCIL".

For the purposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be some
form of lateral separation. The Working Party AGREED, and it was suggested
that three metal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
to the gangways) should be provided, with access between each limited to a
padlocked gateway under the controLof the Police.

As recent adverse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
could cause problems, and it was AGREED that Paragraph 11 $) of the draft
Certificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

The Building Authority pointed out that information was still required from
the Club on profile and step dimensions and the slope of the Kop.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975                                          26.3.79


I refer to my minute of 5th March, 1979, and to the recent telephone
conversation* between Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff and Divisional Officer
K. Jones of your Fire Prevention Secton.

Following the return from holiday of the Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club L td ., the Club Secretary Informed me that the 30th March,
1979 was not convenient. That meetlog has, therefore, now been arranged
for 2.30 p.m . on Monday, 2nd April, 1979, after conferring with the members
of the Working Party.

However, because of evident differences of opinion on means of escape,
the original time and riate of 10.00 a .m . on 30th March, 1979 (but at
your Headquarters) is being retained to discuss these differences, prior
to meeting the Club.

         Purpose of Meeting

Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, p rio r to the re-arran g ed maeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2 .______ Plana

The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, it was still understood
to be supplied by Eastwood L P a rtn e rs at the meeting with the Club.

 3 .______ Report
 (a)       General

 The County" Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
 information additional to that contained in their various C ircu lars. Basically,
 they bad said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to s standard not
 lower than that se t out in the Guide. However, the maximum flexibility bad
 to be maintained in the case of existing stru ctu res and differences iu such
 m atters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

 The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
 and only in one case bad the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
 adhered to.

                                   1.

(b)      Sglon Kop (pages 2,   3 St 4) .
Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the loose and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
was not given to this, It was AGREED that it would be necessary to restrict
admission to the Kop, additional to the xestriction to 11, C40 If the extra
exits are not provided.                   -

On the question of exits, it was again-AGREED that it was essential to line
up the gates in the existing b a rrie r with the gangways. Of the existing two
exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the embankment at the exit at the re a r. After discussion, it was AGREED
that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairways, taking into account the
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

The Fire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, it
was AGREED that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was AGREED that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2central
b a rrie rs but, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authority stressed that whatever
b a rrie rs were provided would have to pass the appropriate strain tests.

The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
recommendation in the Guide, in some cases well below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
also reiterated. It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the
Club's attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

(c)      The West T e rra c e (pages 4 & 5)

As well as the condition of the crush b a rrie rs mentioned at the last meeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing in small areas near to the stand. The cross-fall on the steps on
the north-west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush b a rrie rs mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was AGREED that all these points must be drawn
to the Club's attention.

(d)      The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete T errace (pages 5 & 6)

Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
meet the requirements of the Guide.
      (e)     The North Stand   fa a rre s   6 & 7)

  The rem oval of a row of se=ts from the top of the staod down each eanrway
  to tne upper exits and the removal of four seats at those exits was
  confirmed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

  As the asbestos sheets at the top of t h & a t f were pfote=:ed, the Euildin*
  Authorliy felt that these coaid be accepted, a 0d co n firaed that the * lazin /
  at the ends of the stands was not glass and so would not shatter.

  (f)        The West Stand (page 7)

  Consideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of lateral
                                                afterdis^ ° ‘. i* was AGREED
 th .t the additional staircase agreed at the la s t m eeting should be confirmed.
 So long as u was of 4-umt exit width, it was AGBEED it was not necessary
 to in sist it should be on the south-west c o rn e r. Such sta ircases could be
 bought off tue peg” and, if not instaUed in the close season, it was
 AGEEED that a $ reduction in capacity would be necessary.

 (S)        The South Stand (pages 7 St S)

As mentioned at the last meeting, the penning arrangem ents of the seating
and the numbers of seats in the rows caused problem s. Bearing in mind ± e
need for reasocaDleness and to make the situation better, it was AGIiEED
that, even though net strictly in accordance with the Guide, that t b e V s t
compromise was to see!: the removal of the existing b a rrie rs and their
re-alignm ent, together with the widening of the gangways at the position
of the wings.

The F ire Service pointed out and it was AGREED that F ire Resisting Doors
would be required leading to the D ire c to rs’ seating, and i hour fire3
resistan ce would be required for all problem a re a s under the stand. This
could be reduced to £ hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
installed.

For their part, the Building Authority reite ra te d their concern as to the
corrosion of the steelwork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustrading,
b a r r i e r s and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
It was AGREED all would need to be given attention by the Club.

(b)         General Requirements (pages 8 St 9)

As well as the F ire Service pointing out that the p re se n t tem porary
stru ctu res used for police and firs t-a id purposes would need removal
from a means of escape point of view if the capacity of the North Stand
was not to ba reduced, the Police stated that they were ready to discuss
with the Club the facilities they would req u ire. Briefly, they envisaged
a perm anent structure alm ost twice as large as the existing temporary
stru ctu re, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
e t c . , facilities.

So far as F irst-A id was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
had confirmed th'iir willingness to provide advice on F irst-A id and
Medical Facilities, bat the person nominated (Dr. H. Bailey - Specialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd April, 1979. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
prevent his doing so.

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the rep resen tativ es, and stre sse d that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, view edpurely a s a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Comm ercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and It was hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That, whilst Designating O rders did not specify time lim its for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be Issued
by the sta rt of the 1979/80 Season.




                                            m
      That, a s the Club wanted to a ttr a c t representative gam es, the aim should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

q     That a s much work a s possible should be c a rrie d out in the close season,
bearing In mind that because of the recen t continuous spell of bad w e a k e r tins
will be m o re restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's Witness Bally had
also to be borne In mind.

2            Discussion on Standing A reas

A.           Soion Kop

IT WAS AGREED-

 1     That the siting and angle of the dew b a r r i e r s to be installed be the subject

 2       That the Club consider the installation of simple la te ra l b a r r i e r s (not of the
 clim b proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
 c e n tra l block (but not so a s to ob stru ct the gangways).

 3       That in view of the clearance time of I l f minutes compared with the
 S m l r u t e s Specified in the Guide, the m eans of escape be discussed in detail
 between Dr. Eastwood and the F ire Service (including the re -sitln g of the gates
 in the existing b a r r ie r s and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
    an Increase in their number).

    4   That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be Increased to the
    maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

    5.         That representative p a r ts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
    be tested to the appropriate standards.

           That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
    cru sh b a r r i e r s and the scoreboard structu re be the subject of detailed discussions
    between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

     7.        That the Club's longer term pro p o sals for the improvement of the m eans of
     e g r e s s be unanimously welcomed.

        8.     That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
     points have been resolved.

and First-Aid T e m p or ar y Structures under the Stand be accepted In principle, and
that the facilities required In the ne w permanent structures be considered later in
the Agenda.

4.    That the existing Wire M e s h barriers under the Stand be the subject of
discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

5.   That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions

 4.    West Stand

 IT WAS AGREED -

That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required time,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end of the Stand (possibly of the F ire Escape type for emergency u se, ra th e r
than for normal use).

5.    South Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That D r. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss in detail the apparent
spalling of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork columns, removal of the tim ber casing a t base level for inspection (2
only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin walls.

2.    That, to overcome the means of escape problems in the upper p a rt of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing b a r r i e r s be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
seats o r some such alternative.

3.     That Dr. Eastwood and the F ire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
fire resistan ce in the central a re a , protected escape ro utes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.

4.     That the means of escape problem s in the front open a ir p art of the stand
be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
side consideration be given to providing an additional gangway to exit on to the
d erelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.

5.    That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons immediate]
before a match, even though police had control of its use after a match.

6.    Ground Exits

Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
already supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
circulated without delay.




                                          4.
XT WAS AGBEED That consideration would be given to the Installation of an

Apologies for absence were receiv ed from Dr. H. Eailey (Sheffield Area Hea.ih
Authority) and H. E. Wright (South Y orkshire County F ire Service).

The Note (previously circulated) of the m eeting held on 2ndApril, 19/9, was considered
in conjunction with a Note (circulated at the m eeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
and P a r tn e r s , the South Y orkshire County F ir e Service and the City of Sheffield
M etropolitan D istrict Council Euilding S urveyor's D epartm ent held on 13th April, 1979.

The Note of the meeting held on 2nd A pril, 1979, was ag reed , subject to the following
amendments and additions in the light of the f u rth e r investigations and discussions:-

2A      Spion Kop

P a r a s . 1 & 2 - Revised copies of drawing no. 1610/IX were circulated at the meeting
showing the proposed new crush b a r r i e r layout, including the two lines of 1 2 -.al
b a r r i e r s . This was AGREED in principle.

P a r a . 3 - A 16, S50 crowd capacity on the Kop a s existing would mean an unacceptable
evacuation time of some 12-V m inutes. L a r g e r and re-alig n ed g ates in the b a rrie r
and improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this tim e to some 10 minutes,
but S minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 m etre over. 1 width.
This could bu integrated into the proposed future schem e for enlarging and rrsfing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.
    p a r a . 4 - The e x p lo ra to ry w ork regarding th;- improvem ent of the headroom had
    still to be c a r r i e d out, bat was not expected to be a m ajo r item.

    p a r a . 5 - E ecause of the difficulty in devisir^ a suitable method of testing in places
    (such as the top of the Kop), it was AGREED that proposals should be formulated
    a f te r fu rth e r d isc u ssio n s between Dr. Eastwcod and the Building Surveyor.

    P a r a . 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
    s tr u c tu r e should be looked a t. It was AGEEED that the question of the height of some
    of the cru sh b a r r i e r s be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
    testing.

    P a r a . 7 - The Club s t r e s s e d that th eir proposals fo r the improvem ent of the means of
    e g r e s s would hopefully be c a r r ie d out in the sh o rte r r a th e r than the longer te r m future.

    P a r a . 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush b a r r i e r s , together with...
    the installation of the new c ru s h b a r r i e r layout and alteration of the gates in the exist! .
a   b a r r i e r , could all be c a r r i e d out in the close season. T heir aim was to achieve a        '
    16, 850 crowd capacity.

    2B    • W est T e r r a c e

    P a r a . 2 —The Club accepted th at in view of tae c ro s s -fa ll on the no rth-w est co rn er
    exit, *the ste p s should be r e - b u i lt. It was AGEEED that the other m a tte rs would be
    considered again a f t e r it was se e n which of the cru sh b a r r i e r s failed on testing.

    2C         North West C o rn er T e r r a c e

    P a r a . 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement or replacem ent of the
    existing co rru g a te d sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to c a rry
    out m ore extensive works so as to bring the existing unused a r e a into use fo r an
    additional 250/300 s p e c ta to r s .

    3.         North Stand

    P a r a . 1 - D r. Eastwood, the Euilding Surveyors and the F ire Service had reached
    a g re e m e n t on a sc h em e which could be recommended to the Club. This would
    involve the rem oval of 10 se a ts from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
    front of each of the 9 up p er e x its. The result would mean a loss of 126 se ats
    compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club AGEEED to give
    consideration to the p ro posal.

    P a r a . 2 - The word a t the end of the f irs t lir.e should have been 'T e a ' and not Team .
    It w as AGEEED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss in detail any
    fire protection works co nsidered to be necessary.

5.          South Stand

P a r a . 1 - The b ases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor tim ta r.
Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was AGREED          th a t al,l b ases would be exposed for
Inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
encasing in concrete for perm anent protection. B ecause of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club also AGREED that the space beneath the tim b er floor should be cleaned out.

P a r a . 2 - Provided the penning b a r rie r s were rem oved entirely , it was AGREED that
it would not be n e c e s s a ry to remove any s e a ts for escap e pu rposes in the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

P a r a . 3 - It was AGREED that tim ber handrails should be provided down each of the
ou ter edges of the m ain sta ircaS er that the existing iro n cen tre railing should remain,
and that a new handrail down the centre of each sid e of the sta irw a y should be installed.
It was also AGREED that the brick s ta ir c a s e walls should be b u ttre ssed where crowd
su rg e p r e s s u re could be generated.

P a r a . 4 - So fa r as the front open a ir part of the stand was concerned, it was AGBEED
that on the west side a new exit through a new 1 .2 m e t r e wide door adjacent to ins existing
sn a ck bar should be provided, with app ropriate fire re s is ta n c e m e a s u re s in the
surrounding a r e a . On the e a s t side, consideration was given to an extension of me
footway at the front of the stand and the rem oval of the wall, provided the new exit was
isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the F ire Service
should consider p recisely what m easu res could be considered sa tisfa c to ry s o £ i .o
avoid any loss of s e a ts .

- . Club were to com plete th eir plans, both from a. financial and p ra c tic a l point of view.

   The Club w ere to m ake application for financial a s sista n c e u n d e r the Football
   A sso ciatio n 's Ground Im provem ent Scheme, and bad to have o v e r 50,000 crowd
   capacity if the aim of attractin g international m atches was to be achieved. The la te s t      ••
   propo sals, if im plem ented, appeared to give a capacity of som e 50,750.

   So that they could be noted and returned fo r agreem ent, the Working P a rty asked for
   2 copies of all plans (as re v ise d ) to be supplied by D r. Eastwood, especially to the
   F i r e Service and the Building Surveyor.

   M r. McGee req u ested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
   occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification p ro c e d u re proceeded without
   delay.                                                                         • .

With regard to future meetings I think it is essential that all matters agreed
be recorded, as we are now approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

I-would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, be advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Mr. Vaughan, as the co-ordinator, should chair such meetings.

Yours faithfully,^   ______________    * ~

            Dear Sir

            I refer to your letter, reference number DV/AW/ 5 8 3 , dated 20 April 1979,
            concerning the above .matter.

            The requirements I wish to see imposed are as follows:-

            1.   The existing crush barriers at the ground be tested on a load of
                 400 lb./ft., the maximum required by the guide to the Act. (This is
                 to be done immediately and, thereafter, 20 per cent of the crush
                 barriers, chosen at random, to be tested each year, ensuring that
                 each crush barrier is tested at least once every five years)

            2.   Vertical barriers be placed on the Spion Kop to prevent lateral
                 movement of the crowd.
                                                                                                         I
                                                                                                         «
            3.   Gateways in the existing perimeter fencing be realigned with the
                 gangways of the Spion Kop.

            k.   The police have the facility to override the public addresssystem.

            5.   A suitable police room be provided.

            Representatives of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have accepted
            these proposals without demur and, with the, exception of item 5 , will be
            carried out during the close season of 1979« The police room will be
            provided during 1980 .

            At the request of your Mr. D. J. Shirtcliffe, I am enclosing a copy of
            a sketch of the proposed police room.


            Yoyrs faithfully

D ear SLr,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

I have now received the detailed ctHnmenis of all of the d i s c ip li n e
re p re s e n te d on the Working P arty .

These have been collated Into the attached schedule which, together with
plans, confirm formally In writing the m atters dfecusEed by the Working
P a r ty with the Club over the s e r ie s cf meetings held so fa r and which
the County Council feel require attention so as to secu re reasonable
safety a t the Ground.

They a r e , of course, Lndlvldualrrequlrements on specific m atters and a re
a d d i t i o n a l ^ the general requirem ents s e t out In the specimen form of
General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my le tte r of
8th December, 1978, and discussed a t the meeting held on 13th December,
1978,

A fter the Club has had the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
you would let me know which of the requlrsm ents you feel will be able to
be c a rrie d out In tha close season.

Should you have any q ueries, M r. D. Vaughan' of my staff (ext. 422) would
be happy to discuss theja with you.

                                        Yours faithfully

   Grattm         on the 13th Decenber 1979, Z have had the opportunity of
'T* Division      inspecting your proposed plans for the construction of a
                  Police roocn at that stadiuru

                  The plans appear adequate and Z have no ccment to aa.ket
                  however Z note that on the sain plan it is intended to divide
                  the nale toilets for staff and prisoners, although Z understand
                  this is not practicable so far as the feretle toilots are
                  concerned.

                  Frca a welfare point of view, Z an sure that it would be nore
                  acceptable if seperate toilet facilities could be a&de

 Dear Mr. England,
                 Certificate of Ground Safety, 1979
                  ■teat on Crush Barriers, Balustrades and Fences
             We have pleasure in presenting a formal report drawing
    together the results of all the load tests on crush barriers,
    fences etc. which were carried out between June and December
    1979.

   rush Barriers
 ^      The first series of tests were made on all the barriers
 existing at the time of the application for a safety certificate.
 These are shown on the attached prints of drawings Nos. 1610/61 and
  62.   The barrier numbers used in the following descriptions of
    the tests are as shown on these two drawings.

    (a)      A total of 19 barriers failed to carry the specified test
             load of 6 kN/m length when first tested.   Seven of these
             failures (Nos. 40, 41, 42, 57, 58, 62 and 68) were caused
             by defective retaining clips on the horizontal rails.
             Seven failed because the horizontal rail suffered permanent
             deformation (Nos. 34, 87, 91, 92, 93, 97 and 98) and five
             failed because of bending of vertical posts (Nos. 4, 18,
                                                                         -1 J
                                                                 SHEET          2.

         19/ 37 and 38).
              During the course of the testing careful inspection
        was made of each barrier and it was found that, although
         they passed the test, a number of barriers had minor
        defects mainly due to corrosion.    A total of 32 new clips,
         eight new rails and five new post* were fitted in addition
         to strengthening of those barriers which failed the test.
(F*     All protruding or sharp edges were removed.
^             One further barrier was modified because It was Initially
         significantly lower than the minimum height recommended in the
         green Code of Practice.
              Following construction of the new additional barriers on
         Spion Kop and the completion Of repairs to the old barriers
         a second series of tests was made.   All the new barriers
         and all the repaired barriers now passed the test.

  (b)   Leppings Lane
              In the first series of test* six barriers (Nos. 104,
         105, 106, 107, 110 and 123) had failures of the tube
.0      retaining clips.   Five barriers (Nos. 107, 114, 115, 121 and 130)
C )     suffered permanent deformation of the horizontal rail.
              All these barriers were repaired.   In addition 13 new
         clips and five rails which were badly corroded were replaced,
         and any protruding or sharp edges removed.
              After construction of the new barriers, they and all
         the repaired barriers were tested and all withstood the
         test load satisfactorily.

  (c)   North West Corner
              The initial testing of the first few barriers in this
         c o m e r showed that all of them were only capable of taking
         about half the test load.      The rails deflected excessively
         and the holding down bolts were also inadequate.
                                                                    SHEET    '»*

           Major strengthening in the form of extra posts to
      shorten the span of the rails and to share the load with
      the existing posts were installed.   A new type of holding
      down arrangement was devised.
           When re-tested all existing barriers plus all the
      new barriers successfully withstood the specified load.

    Safety Cage
      When the first series of tests were made on the crush
barriers it was found that the safety cage along both ends of
the ground had defective supports.   It was found that certain
holding down bolts had not been fixed when the fence was
Installed.   There was also a need for support from the
concrete perimeter wall in some places.   After appropriate
remedial work the fence was successfully test loaded in 4m sections
along both ends of the ground using the normal crush barrier
loading of 6 kN/m length.

Boundary Fences
      Concern had been felt for the boundary fence along the
« •  of the ramp from Spion Kop.    Any failure of this fence
as the crowd leaves the ground could result in people being
spilled down a steep bank.   The whole length of this fence
from the score board down to the bottom was therefore tested
using the lateral force specified in the green Code of 2.74 kN/m.
The whole length carried the load satisfactorily.
         The continuation of this fence round to the north-east
c o m e r of the pitch, plus the two lines of fence which protect
the island of spectators to the west of the tunnel were also
appropriately tested (the lengths marked in red on the attached
print of drawing 1610/11).      All the sections successfully
carried the test load without signs of distress.
         It was also found to be possible to test load five sections
of the boundary fence round the top of Spion Kop as shown by the
short red lines.      The load a p p l i e d was again that appropriate to
                                                                                                                               SHIFT   ^*

Further to your letter of the 31st March, ny Chairman
is away for another three or four weeks; so you will
a-DDreciate that I cannot give you Board decisions or
f-iTrir;-ions - M y personal xe*c uion is su*pr j.se j as uncne—
the above act work has been going on continuously since
it was started last surrcer and at no tine do I feel
that the Club have lagged behind in its actions to do
evsrvthir.c that has been promised co be done •

To take Item 4 of your letter - this is very much in
tha progress, and we are in the hands of the contractors.

As regards the training of safety stewards, this was being
left until the warning systen was installed. However, on
receipt of your letter I did contact Mr. Vaughan and
suggested that if he -would like to contact the County •
Fire Sc-rv.ir.".. r-\H our stewards would be at the ground
j'or our saatca on Easter Monday, and that might be an
opportunity to deal with this particular i.tem. The
officers of the Fire Service had intiw-ated to r.e.     .
previously that any ti.Tt.a would be .suitable to them.

                 March and of his reply dated 3 April.
                      I aia in a-little difficulty in replying to some of the
                 points raised as Mr. Clough, is on holiday until Tuesday,                                                                                                      8
                 jk-oril, and Mr. Strange is sway until Monday, 14 April.
                 Because we are carrying out re-wiring in the South Srand
—   •

                 and Mr. Clough is better equipped to deal with the corrments on.
                 the Exit signs I will delay replying until he retu rn s .
                                    With regard to the 'comments from the Building Control
                  department I may need to reply in greater detail when John
                  Strange returns from holiday.-                                                                          . However, my first comments
                  are as follows. :-
                   (i) The cracks between the door frames and supporting wall
                                    will be re-inspected.                                                              I can only assume that this is
                                    ■something which was not noticed in the inspection which
                                    we made and the inspections which were -made by the
                                     Building Control department at the end or the work.                                                                                              It
                                     may be that due to shrinkage of the timber a slight
                               •     gap has opened since that time.'                                                                      We will, of course,_have

                                                                                        . R e gi st er e d In E n g l a n d ' — No. 1 1 3 4 5 3 1

                     the cracks mortared or covered if this is needed, but
                     micht I s'uccest that minor matters of this k i n d do not
                     need a letter or need to be dealt with between the
                     Deriodic inspections which you and we will be carrying
                     out.       . A f t e r all the next inspection is less than three
                     months away.


      :(ii) I have not been able to discuss the paint used on the


                     closed down until 14 April.                                      However, one of my assistants
                    believes that M r .. Sherriff-has recently told Mr.                                                   Strange
                    that Mr. Mills saw a painter with a tin of Dulux instead
                    of the Nullifire which we specified.                                         It would have been
                    aDpreciated if a telephone call had been made at the time
                     so that w e could have-checked with certainty and if
                    necessary taken corrective action.                                        I will write to you
                    again on this point.


      (iii) Mr. Strange mentioned that Mr. Sherriff had queries in a
                    recent telephone conversation whether wired glass has been
                    used where appropriate.                                  Mr. Strange said that so far
                    as we k n o w wired glass had been used everywhere that the
                    fire officer had requested it, and that the fire officer                                                              <•
                    had .of course, made his own inspection.                                                The conversation
                    had ended w i t h Mr. Sherriff saying that he wo u l d check with
                    the fire officer.

                    ingenuity was needed to devise this particular exit, as
                    we were constrained by the levels in the existing stand

            I find the exit signs were erected under the supervision
       of John Strange who is still                                                  on holiday.                                 I have quickly
       looked through the certificate of ground safety and have not
       been able to find'any reference to lettering size.                                                                                          Because
       you do not say which exit signs have not been sited in
       accordance with the plans it is a little difficult for me to
       comment and I suggest this matt e r be left in abeyance until
       John Strange returns.                                        With regard to the illumination Oi the
       exit signs, it may be that you are unaware that we are rewiring
       the South Stand and it may -be that the signs you have in mind
       w ill be appropriately illuminated by both systems when this
       work is complete.

  • Para iii
         yjQ have not been able to understand what it is

   which y o u say does not comply with the requirements
   of paragraph 12 of the certificate.       The agreement
   wit h the Fire Service   (Mr. K. Jones) was set out in our
   letter of 12 December.      So far as we can see the only
   possible variation from that agreement is that because
 (®b f the rewiring which is now taking place tfe did not
   implement the agreed measures in the 'case of the two exits


   December.


   Para iv                      .
        The fire warning system is complete except for the
  ’ supply of the trickle charger end battery equipment.       These
  •items were ordered some months ago ana if the original
   deliverv dates had been adhered to would have been installed
   by now.     Unfortunately the suppliers have failed to
   deliver on time.      We have been applying appropriate pressure
 ^ ^ 2_nd the latest information is as set out in the attached                  \   -V


   cooy letter from our electrical contractors which was dated
   24 March.      As you will see from this, two O j. the four
   outstanding items have very likely been delivered by n o w
   b ut the signal indicator panel was not expected for four
   weeks fro m 2 4 March and the industrial batteries complete
   with steel stand and ancillary equipment was due to;be
   delivered by Friday, 25 April.


        I understand that there is to be a meeting at the ground
   on Thursday,    10 April, when these can no doubt be discussed.


                                      Yours sincerely,

                 the Building Control department for comment.                        They
                 inspected during construction and after the work was
                 completed-          I am not amused b y the fact that the
                 headroom is now being queried.                  In any case this is
                 a matter for the fire officer, not the Building Control
                 department.         With regard to the sharp edges I suggest
                 we leave the matter until the inspection in June/July
                 as the season is now almost over, and there is no
                 time to agree further work and have it carried out before

         (v)     The perimeter fencing at the north-east c o m e r of the
                 SDion Kop has been artraisea for condition "and strength.
                 Bearing in mind the likely pressures at that location,
                 the tests which we carried out where possible, and that
                 we are ’dealing with_ ar. existing ground, the fence is
                 satisfactory in my opinion.


         (vi) We will look at the s_ep obstruction, but again unless
                 this is something which, is obviously dangerous                     (in
                 which case I would have expected the matter to be raised
                 last December)        suggest that discussion be left until the
                 June/Julv inspection.


         (vii) The mesh fencing under the North stand was discussed
                 with Mr. Jones of the fire service and he, like me, was
                 satisfied that there is no hazard which justifies the
                 making of changes.

Dear Sira,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.

After consultations vith the Building Authority and in view of tht fact
that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, Che County
Council is able to agree this year vith the course of action vhich you
propose.  However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

M a y I alao mention the Certificates by:-

<»>       a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
          paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) aa to all atructural
          parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

Cb)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
         26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
         within the Stadium; and

(c)       an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
          12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
          Emergency Power Supply.

I take it that if the Club has not already done so, they will shortly be
requesting you to supply these.

                                                       Yours faithfully,

                     INSPECTION JULY/AUGUST 1980 OF HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM



                     Items of maintenance which it is suggested should be carried
        out in the reasonably near future.


         1.           Some of the fencing posts at the top of the Kop need paintin;
                    near the base.


life                The fencing at the rear side of the gangway over the lower
                    exit from the Kop is becoming very corroded.


                    The concrete posts forming part of the retaining wall at the
                    foot of the bank at the rear of the Kop (behind Penistone
                    Road turnstiles)                                          are showing signs of spalling due to
                    corrosion of the reinforcement.                                                                      The cracks should be repai:
                    with either liquid epoxy or by epoxy mortar.


                    The Denso tape wrapping on some of the starter bars at the
                    back of the North West corner is coming loose.


                    Cracks running from the top to near the bottom of the concre
                    terrace at the North West corner have grown more pronounced
                    in the past year with salts leached out of the concrete
                    being deposited on the underside.                                                                       These cjacks should be

                                                                                                       ^ Hnoland - No. 1134531             17!

          sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.


  6.     There is a very small area of rust spalling on the
         ballustrade at the front of the West stand.


  7.     The boundary wall at the South West c o m e r needs
         pointing in places.


  8.     Certain timbers in the roof of the South stand may    be
         suffering from damp penetration.      These can be checked
         when nart of the roof is examined at the end of 19 80.

Ground Security - The Secretary reported on estimates received for the
installation of a crowd counter at a cost of £14,500.plus the possible
installation of six new turnstiles at each end of the ground 4n order
tbat open gates can be closed, at an approximate cost of £23,000.
Tbe Secretary suggested, other than have this heavy expenditure, he
would like to try using existing turnstiles for admission to the
North Stand, but by so doing this will reduce the number of turnstiles
available for standing supporters at each end of the ground; it was
agreed this be put into operation as soon as possible, but only after
due warning in our programme etc. of our intentions.

At 10.00 eaa Tuesday, 10 February 1581, I attended at S>effi*ld

ISednasday Football Ground as a wjnber of the Working Party o n

Safety at Sports Grounds.    Persons present Included Hr David Vaughan

of the South Yorkshire County Council, Hr Ken Heanott of the

South Yorkshire Fire Service, Chief Superintendent Kerold,   F

Division, representatives of the Club and representatives of the

Building Authority.




A general inspection of the grourri toe* place and no aajor problems

were identified, the   majority of work being in the fora of Mainten­

 ance, however, discussions were undertaken concerning the Police

 Room a n d the siting of possibly temporary ticket offices both in

 Penistone Road and Leppings Lane.    Ihere were no objections to

 these offices cn a temporary basis in order that the situation

 Eiight b e assessed as to the types of queues which might develop.

 So far as the Police Roam is concerned, the Club had received cur

 suggestions and the matter was to be placed before the board:

                    On the occasion of the above match, there was an incident
                    at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
                   ^enclosure, whzch resulted in. injuries to spectators
                   'because of crushing. ...... .       ..........

                    From our enquiries it appears the.crushing was caused
                    through Tottenham supporters arriving late,      to
                    problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
                    after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
                    to spectators at the front of the ‘terracing who had
                    been in the ground a considerable length of tics.

                    According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
                    excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
                    area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
     .)             purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
                    at Turnstile »N‘, Penistone Road, which was the
                    Wolverhampton standing area, were directed by the
<)                  police to the other end of the ground where the
                    Tottenham fans were standing,

                    I give below details of injuries reported to me:-
                         30 spectators treated by St. John1s Ambulance
                                      Brigade for minor ailments, etc.

     planning, action and incidents relating to the FA Cup Seai-Final between
     Tsttar.naa Hctspur and Kclverhaaptor Wanderers held at Eillsbo-cuch on
     Saturday 11 April 1S81.                                  •        ”

     crj_t-'-e         as veil as one letter praising the pclica action in a dangerous
     Situation.      Chief Superintendent Heroic aer.tior.ed that ether letters
     congratulating the police cr. their actions had also be&n received.

    M r Goslin sai; that it vas his decision to reaove spectators frca the Loppings
    Lane er.c or tr.e ground to the other side in -order to ease a dangerous situation
    vnsre serious injuries or even fatalities vere a real possibility.      He then
    read tr.e letter cf coeplaint, which contained an allegation that the police
         s= — -a    c acre people into tr.e "Lappings Lane enclosure when it was obvious
    trac it was full.                         •


    The Chairaan invited views on this pcint.         Superir.tander.t Chapaan said that the
    er.wran.css to L e p p m g s Lane were controlled to ensure an even distribution cf
    fans.    He waver, as .the gerund filled up the usual packing probiers occurred.
    There was space in 'the centra of the enclosure but fans refused to move over
    and fill it. Police officers were placed into the crowd to ensure that the
    -est use vas aade cf the available space. The Mounted Departrer.t also assisted
    at      - eir            crowd to prevent acre people entarinc t h at sart cf the
    ground.                                            “           *

    Chief Superintendent Heroic pointed out that the prcblen was exacerbated by a
    series cf incidents which culminated in the late arrival cf a large nuaber’of
    _ans.  This aear.z that is.stead cf arriving ever a period', thev all arrived

         it and caused prcbleas on the motorway.     The pontoon bridges and extensive
         rcacv/orks on the ootorvay ist the Derbyshire Police Area also created delays.
        This* 90 minute delay resulted in a succen flood of vehicles, all of thea
        'Spurs supporters, into Sheffield. Acting Chief Superintendent Thcapscn tcek
        up this point and said that he accepted that the traffic route, designed to
        divide, the fcctball supporters frca the city centre shcppers, was tco tortuous,
        alzhouch this siay not have proved a problea had there been a steady flow of
        spectators rather than ths sucdan influx caused by the incidents described by
        Hr Eerold.

        The Chairaan then scught the views of the nesting ever the crushing incidents
        whan several spectators were injured and which necessitated the reaeval of
        scae spectators frca the Leppings Lane enclosure.

         Kr EeroId said that the capacity for the Lappings Lane enclosure, stated in '*
         the certificate issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, is 10,ICO.
         This aiist, cf necessity, contain a safety siargin. The actual turnstile
         reading; was 10,425 to which aust be added the 70 Spurs supporters who had
         sanaged to cbtain tickets which put thea eacngsc the Wolves supporters. These
         had been scved to LeppL~.cs Lane frca the Sep fcr their cwn safety. This zace
         a total cf 405 spectators ever the authorised limit. Inspector Calvert roir.ted
        cut that this created a siailar situation to last year when about 400 forged
         tickets were printed for the Lappings Lane end, although the saae trebles was
        •r.ct experienced then.

        Kr Eercld had already referred to the late arrival cf a laree nisober of
        spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Line enclosure when
        the natch started. The flashpoint occurred when Tottenham scored after cr.iv
        three ainutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was
        happening and caused a crush, which resulted in the injuries. Inspector
        Greenweed also aenticned that there had been two cr three fights, albeit cf
        a -incr nature, at the saae tiae. This had resulted in the crder frca .Mr Goslin
        to cper. the cates at the front cf Leppings Lane in crder to release sose
        spectators onto the pitch surrcur.d- This was done by opening the gates,
        releasing a few spectators and then closing thea to alicw a steady flew. This
        was difficult to aair.tain because' as socn as pressure was relieved at the
        -cent the crush frea the back’ filled"~the void."

       The lack of a reserve serial between the South Stand and the Leppings Lane
       stand (where cne has ncraally been situated) caused a few ainutes delay in
       the -ceplcyrsnt cf officers to police this situation but this trebles was scon
       cvareoae. Superintendent Chapaan stressed that.there was still roca in the
       cs r.zre cf the Lazplr.cs Lane enclosure although it vas quite full. This was
       only to be expected when there was a capacity crowd, but the refusal cf
       spectators to fill spaces had caused difficulties elsewhere in the enclosure.

       The discussion progressed to the construction cf the Leppings Lane enclcsure-
       >lr Gcslin felt that it was inadequate and required acre divisions so that
       spectators are net in such a solid aass. He also felt that the liait cf
       10,100 was tec high, although Superintendent Chapaan disagreed with this-
            Chairaan disagreed with Mr Heroic’s suceestien* cf a-6 ft to S ft vice
       channel c c - t . tne centre cf the enclosure to divide scectators and segregate
       c^ cs 7 n? -a“s c z the grounds that such a ssall segregation gap cr.lv encouraged
       oppes^g spectators to throw articles at each other and at police officers

         entrance to the Leppings lane area because it always causes delays and
         blockages- It would benefit fzoa reccnszructi.cn.
                                                                                    •

         .The chairaan said that talks would take place with Sheffield Wednesday
        . Football Club on the ground capacities and for any reconstruction thought to
          be necessary.

         The discussion progressed to the fans who ran cnto the pitch during the half
         tine interval.

         Mr.rerold said that the trouble steaaed frca the front central gate being
         opened frca where about: 150 young fans were led cnto the pitch surround.
         These were the ones who eventually ran cnzo the pitch although at the tise
         it vas necessary for the gaze to be opened to relieve crowd pressure. The
         Batch referee, Clive Thcaas, had said that he was unable to start the Batch
         when he wanted to. This was, however, based cn a five air.uta half-tise
         interval and net cn the r.sraa.1 ter. ainuta one. It vas unfair to suggest
         thaz the natch vas held up as a result cf the fans cn the pitch.
                • *                *                         •


         Mr Gcslin said that he nay have made a wrong decision at half-time to try
         and get the fans frca the pitch surround cnto the Xcp. They had not been
         causing any zrouble where they were, yez the decision to rove thea cnto the
         JOop precipitated a aincr pitch invasion. The half-tine interval was, cn
         reflection, insufficient to carry cut the necessary manoeuvre. Sense of the
         people who were being shepherded into zhe Xcp refused'to go in, resulting1 in
         a sincr 'break—ouz' which vas cuickly c".trolled. Mr Eerold said that it vas «
         apparent, fsr future reference, that when people have to be scved frca the
         Kop the area behind the hoardings is an ideal position to put zhea into. Chief
         Inspector Saith also pointed cut that 5C-1CO fans had been successfully rsacved
         frca the pitch and placed into the centra cf the Xcp. Hr Eercld said that
         this situation prompted the only criticila cf the police by the club in that
         ve sseaed to be helping fans to clirb cvsr the railings. Inspector Sykes
         replied to this criticisa by saying that cr.ly the fans who had becoae stack
         whilst attempting to cliab ever the railings to avoid the crush had been
         helped by police officers so they did not injure thenselves. The other fins
         were released, in saall groups through a polite controlled gate.

        Cr.e problea which was totally unnecessary was thaz caused by the sale of
        unwanted tickets by Wclverhaapzon Wanderers direct to Tottenhaa Hotspur. This
        is contrary to FA directions and neither the FA, Sheffield Wednesday FC ncr
        the police were told cf this decision. This zade a nonsense of the
        segregation arrangaaents and was a contributing factor to the difficulties
        which occurred. Tiscussicns were to taka place about this situation.

        The Chairaan then asked for any contents or crizicisas which could prove
        useful for future occasions. The following prints were raised:

        Acting Chief Suoarintandent Thcaoson
                                             •
        The route for traffic frz.z the actcr»ay vss tor tortuous and the acre direct
        route, the Parkway, should be considered in the future. Chief Surerinter.cent
        Heroic pointed ouz thaz this would bring the f m s through the city centre
        and into .direct conflict with the bus routes for walkinc soeozatcrs.

             Mr Thotspson also, relayed criticisss that officers outside the ground had
             mace no attempt to direct traffic at blocked up junctions. This cricitisa
           - was not accepted because with the size of the crowd soee delay oust be
             accepted and anticipated.

            Superintendent Chapman

            T h e absence of a reserve serial between the South Stand and West Stand caused '
            a slicht delay in the deployment cf officers to the disorder situation end
            there should be a reserve stationed there in future.

            There should be fesale officers available at the turnstiles to assist, ia any
            necessary searches. There was a narked absence o f feaale officers-at the
            gates.

            The back to back radios are net useful in the situation when there is
     r'\    extensive sedia coverage at the ground. There is a high degree of inter-
■i    )
            ferer.es.

            Acting Superintendent Rudcy

            T h e ccmur.ications had proved successful with three channels being used
             (1, 2 and 4). The splitting c f the ground control and the public order control
            mean t that the caravan for public crder control need no longer be situated
            ir.side the ground and could be scved about outside for cptisus reception.

            Mr Ruddy also pointed cut that the supervisory officers froa foreign
            f o r c e s had race nar.y cenpliaentary rsnarks about the planning, organisation
            and operaticr.al aspects cf this event. He felt that we were being ever
            critical of curselves.

            Inspector Calvert

           M r Calvert suggested the inclusion cf a de-brief chart so that the ccsser.ts
               a-“.y officers at the ground could be included fcr discussion.

           Inspector Sykes                          •

           Cn this occasion officers frca foreign forces had been esployed cn duties
           ir.sice the ground; Mr .Sykes felt that this should be the duty cf the regular
           officers ('?• Divisicr.)* who are familiar with the territory. *

           Mr Heroic pointed cut that the reverse situation had applied last year and
           there vere still difficulties. In fact, the local knowledge cf the visiting
           officers who were ir.side had helped to ever core situations, which our own
           pclicsren say not have been able to deal with easily. There are also
           logistical difficulties with the deployment cf foreign officers outside the
           ground.

           Sercaar.t ?urdy

           Difficulties were experienced because officers froa fcreicn forces had not
           read cr ur.carsteed the correspondence sent to then. Eespite having raps anc
           being taken cn a tsur cf the ground, sore had cone to a different part cf

        the ground to where they had been deployed. This could have had serious
        consequences vh<»a. assistance was urgently needed.’

        ‘The local call sicns (eg Sierra 5 - Sergeant) should be stressed to visiting
         officers as tie lack of this knowledge could lead to confusion.

        In accordance withvycur instructions, 2 nd due to your fully ccrzaitted
        diary this weak, I can report that I net with tha Club Secretary cf
        Sheffield Ifsdr.asdayy-:sr. E2ic England, prior tc the r^tch *i£h Gri=sby
        or. Tuesday, 2S April 1GS1. we discussed our actions at the Soni-fin&l
        sad I Inf crrsed hia that the Chief Constable would fce reporting
        independently cur position to the Pcotball Association.     In his report
        to tha ?.A. .Kr.-England .is going to include that fact:.

        I have actr.iair.tsd >■<= v i t h all cur efforts to neve tha ’Spurs fans
        lr.to tha lass cdr.sely packed central part of the tarracing and o f tha
        use cf tha public address ays tan., ate.                                               .

         Kr. England new tails n a that deapita his earlier halief that the
( )     •referee, Clive Thonas, .vas coinc to report adversely to the Football
       • Association, in fact.he dees net now know whether Thccas will do so or
         not. Cartainly, tha r . A.officials were present and saw w h a t occurred
         thenselvas and will, I think, Understand the pcsiticn when they raceiva
         the reports frca tha .Clio and the Chief Constable.       ‘       *     ’

        I have i n f o m e d Kr. England that our consensus view is that the 10,100
        crowd figure specified in tha Safety Certificate ±3 hoc high. Under­
        standably, he fafutes this and defands tha position b y stating that the
        fsrisr capacity, prior to tha iaplecaataticn of tha Safety Of Sports
        Grounds-Ac trot Hillsborough in Decssber 1275, was 11.ICO, and that cn a
        nur.bar_<of occasions in previous all-ticket satches the terracing has
        s c c c = 2 cdated that number. Cartainly, at tha 1020 Sani-fir-al, when va
        again had a capacity crowd of 50,174, we also had sens hundreds of
        forced tickets, all for the Lftppinga Lana end, and apart frcss on a vary
        ninor crushing of spactatcrs there was no prcbl*si.

        Idr. England has bean acquainted with our view that tha Leppir.gs Lane
( )     terracing should be sectioned ’virtically* front to back to produce
      - pjjns to enable sore acourata crowd control end pravant sidavays cove- •
        tuant and he is. already activaly-considaring this. Ua has also con­
        sidered using turnstiles 1-4 for cna part of the tarracing and 5-6
        for anofchar ‘part ar.d controlling tha crowd entering through those turn­
        stiles by tha placing cf safaty barriers in that open area betvasn ths
        Lappings Lana turnstiles and tha back of the West Stand,*'tarracing. ~ I
        agree with hi= that for z^ost catchas that would possibly v c zk b u t have
        grave reservations as-to its efficacy for tha pctasnially trcubleaone
        gaiie3 - Additionally, to inpla=ent it he would have to find sosaa way
        for spectators to enter the Seat Stand without crossing the other
        corridors cf supporters.

        Mr. England accepts the prcblen with the tickeas and, quite properly,
        says that is a natter over which he and the Hillsborough Club ..
        official3 had no control whatever. ’Souss played Coventry cn the Saturday
       before Wolves cola their ticket allocation on 'open sale'. >*e d o not .

       vards-that* substantial mrsbers of their supportsr3 Ji-d purchased ticlcats
        for the Wolves end.— Tiuv did not tdll us or Siidzrielu Wednesday.            >.




                                                                      „   r    ' '     •....
T h e Minutes recorded-by Sergeant. Jehnsca are incorrect, vfcan v a state
that that sale -by Kclverhaapton Wanderars was Contrary to Fcotbill
Association directions.- There were no such directions* b u t en
agreer-ent between, the F . A . , tie participating clubs and Sheffield
Wednesday, as to the ticket allocation, was quite clearly circumvented.
Hr. England i s - r e o c = e n d i n g ta the F.A. that in future they should
give directions to participating clubs that they will no t act in thi3'
wa y and rrast retain, o r return, any unsold ticxet3 and not p ut thes cn
open sale as l?oIves.had done c n this occasion.

No other points of. any great'inportance were discussed b u t you should
be aware t h a t *1* have-condeded to Hr. England that vith hind sight we
accept that our atterrst to cove the ’Spurs fans froa the periaeter
track to the ?3Cop’ during the lisited period at half tine w a s , .perhaps ,
ill advised. I have told Mr. England that no police o*fficsr encouraged
fans .to clirb tha.-fence and, despite his opinion, all w e cod vas to
assist those who did so and becaae stuck or injured in the process.

1 have also indorsed Hr. England of the Chief Constable’s concern at
the attitude of senior cenbers of the Hillsborough Club to you and the
Chief Constable and o f their apparent lack of co-operation and support.

1 xeccssend that a repo rt, setting out the Police position in this
case, now be compiled and forwarded under the Chief Constable's
signature for tha information, of the Football Association.

                 Dear Sir

                 FA COP SEMI-FINAL          -          11 APR JL 1981
                                                  • •                •

                 I would refer to the FA Cup Semi-Final natch between Wolverhampton
                 Wanderers Football Club'and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
                 Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
                 Saturday 11 April 1981.

                 As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
                 held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
                 a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
                 This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
                 Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100. -

                 Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
                 of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
                 to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
                 the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
                 the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
                 caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
                 to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
 ')              traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
                 football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
                 start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
                 afternoon could have been anticipated.

                 Z now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
                 and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

                 Cn the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
                 the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
                 in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
                 Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
                 which were at a premium in London.   Others also made the journey from London
                 to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
                 policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
                 groups of standing supporters at. opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
     the <two. participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
     Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
     Association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
     vas not~properly‘catered for. The result of this was that some 400
     Tottenham fans h a d to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
     of general safery and public order^ and were accomodated in the Leppings
     Lane end of the ground,, which had befn’.designated for use by Spurs
     supporters. •          ... „
                               • «
     The capacity at the Leppings Lane_end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
     a safety factor.    At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
     gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
     apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
     that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

     A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
     large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
     On this occasion the Tottenham Botspur fans, who had arrived early in the
     day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
     centre of this enclosure,'- thereby creating a jasming effect at the
     extremeties of it. The late arrivals.caused an immediate problem upon
     gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
     immediately upon entering after Tottenham Botspur had scored a goal soon
     after kick off.  This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
     terrace including broken arms, legs'and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
     fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John Ambulance
     representatives present at the game.

     As a result of this the safety gates at the front of the Lessings Lane
     enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
     onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
     terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
     refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
     get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
     the interest of public safety.

'l   During the half time interval m y officers attempted to move the spectators
     who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
     spectator areas.  During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
     did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
     by officers within the ground.

     In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
     inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
     I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
     at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
     events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
     of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
     the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

     Yours faithfully




          Constable

 1.     MIWUTCS OF TBE      PREVIOUS MEETING

 1.1   The minutes of       the Meeting held at Ii*gara Sports Clubon 16 October
 1980, which had been       circulated, vere received and accepted.


 2.    MATTERS XRISIKG F R O K T H E K X W T E S

 2.1   Iten 3 - Television and Press

 2.1.1 The Chairman said that a meeting had finally been arranged with
.representatives of both the national and local media, and this vould take
 place in October 1981 at the Niagara Sports Club. This was the first
 occasion upon which such a meeting had teen possible, due to other
 coeaitments of all concerned. The suggestions made at the meeting on
 16 October 1980 will then be pot forward. The Press Council had been
 approached about the difficulties encountered but had been unable to
 assist and suggested that individual approaches were necessary.
. »
 2.1.2 Tfte recent public disorder situation throughout the country, and
 the possible implications for the forthcoming football season, vere then
 discussed. Kention was also made of the situations where crowd
 disturbances are magnified by excessive oedia coverage, resulting in
 'copycat* incidents. Superintendent Lasbert suggested that it should be
 written into contracts vith the television coepanies that they should only
 photograph the actual sporting event taking place. Bcwever, Hr Bennison
 pointed out that the contracts are sgreed between the Football League and
 the television companies. Be suggested that legislation conccrning the
 point raised by Supt Lambert may be the answer. Kr England reiterated the
 point made at a previous meeting that fcv difficulties were encountered
 with the photographers detailed to covcr the actual match - the ones
 taking excessive account of hooligan cricr.tated incident's were the news
 reporters. Be maintained that a close liaison with the television
 producer who* attended the ma* ch vouH b*t extrer-sly bencficinl And had
>•1.)      Chairmen *entloa*d the possibility *f using video rtwrdtri
which could then toy analysed and, *>ere Mcoiary, r*tro»p»ctlv« arrests
M d « . Still photographs would be cfetait*d fros the video recordings for
use 1a court vhere necessary. fcpirt fro* enabling the police to catch
hooligans, it could have * deterrent effect epon would-be hooligans who
M y think twice before'causing trouble If they thought th*ir actions vere
being Monitored. Chief Superintendent Berold &er.tiooed briefly the feet
thet defendant* et Leeds Crown Court bed recently been found ’not guilty*
of offences arising out of disturbances during the Batch between Sheffield
Wednesday and Newcastle at Billsborough at the beginning of the 1980/81
 season. Tfcey had produced television recordings as p*rt of their
 successful defence.

2.2    Itea 8.3 - Banning of Supporters

2.2.1 Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) highlighted a problen which
occurred last season over the release of a ’conviction' of • Sheffield
Wednesday supporter involved in disturbances at Oldham. Despite the fact
that the information was passed by us in good faith, it transpired that
the person had not at that tine been convicted of the offence and vfcs
aval ting trial on a 'not guilty' plea. Kr England mentioned that of the
names published after the disturbances at Oldha=, only two had reacted
Adversely, and one of those vas the person vbovas not then convicted.
                                                                                          *



2.2.2 la viev of the difficulties caused by.iMs incident, the Clubs mist
now obtain details of any of their convicted supporters from the press

 4.     DEVELOrKEKTS SINCE THE IAST MEETING

 4.1        Mr Chester s a i d that the companies forced th r o u g h the Sheffield
 U ni t e d Football Club had been brought about in an effort to re^ ° ^ * * e
 v alue of supporters and supporters' clubs in their ,s5*s *A f>*’e

 Associations felt part of the club, the new organisations

This man could possibly ldtntify ftnd wtleast tht visiting supporters,
although Chief Superintandtnt Rtrold ftlt thftt this could be counter­
productive snd Induct ft disorder situation.

4.4    Hr Wright suggested thftt drinks contused before the match could
crtfttt problems ftnd Hr Chester asked whether tht pollct met local JPs to
discuss problems ftt football grounds, lfct Chairman atsurtd hi* that such
•ottings did take plftct, albeit not sptcifieally in rtlfttion to football
Batches. Bow ever, at tht Vftrious informal meetings which did tftkt plftct,
tho problems wart aired.                                              •

 4.5   Hr England ccroentad that tht ground regulfttlons ftt Blllsboroogh hftd
 recently bten ftlttrtd ftnd asked whether tht pollct would, with thftt bftcking,
 refuse entry to known miscreants. l^t Chairman assured his thftt they vould
 refuse access to the ground to knovn trouble causers but said thftt the
 r»-vritten regulation was short of the phrase "deny access to,*. On the
 face of it, it merely allowed policesen to eject persons csusing trouble
 Inside "the ground and, while the police would interpret this regulation
 in the spirit in which it was meant, it could well be re-written, with the
 addition of the missing phrase, to good effect.

 4.6   Kr Bennison suggested that the police should draft ftn ftpproprlftte
 ground regulation which could then be included by the clubs, and the
 Chairman maid that this could and would be done as a matter of urgency.


 5.     FUTURE OPERATIONAL DTTTICPLTIES

  5. 1      Tt>e Chairman stated that the Football Association, in their wisdeo,
  h a d ensured that on alternate Saturdays four of our clubs were at Bose,
‘ v i t h only Sheffield Wednesday being Away. Obviously the reverse applied
  o n the alternate Saturdays. This created certain operational difficulties
  w h i c h would be overccae but these were exacerbated in sooe circuestances
  m u c h as when the Sheffield Show occurred,        four football matches
  t-aking place within the county on the sase day, and similarly the St Leger
  R a c e Week at Doncaster coincided with the sase four clubs being at Booe.
  T h i s would represent a considerable drain on eanpower resources.

 5.2      Superintendent Mole proposed that stevards should liaise with the
 P i r e Service concerning fire precautions in view of the recent nation wide
 disturbances when fire bcsbs had been thrcvn, but Kr Bennison, supported
 b y Mr Spinks, identified the current difficulty in obtaining stewards.
 H r Wright asked’w h ether police cadets, or a sinilar body within the Fire
 Service, could undertake supervision of fire points, but the difficulties
 inherent in such a sy st e a were pointed out to hia.

 5. 3   Chief Superintendent Derold sa'id that he and his Sub-Divisional
 Cocrcander, Superintendent Chaptcan, had spo*:en to stewards on this subject

       For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan.

                                       ^                           --
       Dear Mr." Vaughan,                                        ...

                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .
                                  Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End

               We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
       installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
       Leppings lane end of the ground.

                It is intended that these fences are so positioned
       that they divide this section of the terrace into
       •approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
       entrance.

               By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
       should result.                 A visiting team with only a few followers
       will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
       retained by the home supporters.

                Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
       accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
       dictate.

                A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
       each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
       during a game.                 The gate could be left open, but fastened
       back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones


                                                   R.„i.£jn3j       land — No. 1134531
                                                                                                            VI

   are' accupied by supporters of the same team. When establishing
                         • I
   the height we have considered that the views to the corner
   flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
   present by the perimeter fence.     We therefore propose that the
   top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
   terrace.

         This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
   but. should eliminate, a. mass, invasion from one area to the other.
   Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James's
   Park, the home of Newcastle United.

         We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
   within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

     —   Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
   various locations around the north stand.     Now the gymnasium is
   open to the general public security to ether parts of the ground
   must be maintained.    It is proposed that gates are provided at
   the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
   gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
   stand.     A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
   prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
   Leppings Lane.

         Six copies of our drawing 3563/1 together with two copies -
   of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.

Dear Hr. Vaughan,

                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
     As previously intimated to you ve carried out tests
cfd approximately one fifth of the crush barriers in July and
also made a preliminary Inspection in company vith Mr. Sheriff.
     One or two of the crush barriers showed signs of distress
under the test load and along a length of the boundary fence of
the Kop at the North East comer it was discovered that certain
of the stays were rusted through.    Remedial work has now been
carried out and the defeative crush barriers have been successfully
subjected to the test load.    We shall be Inviting Mr. Sheriff
to inspect the remedial work in the next few days following
which Z will issue a certificate on the lines of that which Z
sent to you- last year.

  I attended this meeting, together with Superintendent Chapman and
  Chie^. inspector Stuart of Operations Division.

  Members of the Fire Service and Buildings Department were in
  cLLe.ndar.es anc the only reservations expressed were bv the Fire
  Service, who ir.cicated that the security gates - which will be
  open during roctrall matches - should not in any way restrict the
  egress routes, wnicn t.nev feel are of minimum width as it is.

  The Buildincs_representative indicated he would seek further
  information regarding the construction materials to be used but
  tnis would pose r.o —rcblem.

      3.     Other Matters

      Tvo other natters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating
      to tne Police anc First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of the
      Lottery nc;<et Boxes.
      (a)    Police and.First Aid Facilities

            I ?.W*S y f:£}led th£C che existing unsatisfactory police and f^rst
            aic f a c ilitie s under the North Stand had been acceoted on an irter'm
            basis on tne uncerstanding that the Club would provide purpose built
            replacement f a c ilit ie s in the 1980 close season.
            It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed reauiresents are
            still, continuing, but i t is tilt that the Club should‘be asked to give
            “ ir ^ indication when the new police and f i r s t aid f a c ilitie s a-’-e to •
            be provicec.                                                                      '
     (b)    Lottery Ticket Boxes

^           Concern was expressed as to the blocked egresswhich couldresult if
            tne timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the raa^s
            were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.
            "he Oj._ic=r Wording Party fe lt traat the Club should be requested to
            re siue tne bcxes in a less c r itic a l position.
    I attach an additional copy of this le tte r for your use.

                                               Yours faithfully,

  In one           instance               a‘ c l i p r e t a i n i n g              the     horizontal                tube       had    to be r e p l a c e d
             Remedial                work was                carried            out    on barriers                   41       (one    post )
  and      115         (one        post an d one                    clip).            At    the      same       time           two corroded             fence
  posts         and         four        corroded                fence          post    stays         were       replaced.
              After          remedial                work         the s e c t i o n s           of   barriers                 which failed

  that        all       24       barriers               have         a satisfactory strength.

    For the"attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

    Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                       Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End
                                     and Security Gates

               The work on the radial fences/a1id security gates
    indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which we sent to you on
    2 September 1981, is now substantially complete.
               Three first team home games have been played since the
    fences were erecte.d.                               Ve have not heard any formal comments
    from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
    their access gates but we understand that representatives of the
    South Yorkshire Police have inspected the work and they are
    satisfied with the new arrangements.
               To increase security it is proposed that pairs of gates
    are installed at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of
    the West Stand.                    Two copies of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed
    showing details of vthe gates.                                                                                   «

Dear Sir

SAFETY CF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975
SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY F00T3ALL CLUB LTD

I refer to your letter of 23 Decesber 1981 and to the letter frca Messrs.
Eastwood & Partners - the Club's consulting engineers - relating to their
proposals to erect a pair of security gates at the base of the two staircases
at the rear of the West Stand at the ground. Froa a policing point of view I
see no problems whatever concerning the erection of these gates, subject of
course to thea being secured in a fully open position during the tiae the
public parts of the ground are occupied when matches are being played.

Dealing now with the radial fences which have recently been installed on the
Leppings Lane tcrracing, I can confirm that the fences are working particularly
well and proving to be nost satisfactory in effecting the segregation of
opposing groups of fans. Since the fences were put up there has been no
fixture at the ground of sufficient interest to result in that entire section
of terracing being given to one group of fans and so I as unable to coanent in
that respect, but I see no probleas whatever.

 However, there are one or too points concerning the actual construction of the
 fencing which give cause for concern frca a police point of view.      In scse
 places the existing barrier rails Jiave been extended up to and completely
 through the new radial fences at a height of 4'6" or so from the ground,
B a k i n g it very easy for fans to climb frca one pen to another.  In other
x aces the existing barrier rails have been cut off short of the radial
 fences, leaving what the police consider to be dangerous pieces protruding
 into sore of the gangways. This natter has been drawn to the attention of the
Club Secretary, who has been advised of ny intention to bring it to your
notice.       I would point out that Hr. England totally agrees with police
 observations regarding the construction of the radial fences but I understand
 frca hia that it is being suggested that any alterations could conceivably
result in a reduction in the capacity of the Leppings Lane terracing. I aa
 not aware of the thinking behind that but for ay part see no reason why that
 should be.

 As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due
 to take place anytioe around nov, I would suggest the opportunity be
 taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

 Perhaps you would contact Hr. D. Vaughan of my staff (extension 422)
 so that the oecessary arrangements stay be made.

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                    Safety of Sports Ground Act
               Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
                I believe the small number of points needing
 clarification have already been discussed between
 John Strange and Mr. Sheriff.                                         One of these refer to the
 need for a goal post type frame oyer the gates but this is
 in fact already provided by the sheeting frame.                                                       There is
 also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
 of reinforcement in the lOOinm thick retaining wall.                                                           There
 is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
 maintenance repair will be carried out.
                Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
 terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
 crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
 it will make it easier for anyone who so wishes to climb
 over.          Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
 leave the crush barriers as they are.                                                 If all barriers
 were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
 would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by.barriers.
                                                                                                                       £&Y* 'j fc c ^ c •

 There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
 capacity which is undesirable from the Club's point of
 view.     However from the point of view of safety a strip
 of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
 major hazard.
         it should be kept in mind that the introduction
 of these radiai baxriers has effected a very great
 improvement from the point of view of segregation of
 spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
 view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
 I believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
 between the vaxious interests.
           In the second paragraph o n this subject you
 refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
 crush barriers.     I have not had an opportunity to check
 this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
 the word 'dangerous' is’a little exaggerated and they
 do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
 gangway at this position.
           With regard to the security gates around the North
 stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
 the gate width is 'at all critical.    The remaining clear
 width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
 Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
 eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
 per minute per exit width is 5 , 1 6 0 shared between the two
 routes.     The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
 practice more than half the number tend to use the lower
 exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
 to the upper set of exit stairways.      The picture is that
 fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
 exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.

           There were     very good structural reasons             for p l a c i n g
the   gates   in this way.        The theoretical exit capacity has
not been changed since         it w a s a l w a y s   a six u n i t gateway.
There   is no f u n n e l l i n g effect,   a n d t here is a g oo d

1 .___ Purpose of Meeting
     •                           «

The purpose of the neeting was Co discussvthe apparent difference of opinion
on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
and the security gates at the top of the North stand ra=ps, as well as to
carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadiun.
2 .___ Ground Inspection
A.       West Terrace
Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
satisfac to rily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.
yj^ ver, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
had been extended u? to and, in scoe cases, coapletely through the new
radial barriers, which had the effect of making i t relatively easy ror anyone
who wished to do so to clinb froz; one pen to another. Also, in the pen
nearest to the South"Stand, a snail length of existing crush barrier had been
le f t unsupported.
IT W A S A G R E E D -

(i) That, or. balance,           i t was preferable fron a safety point of view to
prevent crowd surge by          the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
through the new radial          barriers than to conpletely prevent persons being
able to climb f roni one        per. to another, subject to review at the end or tr.e
current season.
(ii) That the unsupported stiall length of existing crush barrier would
be cut off.

     One of the security gates which the Club wished to instal at the bottom of                                                      '

For the attention cf Mr« E. England


Dear Eric,
                Annual Certificate of Ground Safety
     We have completed the testing of the remainder of the
barriers at the Spicn Kop end of the ground excepting
those bariitss which because of their position cannot be
subjected to the test load,      Z aa pleased to say that all
the barriers withstood the load but unfortunately in & number
of cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube deforced
considerably.      It is inevitable thatvwater gets under
these clips and they rust thus becoming weaker with the
passage of time,     In one or two cases the clip actually
snapped as the final load was taken off.      A total of 25 new
clips are needed os-Spion Kop including a fev on the barriers
at the top which have not actually been tested.       John also
Inspected the Leppings Lane end and 10 clips are sufficiently
corroded to make it vise to change them rather than wait until
they are tested during the next^tvg years      ^Jfe are using
a heavier gauge metal for the JSinfforocgB.^d i p s so that -the....
future life expectancy will be increased.                          ...
     The metal in the tube beneath the clips is also subject
to corrosion and 11 lengths each about '8ft. long on Spion Xop
are clearly nearinc the end of their life.      He have to_bear
in mind that the ccrrosion which can be seen on the outside may


                                                                         /
be Batched by corrosion inside the tube which cannot
of course be painted.     Whilst all 11 lengths successfully
carried the test load you may think it prudent that they
should be replaced new because they could become dangerous
within five years.
     If all this vork is carried out (new clips on both
Spion-Kop and Leppings Lane plus 11 new lengths of barrier
top rail on Spion Kop) the likely cost is between £1250
and £1500 exclusive of professional fees.     I should be
pleased to have ycur view as ttowhether we should carry out
the whole of this writ or merely replace the clips on
Spion Kop which deformed under test in which case the cost
of the work would be approximately halved.
     John has already walked round the ground and he tells
sa that some splitting and spelling of the concrete columns
is developing at cround floor level at the back of the
South stand.   I* shall be making my inspection in company
with the Building Surveyors department representative during
this month and it is likely he will'raise the matter.       In
any case it is important that splitting of this kind be dealt
with reasonably c^ickly so as to retard the rate at which the
reinforcement corrodes.     I will discuss this matter with you
when I have seen the damagemyself.

                                     Yours sincerely.

                    This is the only fault, of the segregation facilities provided by
                     the club and I would suggest that as approach be sade to tfcea
                     setting out the problems and asking that in due' course, an
                     additional ajtle toilet be provided at the South end of the enclosure,
                     and an additional bar at the Horth End, and that sooe fors of
                     barrier, tAich would possibly only need be 2 or 3 feet high to be
                     provided in the centre.

     ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                                      CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                           On 16 August 1982, I made an inspection of the ground,
     after having              had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
     on Spion              Kop tested by members of my staff under my control.
                           At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 43, 44, 45,
     46, 51, 52, 53, 54,                          62, 63, 63A,               65, 66, 72,           73, 74, 75, 76, 78,
J    79, 80, 86, 87, 88,                          89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 97,                         98, 99, 100, 101, 103,
^    104, 105, 107, 108,                         109 and 110 were tested                          in accordance with the
^    procedures laid down in                                the Guide to Safety                   at Football Grounds.
     All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
     the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed.                                                    These clips have
     been replaced.                     At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
     showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
                           I am now able to certify that all 41 barriers have a
     satisfactory strength.
                           Two radial fences have been installed on the Leppings
     Lane terrace to segregate spectators.
                           Gates have been installed at various^ locations around
     the ground to prevent intruders entering the stands.
                           Repairs have been carried cut to six stanchions
     supporting sheeting along the boundary wall near gate ‘O' on
     Penistone Road.                                         j m    M R                                                                   ./
                                                       Rec W           ' M   land - No. 1134531          f)

                      Sharp corners on the underside of the landing of
           t ^ -south exit-at the.front of the West stand have been.......
           cround smooth.
                     Various minor items of remedial work to concrete   .
           and brickwork walls, steps, terracing and the like have
           been c ompleted as part of the maintenance programme.
                     Certain other items of maintenance work which it .
           is suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
           have been recommended to the Club.   A list is attached.
I                    I certify that in my opinion the various structures
           on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate
           for the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down
           in the Certificate of Ground Safety.

It was noted chat, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1952. the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and west Stands.  Evidently, it
was proving tc be a zest welcome feature.

The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (new used as a
store) were again discussed in view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork   at the rear corner of the Stand .
(nearest to the N’orth West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr.*Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium.  One had
failed and been replaced.

anc corrosion ci tne root ot tne tunnel exit orcm the Soien K ot? (towards the
North Stand end).  Acii.cn vould be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
verst affected) portion of the rcof, which would also have rhe effect of
increasing the headroom.

VThilst certain remedial vcrk had already been undertaken by the contractor to
scaoaiise the banking at the rear cf the Spicn Kcp following digging out
to provide new rerreshnent and ‘toilet facilities, the Officer Vcrking Party
vere or tne r i m opinion that further work vas essential.    Measurements had
shown that i n :places there had beer, as much as four to five inches of
movement.   Simple visual inspection showed that there vas a lack of the
;ormer retained earth material underneath the access ramo in places , ana
consequently m e r e had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
of the existing oarrier rails.    The Club vould have to lock to the contractor
(or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial vork to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.
As pointed out m the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures vould
require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new racilities (as they vere not load bearing).  Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these vere capable of being generated (as also pointed
out in the letter of 29th June).
IT wAS AGREED:-

          Annual Inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium as required
                                       by the Certificate of Ground Safety


                  On     25 J u l y ,               1983               I made                  an    inspection          of     the ground            after
 having                 had approximately one                                                   fifth of         the    crush       barriers
  tested by members                                    of m y                  staff under my                     control.

                  At     the      e n d of June,                                   crush barriers                    numbers         121,    122,       123,
  124A,             125,       1 26,            127,               128,                  12 9,      1 30 ,    131,     132,     1 33,      134,    135,

  and             154    (p a r t ) , all at                               the L e p p i n g s L a n e                 end    of     the ground
  were             tested         in a c c o r d a n c e w i t h                                    the procedures              laid       down       in t h e

                   In a l l       b u t one                     case               the          barriers         sustained           the    test       load
  although                 in t w o             cases                   the              clips        retaining         the horizontal                 tube

  deformed.                       These clips were on barrier 136 between spans 6-7
   and 8-9.                   New clips have been fitted.

                   The only failure was the centre support of barrier 141
   where the angle leg parted where it was badly corroded.                                                                                             The
   angle has been plated and new bolts inserted.

                   I am now able to certify that all the barriers tested
   have a satisfactory strength.

recommended          to    the Club.           A   list     is a t t a c h e d .

        New    toilets          and    turnstiles have                recently been            constructed
behind       S p i o n Kop.       During       these operations                 the     ramp    down       the
back    of    Spion       Kop was       disturbed by movement of                        the    embankment.
In p a r t i c u l a r    the h a n d     rail     and concrete wall                  guarding        the

have    now been          tested       in a c c o r d a n c e    with     the    requirements              of
the Code       of P r a c t i c e      and    in a l l b u t o n e        case,       where     there       was
excessive        deflection of               a hand      rail        post,    successfully
resisted       the       test    load.

        Following          these       inspections         and        tests,     I certify           that       in

The Club recalled the practice followed in ?°“ ,ul't4tio\ ^ hJ h!h ® ~ ^ r
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool)   y     ra<.for.s it
temporary barriers.  This worked well but on all other normal
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting      pp
o£ the West Stand and Terrace.  On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inc ement,    i '
obviously desirable to allow heme supporters access to a s e

   Dear Mr Chester

   SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND

   With reference to our conversation of last week regarding improvements
   required to the West End of the ground, I forward herewith our thoughts.

   You will see that we favour the erection of a stone wall on the ground side
   of the current terraces, with such wall housing a bank of turnstiles.  Our
   belief is that once a spectator goes through the turnstiles he should then
   be segregated from the other fans, and this can be achieved by the erection
   of permanent high metal railings on that concrete area at present behind
   the Stand.  Similarly, there should be a high metal railing down the centre
   of the West Stand. What is then created is total segregation of all three
   portions of the Terrace and the two areas of the West Stand, with each Oi.
   these segregated areas having its own refreshment and toilet facilities.

   If you have any query on these recommendations, no doubt you will come back
   to m e .

   Yours sincerely




    Chief Superintendent

 For the attention of Mr D Vaughan

 Dear Mr Vaughan,
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
         Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End

            The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team's supporters
 as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
 their exit at the end of a game.
     We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
 drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
 turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
 and new gates.
     It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
  proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
  the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                            Yours sincerely,

1.     Purpose of Meeting
The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two n ew banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.     Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the ? ™ l ° s * } * h a d * * * *
prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. A one
time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns           of
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
home supporters as well.
The proposals now outlined by the Club wer e generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject t'os-
       additional gates being provided J»etween the turnstile numbered 16
 (a)
       and the wall of the inner access road;

       the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
 (b)
       visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in half by a new
       central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
       pitchside security fence with gates erected so as    to    permit en ry
       t o be diverted to either half as appropriate (the   proposed new
       secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
       on the plan to be abandoned);

 (c)    the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters’
        terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
        running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
        fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
        home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

 (d)    the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit zates
        installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
        area




                                                                         ( S >
The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety ot
Sports Grounds Act and Buildirvg Regulations.

3.   Action

IT WAS AGREED
fa) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan k n o w the
outcome.
(b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions^of_the South
Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both tne Safety of Sports
G r o u n d s -Act and Building Regulations.

 Dear         Dick,
                                              Turnstiles                   at Leppings          Lane
             After        speaking                to S h a r o n           last    Wednesday          about        the number of
 turnstiles               required                 to      serve       spectators             using     the L e p p i n g s        Lane
 e n d of       the       ground we                   have       altered our             proposed         layout         accordingly.
 Three         prints       of       our           drawing            6705/3       a r e -e n c l o s e d .
              The    eighteen               existing              turnstiles             will     remain.           Ten will          serve
 the North            stand          and           eight         the       terraces       for     the     home      supporters.
 In a d d ition            to     four             turnstiles               from       (A - E) , w h i c h         can be         re-useql,
 twelve         new       turnstiles                      will    be       required.           Four     each       of    these will           be
 for home            and    away             spectators                using       the West          stand,        four       for visiting
 supporters               using          the              terrace      under       the     score      board        and    four more,
 primarily            for       away            supporters                 to    the    centre       terrace,           but    they could
 be     used        for    home          supporters                   if    the    need       arises.         We understand                the
 police          have      suggested a central                                  fence    to d i v i d e       the middle           section
 rather          than      provide                 a       2 m wide         sterile        area      to o n e       side.         This     may
 work         providing            you are happy                       having          home    and    away         supporters         in    the
  same        area    outside.
              Would       you      and Sharon                    be k i n d       enough       to h a v e      a    look at        t he

Dear Dick,
           Be-arrange»ent of Entry and Exit Arrangements at
                        Lappings Lanai
         I understand, following John Strange's telephone conversation
with you yesterday, that South Yorkshire County Council did not send
you a copy of their letter to us dated 2 May.      A copy is now
 s^losed.
 ®       A nuaber of things that they request .have already been
^icorporated since we wrote to thee on 9 April.   However X do
not think that it is reeliatic to ask for the gates in the radial
 fences and have written to David Vaughan accordingly.

                                Tours afncerely.

Fcr the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                        S'afety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                  Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April*
              . In the interim period several of the points which yo u
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                         However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to zhe
request in paragraph                               (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radiai
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                         If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                                 a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                         It is our view that in the event of
emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by che
gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                  Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
                                 Alterations at Leppinqs Lane End
         We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
6 705/5 and 6 705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the West stand.
          Both drawings show the following turnstile arrangements.
                    Turnstile Nos                   1 - 8       -   North stand
                                                    9 - 13 -        North west terrace, home supporters
                                                  14 - 16 -         West stand , home supporters
                                                  17                                         - 19 -        West stand, awa
                                                  20 - 23 -         South west terrace, away supporters
          The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
the same on each drawing.                                  You will see that we propose to build a new
ladies toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
refreshment bar.                    The existing ladies toilets will be refurbished for
the use of home supporters.                                   The existing gents toilets will be
divided and refurbished.
          Drawing 6705/5 indicates present turnstile                                       housings       (17 & 18).
remaining with the ajoining fence covered with sheeting to completely
separate the home and away supporters.                                   However, doing the calculations
 for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch point

It could take over 20 minutes to evacuate that end of the ground
depending on how many people leave the South stand from that side.

arrangement by demolishing the two end turnstiles                   (17 & 18) and
constructing a new dividing wall angled across to enclose three
gates on the left hand side instead of two.
      We believe that the cost of the scheme on drawing 6705/5 will
be about £57,500 and for the one shown on drawing 6705/8 around
£59,500, both including professional fees.                 To these figures add
say another £3000 for the maintenance work mentioned in our letter
of 2 M a y .
      If a decision to proceed with one of the proposed schemes is
given within the next few days it may be possible to have the work
substantially complete by the start of next season.                        This is not
certain but we would have a go.


                                            Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
                                 Alterations at Leppinqs Lane End
              As mentioned in your telephone conversation with John
Strange yesterday we have now received tenders for the work
at the back of the West stand and including other general
maintenance items.
              Four completed documents were received together with a
completed Form of Tender from J. Lee and Sons.                                          The tender
return envelopes were opened by Richard Eastwood, witnessed by
John Strange on 11 July 1985.
              The total tender sums are as follows

              Gleeson (Sheffield)                    Ltd.             £73,735.00
              J. Lee and Sons                                           74,150.00
              J. Finnegan Ltd.                                          79,432.00
              J. Glossop Ltd.                                            99,634.15
              A.J. Loveland                                           106,494.08

               Each of the tenders includes a contingency sum of 10%
which may or may not need to be expended.                                  The arithmetic
 in Gleesons document has been checked and a minor error increases
 their tender sum by £0.20, to £73,735.20.


                                An Unlimited Company. Regirtered in England - No. 1833144
EASTW OOD f t PARTNERS




        You will recall that on 4 June we wrote to you saying
 that we expected the cost of the work to be around £62,500.
 Since then we have added the extra fence on the Leppings
 Lane terrace   (£2087), the barrier down the West stand seated
 area £612) and repairs to and replacement of some crush
 barrier posts which did not pass the load tests which we
 recently carried out on Spion Kop (£1606).      The only surprise,
 as John mentioned to you, is the figure of £3000 entered
 against the item for removing and resiting the infra-red
 counters and control gear on turnstiles Nos. 17 and 18.      We
 had to ask the tenderers to go to Phillips Alarms for a quote for
 this work because it is their equipment and they are still in
 the process of installing it.     They have, we suspect, taken
 advantage of the situation and given a high price for the work,
 though it may be that the exercise of moving the control box
 is more involved than we imagine.
        So, after deducting the 10% contingency in the tender
 offered by Gleesons and deducting the above extras we arrive
 at a figure just over our estimate, though we do have to add
 planning and building regulations fees and professional fees
 which will probably amount to about £6000.
        We recommend that the tender submitted by Gleeson
 (Sheffield) Ltd. is accepted but we will wait until you have
 had the opportunity to discuss the tenders with your board
 before sending Gleesons a letter of intent.     Gleesons have
 told us that they can start work almost immediately.


                              Yours sincerely,

      Dear Sir,
      S a f e t y o f S p o rts Grounds A c t , 1975
      S h e f f i e l d Wednesday F o o t b a l l C lu b p ic

      The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) net yesterday afternoon
      to consider the detailed drawings enclosed with your letter dated
      25th July relating principally to arraageoents for the segregation
      of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough
      Stadium.
      Subject to the following points and to the submission of the necessary
      detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals are
      regarded as generally acceptable
      (a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergencyegress
      purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate Co be provided;
      (b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile23tobe either
      shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the
      outer (river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile
      16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller
      shutter gate between Turnstiles 16 and 17;
      (c)     Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the internal walls
      (e.g. 'the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, 40d a
f )   substantial stud partition (tiober or ateel - suitably faced) is felt to
      be required;
      (d )       Plan Ho.'6705/IQA - same comments as for plan 9A;
      (e)    Plan Ho. 6705/11A - no objection in principle, but details of exact
      location required;
      (f)    Plan Ho. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
      indicated;
                                                                /CoQtd ...

                                                                                  -------------- ;--------- .   P

                                                            1ST
(g)    Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved
by steep slopes as indicated oo the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements
to give foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to
take measures on top of the vail to discourage persoas from attenpting to
climb over vill have to be borne in mind;
(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers nuabered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crcwds are present;
(i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;
(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd Hay,
1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
Stewards, who oust be fit, able and properly trained.

                                     Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                              Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
            Thank you yery much for your letter of 30 July giving the
outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.                                              We note
the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
by the Building Surveyors Department.                                 We believe that all the
calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
checking and comment.
            With regard to your detailed observations our response
is as follows
(a)         We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
the proposed extra security gate.                                 There is already a gate in
the 2 m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
police.         This same gate will still be available for the s p e c t a t o r s
in emergency as there are gates into the 2 m gap from the terrace
which will be under the control of the police.                                        This point may
perhaps be clarified during the Working Par t yrs visit on 7 August.

(b)         The foundations'for this fence are in fact a l r e a d y aligned- in

  the way you suggest.

  (c) and (d)
          We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
  single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
 walls.    The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
  vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
  Studding is not at all suitable in terras of strength or
  durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

  (e)     The refreshment area is under the most westerly
  staircase up to the north west corner terrace.     There will
 be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

  (f)     The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4'1")
  above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
  step.

  (g)     The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45'
 chamfers which will not form good footholds.

  <h)     Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
 object to the provision of -another gate at this point, and
 the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

  (i)     As with point   (a), we are hot sure what is intended,
  and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

  (j)     Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
 taken care of by Mr. Chester.


          It will be much easier for your Working Party to
 appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
 construction.    There will also be an opportunity to see
 the metal decking of the South stand.


                               Yours sincerely,

1.       Purpose o f M e e t i n g .

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "sunner" inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.       Ground Inspection.

A.       L e p p in g s Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party’s meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwoqd and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of lsc August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment. .

On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed cut what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Scanc. The position of the
Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
45 chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
aligned so as to maintain the exit width betveen the outer (river) wall
and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on che plan submitted).

dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete slabs. It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the Police.
This gate would still be available for the       use of spectators in   an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and female
toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perineter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;

(c)   that a new gate in the pitch                     perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen;

(d)   that the          advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
area should be          securely fixed to the concrete wall;

(e)   t h a t t h e s p a i i i n g of t h e c o n c r e t e of t h e v a i l a t th e f r o n t o f the
upper s e a t e d s ta n d a r e a s hould r e c e i v e a t t e n t i o n as a m a t t e r of m a in t e n a n c e ;

(f)   t h a t the        c o r r o s i o n of the s t e e l columns a t th e r e a r o f t h e Stand
should r e c e i v e     a t t e n t i o n on a m a in t e n a n c e b a s i s .

B.       South Stand

M e s s r s . Eastwood & P a r t n e r s r e p o r t e d t h a t t h e c o n d i t i o n o f the upper
c o n c r e t e o u t e r p o r t i o n o f the e x t e r i o r w a l l of th e Stand had been
i n v e s t i g a t e d and was c o n s i d e r e d to be s a t i s f a c t o r y .

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
surface was to commence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
start of the season).
 IT WAS AGREED that the aetal sheeting of che vooden upper portion of the
 Stand should largely overcome the £ laxomability problem* inherent in such
 timber structures, sod the Club stated that they vould ensure that the
 vo o d e n intermediate steps vere securely replaced upon completion of the
 laying of the metal sheeting.

 C.    Spion top

 Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club's
 proposal to cover the Spion Rop had been sent for the information of the
 Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
 the bridge portion of the Kop vould be removed. Its present condition
 remained acceptable vith continuing maintenance.
 In viev of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
 additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
 to Che South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard vhich could
 occur when large crowds vere present.
 IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new «?ate in the pitch perimeter
 fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand vith a stepped
 arrangement to assist access and egress.

 i).   North Stand

 The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber vail
 (in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Ball) vere
 inspected.
 IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) vere not
 stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
 basis.
 E.    Closed Circuit Television Facilities
 The advantages for general crovd control and security (both in and outside
 the Stadium) vhich vould be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
 Television System vere explained to the Officer Working Party.

 IT WAS AGREED:-

; (a) that a 2| kg. CO2 Fire Extinguisher should beinstalled      inboth the
  Police Control Box mod the Disc Jockey Sox;
 (b) that loose external vires on the outsideof the      Boxesshould   be made
 secure.

Dear Dick,
       Many thank* for your note of 12 August enclosing the
copy of David Vaughan's not* of tha Mating bald at tba ground
on 7 August.    A copy of ay letter to David Vaughan vai sent
to you tha sane day so that our letters have crossed in tha
post.
      You will saa that Z hava taken up vary strongly tha
suggestion by Don Sheriff that tba vorkaanship in tha brickwork
was poor and would laad to weakness. Zt is unfortunata that
David Vaughan did not racord that Z had completely refuted
what Don Sheriff said.    David now recognise* that this was a
mistake but     putting tha aatter right by circulating a copy
of ay letter.
      Turning to the aatters on the second pagei-
"Zt was agreed"
Ky comments on tha points you have in aind are as follows i-

 (b)   This refers to the existing gate between the new 2a wide
       gap formed by the radial fence which will be used for
       police access only.   You will notice froa the wording
       of David's ainute that Z persuaded thea that steps oould
      be used.   I have interpreted   thi* a* being from
      the inside only which means that we will not loae
      any of your advertising space.   We have added the
      provision of some timber step# on the inside to
      the work being carried by Gleeson.


(C)   The other radial fence forming the small visitor*
      pen has left a length of terrace without a direct
      access on to the pitch. There is of course a gat*
      at the top of the terrace connecting into the next
      p e n a n d we had hoped that the police would accept^
      that as an adequate means of exit in emergency.
      However at the meeting they made the point very
      strongly that if someone had to be got out of the pen
      which has no gate or if there was misbehaviour the
      police would only be able to get in via the neighbouring
      pen, passing up the terrace through the gate at the
       back and then down again In the Isolated pen. They
       considered this unacceptable.       I think that this
       particular item can be paid for out of the contingency
       sum and suggest that it be added to Gleason’s work.


(d)    You will recall that when you and t went round with
       Superintendent John Freeaan he pointed out that the
       advertising hoardings on the parapet of the seating
       area of the West stand were simply hookmd over the
       parapet wall and some of the hooks had been bent.
       We agreed that a fixing would be provided. Be had
       apparently reported this to David Vaughan so the
       matter w s raised again. It is clearly a good point
       because any hooligans in the seated area could easily
       drop an advertising board on to people below.    I have
        in mind that the hoardings can be fixed by a runner
       of timber and again subject to your approval, this
       can be carried out as part of the present works. ^
(•)   This is a very ainor aatur which can be dealt vith
      next year.

(f)   You will probably know that the bases of the steel columns
      behind the West stand have bean queried year by year
      by Don Sheriff who has requested that exoavations be
      carried out to ensure hhat the steel is not rusting
      below ground level.    By chance Gleesons had exposed
      one of the columns and I was interested to see that it has
      not suffered badly.    However I have pointed out that the
      columns do notcarry any load.     They fora part of the
      previous structure and were chopped down to that level
      when the new concrete stand was built for the World
      Cup.   They merely form a freuse within which the brick
      wall is built. There is therefore no cause for concern.
      At the next meeting in February I will try to get this
      item deleted froa the list.



      Quite a number of items have now been added at Police
request. In addition there is the cost of the new gas main
and also unexpected costs in connection with the electricity
supply to the new refreshment area In the North West comer.
X am asking John Strange to check on all these items to see
whether they can be accomodated within the contingency sum
which we Included In Gleesons contract. I*.am <an holiday but
John u< ^                 T next w*ek.

    Dear Mr. Vaughan,

               I spoke to you before going on holiday regarding the very
advanced state of 'corrosion which we discovered when I made an
examination of the external steelwork of the Hgrth stand roof
at the end of the last football season.
               Attached are four photographs which are representative
    of the conditions which I discovered.                                               Photograph 1 shows one
    of the main trusses.                       It will be feen that the vertical
    member and the top boom and diagonal were fairly rusty and they
    clearly needed a paint treipfient because the paint had largely
    disappeared and corrosion can be expected to accelerate from now
    on.        It has to be kept in mind that the roof was designed for
    the pre-1970 wind loadings including downward suction when the
    wind is blowing from the back’of-the stand so that factors of
    safety have always been slightlj^less than they would be

 according to the present day Building Regulations.
          At the time of my first inspection the bottom boom
 member was covered by some flashings which hid two side
 legs.      I arranged for representative lengths of these
 flashings to be removed and as you will see from photograph 1
 rusting had been taking place rapidly for many years.       It seems
 that when the roof was painted last time the flashings were
 left in place so that there had only been the original paint
 treatment which had disappeared long ago.          Photograph 2
 was taken on the same day at another location.      You will
 see that there is a very large rust lamination on the nearside
 leg of the bottom boom where a large piece of rust is splitting
 away from the remainder of the steel.
          In addition to the very serious rusting of the vertical
 flanges, there were many places on the web of this bottom
 boom member where rust had progressed quite considerably.
 The web had clearly been painted 18 years ago but because
 of the very shallow slope of the bottom boom (parallel to
 the roof) the rain which falls in it had been ponding thus
 keeping the steel wet for a considerable portion of the time.
 This had tended to occur locally where small dams of dust had
 built up.
          As a result of these findings I reported to the Club
 that all the steelwork needed painting as a matter of urgency
 but in addition, the bottom boom would need to be blast
 cleaned before painting and finally that a completely different
  form of flashing should be incorporated which would stop
  rain from falling into the trough and which could also be
  easily taken off when next the roof is painted.
          The Club took the decision to carry out the painting.
  Tenders were obtained and work began at the beginning of
  July.     When the flashings were taken off everywhere, we found
  even worse conditions in some places than had been discovered
  in the original inspection.     Photograph 4 shows the extent to
EASTWOOD ft PARTNER8




 which metal had been lost in so^f-^arts of the bottom boom.
  Photograph 3 was just as bad but the damage does not show
 up quite so well in the photograph.       Incidentally, photographs
  3 and 4 show s o n i c a ' “bright          £ai/vL —       isna.iiv.Ic_    *
  of the members.     This steel had of course already been painted
  and does not represent the original condition.
           During the work on the underside of the roof which
  has also been painted but for which the Club is not intending
  to apply for a grant, we discovered that at many places
  water had been leaking between roof sheets and had caused
  some localised rusting.       The reason for this leakage is clearly
  the very shallow slope of the roof which is only about 1 °
  (1 in 60).      A normal minimum roof slope is about 5°.        With the
  1 ° slope it seems that when the wind is blowing from the south
  rain which falls on the roof can be blown up the slope under
  the lap between sheets and small amounts leak into the stand.
           In order to give long term' protection from this leakage
  which could in time cause the steelwork beneath the roof to
  become unsafe, I have recommended to the Club that they spend
  approximately £3,000 in having the lower edges of each roof
  sheet lifted and a seal placed before fastening the sheet down
  again.
           The Club will therefore be applying for a grant towards
  the cost of
  (a)    painting the external steelwork
  (b)    blast cleaning the steelwork which    was worst affected
           by rust.
  (c)      completely new flashings over the bottom boom of the
           main trusses of a kind which will shed the rain and
           can be easily taken off for future painting.
   (d)   placing of the seal between all roof sheets.


           For your information the total cost of all this work
  including professional fees will be in excess of £60,000.
  This does not include the cost of the internal painting for
  which the Club will not be applying for a grant.        It is

A new innovative safety cate called ’Safecate' is now
available frcm Selflock Limited, a Firsteel Company
within the Lonrho Grouo.


Our engineering design and manufacturing expertise has
enabled us to produce a product that could completely
eliminate crowd-control problems. Increasingly, crowr-
control is Dresenting a major problen for organising
bodies, the police and safety officers; and the results
of ooor control were tragically highlighted during the
recent disasters at Bradford and Brussels, but similar
rtroblems could be averted with the use of our new
electronic 'Safegate'.


A crucial feature of the design is the ability to open
the 'Safecate' either by rerote control or manually at
ti*e cate "(by key) - irrmediatelv access is required.


Li the event of a disturbance in the crowd, a barb scare,
or fire, the gate can be opened instantaneously by a switch
frcm the controller's box, police command post or indeed
from any pre-determined position around the stadium. In
this way emergency services can enter an otherwise fer.~sd area
cruicklv for control purposes, or in the event of a fire, the
crowd will have another or several other exits to safety.
Painted bright yellow, a recognised and approved colour for
safety equipment, the visual significance of the 'Saferate'
is further emphasised by a yellow flashing beacon which
operates when the gate is opened. This feature is of vital
importance for in the event of an impending disaster the
crowd need to find the emergency exit as quickly as possible.


The 'Safecate1 can incorporate a fail-safe back-up pa-^-r
unit so that in the event of a pawer failure the gate will
still operate.


In composition, the rain frame posts tonether with the
bottom* and top rails and also the main gate structure ire
manufactured from mild steel structural hollow section.


To prevent people climbing the gate but still allowing people
to view through the gate, 9rrm dia. rods at approximately
75mm centres are welded to the inside toD half of the cate with
a central bracing to prevent the bending of the bars by vandals,
whilst the bottom half of the gate has a heavy gauge diamond
pattern close set expanded metal panel welded to the inside,
with a cross bracing to stop vandals kicking the panel through
 (see attached drawing). Also to help deter climbing ever the
gate, barbed wire is installed.

               Thank you for your letter of 14 November setting                                                              out the
    comments of the officer working par t y ' on the proposals for the'
    new roof over the Kop.                                             Our response is as'follows


    I.-        Disabled Facilities
          *            First it should be emphasised that the disabled will have
    to be accommodated at ground level.                                             No other arrangement is
    possible at reasonable expense.                                              The choice is between putting
    them in front of the North stand or in .front of the Kop.
               Considering first the Kop, you will know that the terracing
    drops down below the level of the perimeter track.                                                                    It would
    therefore be necessary to place the disabled slabbing, and-seating
    behind the line of the present perimeter fence.                                                                  Each disabled
    chair including manoeuvring space and also a runway in front
    of the chairs occupies the same space as about 20 standing
    spectators.              It would therefore be necessary to sacrifice the
     50 disabled people and their attendants.        ^r.is w u : :
     extrsmelv costlv.     The Club has decided to increase tr.e
     capacity of the Kc? by 5C00 people and the additional cost
     compared with merely roofing over the present .-\cp is m
     excess of £500,0C0.      Thus,   if 1000 standing places were
      sacrificed the cost to the Club would be £100,000 at least.
§H   Ancillarv expenses would     include moving tne boundary ier.ce
£    and reconstructing it to     safety barrier standards plus the
      cost of the concrete harcstanding.      We also nave to Keep m
      rnind that not only would   the spectators be in the firing
      line if anvwhere near the goal but that in addition uhe new
      K o d roof only extends to the front oi tne terracing so un&w
      the disabled would be virtually unprotecusd j.rom j.ain.
           The alternative proposal of leaving tne disabled in -ront
      of the North stand has the advantage tnat tne cantilevered
      roof extends some way in front of tne seating so that there
      is some protection from rain except when tne wind is blowing
      from the South.       The Club would like to give complete
      orotection from rain and is prepared to consider the cosu Oi
      the glazed roofing which we have suggested as a possible way
      of "increasing the comfort oi tne disabled.       The glazing
      would of 'course be of toughened glass.
              If the working party has strong reservations about the
      glazing then obviously it will      not be carried out.        However
      I should stress that there is no possibility of the disabled
      being placed in front of the Kop because of the exorbitant
      cost.      The Club will continue to use the present location and
     ' the only question to be decided is whether it should be unaer
      cover or not.
           I should add that new toilet facilities for the disabled
      are an integral part of the.scheme for the Kop and will be
      conveniently olaced under the North       end oi the Kop.



                                                                         >   3
                                                                             "

        ( a " o r c x i “ !C
                           ^ L- • » O _ —


        (b)     We will need to discuss the proposed carrier
       ad 1scent to un ~ n s *v lad.— ^ ~o — ie — •          '.e exit route
       widens- cut. very considerably from 4.1m vice at tne
       location where the six unit width has ceen caicuiatea
       ana is aooroximately 6m wide alongside tne toilet bioc.-c.
       Vre therefore believe t hat there is no bottleneck effect
       and that a barrier mig ht merely provide an unseen
       obstruction which could crea'ie difficulty.                 We will
       forward a larger scale drawing of the area so tnau
       o u r .c.omments can be considered in more detail.


       (c)      We will of course provide the landings in front
       .of the .existing emergency gates in the pitch perimeter
       fence.but you will know that there have been changes of
       view on this particular matter in the past and we would
       not wish the Club to,be put to the expense of taking
       them out acra_in when members of the present officer working
       party ,axe. reniaced with the passage of time.


        (d)     There.will be four new turnstiles on Penistone
       Road and six new turnstiles at the South end of the Kop.


        (e)         Gates with- a t u m - b a r arrangement will be provided
       at the exits and the Club will of course provide stewards
       to control them.


3.     Roofing of Spion Kop
       The gables will be sheeted on the outside face only and
will     not be lined.                This is normal in Kop buildings and we
think it extremely, unlikely that there will be any difficulty
with hooligans climbing.                    The horizontal rails are at such
wide spacings that it would be difficult for even the most
agile to climb tro.
cost, to srectaiors before the start ox ~ne new? se=scn.             I-
is conceivable that the contractors will have difficulty
in completing the new terrace steps at the rear of the Kc?
before the first game.    In that event secure fencing will
have to be provided as a temporary measure. However we
are reasonably confident that the wnole oz tne terrace
area of the Kop will be complete by the cue date.             We
also intend to have all the new exit arrangements completed
but it is possible that work will still be going on in toilei
areas, particularly the new toilet for the disabled.


4.   Crowd Flow at the, Leppings Lane End of the Stadium
     The Club is aware of the difficulties which the police-
have to contend with at the Leppings Lane end' and^has.of                 '
course been very pleased to help the problem By. the major,
works which were undertaken during the last close season.
We find it very difficulty to envisage   a n y th in g ,   more which
could be done at reasonable expense.       4                          •


5.   Fire Brigate Access to the Front of all Stands
     As part of the works on the Kop, we are completely
remodelling the area around the existing, tunnel.             .The
head room is being increased to 2.4m and the width of .the ..
tunnel is being increased also.    A considerable, amount, oj.
earth shifting will have to take place and this
presents an opportunity to widen the gangway so as to
enable say a fire engine to pass between the North stand
and the retaining wall of the Kop.      If the Fire Service
think this is of value,   I should be pleased to know the
width they would like .so that we can see whether it can
be provided at reasonable cost and without sacrificing^ too
many standing spaces.

 TO ^      Secretaries_of_Football_League_Clubs



 Dear Sir,

 Following lengthy discussions between The Football Association
 and The Football League, we are now able to send you, over our
■joint signatures, a revised Memorandum on Crowd Management.'

 This document sets out to amplify and clarify t h e ‘responsibilities
 of Clubs in relation to this most difficult problem.     Both our
 bodies are fully aware of the enormous amount of time, money and
 energy expended'by cur Clubs in ensuring that the public car.
 attend matches in safety.   With the eyes of the world on us,
 however, we cannot afford to relax for one moment.

 We ask you to study the Memorandum in great detail. Failure to
 act on any of the recommendations 'may be taken into account, should
 a Club subsequently be charged with misconduct under Football
 Association Rules 23 and 24.^                             .

                                                                    Tours faithfully

            (i)     Sheeting of Outer Face

            Dr Eascwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at
            the rear and aidea would result in the atructure being virtually
            aealed. In reply to queries -fro* the County Firt Service, he confirmed
            that no atorage woul<hbe allowed under the atructure and that checks
            for any accumulation of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis.

            (ii)     Climbing of the.Inner Steel Fraae

            As regard* the posaiblity of unruly spectatora climbing the inner steel
            fraae of the new «tructure, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boon                                  j
            member was now to be omitted. The reaultant height of ovej 10 feet
            would make it very difficult for spectatora to climb the structure.

             ( i i i ) New St ep and B a r r ie r Layout

            Drawing No. 6648/56 waa circulated and considered. Thia related to the
            new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
            inparticular on the discussions which he'had had with the Planning
            Authority as to the height of an intermediate or a low second rail to ^
fi
            the b a r r i e r s where the d r o p to the gangway below could be over one metre
            in   places. He sought the Officer Working Party's             views,. and the merits
            of the options were considered.

             IT WAS AGREED that, in the view of the Officer Working Party, the best
             option for a second rail in the areaa deacribed was • low toe rail at
             a height of s o m e ^ O O nan.

     B.     . F a c i l i t i e s f o r the D is a b le d
     To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
     disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (neareat to the North Stand) were not
     unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender flSures
     (opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He still considered
     that any such proposala would involve the loss of up to 1,000 of the extra
     5,000 spectator placea which would be provided by the enlarged Spion     p.
     Other areas of the Stadium had alao been conaidered and investigated, but
     none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible are. as that in front ■ of
     the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long «^hout any major
     problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area. The only
     major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
     coild be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the ^orth
     Stand extending virtually to the pitch. For this reason, the Club w e r e willing
      to roof an area frota approximately the letter "O' on the results b°ar. Lu(J.
     end of the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) vith a substantial roof,
      armoured glass where there might be a visibility problea, provided that this
     was supported by the Officer Working Party.

     W h il s t a cceptin g much o f what Dr. Eastwood s a i d , the O f f i c e r Working Party
     (and the P o l i c e r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s i n p a r t ic u l a r ) s t i l l expr essed some concern as
     t o w h e t h e r making semi-pennanent f a c i l i t i e s fo r the d is a b l e d in fr ont o f the
     North Stand was th e a p p ro p ria te and c o rrect th in g t o do.

     The Build in g A u th o rity confirmed t h a t , a f t e r f u r t h e r               lC V3*

     R e gu la tion s 1985 d id no t appear to s t r i c t l y apply to the r o o fin g of the
     enlar ge d Spion Kop.

     t tuiS AGREED that in the first instance, Dr. Eastvoci would P*e?*r« sketch
     ll^ot    th«. suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
     for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

     C,          Ground Inspection
                  XH    West Terrace and Stand

     The Police representatives confirmed that the r e v i s e d segregation arran enent
     to the rear of the Stand wor'ked veil on by far the ma;3rity of occasions.

     Dr Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area
     S'rtt       c o i n be moved within certain limit, if tie Police con.idered
      that this would achieve a useful purpose.

      IT WAS AGREED
    f] / o    that the additional advertisement hoardings at the front of the upper
A      sfated             (neare.t to the North-We.t Terr.c.) should .1 . 0 be ..cutely
      fixed to concrete wall;

             that further areas-of spalled concrete at the front of the upper
       seated stand area should r e c e i v e d 'attention as matter* of maintenance.
                                                                                 m
                  (ii)    Korth-West Terrace

       IT WAS AGREED that the advertisement hoardings erected on the upper North-
    i y est Terrace should be securely fixed.

                   (iii) North Stand

       The are. for the suggested covered di.abled facilities was inspected.

            The Interin Report of the Cccmittee of Inquiry into Crowd S a f e t y
            and Control of Sports Grounds, under the Chairmans hip of
            Mr Justice Popplewell, was published in July 1985 end has been
            supplemented by Bcme Office Circular 54/85 vjhich urges, a.mongst
            other things, chief officers of police to respond quickly and
            constructively to the spirit of the reccnmencations.' The report
          . contained 24 reccxmendations including the following: •

    * j     Reccnrrendation, 1            *

            'Evacuation procedures should‘be a iratter of police ’training
            and form part of the briefing by police officers before‘a
            football iratch.'                  •

            Reccrrrnendation 10

          "•1Stewards in s 11 grounds should not only be trained in fire
           'precautions and fire fighting but should also be trained
            in how test to help the police in evacuation -’

           As you are aware, evacuation plans and the training of stewards
           have beer. examined. A ccrrtrcn fra.Tev.-ork riakes reference tc plans
           far sirrpler and alleys officers with limited knowledge of the
           stadium to contribute more effectively and with greater -speed
           in an evacuation situation.

     ' -<■ In drawing up the suggested format it was ‘acknowledged that
           considerable flexibility is necessary to take account of the
           rrar.y local factors that ra>:e each ground unique.

           Whilst res cons it ilit v for the training of stewards lies firmly
           with the club, the police have a vested interest in m a x im isin g
           the crowd management potential of non police resources zz spcrts
           grounds. To this end it is felt the police should provide a
           significant input into; the training of stewards and that the new
           appendix on stewardir.g (attached) provides a satisfactory basis
           for ensuring adequate standards are achieved and maintained.

           Appendix 1L ', page 35 of the South Yorkshire.Police Standing
           Instructions for the Policing of Football Hatches, should now be
           removed and replaced with the new Appendix.'L' pages 35 - 43,
           attached hsreto.

           Page 2 of the Index of the Standing Instructions should also.be
           amended so that the last line reads - Appendix 'L' 3 5 - 4 3

Dear Dick,
                                                               Ground Safety
                      Thank you for your letter of 21 April enclosing a copy
of the communication from                                                              |.     You will probably
know that there are several of these quick acting bolt devices
on the market.                              We have inspected some of them and have not
yet been convinced that any of them are foolproof and good
value for money.                                     The South Yorkshire Fire Service have
 also been keeping their ears to the ground and share our view.
                       The one which is proposed by                                               sounds to roe
 to be possibly dangerous.                                                Firstly, the gate is hinged about
 its bottom edge and falls forward on to the pitch surround
when the explosive bolt is released.                                                  It has to be kept in mind
 that police walk past the gates and clearly there could be a
 risk of injury.                                   It is also undesirable that the crowd should
 have to walk out over the top of the gate which would be lying
 on the ground.
                       The arrangement is also likely to be very expensive as
 it would be necessary to buy completely new gates and fit them
 in the safety fence.                                          There will also be the cost of wiring
 all the gates back to the central control point.
                       It seems the device is unlikely to be attractive but if

    FROM:   Inspector Calvert                         ST.vnONVSETT: Hammerton Hoad
    TO:     The Chief Superintendent - 'F* Div        DATS:       11 June IS85

            SUBJECT:   POLICING — HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND


            I refer to the’ memorandum dated 8 May 19S6, requesting suggestions
            from various Officers who have been intimately concerned with the
            policing at Hillsborough.

            The policing of the ground is by and larce a fairly’smooth affair
            but I believe that w e could considerably enhance our efficiency
            with certain changes which could be made by the Club in their
            procedures -                    _             _

            Inspector Creaser has highlighted various cf these and all of them
            have been shown before when we have made approaches to the Club,
            in many cases with very little success.  One of the greatest

  D

            On occasions last season when large numbers attended, we had away
            supporters who were justifyably irate because of the inefficiency
            of" the system , which was turned on the police and could have
             resulted in public disorder.

                 f the points which is not mentioned is the access fci home
            One of
            supporters
                 rters at the Penistone Road end where ticket holders at major
            matches do not have sufficient turn stiles to allow smooth access.
            There is a gross lack of flexibility in the manner in which turn
            stiles ccerate at the Penistone Road end for the Scion Xcp and
            the North  Stand, which may well be aggravated if more horse fans
            decide to  use the Kcp now it is covered.

            I have in        the cast suggested at the Club that they look at the
            croblerr.s, both" of allowing ticket holders easy access and stream-
            iininc the er.trv for paying customers by using a number cf ‘correct
            money"”turr. stiles', as is the case at other grounds.
                                                           <
            Inspector•Creaser mentioned my interest ir. the manner in which
            r a c k i n g is carried cut or. the Leppir.gs Lane terreces. The locetion
            cf the’crash barriers cn these terraces a- the entrances caused
            considerable congestion and I belie'.ve that in the event of emerc-
            encv evacuation, the iocaiion of these barriers would prevent
            access to the tunnels.

             I an aware that there is a statutory recu iremer.t        set out m
             the 'creer. bock' giving the number cf tar r i e r s recuired in certain
             a r e a s T but it r.ay well be that now is the time to lock at the
             ocsiticr.s of certain cf the barriers with a view to alleviating
             the crcblems cut lined abcve.

    1.   Stewards.    The practice of organising on instructional evening involving
                      D.Lock, Fire, Police and part time personnel was established
                      last year. During the latter part of B5/H6 D.Lock and myself
                      •discussed the repeat of sane for this close season and he
                      has it in hnnd to organise. As and when final arrangements
                      have been node J. will confirm.

          Progmnrre   This is the specific responsibility of Dennis and following
         -Sellers.    our *phono conversation I have forwarded a copy of your letter
                      and covering rote asking him to attend to this.

          Dear Dick,

        ■ with Sports Grounds.               I do not see any grounds for objecting to
        # a y    of the recommendations.                There will be little if any change in

          envisages that far more grounds for various sports will be designated
          but in appropriate circumstances the procedures will not be so
          onerous as those relating to Hillsborough.                               Bowever, as it is a
           •top' ground we cannot expect that there wi l l be much relaxation
          ccnp&red with the present arrangements.
                   There is a we leone statement on page 11 that due account
          Should be taken-of the need to keep the costs to clubs and :lo=al _ _
           authorities to reasonable proportions. 'There are also various. ....
          references to Safety Certificates 'reflecting the circumstances of
           each particular ground and the number of spectators who are likely
           to attend      (see page 14).              These words may b e useful to ua in the

 do not show the steepest slopes.
          I should explain that the submission of plans was
 complicated by changes of mind which were forced on the Club
•• by cxrcamscances beyond tneir control.    The intention was to
 redevelop the Kop broadly as the present scheme.      They were
 informed at a very late stage that the level of grant which
 had been expected may not be forthcoming, because of demands
 from other clubs following the Bradford fire.      The scheme was
 therefore changed in January of this year, to roofing with no
 extra accommodation.     All our drawings had to be changed.
 The contract was let in early February and we sent a very full
  set of drawings and calculations to the     Council on 24 February
  1986.    Following a good run in the cup the Board were able
  to revert to the original scheme in March.      By that time the
  steel frame for the roof only scheme was ordered and we had
  to make use of it.    The columns and the bracing arrangement
  against wind now had to be modified to receive the new terracing.
  In effect a third scheme had to be prepared utilising steel which
  was more suitable for the roofing only version.      Thus, we had
  to do completely new calculations and-drawings in March and April.
  This necessitated a re-submission for building regulations approval.
      "   However, that re-submission showed the steepest slope
  which occurs on the terracing, and the drawings submitted in
  March and April show accurately what has been built.
          I enclose a photo-copy of our letter of 30 April which was
  the one which accompanied most of the drawings relating to the
  new inclined terracing.    It will be seen that it lists the drawings
  which were enclosed, five of them, Nos. 45, 47, 48, 49 and 51,
  being drawings of the Kop terracing.      Prints of these five drawings
  are enclosed.
          It will be seen that each of these drawings has a small
  triangular diagram above the steps which gives the rise and the
  tread of the steps, and hence indicates the overall slope.

       on the      Kop where           a greater            slope occurs.              Thus     it is n o t c o r r e c t

      construction              shown on those drawings.

    word       'provision'             makes       it a p p e a r     that     these have         been    constructed
    as p a r t o f            the   scheme.          They were         built       about three years             ago.         The
    work was             n o t d e s i g n e d b y us,       but      I know       it w a s   subject        to b u i l d i n g
    control             from discussions                I had with the Building Control Department
    at the          time.

                    The presence             of    the kiosk          and the       toilets was          shown on        various
    of our          drawings.            For example            the d r a w i n g     6648/16       (a c o p y i s      enclosed)
    shows       the w a y in w h i c h the                 foundations          h a d to be       orientated to miss
    the    toilets             and also        the      kiosk.       This      d rawing was        submitted           for
    Building Regulations                       approval.             Drawings       7 and 9 were          issued        for

               The Building Control department was visiting the site very
      frequently during late February and March, 1986, to watch the
      piles being installed immediately alongside the toilets and the
      kiosk.     Visits iiave taken place frequently since May.
                I am at a loss, therefore, to understand why this matter is
      being raised now.     However, the kiosk is not used for storage.
      All saleable material is taken back to a central store after each
      game.      During a match the goods on sale consist of no more than


#      rackets of crisps, and Bovril, tea and Coke served in paper cups.
      The number of cups and packets of crisps is not great and there
      is no significant fire hazard.
             The kiosk performs exactly the same function as the several
       kiosks inside the south and north stands.       These kiosks are also
       on exit routes, and have never been considered a hazard by the
       Fire Service.
              One matter which might cause concern is the fact that the
       roof of the kiosk is combustible.        If this matter is considered
       critical, the Club would no doubt be prepared to put a fire resistant
       inner and outer skin on the roof.


^      If)      The discussion   on evacuation times which has arisen in the
M      last month was apparently sparked off by the Popplewell report
^      recommendation No. 24.     This says that the Green Guide should be
       revised to make it clear that the suggestion of an eight minute
       evacuation time is concerned with 'the effect of crowd turbulence
        on the rate of flow’ which arises if there are delays in evacuating
        spectator accommodation.
               It may be that the wording of the Green Guide had not
        always been understood by other licensing authorities, but there
        was no misunderstanding on this matter in the South Yorkshire
        Working Party when the ground was granted its Safety Certificate
        in 1979.    The calculated evacuation time for the Kop with its
        pre-certificate capacity of 20,000       (23,000 until the Ibrox disaster
              1971) had been about 16 minutes    (or 18$ minutes pre 1971) .

         turbulence in the crowd, and the barriers were not so strong.

             The pre s e n t         Chief        Fire Officer,             Mr.       Harry Wright,             was

 route     from the v e r y t o p o f                  the Kop.           This was        constructed by               the
 Club    at a cost of £16,000                       (1979 p r i c e s ) .             He was p r e p a r e d      to
count      the exits on t o th e p i t c h as p a r t                       of the evacuation system

these measures               the e v a c u a t i o n       time      in an emergency was                  brought
below eight minutes,                     and disregarding                  the     gates     onto the p i t c h          the

not    justify greater expense                          to the      Club.       The     Fire Service in
its    advisory role is                  always        h a v i n g to b a l a n c e m o n e y a g a i n s t

slight or very slight risk,                            and this         was     a calculated decision
w h i c h Mr.    H.E.      Wright          supported.

            I am a frequent                  attender at the               ground.           Th e p o l i c e    are

            I know that at other                       grounds       longer evacuation                  times     have
applied without              t h e r e b e i n g the s l i g h t e s t            trouble.         For example,
at B r a m a l l L a n e ,     the       evacuation time was                    almost      20 m i n u t e s     at
the B r a m a l l L a n e e n d          u n t i l the n e w e x i t s          were    constructed onto
Br a m a l l Lane nea r         the       centre        o f t he     stand about            three       years     ago.

Green    G u i d e as      far as         I know.

           Further,          in r e c e n t       years various             police        forces        have

.                                   puts    cne eigJL minute rule in perspective.
                The words          'eight m i n u t e      rule'    are not real l y correct
    of course.         The Green Guide uses                   the words        'it is s u g g e s t e d ' .
    It   is n o t n early so p o s i t i v e          as it is a b o u t i ts o t h e r
    recommendations.

                W i t h this as b a c k g r o u n d        the Club has been quite shocked
    by the suggestion that the gates                          onto the       pitch should be            ignored
 in the         calculations of e v a c uation times,                      and that eight
 minutes         should be a ch i e v e d b y m ea ns o f ordi nar y exits.                       They
 feel this change of v i e w cannot be                          justified.           The   fact that
 Popplewell          has c l a r i f i e d w h a t it is           the Green Guide suggests
 is o f n o r e l e v a n c e       in    Sheffield where we have                   always    interpreted
 the     Guide correctly.                 The c h a n g e of v i e w is n o t the            result of
 Popplewells           clarification.

             If the City C o u n c i l            chose      to ignore       the gates       onto the
 pitch       in setting the number of spectators which w ill be
 allowed the effect w o u l d be to                       limit the capacity of              the enlarged
 Kop to      a l m o s t the       same    as it h as b e e n       since      1 9 7 9.    The completely
n e w e x i t w h i c h has         b e e n b u i l t at the s o u t h end o f t h e Kop,               and
the w i d e n i n g o f the e x i t a t the n o r t h end, -will o n l y c a n c e l o u t
the      loss    of the exits             o n t o the pitch.

             It should be e m p h a s i s e d             that the p r o v i s i o n of      the n e w
decking         to accommodate             almost     6000 more       spectators,          the n e w

exit      routes,      extra toilets,               a nd the p a r t o f the roof ov e r t he 6 , 0 0 0
ex t r a places,           will have        cost about £500,000.                 it has      stretched
i n g e n u i t y to   find r o o m        for the n e w e x i t routes,             as t h e F i r e

c o u l d be provided e v e n             if there were unlimited money available.

      we    will be      allowed to ask questions.                     It w i l l       then be      our   turn to

                Finally, I suggest               there will be              a b r i e f s u m m i n g up.

                 I mentioned         in o u r   telephone          conversation yesterday that
      the    Club thinks        it w o u l d be v e r y h e l p f u l        to the C ommittee             in

      believe     it will be v e r y d i f f i c u l t          for t h e m       to get      a   true picture
^ | t o     enable    them to make         a fair decision              from drawings.               They would
      be welcome         to v i s i t o n F r i d a y    afternoon,          say    if t h e y d e c i d e      to
      reconvene      their meeting           at H i l l s b o r o u g h ,    or    such other        time       as
      will    suit   their convenience.

Dear           Dick,
                                          General               Safety Certificate
               As p r o m i s e d         I looked                  through your              existing safety                certificate
to       see w h e t h e r           there           are        any matters              which we might                raise      before

the        next           certificate                    is     issued.
               My    only       suggestion                     is    that        the   position           of the       disabled             should
be       r e g u l a r i s e d by i n c l u d i n g t h e m                       in    Schedule          3 of       Part    1.        The
entry might                    read       "disabled                  and helpers              in    front of          the    North
stand".                   If    the n u m b e r                is    74,        this   would        b r i n g the      ground          capacity,
including the                     extra 4150                    so        far    agreed       for    Spion Kop,             to    54,398.
We w i l l           of    course be                   applying             for    an increase                after    the       completion
of       the        north       corner             and w o u l d            hope       that we will             at    least       reach       th e
magic            figure         of 5 5 , 0 0 0 .                    The     74    disabled          and       helpers m a y        be
useful              in    attaining that number.
               We    d i s c u s s e d the               other            day the       requirement             for p o l i c i n g .
This           is d e a l t       w i t h in c l a u s e                   7 w h i c h refers            to    "adequate
number              of    police          officers".                        It    goes    on to          say that       the       number
shall           be       agreed between                        the        Chief    Constable             and the       Holder          at
 least          21       days     before               a specific                activity          takes       place.        This       is
certainly                 a more          civilised wording                            than    that which             appears          t o be
in use              by    North Yorkshire                           County        Council          but    in t h e     end,       it    does^cj^

SUBJECT-              SAFETY A T SPORTS GROUNDS - REVISED EDITION
                      OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY A T SPORTS GROUNDS


I have gone through the whole of this extremely comprehensive document
and whilst a considerable amount of the contents is applicable to management
of the club, engineering problems and fire officers, certain paragraphs
are worthy of mention in relation to Sheffield Wednesdays Football Ground
at Hillsborough.

Paragraph 16 relating to crowd pressures. As you are aware the kop has
had a tendancv at recent matches to produce this wave effect_and it is
necessary that when a large match is anticipated in the future, we should
ensure that the numbers allowed onto the kop strictly adhere to the capacity
allowed   It is imperative therefore that the automatic counting system
is always in working order for 'A* and 'B ' category matches, such as the
visits of Manchester United, where almost capacity crowds can be expected.

Paragraph 23 onwards lays down the management responsibility very clearly
and is to be welcomed, since there have in the past, been grev areas as to
who is responsible for crowi control etc.

Paragraph 28 recontnends the appointment of a safety officer and identifies
his duties.   I can only presume that the safety officer is in fact Mr Lock,
although I have never heard him designated as such, and this should be
 clarified with the club.   Furthermore, in the discussion of a central
 control point being designated (other than then police control). ione1lv°uld
 assume that the central control point designated in respect of the Sheffield
•Wednesday ground would be the video viewing room in the south stand.

 Paragraph 43 relates to records of tests kept and examination of the ground.
 I a m not aware that these are kept by the club.

 Paragraph 199 relates to exercises of stewards regarding emergency procedures
 and I am not aware that the club have ever carried out exercises in this
 respect.

 In conclusion, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have complied with the
 guide to a very large extent, more so I would suspect, than the
 of clubs in the country, and it is only on minor points as identified above
 where improvements could be made, so far as police procedures are concerned.

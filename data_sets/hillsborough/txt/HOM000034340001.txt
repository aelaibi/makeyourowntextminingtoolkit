        resuscitation.         There is definite Dost norten evidsnce of intensive resuscitation

         attempts.
         99.       PHILIP S?EELE...........................................................
                   There is no evidence in the medical record nor any evidence from the post
                  mortem findings that Mr. Steele received any resuscitation.                                               I think it

                   likely that he was triaged                    as dead.


         119.      ARTHUR HORBOCKS.........................................................
                   There is no evidencs in the medical record of any resuscitation attempts
                   and there is no evidence in the post mortem findings of any resuscitation
                   attempts.          I therefore think it likely that Mr; Horrocks *-*as triaged as

                   dead.     ..................................................................


         In summary. there is definite evidence both from the hospital records and post
         norten resorts that six patients received resuscitation attempts.                                                 In a further
         three oatients there us some evidence that the patients nay have received some
         resuscitation attempts.                     In four patients there is no evidence of resuscitation
         and it is likely that these oatients were triased to the mortuary on arrival
         at the Accident and Emergency Department.....................................


          I feel it mav be helpful to *ive a brief summary of our experience of traumatic
         asphyxia.           Traunatic asohyxia is a fairly uncommon condition, n o m ally occurring
          in sporadic cases, either in car accidents, or heavy injury.                                             There are a
          number of well documented instances where large numbers of people have died
          in crowds as a result of traumatic asphyxia.                                   Such events are fortunately _
          rare.           The Northern General Hospital Accident ^ d Emergency; Department
          admitted          fifteen cases of severe traumatic ^phvxia_ within a space of one

          hour on the \5th April. and ,t;his .is. in additiQn .tQ . the. p&t.ie.rvts                                                 .sU p ve.

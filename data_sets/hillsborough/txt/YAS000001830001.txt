                          states:-


1.     My date of birth is 18th December 1940.


2.     I am employed as a Control Officer for South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service.        I have had 29 years experience
with the Ambulance Service, originally with Sheffield Corporation
and since       1974 with SYMAS,    following   the   creation      of    the
Metropolitan Districts.        I was promoted to Control Officer in
1975 and continue in that role, working from the SYMAS Central
Control in Heather Close, Rotherham.


3.     My duties involve the monitoring of all emergency work and
the deployment of vehicles.        I am also involved in the deployment
of ambulances on non-urgent cases such as out-patient work.              I am
responsible for instructing ambulance crews when they are mobile
and I communicate with them from the radio control.           I work on a
shift pattern according to a 12 week rota and I am responsible
for the whole of South Yorkshire.


4.     On Saturday the 15th April 1989 I was scheduled to work the
afternoon shift from 1400 hours to 2200 hours.        This was a normal
shift in the 12 week rota.


5.     I came on duty at 1400,       at which time the situation was
normal    for   a Saturday   a f t er noon.   There   were    no   sp e c i a l
arrangements affecting my duties because of the semi-final at
Hillsborough.


6.     The first message from the football ground was received
shortly after 1500 from Mr Higgins. I think he was using a pocket
set.     He simply said the ground was restless and asked for an
additional vehicle to stand by near the ground.              I understood
from this that there might be a possibility of crowd trouble, but
I knew that the service already had a vehicle at the ground with
a further vehicle standing by at Middlewood only a quarter of a
mile from the ground.      This information all contained on the
control board in front of me and at the beginning of my duty I
had phoned all the stations to check that the expected crews had
turned in.


7.    Shortly afterwards Mr.Higgins called again and asked for the
ambulance standing by at Middlewood to attend the football ground
urgently.      I instructed my control assistant to despatch this
vehicle and he telephoned Middlewood station to pass on the
instruction.    Normally an ambulance can be mobile within about 3
minutes and once mobilised the crew always radio in to confirm.
The Middlewood Ambulance Crew confirmed in the normal way.         By
this time I had received a request from Mr. Higgins to ask the
ambulance to go to the gymnasium.         I personally did not know
where the gymnasium was located, but I relayed the instruction to
the ambulance crew and they did not question it.    The instruction
did not seem contradictory to me since I have not been to the
ground for a number     of years and so far as I was aware the gym
could perfectly    well have been at the Leppings Lane end.


8.    At about 1506 the Superintendent in control,      Mr Clarke,
sitting in the telephone console at the side of me, received a
call from the Police.     He said to me that they had requested a
fleet of vehicles.     The Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer,      Mr
Hopkins, was also in the control room.      He also heard Mr Clarke
telling me the police message he had received.       We were      all
surprised that       the Police did not give further details    and Mr
Hopkins asked me to contact Mr.Eason for more information.


9.    I b elieve   I radioed Mr.Higgins again and asked        him to
investigate at the ground.


10.   I recall a second phone call came from the Police which was
taken by one of the assistants       on   duty.   I overheard     the
conversation in the background but the message was not repeated
to me.   I think it was on similar lines to the first call to
Mr.Clarke.


11.     Whenever a request for an ambulance is received by any of
the assistances on duty, the assistant receiving the call fills
out a form AS1        (Ambulance Service 1) and hands it to me to
action.       No form was passed to me as a result of the second call
from the Police and I therefore assumed it must have been merely
an informative message and not a request for attendance.                 All
calls are recorded in a written log and are also taped.             It will
therefore be possible to check the timing of these various calls.


12.     Following     my request for information,      Mr.Eason reported
back within a couple of minutes.         He said word to the effect that
"people have been crushed,         there may be fatalities".        It was
obvious that a large number of ambulances were required and it
was clearly a major incident. The automatic reaction to this is
to deploy as many vehicles          as   possible    and   to   follow   the
Emergency       Disaster     Procedure   w hich   is laid down    for such
contingencies.       We treated the Hillsborough problem as a major
incident without knowing how many injured were involved.


13.     I have received training for an emergency disaster procedure
through mock-up exercises and in the form of a written check
list.     The last exercise I participated in was about 12 to 18
months ago.      I did not have the check list by me on Saturday 15th
April because it is a standard procedure and I know it by heart.
A copy is kept in the Superintendents office for any member of
staff to look at.       I did not leave the radio at that time as my
job was to stay at my post.


14.      On   receiving    Mr.Higgins'   message    I immediately began
mobilising vehicles from the ambulance stations at Parkway,
Batemoor,      Middlewood,   Maltby and Rotherham.     All stations were
instructed:- "Respond red to an incident at Sheffield Wednesday
Football Ground, gymnasium entrance".               The instruction "respond
red" indicates an emergency.


15.      I believe I first got in touch with a Parkway Ambulance
which was on its way back to the station.                   The driver did not
know where the gym entrance was and asked for clarification.                     I
therefore radioed Mr.Higgins'             to confirm the location of the
Gymnasium     entrance       and   he    replied     "the   last     entrance   on
Pennistone Road out of town".            I relayed this information to the
driver of the Parkway vehicle and                  included   it in all later
messages.


16.      The number of ambulances available differs from shift to
shift.     I did not know how many were being despatched from the
various stations,       but I specifically retained 3 vehicles in
Sheffield to cover the normal domestic work and instructed all
other available vehicles to be dispatched.                    Later others were
ordered to stand by as they returned to their stations.


17.     By about 1515     I was in a position         to take an overview of
the situation and established that I had sent five ambulances to
the gymnasium.       I was also aware that Control Officer                  ~| had
despatched a further five vehicles which had been on out-patient
work.     He confirmed this to me verbally as he works in the same
room.     In other words, one ambulance had been despatched from
emergency     duty    from   each       station.      Further vehicles were
despatched as soon as they returned from domestic calls.                        I
believe about nine emergency vehicles,                not including vehicles
from out-patient duty,         eventually a t t e n d e d     from    the   South
Yorkshire area.      For purposes of comparison, there are only about
15 ambulances available on a full shift and I had retained one in
each station to handle domestic calls in the ordinary course of
duty.
18.    Towards   1530 further vehicles returned to Barnsley and
Hoyland stations and I despatched these vehicles to the football
ground automatically, without receiving any further request from
Alpha 4.


19.   At about this time it became obvious that it would no longer
be possible to control all these vehicles from my radio.                 I was
still required to handle domestic calls and the normal channels
were overloaded.     I said to Mr Clarke that we had better operate
on ERC.   ERC is the Emergency Reserve Channel.          Control does not
automatically switch to this channel on notification of a major
incident but only when it becomes necessary because of the number
of vehicles involved.        Mr Clarke replied that he would take
                 I one of the control assistants, to the incident
room to help and they would control the operation from there.
The   incident   room   is   p e r m a nently set up   for this type of
emergency and    fully equipped.       From this       time   on v e h i c l e s
attending Hillsborough were controlled by Mr Clarke and
      from the incident room and the operation was taken out of
my hands.


20.   Nevertheless ambulances were still calling on my channel, so
I gave a general call to all mobiles at once, telling them to go
to ERC.   This was at about 15.30 and I made two further similar
calls within 5 minutes to ensure all crews were informed.                  The
message   I gave was as follows:          "To any mobiles         attending
incident Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground would they change to
ERC channel - message end".      I did not expect to      receive replies
to this as the crews would immediately know to change channels.


21.   I then continued my normal duties, organising the Ambulance
Service in connection with emergency calls which had no relation
to the Hillsborough incident.        I continued to use the ordinary
emergency channel,   which is called channel 33.              Even on this
channel   I continued    to    receive    some calls     in relation to
Hillsborough.      They were mostly from Ambulance crews returning to
stations from domestic duties or volunteers reporting in.              As
soon as the emergency plan came into operation the control
assistants working under me began contacting off-duty staff and
notifying hospitals and many of these people reported in               on
channel 33 in the first instance.            I continued to receive this
type of call until about 1615 and gave all callers the same
message to change to ERC channel for instructions.


22.     After 16.15   I had no further involvement except for an
occasional message from Officers on the scene who used channel 33
because they could not get through on ERC.               I passed on all
messages via other members of staff verbally through the hatch
into the incident room.


23.    The deployment of personnel is not part of my duties save in
so    far as concerns    the relaying of instructions         to   mobile
ambulance teams.      However I remember that when I despatched the
Hoyland vehicle it was at Barnsley District General Hospital and
the driver took a medical team with him to the ground.


24.    I continued my normal duties until 2200 hours,         and during
the whole of the shift my only involvement with the Hillsborough
incident was in feeding ambulances into the ground,           as I have
described above.      I did not play any part in getting ambulances
away from the ground to the various hospitals as by this time
control had been taken over by the Major Incident Room.            Also I
had no personal contact with ambulances coming in from other
regions,   since they would have radioed in on ERC.          This is the
nationwide channel which is universally available in cases of
grave emergency.       I was not involved in requesting assistance
from these other areas.        My    chief    concern    throughout   the
afternoon    was    maintaining     normal    services   for emergencies
occurring unrelated to the match.       I had no idea as to what was
happening at the ground and was so busy with my ordinary work
that I had no information of the number of fatalities until I had
time to enquire at around 1700


25.     I concluded by shift at the normal time of 22.00 and went
home.

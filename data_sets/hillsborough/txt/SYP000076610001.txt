         I went and           laid down         in the         penalty a rea        for about         13 minutes a w om an

         w i t h a jug        of water a St Joh n Arnbulancewoman was                               giving me water.           By

         now    I was        very agitated,              f r us t ra t ed and a n g ry by what           had happened

         but    felt        very    releived           I had got out a & the               pen alive.      If it hadn't

         been for           the    fire ma n     I w o u l d n ’t have^got          out.

         In my opin io n            the m ajor          factor     in          cause       of the deaths and        injuries

         was    other        so    called s up p or t er whof I w o ul d              describe as        "scum" who

         s h o w e d no      c o n s i d e r at i on    for a n y b o d y but     t hemselves         in order    to get

         into     the ground to see                    tire ga/e at a n y b o dy s         expense.      If they had

         l i s t e n e d to the Po li ce               and a ct ed      in an o r de rl y manner         this    tragedy

         would      have      never      oecured.

         I then got off               the    pitch and went and sat                   near    soms/lcameranian at the

         side     of the N or th Stand,                  e ve nt u al l y   I met     up                                 and
                                                                         cat                      'S/CSV
                                       we sat          there and        listened      t o^ Kenny D A L G L I S H on the

         public addr e s s            system and then we heard 1'^n& m atch had been a b a n d o n e d

         but    not     to     leave     the gr ou nd until              t hA / fm b ul a nc e s    had gone.

         E v e n t u a l l y at about 4 . 5 0            pm we     left the        ground and made rny way back                  to

         the    car,        where     I later          saw                         I feel     very s tr on gl y of the

         Finally        I would        like      to say that whe n j f a t t e n d e d              the game    last year at

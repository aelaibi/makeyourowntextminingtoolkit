    alcohol .       Police           officers       directed us where               to    park & 'I found a spot

    in Win n St.              Police    signs       d i r ected us to thf^" ground.                     On our way to

    the    ground        I noticed a lot of younger                        latis drinking          cans of beer as

    most    of the        pubs seemed shut.                  I remember a large                 queue     outside a

    corner shop type                 place where         they were          getting       the     beer.       Apart      from

    this    I didn't           notice any d isorderly                 behaviour.



    We    reached        the t u r n s t i 1es at about 2 . 1 5              <1 4 1 5 hrs 5.         There we re lots

    of    people about but              it seemed quite               org a n i s e d and we         got ^rfto the

    ground quite quickly.                    I can only remember                  seeing       one^Police        officer

    outside      on h o r se b a c k .        The     stewards        ripped the sVi/^off my ticket^                                1

    retained       the        rest.     Once      past    the       turnstiles       in the        courtyard there

    was    random searching                 of the     fans     by Police          officers.            I w a s n ’t

    searched       but        I think                 was,     1 had been before                to the ground            so     1

    knew where           to go & we all             three      of us made          our way through the                  tunnel,

    There was        no congestion at all at                        this    stage    in the        tunnel.          We made

    our way      into Pen 4.                it was a b s o l u t e l y      pacK@d,       ii d i d n ’t seem           right*,

^   there     seemed much too man y                   people        in the    pen.        There was a lot of

    j o s 1 1:!.ng & we iipsrte d f o rwa r d a few feet.                     We    t o ok u p a u r position here

    at about       2y50        ish    (1430 hrs),         we were waiting                for    the game       to start.

    N o r m a l l y at    this time you would                  be    reading your          programme          but      that was

    impossible           it took all you had to keep your                           feet.         The    pen was        getting

    fuller     & people were                starting      to    loose       tempers.           We were      getting

    in front       of us were           telling        us to get           back    but we had nowhere                  to go we

            At    this       stags          1 noticed                    people           jumping             onto          the       pitch          from          the

            saw    lots       of       bodies              on       the       pitch        &    a    few          on       the       terracing.                    They       were

            obviously          dead          because                    they       were        blue.              I    c o u l d n ’t       describe                   any    of

            from    the       stand          above                 so    I    presumed              he       was       one       of       the       ones          pulled          up.

            He    came       down       &                          joined          us.         We    walked                through          the          tunnel          people

            were    lying          &    sitting                    on    the       tunnel,           injured                &    trying             to       get       their

            breath.           This          would              be       about       3.45        <1545             hrs).              We    walked             out       of    the

            ground       straight              away.                    The    main        thing             to       do    was       ring          home,          which          I

            did,    we       then       returned                    to       the    car,        we       left          the       ground             of       our       own    accord,

                        H I L L S B O R O U G H - S A T U R D A Y 15th    APRIL,      1989


          Being a s u p p o r t e r of- L i v e rp oo l F oo tball Club, and a ls o an
e x p e r i e n c e d 'Registered Nurse', I g av e as m u c h help as I could
in the a re a b ehind the L ep pi ng s Lane Stand on a fine S at urday
a f t e r n o o n in April, when all I had g on e to S h e f f i e l d for, like
m any others, was tovatch two fine teams play football.

     B elow is an a c c o u n t of events as I saw them from                               the time
I left home, to the a r r i v a l of the e m e r g e n c y s er vices                      to tend
the injured, and remove the dead.


10 .30 a .m .

        I left Birkenhead,              M erseyside,        w it h two      friends       to drive

to S heffield. We tra ve ll ed via                    the M53 - M56 and M62 , f o l l o w i n g

the signs m a rk e d         'Footbal Traffic'.                 F o l l ow in g    the d e s i g n a t e d

route w hi ch       took me      through     busy     s h o p p i n g a r ea s outs id e      M anchester,

th rough n u me r ou s       road w or ks and       e ve nt u a l l y    into     the D e rb ys hi re

Peak    District.              At one time      the traffic jam             was     so bad it took

me 45 m i n s . to        travel      3 miles.



        On the o u t s ki rt s of       She ff ie ld     I witnessed            coaches and vans

being    pulled      into the r oa ds id e          by Police Officers,               who,     I presume,

were    looking for alcohol.                   As    I pro ce ed ed       f u r th er a l o n g   the road

I a gain w i t n e s s e d    Police    O ff icers     s t a n d i n g at    the kerb         side      every

few yards         s to p p i n g private v ehicles.             It was at          this    time     I

m y s e l f was    stopped,      a sked my des ti na ti on ,            and was     told      to proceed

down    the road u ntil          I reac he d     yet a n o t h e r g ro up of         Police      Officers,

who w ould d irect me            to a park in g area.                This area was a road,

very,    very steep          in a r e s i d e n t i a l area    off the area            the    locals

call    the   'Flounch'.



        On a r r i v i n g at    the g r o u n d at 2.15        p.m.      it was very          evident

the o r g a n i s a t i o n of the previ ou s year             was      sadly     lacking.          People

were m i l l i n g ar ou nd      the gates       trying      to get into           the ground,          their
                                                               - 2 -



     p ro gr es s     t hr ough      the    t u r ns ti le s    b eing h a m p e r e d    by   Police      O ff ic er s

     s e a r c h i n g h a nd ba gs o u t s i d e     the      tur ns ti le and,         h an db ag s and male

     s u p po r te r s     b eing s ea rc he d      just inside           the    turnstiles.              Once     in

     the g r o u n d       we p r o c ee de d   to our seats           to w i t ne ss      the d r e a d f u l
J
     events of that fate fu l a f t e r n o o n                  unfold.

I
!

              At first,          like m a n y      people a ro u n d me,            I did not real is e

     ~ne e no r m i t y of        the situation.               I just     thought        the o c c u r r e n c e s

    b elow me were due               to over        c ro w d i n g on a n or m a l scale,            and would

    soon be s orted out.                     I w a t ch ed     Police     O ff ic er s    s h o u t i n g at     the

    fans      to m ove       back,     people who had m a n a g e d             to climb over g r a b b e d

    by the Police as               if b ei ng arr es te d.              On r e a l i s i n g what was

    happening            I found m y s e l f       shouting,       like m a n y      people a ro u n d me,

    in a futile a t t e m p t at m a k i n g o u r s el ve s               heard,        to the      Referee,

    the shouts             b eing to       'stop    the match'.



             I stood routed             to the spot unable                to c o m p r e h e n d    fully what was

    g o ing on a r ou nd me,            people       by this       time were         s t a n d i n g on    their

    seats      in front of me o b l i t e r a t i n g my view,                   vo ic es were b eing

    r aised      in distress and anger.                        I m oved    to the gangway,                and at this

    point saw a man r u n n i n g with a child in his arms                                  , who was        either

    u n c o n s c io u s   or dead.          A female          Police O f f i c e r was d r a g g i n g a

    m ale    St.     Johns      A mbulance m an over             to a n o t h e r    person        lying on the

    ground,        Police were s t a n d i n g around,                 some     helping,       some s t a n d i n g

    on the base of the r ai lings                     p le ad i n g with        people     to mov e       back,      other

    Police d oi ng nothing.




             Rea li sing that as m u c h help as p os sible                          was g o i n g   to be needed

    I started         to m ake my way down               the gangway,           only      to find my way
                                                            - 3 -


obstructed         by o t he r       fans,    d i s t r e s s e d at    the scenes        they were

witnes si n g,      others       p u l li ng people up from                 the s t a n d i n g area.



         On r e a c h i n g    the l a n di ng      the c a f e t e r i a    is based on,         I e n c o u nt er ed

a man     lying on the floor with a Police                             Offi ce r    in at te nd an ce .

Having i nt r o d u c e d m y s e l f as a nurse               I chec ke d         the man,     he was

exh au st ed     but alive,           and a do ct or        had      seen him,        the doctor

     ing a L i v e rp oo l      fan.         The P o l i c e m a n     p ro mised     to stay with him

so I p roceeded,              found a steward,            again        exp la in ed    I was a nurse

and offe re d a ss i s t a n c e .            He did not seem               to k no w what      to say or

do at     first,      but s u g g e s t e d     I go down and            find a Police          Officer.

I went down a n o t h e r            fli gh t of stairs and e n c o u n t e r e d a n ot he r

group of p er ha ps            three or four           s upporters,          hot and ex ha us te d

but m ob il e.          I e v e n t u a l l y a r r i v e d at g ro u n d       level and stood           in h or r o r

at the scene          before my eyes.                  Bodies        lying al l over         the place with

coats     over     their faces,           men      lying on       the floor b eing a t t e n d e d          by

f el lo w suppo rters,           and male and           female         Police      Officers.

I approached          yet a n o t h e r      Police     Offi ce r       e x p l a i n e d my p r o f e s s i o n and

asked who was           in charge.              I never      r ec ei ve d a reply          to   this question,

as    I was o b v i o us ly      o v e r he ar d    by a n o t h e r    Police O f f i c e r    tending

to a man,        who was        struggling          to breathe lying on the floor                     behind

me,    he was s h ou t i n g at me            to come and help.                 As he was       s ho u t i n g at

me    to help,       the female          Police O f f ic er with him shou te d                  that she was

a n urse as well,              and    that the man was alright,                     injured     but alright.



         At this      time      I m ov ed away         tell in g m ys e l f        that there was

n o t hi n g   I could do to help               these men         lying very          still with navy

blue e x t r e m i ti es       sol took a n o t h e r       look at my          s ur ro un di ng s.       By

this     time m o re      injured        but living men had been b r ou gh t out,                       and had
                                         - 4 -


been-    placed on          the floor     In s i t t i n g p o s i ti on s a ro u n d      the wall.


I c he ck e d all of          them,     some had        p os si bl e   rib    injuries,          some

very     s ho ck ed and       exhausted,       some       just very        hot and exha us te d.

By this      time a n o t h e r    L i v e rp oo l     fan had a p p e a r e d      with buckets

of d r i n k i n g water,       and     plastic        disposable        cups,      he c ou l d n ' t

give any      p r o f e s s i o n a l help so was m a k i n g           h i m s e l f us ef ul    in any

way he could.                He went a ro u n d        the injured with water,                   and m any

w ords of comfort.                Another      L i v e r p o o l s u p p or te r     ran up       to me

sa yi ng he was a q u a l i f i e d         'First        Aider',       what could        he do     ?

I d ir ec te d    him to       the e x h a u s t e d    fans and he stayed with                   them

u ntil    they were r e m ov ed          to Hospital.



   I carried on,             chec ke d a gain on a y o u n g man               c a l l e d ______ who

was     lying on the floor              exhausted,         and     shocked,        and e n co ur ag ed

the fan who was a s tr an ge r                to him,        but    stayed with him,

e n c o u r a g i n g him    to brea th e and          r e a s s u r i n g him u ntil he was

e ve nt u a l l y walked       to an a m bu la nc e.



        Whilst all          this was g o i n g on it was               b ec o m i n g m o r e and m ore

apparent       that firstly no bo dy a m o n g               the Police or            Stewards

had     taken charge of the              situation,          s ec on dl y     the e m e r ge nc y

 should     be m oved        to an area o u t si de          large blue roll back gates,

 so that      the a m b u l a n c e s   could ge t        to them,        it was at        this     time

 I r e al is ed help had           finally arrived.                I m a n ag ed     to get one
youngster          on his     feet,    and a s s i s t e d him o u t si de     the gates,

the dead had a l r e a d y          been m o v e d    to this area       by the        Police,

h a vi n g been      d ir ec te d   to do so by a ma n          I took to be a Doctor,

who had a r r i v e d       from one of the           local Hospi ta ls .            He was

telling       the    Police      that he w an t e d     the    injured      to be placed          in

categ or ies,        the badly        injured     to go in the        first am bu la nc es ,

and not       the ones w ith m i no r          injuries,      w hich at first           seemed     to

be the case.             I was      later   to discover,         the f o l l o w i n g m or ning,

that    the    Doctor       c on c e r n e d was a f el l o w fan who had a r r i v e d on

the    scene a lot e a r l i e r        than    I, had sum me d up the             total lack

of leadership,           and had taken over himself.                         Again.      I was

approached          by a lady in a red           trousff suit,        she    p ro du ce d a card

from her pocket,              she was a q ua l i f i e d      'First Aider'          - a local

lady who had          seen     the scenes       on T.V.     and had a r r i v e d       to help.



       I ca rr ie d on. mad e some             three or four a t t e m p t s        to g et help

to a man prop pe d a g a i n s t         the wall       just o u t si de     the    large

e nt rance     to the s ta nd i n g area,            who had an obvi ou s          painful     neck

injury.            I eventually       e nl is te d    the help of a tall            Policewoman,

showed her were           the man was.               She went away and very              soon came           back

with blankets and mor e               supporters,        and with all         this c om b i n e d help

we m a n a g e d    to ge t    this m an onto         the blankets,         and    onto a

stretcher,         an Amb ul an ce a p p e a r e d with       the    latter       just at     the right

moment.



       H aving by this          time got m o s t of the injured               o u t si de   the

gates,     badly      injured       to the r ight and m i n o r        i nj ur ie s    in order

of impor ta nc e       to the left.            The sight of the dead               lying a l o n g s i d e

one wall      in this area,           head to toe, and          the li vi ng lean in g or

lying a g a i n s t the o pp os it e wall,             s ep arated   by a h uman shield                 of

Police personnel,              is a sight       I will never forget.                The a r r i v a l

of a m b u l a n c e s and    crash       teams     from    the      local h os p i t a l s was         by

this     time g e t t i n g   stronger, the badly              Injured had          been       removed,

a ll   that was        left   to do was c on t i n u e         to s u p po rt      Inju re d     limbs

with     scarves,       r ea ss u r e   some       of   the injured,        y o u n g s t e r s who

gave     their names as                            15 yrs of age,         worried         how he

was g o i n g       to get home,        a y ou ng    Pol ic em an      stayed w ith him            saying

'we wil l g e t you home                sonny,    d on 't worry'.             Anot he r y o un g         lad

his     injured       foot r e a s s u r i n g him all         the   time.



        The   local n ur s e s       took over,         ha nd ed out blankets,              a y oung

Asian doctor,           local      I think,       was by this          time g o i n g a ro u n d         the

lads with m i n o r         injuries,          c a r r y i n g a brief case and            s te th o s c o p e .

I r ea lised         that by this         time     there was         little       left for me           to

do so      I w an dered       back      into    the area be hi nd         the stand,          intending

to go back           to my friends,            but was     stop pe d     by yet a n o t h e r

d is tr e s s e d    fan,   who    I knew,       uninjured        physically            but m entally,

very d i s t r e s s e d    - he had       been     to Belg iu m and w i t n e s s e d           the

 Heysel       Disaster.           He was e v e n t u a l l y    c o m f or te d    by     m y s e l f and      the

 same y o un g       P o l i c ew om an who had helped me with                    the spinal          i nj ur ie s

 man,    and sent on           his way his purpose                in life at            the time was

 to go and ring his Mum.                       On his d ep a r t u r e    the      P o l i c ew om an

in the a rea b ehind the Leppi ng s Lane Stand on a fine S a t u r d a y
a f t e r n o o n in April, w h e n all I had g on e to S h e f fi el d for, like
m any others, was tova tc h two fine teams play football.

     B el o w is an a c c o u n t of ev en ts as I saw them from                              the time
I left home, to the a r r i v a l of the e m e r g e n c y s er vi ce s                       to tend
the injured, and remove the dead.


10.30 a.m.

        I left Birkenhead,               Merseyside,            w i t h two     friends       to drive

to S heffield. We        t ra ve ll ed via                the     M53 - M56 and         M 6 2 , following

the signs m a r k e d         'Footbal Traffic'.                    F o l l o w i n g the d e s i g n a t e d

route w h i c h    took me        through busy s h o p p i n g areas outs id e                   Manchester

through n u me r ou s         road w o r k s and e v e n t u a l l y       into    the D e r b y s h i r e

Peak District.                  At one time       the     traf fi c jam        was so bad it took

me   45 mins.      to     travel       3 miles.



        On the o u t s k i r t s of       Sh ef fi el d    I witnessed            coac he s and vans

being p ulled        into      the r oa ds id e     by    Police        Officers,       who,     I presume,

were    l oo ki n g for a l co ho l.             As I p r o c e e d e d       further along          the road

I a ga in w i t n e s s e d    Police     O ff ic er s s t a n d i n g at       the kerb         side      every

few y ards      s t o p p i n g p ri va t e veh ic le s.            It was at this            time     I

m ys e l f was stopped,           a s k ed my d e s t i n a t i o n ,     and was      told     to p r oc ee d

down the road u n ti l            I r ea ch ed yet a n o t h e r g r ou p of            Police       Officers

who w ou ld d ir e ct me          to a p a r ki ng area.                This area was a road,

very,    very steep           in a r e s i d e n t i a l area       off    the area       the    locals

call    the    *F lounch '.



        On a r r i v i n g at     the g ro u n d at 2.15            p.m.      it was very e v i d e n t

the o r g a n i s a t i o n of the p re vious            year     was sadly        lacking.            People

s u p po r t e r s b ei ng s ea r c h e d     just inside       the t urnstiles.                 Once    in

the g ro u n d we p r o c e e d e d     to our seats          to w i t n e s s    the d re a d f u l

events of        that fate fu l a f t e r n o o n unfold.



        At first,       like m an y         people a r o u n d me,      I did not realise

-ne e no r m i t y of the situation.                 I just       thought        the o c c u r r e n c e s

b elow me were due           to o ver c ro w d i n g on a n or m a l scale,                 a nd w o ul d

soon be sorted out.                 I watched        Police      O ff i c e r s s h o u t i n g at      the

fans    to move      back,     people who had m a n a g e d           to climb over g r a b b e d

by the Police as            if b e in g a rrested.              On r e a l i s i n g wha t was

happening        I found m y s e l f shouting,             like man y people a r o u n d me,

in a futile a t t e m p t at m a k i n g o u r s e l v e s heard,                to the     Referee,

the s houts b eing to            'stop        the match'.



        I stood routed           to the spot un ab le            to c o m p r e h e n d    fully what was

g o in g on a r o u n d me,      people        by this    time were         s t a n d i n g on    their

point saw a man r u n n i n g wit h a child                   in his a rm s         , who was e i t h e r

w it ne ssing,          others     p u l l i n g people up from                the s ta n d i n g area.



         On r e a c h i n g     the l a n di ng the c a f e te ri a             is based on,           I encountered

a man      lying on the floor wit h a Police                              O f f ic er    in a t t e n d an ce .

Having i n tr od uc ed m y s e l f as a nurse                     I chec ke d           the man,     he was

exh au st ed         but alive,       and a d oc t o r had              seen him,         the d oc t o r

     ing a Liv er po ol fan.                 The      P o l i ce ma n     p ro mi se d    to stay wit h him

so I proceeded,               found a steward,              again explained                 I was a nurse

and o f f er ed a s s i s t an ce .              He did not see m to k now w ha t                     to say or

do at first,             but s u g g e s t e d    I go down and find a Police                        Officer.

I wen t down a n o t h e r fl ig ht of stairs and e n c o u n t e r e d a n o t h e r

g roup of perhaps               three or four s upporters,                      hot and e x h a u s t e d

but mobile.                I e v e n t u a l l y a r r i v e d at g r o u n d      level and stood                in h or r o r

at the scene             before my eyes.                 Bodies         lying al l over           the place wit h

coats over their faces,                    m en     lying on the f loor b eing a t t e n d e d                     by

fe l l ow supporters,              and male and female                    Police        Officers.

I a p p r o a c h e d yet a n o t h e r      Police        O f f ic er e x p l a i n e d my p r o f e s s i o n and

a sked who was             in charge.             I never r e c e i v e d a reply                to this question,

as I was o b v i o u s l y o v e r h e a r d         by a n o t h e r      Police O f f i c e r      tend in g

to a man,            who was s t r u g g l i n g      to breathe lying on the floor behind

me,    he was s ho ut in g at me                 to come and help.                 As he was         s h o u t i n g at

me    to help,          the female        Police       O f f ic er wit h him shou te d               that     she was

a nurse as well,               and    that       the ma n was alright,                   injured     but alright.



         At this time I m o v e d awa y                  t e l li ng m ys e l f         that there was

n o t hi ng I could do to help                    these me n       lying very             still w i t h navy

blue e x t r e m i t i e s sol took a n o t h e r             look at my s u r r o u n di ng s.                   By

this     time mor e         injured but           living me n had been b r o ug ht out,                      and had
                                          -     4    -




been p laced on the floor                     in s i t t i n g p o s i t i o n s a r o u n d         the wall.


I c he ck e d all of them,               some had              p os sible      rib    injuries,          some

very sh oc ked and exhausted,                        some        just very hot and exhau st ed .

By this      time a n o t h e r     L i v e rp oo l fan had a p p e a r e d                   w i t h buckets

of d r i n k i n g water,        and     plas ti c d i s p o s a b l e           cups,        he c ou ld n' t

give a ny p r o f e s s i o n a l help so was m a k i n g h i m s e l f u s e f u l                       in any

way he could.              He w en t a r o u n d              the    injured w i t h water,              and man y

w or ds of comfort.               Anot he r              L i v e rp oo l s u p p o r t e r     ran up     to me

s ay i ng he was a q u a l if i e d              'First           Aider',      wha t could he do              ?

I d i re c t e d   him to the e x h a u s t e d                 fans and he stayed wit h                  them

u ntil    they were        r e mo ve d        to Hospital.



   I ca rr ie d on,        ch ecked a g ai n on a y o u n g man c a l l e d w h o

was   lying on the f loor e xhausted,                               and shocked,             and e nc ou r a g e d

       Whilst all         this was g o i n g on it was b e c o m i n g more and more

apparent       that f ir st l y n o b o d y a m o n g                the     Police      or Stewards

had    taken charge of the situation,                                s ec on d l y    the e m e r g e n c y

a Police O ff ic e r            came up to me and                   suggested         that all        people

so that the a m b u l a n c e s          could g et               to them,        it was at          this     time

the dead had a l r e a d y been m oved                  to this area by the                Police,

h a vi n g been d ir e c t e d        to do so by a ma n             I took to be a Doctor,

who had a r r i v e d         from one of the           local      Hospitals.            He was

t elling       the     Police      that he w an t e d      the injured         to be placed           in

categories,            the b a dl y    injured      to go in the first am bu la nc es ,

and not        the ones w i t h m i no r         injuries,         w h i c h at first see me d          to

be the case.                I was     later to discover,              the f o l l o w i n g morni ng ,

that     the Doctor c on c e r n e d was a f e l l o w fan who had a r r i v e d                      on

the scene a lot e a r l i e r             than     I, had sum me d up the              total     lack

of leadership,             and had       taken ove r h im self.                  Again.      I was

a p pr o a c h e d    by a lady       in a red      trousar’ s u i t , she p ro duced a card

from her pocket,               she was a q ua l i f i e d         ’First A i d e r ’ - a local

lady who had seen               the scenes on T.V.                and had a r r i v e d     to help.



       I ca rr ie d on.         mad e some       three or four a tt e m p t s           to g et help

to a man prop pe d a g a i n s t            the w all     just o u t si de       the    large

e n trance      to the s t a n d i n g area,           who had an o b v io us          p a i nf ul neck

injury.              I eventually       e nl is te d    the h e l p of a tall           Policewoman,

showed h er were             the m an w a s .          She wen t away and very soon came bac k

with b la nk et s and m ore             s upporters,        and w it h a l l      this c o m b i n e d help

we m a na ge d       to get     this man onto           the blankets,         and onto a

stretcher,           an A mb u l a n c e a p p e a r e d w it h    the   latter    just at        the right

moment.



       H aving by this            time got m o s t of the injured o u t s i d e                 the

gates,      ba dly      injured      to the right and m i n o r            i nj ur ie s    in o rder

of impo rt an ce          to the     left.       The s ight of the dead                lying a l o n g s i d e

one wall        in this area,           head     to toe,     a nd     the living        lean in g or

this       time g e t t i n g stronger,          the b adly       injured had b een removed,

all     that was        left    to do was c on t i n u e        to s u p po rt       inju re d     limbs

w it h s c a r v e s , r ea s s u r e   some     of    the    injured,       y o u n g s t e r s who

g ave      their names as                        15 yrs       of age,      worried          ho w he

was g o i n g        to get home,       a y ou ng     P o l i ce ma n stayed w i t h him saying

•we w il l g et you hom e sonny,                  d o n' t w o r r y ’.        A n o th er y o un g      lad

        The local nu rs es            took over,        h an d e d out b la nkets,              a y oung

Asian doctor,            local      I think,      was by this          time g o i n g a ro u n d         the

I r e al i se d       that by this        time     there was         little         left for me         to

do so I w a nd e r e d         back     into    the area b eh i n d        the stand,            intending

to go back            to my friends,           but was       stop pe d by yet a n o t h e r

very d i s t r e s s e d      - he had been           to B e l gi um and w i t n e s s e d        the

 to go and ring his Mum.                       On his     departure         the      Policewoman

 h e rs el f b roke       down briefly,           and was r e s cu ed by one of her

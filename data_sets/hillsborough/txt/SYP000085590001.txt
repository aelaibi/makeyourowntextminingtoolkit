            I am the above person & I reside at the above address.

            On Tuesday the 4th of July              1989 (040789) at my home address                 I signed a

            completed       "supporters questionnaire"                   this cavers my movements &

            observations on the         15th of April                1989 (1504S9)     when I attended the

            Liverpool       versus Nottingham Forest FA cup semi final                      football match

            at Hillsborough in Sheffield.

            Further to this questionnaire,                     I am a member of the Heart of England

            branch of the Liverpool FC supporters                         club,   two members of this    club

            died at the above mentioned game,    the two lads I knew only as. C ARL £
                                                                AA&tf&yfyty a/(?27
            NICK,    I later found out that their full names were CARL/ & NICHOLA S/

            HEWITT.

            I travelled to the game on a coach organised by the supporters                              club.

            I nornally sit behind the driver on the coach,                           however,   on this day I
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     SS9S5

         sat on the front seat on the other side of the coach,            the HEWITT

         brothers sat,    I think separatly in the two rows of seats behind me,

       f/'they got onto the coach after me at the final         collection stop in

         L e i c e s t e r , I said hello to them as they got on,   that was all.

         I d i d n ’t speak to either of the HEWITT brothers again that d a y , also

         didn't see them again after the coach had pulled up,            I simply got ofi

         the coach & made my way to the ground,         I d i d n ’t see or speak to the

         HEWITT brothers at any time after        leaving the coach.

                                                                                    SIGNED

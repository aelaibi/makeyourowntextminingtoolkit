I am a Member of Parliament for the Garston Constituency of Liverpool.



As stated in the questionnaire that I have completed I travelled by car to

Sheffield on 15.A.89 with                                                           We arrived between

2.25 pm - 2.30 pm and were able to park quite close to the ground.                                       We all

had North Stand Seating Tickets, we all walked to the Leppings Lane

Entrance arriving at about 2.35 pm and joined a large crowd waiting to get

into the ground.



There were some Police Officers about; I remember seeing a mounted

Policeman and an Inspector but it appeared that there was very little

movement indicating that people were getting into the ground.                                   In fact

there were no orderly queues as such, you had no control of where you were

going you just had to go with the crowd swaying and swirling around.                               I

actually got pinned on the wall near to the concertina gate.                              There was

certainly no violence within the crowd but there was some verballing going

on because people were getting very anxious about the situation and it was

heading towards kick off.              I ought to say that I attended last years match

with a similar ticket and all I can say is that nothing springs to mind

that there was any difficulty last year at all in getting into the ground.



There were no orderly queues as such at all, for example at Anfield mounted

police officers are at each turnstiles at the Kop Entrance which force you

to go into orderly queues; what was happening at Hillsborough was not like

that and it appeared that the turnstiles were closed; I of course didn't

know if that was so neither obviously did the people who were joining at

the back of this crowd, it just appeared that there was no movement at all

and the crush just got worse with people shouting things like "We've paid

for our tickets now they won't let us in."



At kick off time I found myself pinned by the blue concertina gate which

was suddenly opened from my left to right;                      I just got carried through with

the pressure of people and was not really in control of my movements for

about 5-10 yards.              I remember seeing a line of police officers standing

alongside the wall on my left hand side.                    There was a lot of verbals to the

Police as they passed through probably venting their frustration.



I got to my slot about 5 minutes after kick off,                                          were not

there; they arrived about 2-3 minutes later.



There was a moment in the match when Liverpool hit the goal bar and this

was met with a huge vocal roar from the supporters; shortly after this I

became aware of people climbing over the perimeter fences at the Lepping

Lane End.        I formed the opinion that it was a form of hooliganism and it

wasn't until I saw people lying on the pitch near the goal mouth that I

realised that something was seriously wrong and that it wasn't hooliganism.

Shortly after this the match was abandoned and obviously the Nottingham

supporters didn't know what had happened and there was a lot of chanting

and a lot of uniform police officers arrived on the pitch at about the same

time injured fans were being carried away from the Leppings Lane End.                                I

suppose the police officers didn't really know what had happened at this

stage, it must have been like having a piece of a jigsaw puzzle. Gradually

the picture emerged of how serious the incident was because I saw fans

being carried on stretchers with their faces covered and their limbs just

hanging over the side.             The fans were first to react; I think the police

officers at Leppings Lane probably thought it was holiganism, rather than

people being injured and shortly after this more police officers arrived

and formed a line across the ptich.                       Gradually events unfolded and the

organisation seemed to get better but it did take quite a time to get into

full swing.         I left the ground at about quarter to four.                            At this time I

was aware that 5 people had died but of course I found out later the full

extent of the disaster.               We drove back to Liverpool only stopping to make

a phone call.



In my opinion what was occurring outside the ground (i.e. the crushing)

should have been relayed to those inside the ground who would have been

able to take some action about it.                      Also when the first fans began to climb

the perimeter fences the police obviously thought initially that it was

hooliganism and didn't react accordingly but of course they may not have

known what was happening.                 Some individual officers did begin to take

action when they obviously realised what was happening but they appeared to

lack any co-ordination at first.                     Finally, I have seen and read items 29-38

inclusive on my completed questionnaire and really they sum up my opinions

and observations.

     AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?


     The police did not assess the situation correctly although at first
     it did appear to be disorder.    There was no leadership, seemed to
     lack chain of command, some officers acted independantly while others
     remained ridgid in controlling a crowd.


30   HAVE   YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE   ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE MATCH
     STEWARDS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?


     No.

     SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHICH YOU THINK IS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR TO
     THIS DISASTER? (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)


     It was more organised outside the ground last year.     There was no
     crush as turnstiles.


36   HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF FANS IN THE
     STANDING AREA TO THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?


     Once the gate was opened fans rushed past me and there was no-one to
     prevent all the fans going down the trunnel to pens 3 and A.


37   DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED
     FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?


     There appeared to be quite a delay in the arrival of the emergency
     services.     The fans who first went onto the pitch knew what was
     happening and were the first to get organised.     Everyone else seemed
     unorganised.


38   IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO
     THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?


     I think the events of that day were avoidable and the greatest
     tribute we can pay to those who lost their lives would be to see that
     whatever steps need to be taken should be a matter of urgent
      consideration.   Any consultation on these matters should involve
      football supporters and other organisations.

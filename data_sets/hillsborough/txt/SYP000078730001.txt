relaying        to me messages           he    could hear.        He told me that there was                      some

sort     of    problem with        numbers at the Leppi n g s Lane                 end and that a

delayed kick            off had been          requested.      He then told me that               th^/gates

had been opened.                It was    obvious     that the kick          off had not/been

delayed because            the teams were

              a g g r e s s i v e as    in a normal          pitch invasion.               I saw Su p e r i n t e n d e n t

              Greenwood, run onto the                  pitch and speak             to the       referee who         in turn

              cleared      the      pitch of         players.         The    playing area at that end was                       now a

              mass    of    people and             1 went    down towards          that     end to observe.              Fans were

              w a n d e r i n g about all          over     the    place and h o s t i l i t y was building                up

              b etw e e n the fans on the                 pitch and those              remaining         in the stands and

              S p i o n Hop.        I realised there were                   problems w ith the             crowd at      the

              Leppings       Lane end and. I made my way further                            towards        the barrier

              fencing.         As      I did so I became aware                  of persons           suffering minor

              injury;      some        very distressed;,            fighting       for    their         breath,    some were

              hysterical         some were abusive                 to me,     other      officers and their              own fans

              in the N orth Stand.                  People were          laying        on the ground being a t t e n d e d

              the    pitch side were                leaning       over the top and assisting                   people      over.             ,

              The    gates were           open and        people many deep were                 trying to get          out

              through the tanglement                   of bodies around                the gates.          A lot of      people

              were    on the        pitch side         trying       to assist          them.       1 could see        people

FORCE OPERATIONS ROOM




On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was the Duty Inspector in the For©£    Q&tmteXW®
Room working from 2 pm until 10   pm. On commencing duty I was aware that,
the Major Incident Room situated just off the main Operations Room was manned
and was controlling events in relation to the football match at Hillsborough.
Chief Inspector Edmundson was in charge of the Incident Room and I had no
duties in respect of the event.


At about 1506 that day, Chief Inspector Edmundson came into the Operations
Room and instructed ire to implement Operation Support in respect of crowd
problems and injuries at the football match.   I inmediately brought up on
the Conmand and Control system the pre-fonnatted message and I then ssksd
Chief Inspector Edmundson if the implementation had been authorised by an
officer of Assistant Chief Constable rank as instructions require.     Whilst
completing the format details I heard Chief Inspector Edmundson query with
ground control who replied that the ACC (Operations) was present and had
authorised it.   Again, whilst cotrpleting the format, I queried the rendezvous
point but was unable to clarify it at that stage.   Once completed I
despatched the Operation Support message forcewide at 1510 hours giving it
an 'E' emergency coding which means that the message generates a visual and
audible warning at receiving sub-divisons indicating the presence of an

incoming priority message.


At 1513 hours I ascertained that the rendezvous point was to be the police
room at the <jroUn6 and despatched another priority message giving that

information.

JAMES WILLIAM GUNN
DETECTIVE INSPECTOR
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE




On Thursday, 8th June, 1989 at 11am I watched a compilation tape of the
Hillsborough event and video.
The tape was number MRE 2/R and at a point marked 1200 on the tape which
came up on the screen, the scene was Leppings Lane turnstiles and was showing
a crowd situation crushing to get through the turnstiles. When the view moved
across to the other side of the area showing a group of fans not taking part
in the efforts to get into the turnstile, a voice clearly said "We've just got
here".     Followed shortly afterwards by a voice with a north-^estern
accent saying "We've got to get in there at the turnstile.   We've got to
get in there".   The inflection of the voice appeared to be more of an instruction
than a comment and in my opinion it was someone talking to a group of persons
and giving them a specific instruction as opposed to advising them.
The video then panned to another area.
The footage concerned ran from approximately 1200 to 1216.
Inspector Spencer was present.   I played this video and after playing it through
a few times we were then joined by Detective Inspector King who also watched it.

           I am a single man and reside at the above address with my mother.



           I am a supporter of Liver pool Football Club and a season ticket

           holder.     I attend all the home games and some away games.



           I obtained my ticket for the Semi-Final Football Match to be played at

           Hi 1 lsborough, Sheffield,    on Saturday 15th April            1989 (150469),          between

           Liverpool and Notts Forest from Anfield.



           I did not go to the match in an organised party,                    but with a group of

           friends on a coach owned by Eavesway Travel, Newton-Le-Wi11o w s .                        I

           i.rsiu a i ia n on the coach with

                           and                      Although there were other lads in the
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              S3572

party,         but I do not know them by name and I do not know the addresses

of any of the lads.



I caught the coach on the morning of the match at Haydock, a suburb of

St Helens.



The coach stopped once at a service station for people to use the

toilets.         As we came off the motorway near Sheffield,      I saw Police

stopping         coaches,   but for some reason they did not stop our coach.          In

Sheffield the coach stopped near to a railway bridge on the main road

and people started getting off,           but just before I got off,      the Police

told the driver to move on so the driver drove the coach back up the

main road and parked in a row of coaches.



M y s e 1f ,                        and         all got off the coach at this

point and started to walk towards the football ground.                 As I walked

along the road near to the railway bridge,             I saw a large crowd of

people lying on the grass bank,           drinking and sun-bathing,      but I

did not see any trouble.



I had been to Hillsborough before           in 1988 (000088) and knew where to

go at the same match last year.            I went   into the Leppings Lane

terrace.         We all had tickets for the Leppings Lane terrace which

cost £6.



We arrived in Sheffield at about two o ’clock            (1400) and went straight

to the ground,         arriving there at two fifteen (1415).      On

arriving at the L e ppings Lane turnstiles, there were queues

about two people thick and stretching back from the turnstiles

to the outer iron gates.
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          S3572



I did not see any mounted Police,      but there w e r e Policemen

checking y ou as you got near the turnstile and

had to give up a flag he had with him to a Policeman who gave

him a slip of paper to collect the flag after the match.             He did

get the flag back after the game.



I had no problems entering the ground,       there was no crush at this

time outside the turnstile.       I went through a turnstile on the

left-hand side and gave up part of my ticket.        We all entered

the ground as a group and walked towards the tunnel which

leads to the terrace.     I did not see any Police or Stewards

inside the turnstiles.     I did not see any gates open,     except the

turnstiles.   Because   I have been to the ground before,      I

knew that   I could have reached the terrace from either end

of the Leppings Lane Stand,    but I wanted to go to the centre

of the terrace.



On going down the tunnel,    to the terrace,    it was not too busy,

there was no crush in the tunnel and it was about half past

two   <1430) to twenty to three    (1440).   On reaching the terrace

it was pretty packed and we had to push our way into pen

three.    I remained with my friends in pen three and we made

our way to the front of the pen against the perimeter fence

around the pitch, and as far to the right as we could go

against the fence which runs down the terrace to the perimeter

fence.   We remained in this position for about ten minutes,

during which time I was being knocked about by the crowd

moving forward and backwards.      We looked to the right into pen

two and saw that there was plenty of room in there,        so we
                                                                            PAGE        4
                                                                            S3572
* decided to jump over the fence into this area.



 Myself,                                                       and

          , all jumped over the fence.    We used the mesh of the

 perimeter fence to get over the fence.        Once    into pen two it was

 quiet and we could find plenty of space to stand, and we stood

 about half way down the terrace about fifteen to twenty feet from

 the fence which divide pens three and two.



 The next thing then I can remember is the game starting, a Peter

 BEARDSLEY attacking.     I then became aware of people climbing over

 the perimeter fence    into the pitch and I saw the Police          put these

 fans back into the pen.     After a few more minutes, more and more
 -------------------------                                                         S.
 people started to flood over the fence into the pitch and spread

 into the playing area.     I then saw that the game had been stopped

 and the players    left the pitch.    At this point I had not seen any

 injured or dead person.



 I then saw more    people jumping over the fence from pen three into

 pen two.    I remember one man being passed over people's head in pen

 two and out into the pitch.       I saw people giving this man mouth-to-

 mouth.     I think it was a St Johns ambulance       person who was giving the

 mouth-to-mouth and then he was joined by a fan.          After a while     I saw

 this man had been left and was just lying on his back on the pitch in

 front of pen two.     I would describe this man as being aged about

 thirty years,    large build,   brown hair.   He had a beard.        I think he

 was wearing a light coloured shirt which was open.           The man was

 covered over a lot later.



 I saw a Policewoman attending to a girl or child on the pitch.              She

                                                                     S3572

had an oxygen cylinder.     I do not know if the child lived,    but I saw

that the Policewoman was upset.     I saw two ambulances    come onto the

pitch, an old one and new one.     I saw a number of people being treated

on the pitch and also a number who appeared dead placed on the pitch

in front of pen two.     They had to move several of the dead people when

the ambulance    came behind the goal area.     I saw a lot of people being

pulled up into the West Stand at the rear of the Leppings Lane

terrace.     While all this was going on,   I heard several tannov

an no uncements for people to clear the pitch so that the game could

restart.



At the rear of pen two there was a loose advertising board and this

was taken down by someone and it was passed over our heads onto the

pitch to be used as a stretcher.     When the fans on the pitch saw the

hoarding,    they started to rip down the hoardings around the pitch and

used them as stretchers.



We all stayed together and did not go onto the pitch.        I saw fans and

Police tear down the perimeter fence in an effort to reach people in

pens three and four.     I could not see into pen three at the front

from where    I was standing and did not see any dead or injured people

in the pen.     It was not until they were on the pitch that I could see

them.



We all   left the ground at about quarter to five     (164-5), this was after

the announcement that the game had been abandoned.       As I left the

ground I saw that a barrier in pen three was broken and lying forward

towards the pitch,    it looked pretty rusty.    1 also saw blood on the

terrace and a pile of shoes on the terrace.

                                  We left the ground by going back up the tunnelgotand

         his flag back from the Police.       I did not see any dead or injured

         people at the rear of the West Stand,         just people looking for each

         othe r .



         I looked for a telephone to try a ring home,         but the queues were too

         long, so I got a can of coke and went back to the coach.            Everyone on

         the coach was accounted for and we left for Liverpool.            We stopped at

         a service station to phone home and I bought a card phone to phone

         home.      I eventually arrived home at eleven     (2300)   to half past   (2330).



         1 attended         same game last year and the Police were more organ iss d.

c 0 ^.<->^~jhey were checking tickets and as I travelled by train we were

         escorted straight to the ground and not allowed to wander around.

         This year there was more freedom and you could wander around,              Last

         year    I was   in the same terrace and was pushed around and jostled a

         lot, so at half-time      I climbed up into the West Stand.



         I was not injured at the match and did not lose any time at work.



         On the day of the match I wore blue jeans, white and blue trainers,

         dark blue sweatshirt,      no scarf or hat.

            the     crowd.

            All     I can       say was              that      by     now         the       Players          had     come      out       onto    the       pitch

            and    five,        I also           saw a         number             of    fa n s     being        pushed and               lifted          into    the

            have    worked.

            The    next        thing        I ca n        say       is    the          g a me     was     stopped         the       players          left       the

            the    p e n n e d area,             what       appeared               to       be a    couple           minutes         on    reflection

            of    th e    incident,              I

            could        see a       fe w    fans         lying          on       the       edge    of       the     pitch,         it w a s     a       nice    day

        and    some      people            were       being        shown      to w h a t        I assume          was    the       first       aid

        escorted         by a S t e w a r d ,            his       left     arm     was      badly         twisted and             obviously

        broken,         I can't            describe           this m a n         in a n y       detail       because          there       was       so

        much      going       on.

        I would         say      it w a s        approximately                3.23pm         and      I could          see    people          being

        stretched            in the         s am e     direction            as     the     walking          in j u r e d ,    towards          the

I came     out        of    the      ground and               turned          left       into      the    Leppings        Lane       as       I

crossed         the    bridge          to     the     river         Don       I bumped          into      my    brother                   I

stood     there        a while            talking          until         we     were      joined         b y f e n d

would     like        to    say      on     coming         out      of     the       ground        the    outer       Leppings

Lane    area      was       heavily           congested             with        emergency           service        vehicles          and

fans    had      to w a l k         in s i n g l e       file       between           the    vehicles           and    appliances,

                                                                                                                                     51146

             I would        sa y    this    was a g a i n s t      policy and           if    the    crowd        had    surged       out      of

             the    crowd a         second       incident        could      of    occurred.

             We    made     our    way     back    to     the    car a n d m a d e       a    call       home     from my       brothers

             car    pho ne ,       just    to    let    our     families         know    we       were    alright.            I do    not

             feel     I can a d d a n y t h i n g         else    other      than       the       time    I h a ve      given       are    only

             guesses        on my     part as          eveything        happened         so       quickly and           I didn't

             perposely         look at          my watch        at a n y    time.

             I ca n    not     describe          any    emergency          personal          or    fans     who    were       assisiting

             with     the    injured,           apart     from    the      two                 irothers         wh o    1 know

             personally,            equally       so    I cannot        describe         any       injured        party,       or    person

             I assumed         d e ad,     because        everything         wa s   a    total       chaos.

             “ I do    remember           the    goal     net    being      removed          in o r d e r    for       free    flow       of

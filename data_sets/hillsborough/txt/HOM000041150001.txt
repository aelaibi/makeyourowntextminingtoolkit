Re scene at Leppings Lane at 2.45 pm
“The first thing I said was: “Where are all the bobbies? There is hardly anybody there”. I saw
numerous people climbing over the tops of the turnstiles and the few police officers that I saw
appeared to be doing nothing about it. My main observation at this point was the lack of police
presence. I couldn’t understand how such a large crowd could have possibly gathered. I recall in
previous games there was usually a large police presence concentrated on this part of the ground
usually forming some sort of cordon”, (p.68)

           At 9.00 a.m.         on Saturday,          15 April                                          1989,                    I paraded for duty at

           Ecclesfield Police Station,                            and was subsequently                                                            conveyed to

           Hillsborough football              ground for briefing                                                                    re the Semi-Final.            I

           arrived at the ground together with other officers at approximately

           9.40 a.m.        At this time there a pp e a r e d to be very little activity

           around the ground apart              from that of Police Officers.

           Briefing for the event             subsequently took place                                                                        in the North Stand at

           a pproximately          10.00 a.m.

           My duties      that day were         plain clothes                                                         foot               patrol   in Middlewood Roadg

           motor vehicles.           My supervisory officer being                                                                           Inspector Scaifel

           At the   conclusion of the briefing TDC O ’Brien and myself made our way

           along Penistone Road and             into Parkside Road,                                                                       this would have been

in pedestrian ac tivity     with large groups of      youths wandering around

aimlessly with a few shouting the usual         football    chants.     We     both

made our way along M iddlewood Road in the direction of               ohe hospital.

When nearing the Texaco      petrol   station we decided to walk back in the

opposite direction towards H il ls borough shopping          centre.

At about    12 midday as we approached the junction of Middlewood Road

and Wadsley Lane,    our attention was      caught by Police Sergeant           1948

Miller who was on mobile Transit         patrol.    He stated that one of the

pubs situated further up Wadsley Lane was full             to capacity and that

there was a large number of people outside           on the frontage and road

drinking beer.     He appeared concerned that        they may get out of hand.

Also situated at this junction are a number of shops where a large

number of Liverpool    supporters had gathered for what           can only be

described as a drinking      session.     There were numerous      cans of beer

and lager being and had been consumed.             I continued to walk along

Mi ddlewood R oad and into the shopping        centre.     Whilst walking along

this   road I again saw large groups of youths           drinking from cans of

beer and lager.     Those that I did not see drinking           I could hear pass

comments as to "Where       is the nearest    public house?"

Once TDC O 'Brien and myself had patrolled the             precinct,   we decided to

visit Parkside Section House via the          park grounds.      At about            _

 1.00 p.m. - 1.15 p.m.      whilst walking along Parkside Road,              I was

ap proached every five      yards by a       Liverpool supporter asking

ticket.     On eventually    reaching Parkside Section House,           I saw^^.

 large number''of "youths standing behind the Section House              and    around

 vehicles   in the parking bay situated ad ja ce nt to the Section House,

 the m ajority *of whom were drunk and were subsequently removed.'' j g a i n

 by the accent    I believe these to be Liverpool          supporters.                   ■ ■
                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                       R 159

standing on top of the Police Station Station drinking                   cans of beer/

lager.     Needless     to say,     I took   prompt and necessary action and

removed the youths who were again from Liverpool.                    Whilst    engaged in

this    I saw one youth emerge from the rear of the               building holding a

can of lager        in one hand and holding his exposed           person in the other,

intending to walk along the            road in this manner.          This youth was

spoken to and advised accordingly.

TDC O ’Brien and myself thought              it best to inform ground control of

the situation at the Section House,               so that further attention could

be paid to it.
We were some fifteen minutes at the box before                 resuming       patrol    in

Middlewood Road.

At 2.15 p.m. TDC O ’Brien and myself              returned to the Police area at

       rr e a r of the North Stand via the Penistone Road entrance.                    Whilst

e/route      we were again approached by dozens of Liverpool                   fans    looking

     ir tickets.     On arriving at the gym I mealed.

 U     about 2.45 p.m.      I resumed patrol      together with TDC O'Brien and

     fgether with Police Constables Hiles and Moulding we made our way

along Penistone Road into Vere Road and into Leppings Lane.                       This was

the first and only time during the day that             I v i s ite,*r thi s side of
                                                                  /      *
the ground and to be honest,,            I was taken back        Oie  sight.    The

 climbing'Vv1i»r_ the Tqjfs'Tf the tiJnstile* and the few Police Officers

 that I saw a p p e a r e ^ to be doing nothing about          it.    My main            .,ir

 observation a t ’ th/s       point was the      lack of Police      presence.     I co ul d n’t

 understand     how sujbh a large crowd could have            possibly gathered.             1

                                                                                      R 1 59

cordon.     It did not however          cross my mind that        people may bs injured

as a result, of such a crowd forming.

We continued to walk          past Leppings Lane and through the car park

situated in H i l ls bo ro ug h Park,       intending    to go back      into the precinct

in Middlewood Road.

It was whilst walking          in the park that        I decided to      listen in on the

channel    used by ground       control whilst Policy Constable Moulding

monitored the C.I.D.          channel.    I re cal i^fiea r i ng at about 3.00 p.m.        the

request for an ambulance,             the reports     of somebody      seriously injured.

Throughout    the following           five minutes or so there          seemed to be chaos

and confusion.        The    transmissions were        clear,    but everybody seemed to

be requesting a mbulances at the same                time.    I recall    seeing two or

three travelling along Penistone Road.                  To be honest,      at this time I

thought s omebody was         over    reaching until     I heard a voice on the radio

who 1 recognised to be Chief             Inspector Sumner who stated that there

were -a number of bodies and something about a temporary mortuary.                             On

hearing this all. four         of us immediately        returned to      the gymnasium.

On my arrival my stomach             churned as    I saw them bringing       in the first

of the bodies       on advertising       boards.   One after the other for some few

minutes    I was    in shock.        I just stood there       saying    nothing,   doing

nothing.    I recall    seeing       six Liverpool    supporters       carrying a dead

body into the gym,          three of which were       crying.     As they got to the

door the body just          dropped off the board.           It was on seeing this that

I tried to pull myself          together.     I do    not know where TDC O ’Brien had

got to or the other          officers.

I grabbed hold of a          board and    ran onto    the pitch with       the

supporters.        again,    I was    in disbelief.     I saw people      still being

pulled out of the West Stand some unconscious,                   but the majority

appeared dead.       I just did       not know what     to do.     I saw people injured,

people dead and       people    in    grief.✓rvl at first tried to see to all
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         R 159

three at once.              I recall most          if not all           o ^ e     injured were being

seen to by ambulance                 crew. Police O t f y r ^ s           and St.        John's.   I

resigned myself             to     removing thos^tfho were o bv iously dead from the

pitch.     I recall         there      we,(e><f<£t        fans still        chanting        obscenities as

bodies were being                 carried     in front of the S p io n Hop.                 This was soon

to stop.
I carried some three                  or four bodies from the                   pitch.      I recall

thinking       I was fortunate               to be in plain clothes,                seeing the abuse and

bad feelings being                 directed towards           the uniform           lads.     In most cases

understandable as a grieving                       heart sees no barriers.                   Each journey to

the gym the amount                 of bodies       increased two fold.                  l recall when I

 brought      in my last            body,     just standing and            looking,        thinking that this

 should not have happened.                      I was upset,            confused and did not know what

 to do next.           At this         time    I saw that        I was not by myself.

 I eventually d irected my attention to assisting                                   the uniform Police

 Officers with the                 searching and identification of the bodies.                           I

 assisted some three                 or four officers            in this        task.     I cannot say that

 I can give any d e s c r i p t i o n s           of these       bodies.         I merely assisted the

 uniformed officers who                     completed the        reports.

 I was subsequently                 conveyed to Hammerton Road Police Station where,

 together with other                  officers,       I took missing             person     reports from

 relatives and friends.                     It was only at this            stage that         I recalled any

 descriptions             of the       bodies     I had handled.           This was disturbing

 knowing that             the      person they were         looking        for was        in fact dead, but

 still having             to      complete the report.-

 At 1.00 a.m.            that morning           the t e m p o r a r y   enquiry      room wa s     closed.       I

 was     s u b s e q u e n t ly   c o n v e y e d to E c c l e s f i e l d Police    Station w h e r e    I

              At 9.00 a.m.             on Saturday,         15 April           1989,       I paraded for         duty at

              H i l l s b o r o u g h football         ground for briefing                  re the S emi-Final.             I

              Briefing          for the event          subsequently            took        place    in the North Stand at

              approximately            10.00 a.m.

              M y duties        that day were           plain      clothes         foot      patrol      in M id dl e w o o d Road,

              t o ge t he r w ith T e m p o r a r y D e t e c t i v e C o n s ta bl e O'Brien,               paying

              At    the    conclusion of          the    briefing TDC O ' B ri en and myself made our way

              a l on g P en i st o ne Road an d          into P ar ks id e Road,                this w o u l d have been

              about       11.00 a.m.

              I saw that w it hi n the              last     hour       there     had c e r t ai nl y      been an increase

 a i m l e s s l y with a few s ho u t i n g             the usual      football          chants.        We both

 m ad e    our w a y along M i d d l e w o o d R o a d          in the d i r e ct io n of          the    hospital.

 W h e n nearing        the Texaco         petrol         station we deci de d to w a l k                back    in the

 o p po si te     d i r e ct io n towards H i l l s b o r o u g h shopping                centre.

At about          12 m i d d a y as we a p p r o a c h e d       the j un ction of M i d d l e w o o d Road

an d W a d s l e y Lane,         our a t t e n t i o n was        caught by P ol i c e S e r g e a n t          1948

M il l er who was            on mob il e T r a n s i t       patrol.       He stated that            one of the

 pubs      s i tu at ed further         up W a d s l e y Lane was           full     to   c ap ac it y and that

there was a large number                     of     people      outside on the f ro n t a g e and                road

d r i nk in g     beer.       He a p p e a r e d    c o n c er ne d that they may get               out of hand.

Also      s i tu a te d at     this     j u n c t i o n are a number           of shops w he re a           large

n umber of Liverpool                s u p po rt er s      had g at he re d for what              can only be

d e s c r i b e d as a drinking            session.           There were         nume rous       cans of beer

a nd      lager being and had been                   consumed.          I continued to walk along

M i d d l e w o o d R oad and       into     the    shopp in g      centre.        'Whilst w a l ki ng along

this      road     I a ga in saw        large      groups      of youths         drinking        from    cans of

beer and          lager.       Those     that      I did not        see drinking           I could hear pass

comments as           to "Where        is the nearest              public house?"

Once TDC O ' B r i e n and my se lf                had    p atrolled the           precinct,       we decided to

v isit P ar k s i d e S e c t i o n House           via the       park     grounds.          At about

1.00       p.m.    - 1.15       p.m.    whilst w a l k i n g       along P ar kside Road,                I was

a p p r o a c h e d every five yards               by a Li ve rp oo l        supporter as ki ng           for a

ticket.         On e ve nt u a l l y     reaching P a r k s i d e S e c t i o n House,             I saw a

large      number      of youths         standing         b eh i n d the S e c t i o n House and around

vehicles        in the       parking      bay s i t u a t e d a dj acent          to the S e c t i o n House,

the m a j o r i t y of whom were             drunk and were              s ub se q u e n t l y   removed.        Again

by the accent           I believe         these      to be Liverpool             supporters.

I recall        that whilst          inside        the    b o x / S e c t i o n House     I heard    footsteps

on the      roof.       On    inspecting           this    I saw about         four youths          to be

standing        on top of the Po li ce S t a t i o n S t a t i o n drinking                       cans of beer/

lager.   Needless to say, I took prompt and necessary action and

removed the youths who were again from Liverpool.    Whilst engaged in

this I saw one youth emerge from the rear of the building holding a

can of lager in one hand and holding his exposed person in the other,

intending to walk along the road in this manner.    This youth was

spoken to and advised accordingly.

TDC O'Brien and myself thought it best to inform ground control of

the situation at the Section House, so that further attention could

be paid to it.

We were some fifteen minutes at the box before resuming patrol in

Middlewood Road.

At 2.15 p.m. TDC O'Brien and myself returned to the Police area at

the rear of the North Stand via the Penistone Road entrance.    Whilst

en route we were again approached by dozens of Liverpool fans looking

for tickets.     On arriving at the gym I mealed.

At about 2.45 p.m. I resumed patrol together with TDC O ’Brien and

together with Police Constables Hiles and Moulding we made our way

along Penistone Road into Vere Road and into Leppings Lane.- This was

the first and only time during the day that I visited this side of

the ground and to be honest, I was taken back by the sight.    The

crowd appeared to be solid from the turnstiles 1-16, to near the

centre of Leppings Lane.

It did not however cross my mind that people may be injured

                                                                                                              R 159

as a result           of s u c h a         crowd forming.

We     c o n t i nu ed -t o w a l k      past Leppings L ane a n d t h r o u g h the               car park

situated        in H i l l s b o r o u g h Park,         in te nd in g      to go back       into the       precinct

 in M i d d l e w o o d Road.

 It was w h i l s t        walking         in the park that             I deci de d to       listen       in on the

channel        used       by g r o u n d    control w hi l s t P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e Moulding

monitored           the C.I.D.           channel.      I recall         hear in g at about 3 .00 p.m.              the

request        for a n a mb ul a n c e ,         the reports          of    s om eb o d y se ri ou sl y   injured.

T hr ou g h o u t    the     following          five minu te s        or so there seemed to be chaos

a nd    confusion.              The    transmissions          were      clear,      but eve ry bo dy seemed to

be r equesting a m b u l a n c e s at the same                     time.        I recall      seeing      two or

three t r a v e l l i n g        a lo ng Penistone Road.                   To be honest,       at this      time    I

thought        s o m e b o d y was       over    reaching until             I heard a voice on the             radio

who     I recognised             to    be Chief       I ns pector Su mn er who           stated that        there

were a nu mber             of    bodies       and something a bo ut a tem po ra ry mortuary.                        On

hearing        this       all    four      of us i mm e d i a t e l y      returned to the gymnasium.

On my arrival              my    stomach        churned as       I saw them bringing              in the first

of the bodies              on a d v e r t i s i n g boards.        One after         the other for some            few

minutes        I was       in shock.            I just    s tood      there     saying     nothing,       doing

nothing.        I recall          seeing        six L i v e rp oo l     s upporters      carrying a dead

body     into       the    gym,       three     of w hich were          crying.       As they got         to the

door the bod y just                   d r o p p e d off the    board.         It was on seeing this that

I tried to           pull       myself      together.         I do      not   know where TDC O ’B rien had

got    to or the           other       officers.

I grabbed hol d             of a board and             ran onto         the   pitch with the

supporters.               again,       I was     in disbelief.             I saw people      still     being

p ulled out         of the Wes t           Stand some         unconscious,          but the m aj o r i t y

a p p e a r e d dead.       I just        did not kno w wha t            to d o .     I saw people         injured,

people      dead an d           people      in grief.         I at      first    tried to see to all

three at once.                  I recall       most    if not all          of the     injured were         being
                                                                                                          r n u c   -/
                                                                                                          R 139

seen to by a m b u la nc e            crew,    Police O f f i c e r s     and St.       John's.    I

resigned my se lf            to    removing those who were                o b v i ou sl y dead from the

pitch.     I recall          there were Forest              fans    still     chanting obscenities as

bodies were         being         carried     in front       of the S p i o n Hop.            This was     soon

to stop.

X carried some             three      or four bodies          from the        pitch.         I recall

thinking       I was       fortunate         to be     in plain        clothes,       seeing    the abuse and

bad feelings          being        d ir ec te d towards       the      uniform       lads.     In most     cases

un de rs ta nd ab le       as a grieving            heart    sees      no barriers.           Eac h journey to

the gym the amount                  of bodies        inc re as ed two      fold.        I recall w hen I

brought       in my last            body,    just stand in g        and    looking,       thinking       that this

should not         have      happened.          I was     upset,       c on fu se d and did not know what

to do next.           At     this time        I saw that        I was      not       by myself.

I e ve nt u a l l y d ir e c t e d my a t t e n t i o n      to a s s i s t i n g     the uniform Police

Officers wit h the s ea rching and                       i d e n t i f i c a t i o n „of the bodies.      I

a s si s t e d some     three        or four     officers          in this    task.      I cannot say that

 I can give any d es cr i p t i o n s            of these          bodies.       I me re ly a ss isted the

uni fo rm ed o ff icers who               c ompleted the           reports.

 X was s u b s e q u e n t l y      c on veyed to H a m m e r t o n R oa d Police S t at io n where,

together w i t h other                officers,       I took m i ss in g       person        reports    from

 relatives       and friends.               It was    only at this          stage      that    I recalled any

 d es cr iptions        of     the bodies        Ihad handled.              This was disturbing

 knowing      that      the       person they         were   looking for was             in fact       dead, but

 still     having       to     complete       the     report.

At    1.00 a.m.        that m o r n i n g      the t e m p o r a r y   e n qu ir y    room was    closed.       I

 was s u b s e q u e n t l y      c on veyed to E c c l e s f i e l d Pol ic e S t a t i o n where         I

 signed off         duty.

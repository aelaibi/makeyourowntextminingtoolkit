                I was        initially positioned on Middlewood Road at its junction with

                Hawksley Avenue,                   However at a^iroKimately           1.45 pm I was       instructed to

            I saw further groups of Liverpool         fans coming    into the area.     The vast

            drinking to excess. \ 1        saw many earrying    packs of beer or lager and

            some walking along drinkrng from bottles of wine or similar there were

            fans having to support friends who had been so drunk that they could

            not walk unaided.        I was also aware of several young fans hanging

            around, asking other passing fans        if they had spare tickets or tickets

            to sell.     fiqwever I did not see any transactions take place.            At

            approximately 3 pm a colleague from the Catch Bar h<=*ne detail PC 1431
                       \(& i                                          ^
            J a c k s U ^ (Al) approached and stated that traffic was to be prevented

             from travelling down towards C>^tch Bar Lane from my location at the

            junction.     This was controlled accordingly and at this time there were

            still   large amounts of Liverpool       fans making their way towards the

            Leppings Lane entrance,        to the ground.      I recall thinking that if they

            are so keen on football why are they arriving so late in such a

            drunken state.       I also reflected on the outcome of Liverpool          losing

            and the possible      resulting mood of the Liverpool       support!

            At approximately 3.SO pm I way instructed by a colleague that'sof f i cers
                             \                 j ^ o Z - L tz jo p                 - -------------
            were requuLred at IShe L e p pings Lane entrance.      I did not know why as 1
            C a t c o m m ^ \ ^ t GrCou
             had no p e r s o n ^ radio.   I assumed there was trouble with the fans.

            On arrival at LeV&ings Lane entrance         I was    instructed to join other

            officers to forrnNa cordon across the front of the entrance and prevent

            a large crowd of supporters from gaining access.              I assumed that they

            either did not have tickets or that the ground was full.               I was then

            instructed to form part of a line to keep a route into the ground
                                                                                     PAGE      3
                                                                                     £32179

       ‘yclear and I saw^ bodi es / i.n j ur ed being brought from gates at the rear of

         the West stand.    Fans were    coming out from the gates         in an obviously

         distressed state they were shouting at Police Officers,              "There are

         people dead in th ere .”    " I t ’s y o u ’re fault."     I was still unaware of

         what had happened inside the ground.          I remained in this area with

         other officers keeping the entrance        clear for ambulances which were

         arriving.    We were constantly being abused by fans exiting from the

         ground accusing us of causing the deaths of people              inside the ground.

         I remained at this   itacation until the order           came for my officers to go

         to the North biana tor aecrief

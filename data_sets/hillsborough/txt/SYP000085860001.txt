              Further /o           my    previous        statement           I wish       to     clarify               the    position

              various       means.




              This    caused        a b a ck      log at       the    door        and many        of        the        bodies       were     left       on

              t he   ground        stretching           from    the       door     of    the     gy m       to    the        wall    of    the

              rear    of    the     North        Stand.

               who      was      dead.        He    was    carried          from    the      rear      of    Leppings       Ln   to   the

           RECOLLECTIONS OF EVENTS AT HILLSBOROUGH SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989



            I am a Police Constable of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary presently

           attached to the Force Mounted Section-



           On Saturday 15 April      1989 (150489),      in company with seven Mounted

           Section Officers, I travelled to Hillsborough,        Sheffield under the
                                               i^oS
           supervision of Police Sergeant 1710 W A T S O N , in order to assist South

           Yorkshire Police with public order duties at the FA Cup semi final,

           Nottingham Forest v« Liverpool.



           My deployment on arrival at Hillsborough was to monitor visiting

           Nottingham Forest supporters attending the ground via Penistone Rd
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    S2S15
                                                   m   -5?o
         turnstiles,     in company with PC   '1498 SWAIN,     a South Yorkshire Mounted

         Officer.    Also during the    course of my patrol,        in company with PC

         SWAIN,    I attended Herries Rd and Herries Rd South from where visiting

         supporters were approaching the ground.              Approximately 2.50 pm (1450)

         that day PC SWAIN resumed from Penistone Rd and I continued my patrol

         alone.



         During the entirety of my patrol my duties             consisted of monitoring

         Nottingham Forest supporters only and at no time prior to the

         beginning of the game or indeed following dispersal             of fans at the

         postponement of the match did I encounter any Liverpool             supporters.

         My patrol was restricted only to these          roads and at no time was    I

         aware of any crowd control     problems which had resulted on Lappings Ln

         or any other officers following the postponement of the game, at whic

         time   I again assisted with the orderly dispersal           of Nottingham Forest

         supporters from the ground.



                                                                 R. HINES   PC 45? SIGNED

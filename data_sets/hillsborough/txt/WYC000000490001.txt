Dear Sir,

Re: Deaths Occurring at the Incident at Hillsborough Football Ground

In the event of the death of Mr. Tony Bland, who was involved in the above incident and
who is now at Airedale General Hospital, Steeton, Mr. Turnbull has agreed to take over the
conduct of the inquest into his death, and is anxious to gather as much information as
possible for that inquest. I understand from PC. Greenway at Snighill Police Station that
a "body file" was prepared on each victim, and indeed a file has been prepared on Tony
Bland in anticipation of his death. The Coroner would be grateful to receive a copy of the
file concerning Tony Bland, and I understand such request has to be made in writing.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully,




Administrative Officer

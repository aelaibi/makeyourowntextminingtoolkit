supporters             towards           Hr.      Clough and              that    it    to    be     likely         t ha t    Hr.

Dalglish          be    totally            surrounded            by L i v e r p o o l        supporters.               Therefore                I

spoke       to M e s s r s .          Dalglish and Clough and                          told     them       t h at    it w o u l d          be

more    appropriate                   if t h e y       left     the       pitch and          c o ul d a s s i s t      by

broadcasting                o v er      the      tannoy        system and asking                    for    calm.          The      two

managers          agreed           and     I escorted            them       down       the    c en t r a l      tunnel        on m y w a y

to    the    boardroom.                  Messrs.         Clough           and    Dalglish were                then     escorted             to

Police       Control             by     other      Officers           and       I went       into     the       boardroom where

I was       met    by       several           directors          of S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F o o t b a l l             Club.

They asked             me    if t h e r e         were       fatalities           and       I said        potentially              that

may    be    so,       and       they      said        that     if    there       were       fatalities             the      match

should       be a b a n d o n e d w i t h              their     full       support          but     recognising              t ha t       it

would       be a P o l i c e            decision.              I then went             to    the P o l i c e        Control         Box

and    gave       an    update           of      the    situation.               After       a short          time     I returned

On    looking          down        the     pitch        I saaw        that       there       w as    s o me     disruption             in

course       of    doing           a television                interview          with Desmond Lynam.                         It    seemed

were    blaming             h im      for w h a t       had     transpired.                 I immediately              shouted             from

and      sort      the      problem        out?          it wa s         evident          th at      there        were         some

Liverpool           supporters             in t h e r e        amongst          Notts          Forest         supporters.                  To

supplement             this      I broadcasted                 by    loudhailer                to    the      crowd and a s k e d

for      cairn a n d        their       co-operation                so    t ha t     matters           be     resolved.               The

broadcast           had      the      immediate             effect        of    quietening                 things         down and          so       I

determined             that      I would           broadcast             to    the     Spion Kop and                  spectators                in

the      rest     of      the    ground         because           I believe            at      this        stage      nothing          ha d

been      said about             the     match        being         abandoned             a n d I ha d a f e a r                of    p a ni c

therefore           broadcasted               to    spectators                 a l o n g the S p i o n K o p a n d               North

difficult           circumstances                  and      requesting              the      co-operation                 of   the

spectators             to    remain where                t h e y we r e .           I also          advised          that      there

would       be    spectators             who       would       not       be a b l e       to      h e ar    t h is    message

clearly          because         of     the     limitations               of    the       loudhailer              and      requested

t ha t    supporters             who     h ad      heard       it    relay          the      message         to      those       behind             who

would       not     have        heard      it.        Every         broadcast             wa s      followed          by a p p l a u s e

both      from Notts             Forest         supporters               in the        Spion Kop and Liverpool

supporters             in the N o r t h S ta n d .                  I rec a ll         t h at       in the        course         of

passing          t hi s     message       a group            of     supporters               on     the     Spion Kop were

chanting          and       singing       and       the      rest        of    the     crowd         turned          on    them and

silenced          them.          I believe            t h at      when        I reached             the W e s t       end      of     the

North       stand         the    formal         announcement                  was    made         that      the      game      had     been

abandoned.                I believe           that       persons          at    that         stage         were      advised          to    leave

the      ground        slowly and             not     hurry,

I then       started            to    receive         enquiries                a b o u t the c a s u a l t i e s          from

Liverpool           supporters             on the           pitch and           they were              directed            to an a r e a

by    the    central            tunnel        where         I arranged              t ha t     Officers           could attend                  to

their       needs.           It was       at       th i s    stage        that       I obtained              the      telephone

            Control.            After         that       I went        to    the     Leppings          Lane       end      of    the         ground

            where        I sa w      outside            the    River        g a te    (Gate C)         a number            of    bodies

             covered          in g r e e n     sheets          and     liaised         with      Inspector            Sykes.             I

            ascertained              these         bodies        had    been         removed         from    the      terracing              and

            taken        by    officers            to    the     rear       of   the W e s t         stand.

            I then went              to P o l i c e       Ground Control                 where        I liaised with Officers                             as

            to     the    updated           position.             Following            this      I went          to   the       North Stand

            where        Officers           had     been       gathered          for     de-briefing              instructions,

             I then went             to     the          gymnasium which                 wa s b e i n g     u s e d as          a temporary

            mortuary           and after                 surveying           the     scene checked               as   to        the      c o n d i t i o n of

            t he    Officers           wh o    were       with        bodies.          Some      were       particularly                 distraught

            and     I attempted               to    re-assure           them.          I then         returned          to      the N o r t h

            anticipation               of     de-briefing.

            Prior        to    visiting            the    gymnasium              I had       been     informed          th a t     t h e r e was          a

E N D OF   REPORT
*/                                                                  C-O f \ J
                                  SUPERINTENDENT R.L. GREENWOOD


     I am a Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police presently the Sub-divisional

     cormander for Woodseats Sub Division (E2).


     I presently have twenty five year's Service having joined the then West Riding

     Constabulary in 1963.


     My experience of policing football crowds dates back to 1975 when I was an Inspector

     stationed at Rotherham.    My experience of policing Hillsborough ranges from 1980/81

     and 1983/86 in the rank of Inspector and Chief Inspector respectively.    I have also

     policed the previous semi finals in the rank of Superintendent.


     In connection with the FA Cup Semi Final to be held at Hillsborough on the 15th

     April, I was allocated responsibility for the Football Stadium.


     Prior to the event I attended two planning meetings and a briefing for Inspectors

     and above which was held at Hillsborough on Friday 14th April 1989.   After this

     briefing I briefed Inspectors under my command, details of which are contained in

     the briefing notes which are attached.


     On Saturday 15th April 1989, I arrived at the ground at about 9.45 a.m. and was

     present at the main briefing which was held at approximately 10.00 a.m.    After this

     I went with Chief Inspector Beal, Inspectors Booth and Calvert and the Serials

     concerned with policing the Spion Kop to the Spion Kop, where with the Inspectors

     concerned I examined the area which had been taped off and set aside for Liverpool

     supporters.   At last year's Semi Final a few hundred Liverpool supporters had

     obtained tickets for the Spion Kop, which was allocated to Notts Forest supporters,

     by whatsoever means and had had to be segregated from the Nottingham supporters by a

     cordon of Police Officers.   There was friction between both sets of supporters

     particularly when Liverpool scored and Police Officers had cane under threat to

     their personal safety.    Officers had had to draw their truncheons to control the

     situation.    I anticipated that such a situation was likely to occur at the 1989
Semi Final.   After discussion I then briefed the Serials as is reflected in my

briefing notes.    I then went with Chief Inspector Beal, whilst the Serials were

being further briefed by their Inspectors, to the rear of the Spion Kop as there was

a concern about loose stones being present.     There was evidence of sane stones on an

undeveloped area but this gave no major cause     for concern.


I then made a tour of the ground particularlylooking at the upper level of         the North

stand as I was apprehensive about the location of    a betting booth. I spoke with sane

Officers from my own Sub Division who pointed     the betting booth out and arrangements

were agreed for its supervision.    I then went from the North stand via Leppings Lane

past the Director's entrance and into the Sheffield Wednesday Control Roan, where I

liaised with Staff.    Present at that time was Superintendent Marsh who I took around

the ground.   I also liaised with Inspector Darling and Sergeant Chapman who were the

supervisory Officers responsible for the Constables who sit on the perimeter track.

                                                                           $
I was present outside the players entrance to supervise and monitor the arrival of

the Liverpool and Notts Forest team coaches, after that I again liaised with the

staff in the Sheffield Wednesday Control Room.     I learned fran the Sheffield

Wednesday staff that Brian Clough, the Notts Forest manager, would be sitting

imnediately behind the Notts Forest team bench as he was banned fran the touch line.

The seat was pointed out to me and I was told that so as to evade the press he would

cane out, not with the teams as is normal practice, but     after the teams, the

officials and coaching staff.


I estimate that it would be about    2.35 p.m. when I went on a tour of the perimeter

track.   I walked from the centraltunnel area passing the South stand to     the West end

of the ground.    The perimeter track Constables were in position and I spoke to most

of them on passing.    When I reached the area behind the goal of the Leppings Lane

terraces I remember talking to P.C. Helliwell and together we stood and faced the

terracing and the West stand.    There was a carnival atmosphere in the central pens, a

light weight beachball was being flipped about in the crowd.     I saw a young supporter
                                           -   0   -




in a green and beige striped rugby shirt being hoisted fran the central pens by

supporters in the West stand up into the West stand.         Once in the West stand, I saw

him move first to the left and then to the right and I thought to myself, because I'd

seen this happen many times before at half-time, when was he going to go to the back

and disappear into the crowd but he didn't and I believe that he realised he had been

seen by us.     I had attempted to attract the attention of sane Officers in the stand

to what was going on but suddenly the supporter came back to the front of the West

stand and without no more ado dropped back into the terracing.         After a few manents I

then walked along the perimeter track in front of the North stand to the front of the

Spion Kop.     I recall looking up to the area at the back which contained Liverpool

supporters.     I contemplated going into the Spion Kop to talk to the Officers that

were segregating approximately 800/1000 Liverpool supporters but I looked at my watch

and saw that it was about 2.50 p.m. and that as the teams would be caning out onto

the pitch before very long, it was time for me to take up a position in the central

tunnel.    I therefore made my way to that location.


I do recall a youth being arrested/ejected fran the Spion Kop although I think that

it was during the earlier tour of the ground.          It was on that occasion that I

actually went into the Spion Kop because I thought that the arresting/ejecting

Officers had fallen as a result of the youth struggling.         I remember sane minutes

after this I saw what I believe to be the same youth reappear on the Spion Kop.            I

believe he was spotted by Officers and was again removed.         A Police Officer, at sane

stage, told me that the youth admitted giving a turnstile operator £20.00 to get back

into the ground.


On returning to the central tunnel I was confronted by a large number of press

photographers awaiting the arrival of the teams.         After a short time the teams ran

onto the pitch followed by the referee and 2 linesmen and trainers/coaches.         Mr

Clough did not appear at this stage and the press photographers remained.         I recall

asking one of them what they were waiting for and he said, "You know damn well -

Clough".     I heard, with my back to the pitch at this time, the whistle go for the
kick-off.     The press photographers remained and sane of them were on the playing

area.    It was necessary they move and they were told to do so by the Police Officers

present.     Mr Clough came out and took up his seat but still sane of the press

photographers had remained to photograph him.     In front of the Notts Forest dug-out

was sane television camera equipment and the Notts Staff canplained that it was

obstructing their view.     This was moved by T.V. personnel.   The match having kicked

off and the press photographers gone fran the front of the tunnel I then surveyed the

scene in the ground.     I looked to my left and saw one or two spectators climbing over

the perimeter fence at the Leppings Lane end behind the goal.     Two or three Police

Officers were with them.     I imnediately realised that there must be a crowd problem,

not fighting or a pitch invasion because that would not happen so early in a match,

and so I imnediately went to the Leppings Lane terracing where I saw two or three

Police Officers by the track gate which I believe was open.      Fran ground level I

looked at the crowd in the pen {Pen 3) behind the goal and saw quite clearly that

supporters were being squashed against the fencing.     The area behind the gate was

heavily congested preventing persons from exiting.     I should mention that the

perimeter fence gate is not wide enough to allow a mass exit of persons being in the

order of a normal doors width.     The actual terracing is at a lower level than the

perimeter track and one has to mount one or more steps so as to exit fran the

terracing through the gate onto the pitch.     Police Officers were trying to get

supporters out.     I then mounted the advertising hoarding and fran above fence level

surveyed the whole of the crowd in the pen.     I could see that there were also people

behind the front row who were squeezed and being pushed towards the fencing.        As one

looked further back, the crowd probably more than two thirds were watching the match

quite unaware of what was happening at the front.     One or two supporters were

clambering along the top of the crowd and were trying to get out over the perimeter

fencing.    There were a few supporters on the pitch at that stage.    My imnediate

assessment was that there was a chance the problem could be alleviated if the crowd

at the middle and back of the terracing moved back so as to ease the pressure at the

front.     There was roan to do so and the central tunnel was clear.   I therefore
gestured to the crowd in the middle and towards the back with both hands in a pushing

motion shouting at them to move back and also with both index fingers pointing down

to the front of the crowd so as to indicate to them there was a problem at the front.

I gained no reaction to this and more people started to climb towards the fencing.

It was apparent at that stage that the match could not continue.    I therefore

determined that the match should stop and after broadcasting by personal radio to the

effect that there were potential casualties and that the game be stopped, fran the

top of the fencing waved both my arms towards the Control Box in a signalling motion

to the effect that the game must be stopped.   I then ran onto the pitch past the

Liverpool goalkeeper who I recall was still facing down the field of play, seemingly

unaware of what was going on around him.   It took me a little while to attract the

referee's attention by shouting but I recall play then came to a halt as he had

awarded a free kick.   I told him that we had a serious incident and that he must stop

the game and take the players off the pitch.   He agreed to do so without argument.


I then returned to the fencing and could see no improvement in the situation; more

supporters were clambering along the top of the crowd and attempting to get over the

fence where they were being helped over by Police Officers standing on the hoarding.

The crowd towards the back was still not responding by moving back.    I moved towards

the South pen nearer the Police Control Box to attract the attention of the staff so

as to apprise them of the extent of the problems.   I believe it was at this stage

that I saw Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson who came to the pitch and told him

that we had casualties.


I then immediately returned to the fencing behind the goal.   I believe it was at this

stage that an Officer told me of a fatality.   I recall looking at the people on the

front row inmediately beind the fencing and as my eyes skirted to my right along the

line I saw a female who in my view was clearly dead.   The colour had drained from her

face and her pallor was grey.   I then broadcasted that there was a potential

fatality.   By this time more supporters had cane over the fence.   Officers were

attempting to get into the crowd down the side fencing.
I was concerned as to medical support £nd ambulances and I recall discussing with

sane Officers the presence of an ambulance.        Ambulances had been requested and I

believe a further broadcast was made at that specific time; coimunications were

extremely difficult because of the noise.        However it was within my knowledge that

there was an ambulance located at the end of the tunnel in between the North stand

and the Spion Kop.     An Officer was dispatched to get that ambulance to the scene.         I

recall that the presence of press photographers was many and that they were hindering

the operation of getting people out of the pen.        I had to depute an   Officer to keep

them at bay.     I had previously deputed an Officer to bring St Johns Ambulance Staff

to the fence.


I believe it was at this time that I saw Chief Superintendent Nesbit arrive.


Because of the crush of people adjacent to the fencing it was impossible to get

people through the gate and I specifically recall a large well built man who was

trapped by other people on the steps inside the terracing.        Together with other

Officers I struggled to pull this man free.       Other persons including a young boy were

quickly pulled out.     Officers by this time had managed to go down the side railings

into the crowd.      I acquired a loudhailer.I then broadcasted to the crowd to ease

off at the back     to allow the casualties to be evacuated.     It was at one stage whilst

doing this that the advertising hoarding that I was standing on broke and I fell to

the ground.     By this time Officers were in the terracing and were attempting to take

casualties through    the gate and there was clearly insufficient roan for two Officers

with a casualty     to get through the gate.    It was therefore arranged that a channel of

Officers conprising two lines be formed        outside the gates and that Officers would

pass casualties through the gates to the Officers on         the outside where they   could be

further attended to.     I think it was at this stage that I heard a roar      from

supporters who were on the pitch and my inmediate impression was that they were

making their way towards the Notts Forest supporters         in the Spion Kop, however Iwas

not in a position to do anything about this.        It was   sanetime prior to this that I
recall an ambulance, I believe St Johns, had arrived fran the Spion Kop and it was

necessary to clear some of the advertising hoardings in order it could gain access.

In order that casualties be removed as soon as possible from the terracing I

instructed the Officers by loudhailer to bring the casualties to the gate, not to go

through it but to pass the casualty through the gate releasing it to Officers on the

outside; then instructing those Officers to go and get another casualty and then

instructed other Officers to cane forward with a casualty and pass it through the

gates and so on,   I had also directed other Officers who had entered from the rear of

the terracing to evacuate casualties through the central tunnel at the rear.     By this

means the casualties were very quickly cleared fran the area.    Once this was achieved

and the area cleared I saw a crowd barrier that was crumpled and twisted.     (I re­

visited the Stadium on Sunday 16th April and surveyed the terraced area of pen 3.      I

again saw the crumpled and twisted crowd barrier and noted      rust on a stanchion

which was still fixed in the ground and as I recall on one of the poles.     I don't

know whether this was surface rust or otherwise.   I also saw a deflated beachball in

the well of the terracing.)   I arranged that Officers remain to protect the scene.      I

then reflected as to the question of crowd safety of all those supporters in the

ground.   I had been conscious at one stage during the rescue operation of a broadcast

from the public tannoy system I believe requesting supporters not to push in the

central pen but it then struck me that panic or supporters leaving the ground may

result in further problems.   I think it was at this stage and round about 3.30 p.m.

that I instructed P.C. Goodwill of 'FI' who was present in the area of the goal to

accompany me so as to ensure better conmunication with other Senior Officers and

Police Ground Control and that he must never leave me unless it was on my direct

instruction.   Firstly, I requested that he try and get those Officers back into

Serials that were not engaged because throughout the rescue operation and

particularly at this stage I and other Police Officers were subjected to vehement

abuse in the strongest terms from the Liverpool supporters on the pitch who accused

the Police as murderers who had killed Liverpool supporters.    I recall one supporter
with a Merseyside accent saying to me, "You've fucking killed them", and another

 saying, "The fucking police have murdered them".    Others were saying, "The fucking

police and Kelly have done this".     Having made their points they would not go away

and were obstructing me from continuing with my duties.     Many smelled of drink.     I

recall at one stage having to push two or three supporters aside so I could continue

supervising the rescue operation.     Similarly, I had to push press photographers away

who were taking photographs of people trapped against the fencing.     They were

obstructing the rescue operation.     The loudhailer at this point became faultyand P.C.

Goodwill obtained a replacement.


I had been requesting by personal radio that I meet with Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield as I wanted to discuss the situation as far as the rest of the crowd was

concerned.   I was told he was in the club's boardroom and so I set off to meet him

there.   I turned towards the central tunnel and saw that both managers, Dalglish and

Clough had walked onto the pitch and were making their way towards the goal.       I

immediately feared as to what would be the reaction of supporters towards Mr Clough

and that it tobelikely that Mr Dalglish be totally surrounded bv Liverpool supporters.

Therefore I spoke to Messrs Dalglish and Clough and told them that it would be more

appropriate if they left the pitch and could assist by broadcasting over the tannoy

system and asking for calm.   The two managers agreed and I escorted them down the central

tunnel on my way to the boardroom.    Messrs Clough and Dalglish were then escorted to

Police control by other Officers and I went into the boardroom where I was met by

several directors of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.    They asked me if there were

fatalities and I said potentially that may be so, and they said that if there were

fatalities the match should be abandoned with their full support but recognising

that it would be a Police decision.    I then went to the Police Control Box and gave

an update of the situation.   After a short time I returned to the pitch at the West

end where I saw a Police Scenes of Crime photographer in civilian clothes being

attacked by supporters.   I instructed that he be told to put his camera away.
 On looking down the pitch I saw that there was seme disruption in the crowd in the

 uncovered South stand seats at the Spion Kop end, either people were arguing or

 fighting.     I was on my way there when as I passed the central tunnel I heard abuse

being directed into the tunnel by supporters.       I saw Mr Kelly (FA Secretary) was in

 the course of doing a television interview with Desmond Lynam.      It seemed likely that

he may come under physical attack fran the supporters who were blaming him for what

had transpired.      I imnediately shouted fran the entrance to the tunnel that they must

stop the interview and get out of the way around the back.       I then went to the

uncovered seats where I directed that two or three Officers should go into the crowd

and sort the problem out; it was evident that there were sane Liverpool supporters in

there amongst Notts Forest supporters.      To supplement this I broadcasted by loudhailer

to the crowd and asked for calm and their co-operation so that matters be resolved.

The broadcast had the imnediate effect of quietening things down and so I determined

that I would broadcast to the Spion Kop and spectators in the rest of the ground

because I believe at this stage nothing had been said about the match being abandoned

and I had a fear of panic and potential problems resulting fran people leaving the

ground.      I therefore broadcasted to spectators along the Spion Kop and North stand    at

roughly 15     yard intervals to the effect that there had clearly been casualties and

that we were working under extremely difficult circumstances and requesting the co­

operation of spectators to remain where they were.      I also advised that there would

be spectators who would not be able to hear this message clearly because of the

limitations of the loudhailer and requested that supporters who had heard it relay

the message to those behind who would not have heard it.      Every broadcast was

followed by applause both fran Notts Forest supporters in the Spion Kop and Liverpool

supporters     in the North stand.   I recall that in the course of passing this message a

group of supporters on the Spion     Kop were chanting and singing and the rest of the

crowd turned on them and silenced then.      I believe that when I reached the West end

of the North stand the formal announcement was made that the game had been abandoned.

I believe that persons at that stage were advised to leave the ground slowly and not

hurry.

     I then started to receive enquiries about the casualties from Liverpool supporters on

     the pitch and they were directed to an area by the central tunnel where I arranged

     that Officers could attend to their needs.    It was at this stage that I obtained the

     telephone number for the Casualty Enquiry Bureau and informed the Police Ground

     Control.    After that I went to the Leppings Lane end of the ground where I saw

     outside the River gate (Gate C) a number of bodies covered in green sheets and

     liaised with Inspector Sykes.    I ascertained these bodies had been removed from the

     terracing and taken by Officers to the rear of the West stand.


     I then went to Police Ground Control where I liaised with Officers as to the updated

     position.    Following this I went to the North stand where Officers had been gathered

     for de-briefing instructions.


     I then went to the gymnasium which was being used as a temporary mortuary and after

     surveying the scene checked as to the condition of the Officers who were with bodies.

     Some were particularly distraught and I attempted to reassure than.    I then returned

     to the North stand where further liaison took place about de-briefing and then to

     Claywheels Lane to check on the welfare of Officers and to the Sports and Social Club

     at Niagara for the same purpose, where I remained in anticipation of de-briefing.

     Prior to visiting the gymnasium I had been informed that there was a Police Officer

     who had been working in the terracing area who could not be accounted for and I was

     told at the gymnasium that a Police Officer had been taken to hospital.

                                    Briefing Notes


On Friday the 14th April after the main briefing to Inspectors and above held at

Hillsborough I then briefed Inspectors and above whe were to be under my command at

the semi-final match.


I told them that in particular from experience I could forsee two problems arising.

One was the question of supporters from the Leppings Lane terrace being hauled up by

fellow supporters into the West Stand at half time thus creating over capacity in

the West Stand.   The second problem I related was based on experience of the semi­

final match between the same teams last year in that it was quite forseeable that

there would be a large element of Liverpool supporters who by whatsoever means would

be purchasing tickets for the Spion Kop.   This problem had been evident last year

and that cordoning Police Officers had cone under threat to personal safety.      It was

agreed with the Inspectors concerned that we would go to the Spion Kop after my

briefing and examine the area and how it could best be protected, and reserved for
                                                               Si
Liverpool supporters.


I specifically spoke in clear terms about behaviour of Liverpool supporters based on

my previous experience.   I told Officers that in my view generally speaking if

things were going well for Liverpool supporters crowd management should be

reasonably well achieved, however should things in any way not go well them then

they had proved extremely difficult to contain and moods would easily change.      I

related an incident to them which I had witnessed occurring at a Sheffield Wednesday

- Liverpool match during the period of the Coal Industry dispute.     It was at that

time as I recall that the then kop was over capacity with Sheffield Wednesday

supporters and out of necessity some were transferred to a pen on the Leppings Lane

terracing (the Liverpool supporters occupying the West End of the ground including

the terracing).   A pen was left empty between Liverpool supporters and those

Sheffield Wednesday supporters that had been transferred and a line of Officers was

put in the vacant pen between the supporters.   On transferring the Sheffield

Wednesday supporters the Liverpool supporters went wild attempting to scale the

fencing in an attempt to get to the Sheffield Wednesday supporters.    I twos necessary

     for some Officers to draw truncheons to contain the   Liverpool supporters.


     I reminded Officers of the need for extreme care in   searching supporters andto bear

     in mind the dangers of weapons such as Stanley knives, knives   or sharp bladed

     articles which may be retained in a persons pocket.    Officers were also toldof the

     dangers of weakening a police line by taking away supporters either under arrest or

     for the purpose of ejecting them thus reducing the police cover and thereby

 potentially putting their colleagues at greater risk to their personal safety.


 Above all I told the Officers that in my view a successful operation hinged directly

 on the alertness of Constables and that if they were to be seen as not being awake

     to potential problems then supporters would readily take advantage of the situation.

 On conclusion of the briefing I then went to the Spion Kop with Inspectors to

 discuss specific plans in relation to the segregation of Liverpool supporters (of

 whom it may be expected that there would be more than last year) from Nottingham

 Forest supporters on what was an area with a capacity for containing 21,000 people.


 I also reminded Officers that some Liverpool supporters had climbed over the

 Leppings Lane perimeter fence at the end of last years semi final game and that

manpower had been arranged to prevent a repetition (1 also discussed separately with

 Inspector Darling the normal plan to funnel players and officials into the player's

 tunnel at the end of the game).


After the main briefing on Saturday morning I personally briefed the Serials having

duties on the Spion Kop in terms of the plans for the segregation of the Liverpool

supporters and also outlined to them those points that I had discussed on the Friday

as to behaviour of Liverpool supporters, searching, alertness and the undesirability

for arrest/ejection which would weaken a police cordon and thus put their colleagues

at risk.
Chief Inspector Beal, Chief Inspector Creaser and Inspector Calvert, all of whan

have had extensive experience of policing the Hillsborough stadium, were not present

at my briefing on Friday but on Saturday I discussed with than the particular

problems, as outlined previously, I had foreseen as would affect their areas of

responsibility.


At the conclusion of my briefings I confirmed that everyone was familiar with their

allocated duties.

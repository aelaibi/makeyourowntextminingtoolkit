            I reside at the above address with my wife.

            I have been a supporter of Liverpool Football Club for all                          of my life

            and am a season ticket holder for the Hop at Anfield.                         I bought a £6

            terrace    ticket for the West End at Hi ll sb o ro u gh from

            Liverpool            Football Club to                 the Liverpool         v Notts Forest

            Match on Sa tur da y15 April     198^ (150489).
                                                                                 rO UOl

            passengers, Henry BURKEy

            started out at about        1 1am (1100) and did not stop on the way apart

            from a traffic hold up at a traffic             roundabout near Manchester.

            We arrived in Sheffield at about 2pm                (1400)     and parked in a street

            about     10 mins walk from the ground.             We all walked to the ground
                                                                                      PAGE

together and saw about ten Police a good distance from the ground.                           I

did not see any trouble at all, and                it was the normal      crowds before      I

got to the main gate s in Leppings Ln and at this                   point there was a

very    large crow d.     I cannot       remember seeing any vehicles         in this

area.     There was no queues,           just a large mass of people who a p pe ar ed
                                                                   /
to be trying to find where to get                in.     I did not/see any Police in
                                                                  ---------------------
this area.

At this time because we had tickets,                   the three of us,        , :         and

        decided to go^into the ground and we split up from tH ^ r f r y              BURKE

and James SWAI^fE , I did not see Henry Burke again and James Swairie,

un t i1 after the match.        We joined the           rear of the mass of

people,    moved about three yards and             came to a stop because of the

amount of people.        We stayed like this for some time.                I was being

pushed from behind and you could not ge^ out                   if you wanted to.        After

a very long time        I reached the turi\g4fi‘le and was just           pushed through

and I d o n ’t know which one it was,             there was, a male operating        the

turnst i l e .   I did not give up my tick                    could not get my hand in

my pocket to get the ticket              up.    I saw two P o 1 i cemen on horses     further

along from the turnstiles.I              did not see my friends go through the

turnstiles       but we met up just          inside the turnstile.        It was very busy

there but not as bad as outside,               you could breathe alright.

1 then saw the tunnel which leads to the terrace and made for that

with my fr i en ds .     On look ing X °       my right    I saw a large gate open on
                                      ’  /                      *
                                     /
my right and a rush of people come in.                    I saw a few Police    in this

area but no stewards

We cont i nued into the funnel and was                 pushed through until we got to

the end of the tunnel when I was met by a wall                   of people.     The tunnel

was very congested and you could not have turned back if you had

wanted to.       At the end of the tunnel              I moved slightly to my left and

just    into the terrace.       I tried to work my way back and left but
                                                                                                    PAGE      3
                                                                                                    S6Q2

               could not move because of the             crush.     I got very concerned and

               decided to try and get o u t .

               At this    point we were still         together     but from then on I was on my

               own.    Before moving        I helped some      lads who were trapped against a

               b a r r i e r , these were   lads about S O y e a r s .   We    could not move our arms

               but I tried to push my head            into his     chest to ease the pressure on

               his    chest and stomach.         I could see that the           crowd barrier was

               cutting into h i r u y he was not the only one being crushed but you could
                        ----
               only help a few.       I also helped another lad and he climbed over the

               heads of the people to get out and I later saw him ori the pitch.                        The

               lad I had helped off the barrier went to the
                                                         , ground
                                                            .     and 1 did not see

               him again.                                                       1/

               I made rny way to the fence and tried to climb over, after                    several

               attempts    I got over       into the small alley w a v / another         lad caught me

               when    I jumped.     I then went       into the piVe-tt and was completely

               exhausted.      I lay down for a while,            I then got up and started helping

               people who were hurt.            I saw a line of Bobbies on the pitch and went
                                                               —                 ---
               Up to them and told them about the lad who had been injured                     in the

               crowd at the barrier and he said,               “What do you want me to do about            it?"

               I again started h e lpinjT p eo pl e and getting               rid of camera men.    I also

               helped carry people /Off the pitch on hoardings and also W ' l ittle girl

               with a Bobby.        I d i d n ’t know she was dead.
                                                                               /
       «. ^    I carried on helping people for some time arud saw a lot of people who

               were dead.  I think the number of the Bobb/ who carried out the

     yNfi5*^   Eventually I could not do anything more and decided to leave.   Before

               I left    I remember     carrying bodies into the gym and people were

               counting programme money in there,               they were told to stop but just

               carried on laughing.            I was upset and a fellow came up to me and

               asked if he could do anything.               I asked for the use of a phone and
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           S&Q2
rang home   to let   them know 1 was O.K.

After all   this   I walked back through the ground and       out of the ground

into Leppings Ln,    I did not go through the tunnel.

On the way back to the      car people were asking     if I wanted to use the

phone,   they were great.    When   I got to the   car, my friends,           j,

James and          were waiting for me.     I realised that something was

wrong because Henry had not returned to the         car.

A man came out of his house and said we        could ring the emerge ncy

number from his house.       I tried the number    but could not get through,

it was continually engaged.

We then decided to go back to the ground and          look for Henry,    we could

not find him and went back to the same place we had parked outside.

We went back to the ground again and me and James went           in to see   if

we could find Henry.

We could    not find him at the ground and went       to theN ort he rn General

Hospital,   Police   Station and after a while to a boys      club.     Later we

found out what had happened and went home.

At the tivsis I was on the pitch helping     people    I could see people    in

the pen behind the goal being crushed and screaming for he 1 p.            I saw

people being pulled out through the gate onto the pitch and the

police we re he 1 pi ng people over the top.

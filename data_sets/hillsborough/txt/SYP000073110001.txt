                 I bought                a ground      ticket     for    the      Leppings         Lane     t u r n s til/? e n t r a n c e         B at

                 price          of       the   coach was       £9.    I c a n ’t r e a l l y       remember            the     route     we      took

the     coach.        I saw        s o me    f a ns      drinking             from        cans      in S h e f f i e l d          but       they

did     not a p p e a r         drunk.       At a b o u t          midday          (1200         hrs)     the      coach          parked                  on

an     industrial           estate          which        was       about          5 minutes          walk       from         the     ground.

There        were     other        coaches          parked          in the           same        road.      I have           been       shown a

map     of S h e f f i e l d       and      I think           it    could          be a r o u n d W h e e l s          Ln area.                 No

police        got     on    the       coach       to     ch eck         for       drinks         and weapons.                I saw          one

policeman           standing           on the          corner           of W h e e l s       Ln     and    the      A61       who       was

directing           the     coaches          to     t ha t     parking             position.              W h e n we         got     off             the

About        a dozen        fans       were       buying           cans/dnd/yl              later       sat     with         them while

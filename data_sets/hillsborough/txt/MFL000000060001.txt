         The essence of the Interim Report on the tragic events at
 Hil l s b o r o u g h Football Ground on April 15th last, is that "the policing
 of the Semi Final at H i l l s boroug h broke down", and that "the main reason
 for the disaster was the failure of police c o n t r o l " .

      Speaking of the conduct of some 65 police o f f i c e r s ,giving oral
 evidence at the Inquiry, the report says and I quote "that for the most
 part, the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their
 rank", and later "....the senior officers in command were defensive, and
 evasive w i t n e s s e s .... But neither their handling of problems on the day,
 nor their account in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be
 expected of their rank".

          In the final par a g r a p h of the sect i o n of the report dealing with, the
 p o l i c e ,(P a r agraph 285) it says "It is a matter of regret that at the hearing,
 and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared to
 concede t hey wer e in any respect at fault in what occurred".

           It was against this backg r o u n d that the Chief Police Officer,Mr Wright
 took the sensible step of tendering his resignation.              One must assume from
 this that he i ntended to resign.             In the meantime however,Mr Wr i g h t has
 removed v i r t u a l l y every senior officer under his command, and who had any
 c o n n e c t i o n w i t h the tragedy at Hillsborough, into new positions, and some
 of them a w a y from Sheffield.

           R e c e n t l y the most important n e wspaper in South Y o r k s h i r e ,The Sheffield
 S t a r , s a i d in its Editorial of Monday August 7th: "Chief Constable, Peter
 W r i g h t has t e n dered his resignation.        W h e n members of the South Yorkshire
 Police A u t h o r i t y meet on August 14th, the y should accept it".

      I c o m p l e t e l y agree wit h The Star. It is most unfortunate that when
 the committee did meet they decided that Mr Wright should keep his job.

      95 pe o p l e died in horrific circumstances, and hundreds were injured
 and the families of the deceased have s u f fered m i s e r y ,heartbreak, and the
 sense of acute loss.      Mr Wright owes it to them, and to the dead, to resign.

             From Martin Flannery, M.P.           Sheffield, Hillsborough

       If a Prime M i nister,a Comma n d i n g Officer, or the Leader of a
Council had made a mistake involving massive loss of life, it w o u l d
be a c c epted that that person was responsible, and should go.

      All the evidence shows that proper planning for Hillsborough was
complacent and neglectful, and for this Mr Wright must take the blame.
The H i l l s b o r o u g h tragedy need never have occurred if he and the senior
officers involved had plan n e d and carr i e d out their work properly.
The I n t e r i m Report makes this a b s o l u t e l y clear, and it is therefore
incumbent on Mr Wright to resign his p o s t ,regardless of the finding w h i c h
the Police C ommittee came to yesterday.

     This morning, the National B r i t i s h Press w i t h the exception of
one newspaper, made it p lain that they think that Mr Wright should go.

          It w o u l d be helpful if the Police Committee w h i c h took the decision
y e s t e r d a y ,and w hose blind loyalty outran their capacity to think straight,
was to. go also, and that new people and a new Chief Police Officer
u n t a i n t e d by this shameful episode, should take over.

      It w o u l d appear despite their protestations to the c o n t r a r y ,that
the Police Committed and the Chief Police Officer do not really accept
the correctn ess of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report.        If this is so,
w ill t h e y kindly tell us who was responsible?     We can't all wal k away,as
the C h a i r m a n Sir Jack Layden did yesterday, under questioning^ by the press.

     The facts have to be face$, even if the Chief Police Officer and
the Po l i c e Committee will not face them.




                                            Yours sincerely,
                                                         Z zi

     The essence of the Interim Report on the tragic events at
H illsborough Football Ground on April 15th last, is that'the
policing of the Semi Final at H i l l s borough broke down', and that
'the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control'.

         Speaking of the conduct of some 65 police o f f i c e r s ,giving oral
evidence at the Inquiry, the report says and I quote'that for the most
part/ the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their
r a n k ^ ' , and later '....the senior officers in command were d e f e n s i v e ,and
evasive w i t n e s s e s    But neither their handling of'p'orblems on the day,
nor their account in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to toe
expected of their rank'.

       In the final par a g r a p h of the section of the report dealing w ith
the p o l i c e ,(Paragraph 285) it says 'It is a matter of regret that at the
hearin®, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
pr e pared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what o c c u r r e d ' .

          It was against this background that the Chief Police Officer,
Mr Wright ^a^rl-'^Tia:E~~'hg~~iTe-ld himcolf re-sponaibl-e for--all that- had o c c u r - m ^

any c o nnection w i t h the tragedy at Hillsborough,                 into new positions, and
some of t hem away from Sheffield.

        Recently the most important newspaper in South Yorkshire, The
She f f i e l d Star, said in its Editorial of Monday August 7th''Chief Constable
Peter Wright has tendered his resignation. W hen members of the South
Yorkshire Police Authority meet on August 14th, they should accept i t ' .

     I c o mple tely agree w ith The Star, It is most unfortunate that when
the committee did meet they decided that Mr Wright should keep his job.

     95 people died in horrific circumstances, and hundreds were
injured and the families of the deceased have suffered misery, heartbreak,
and the sense of accute loss.

      Mr Wr i g h t owes it to them,    and to the dead^to resign.

     If a Prime Minister, a Commanding Officer, or the Leader of a                          .
Council had made a mistake involving massive loss of life, .it is, yJ&A/A                  &£

         - A H the evidence shows that proper planning for Hillsborough was

H i l l s b o r o u g h tragedy need never have occurred if he and the senior officers
involved had plan n e d an^. carried out their work properly.         The Interim
Report m akes this absolutely clear, and it is therefore            incumbent on
Mr W r i g h t to resign his post, regardless of the finding which the Police
C o m m i t t e e came to yesterday.
This m o r n i n g the >&&trTFe British Press w i t h the exception of
one newspaper, maj£e it plain that they think that Mr Wright
should go.

     It w o u l d be helpful if the Police Committee w h i c h took the
decision yesterday, and whose b lind loyalty outran their
capacity to think straight, was to go also,; and that new people
and a new Chief Police Officer untainted by this shameful episode,
should take over.

Resignation
demanded
D ear Sir,
The essence-of the interim report
on the tragic events at Hillsbor­
ough Football Ground, on 15
April last, is that
the policing of the semi-final at
Hillsborough broke down
and that
the main reason for the disaster was
the failure of police control.
  Speaking of the conduct of
some 65 police officers, the report
says
for the most part, the quality of their
[oral] evidence [to the inquiry] was in
inverse proportion to their rank
and later
the senior, officers in command were
defensive, and evasive witnesses . . .
But neither their handling of problems
on the day, nor their account in evi­
dence showed the qualities of leader­
ship to be expected of their rank.
   It was against this background
that the Chief Constable o f South
Yorkshire, Peter Wright, took the
sensible step o f tendering his res­
ignation. O ne must assume from
this that he intended to resign.
   The Sheffield Star said in its edi­
torial of 7 August:
Chief Constable Peter Wright has ten­
dered his resignation. When members
of the South Yorkshire Police Author­
ity meet, on 14 August, they should ac­
cept it.
It is most unfortunate that, when
the committee did meet, they de­
cided that M r W right should keep
his job.
   It would appear, despite their
protestations to the contrary, that
the Police Committee and the
Chief Constable do not really ac­
cept the correctness o f Lord Jus­
tice Taylor’s interim report. If this
is so, will they tell us who was re­
sponsible? The facts have to be
faced.
Yours sincerely,
M ARTIN FLANNERY

Dear Alan,

        I spoke to Michael Corner on Friday as I had been in
London throughout the wee k and had only just seen Monday
night's Star, w h i c h carried the article by Bob Westerdale
reg a r d i n g the Chief Constable.

       Mich a e l told me that he w ould be a way this week but that
he w o u l d tell you that I was writ i n g a letter for publication
on the question of the Chief Constable's resignation, and that
he w o u l d arrange w ith you that you w o u l d print it.

       The letter is enclosed, and I hope although it is fairly
long, you will print it in its entirety, as it gives the reasons
w h y I have said to The Star previously, that it should be accepted
by the Police C o m m i t t e e ,
                                — but that even if it isn't,Mr Wright should
still resign.

     I hope you will print it immediately today, as it is very
relevant to today's proceedings concerning which I have just
listened to your broadcast  on the Today P r o g r a m m e ,along with
Councillor George.




                                              Best wishes,
                                            Yours sincerely,

The Editor,
Readers Letters,
The Star,

Sheffield.SI.                                      12th August   1989


     In e verything that we say and do c oncerning the appalling
disaster at Hil l s b o r o u g h Football Ground, we should never forget
that we are speaking, or writing, against the background of 95
dead, and hundreds injured, w i t h all the attendant m i s e r y ,heartbreak,
and sense of acute loss, which all the families of the deceased must
have gone through, and still be going through, and will for a
considerable time in the future.

          The fundamental essence of the Interim Report on the Inquiry by
the Right Hon: Lord Justice Taylor, is that on April 1 5 t h , " the
p o l i c i n g of the Semi Final at Hillsborough, broke down", and that
"the m a i n reason for the disaster was the failure of police c o n t r o l ” .

          Sp e a k i n g of the conduct of some 65 police officers, giving oral
e v i d e n c e at the Inquiry, the report says, and I quote 'that for the
most part, the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion
to their rank', and later '....the senior officers in command were
defensive, and evasive w i t n e s s e s ....... But neither their handling
of problems on the day, nor their account in evidence showed the
qualities of leadership to be expected of their rank'.

       In the final p a r a g r a p h of the section of the report dealing
wi t h the p o l i c e ,(Paragraph 285) it says 11It is a matter of regret
that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire
Police were not p r e p a r e d to concede they were in any respect at
fault in what o c c u r r e d " .

       It was against this background that the Chief Police Officer,
Mr W r i g h t stated that he held himself responsible for all that had
occurred, and took the sensible step of tendering his resignation.
One m ust assume from this that he intended to resign, but sections
of the press are acting as though he did not intend to resign. In
the m e a n t i m e however, Mr Wright has removed virtually every senior
offi c e r under his command, and who had any connection with the tragedy
at Hillsborough, into new positions, and some of them away from
Sheffield.

      As soon as the Interim Report came out. Sir Jack Layden,
Chairman of the Police Committee, ru s h e d straight into print to
the effect that Mr Wright should not cease to be the Chief Police
Officer of South Yorkshire.    He was supported in this b y two members
of the Police Committee, a Labour Member, and a Tory Member, who have
not ceased to gain p u blicity claiming immense support for the stand
the y had taken.

          This 'pre-emptive strike', clea r l y intended to sway opinion on
the Police Committee, when even t u a l l y it met to discuss the case,was
most unfortunate.           They should have w a i t e d for the committee to meet,
inst e a d of seeking support for a one sided case.             It was against this
b a c k g r o u n d that I decided to make a statement asking that Mr Wright
should have his resign a t i o n accepted.         This appeared in The Star with
a comment in lurid terms that 1The new call for his head came amid
claims that the u n d e r - f ire-force-boss h a d made hi g h l y placed enemies
in W h i t e h a l l '.

          This claim was under the heading in large b lack print of 'Sack
Chief Constable call by M.P. Martin Flannery', and gave not a wor d of
e x p l a n a t i o n about the statement r e g a r d i n g 'enemies in Whitehall'.

          In public life generally, and indeed, in other aspects of life,
w h e t h e r it be a Prime Minister, a Comm a n d i n g Officer or, for instance
a C hief Police Officer, if a drastic mistake is m a d e ,involving massive
loss of life, it is accepted that the pe r s o n at the helm is responsible.
All the evidence shows that proper p l a n n i n g for Hillsborough was
c o m p l a c e n t and neglectful, and for this Mr Wright must take blame. The
H i l l s b o r o u g h tragedy need never have occurred if he and the senior
officers involved had plan n e d and carr i e d out their work properly. The
I n t e r i m Report, makes this absol u t e l y clear, and it is therefore incumbent
on Mr W r i g h t to resign his post, w h a t e v e r finding the Police Committee
comes to.

          He claimed that he accepted full responsibility.     Let him prove
that b y hono u r a b l y giving up his position, and allowing a new officer,
u n t a i n t e d by this shameful episode, to take over command of the South
Yo r k s h i r e Police.

          The Sheffield Star has u n f o r t u n a t e l y been speaking with two voices
on the question of Mr Wright's resignation.                   It prints articles which
see m to support his conti n u i n g to be Chief Police Officer,but in its
E d i t o r i a l of Monday August 7th 1989, The Star in a separate paragraph
w i t h i n the Editorial says the following:




                                                               con 11

"Chief Constable Peter Wright has t e n d e r e d his resignation.
Whe n members of the South Yorkshire Police A u t hority meet on
August 14th, they should accept it".

     I compl e t e l y agree wit h The Star for the reasons which I
have given a b o v e .

 In everything that we say and do concerning the appalling disaster
 at Hillsborough Football Ground, we should never forget that we
 are speaking or writing,against the background of 95 dead, and
 100's injured, with all the attendant misery,heartbreak,and sense
 of acute loss, which all the families of the deceased must have
 gone through, and still be going through, and will for a considerable
 time in the future.

  The fundamental essence of the Interim Report on the Inquiry by
  the Right Hon: Lord Justice Taylor,is that on April 15th,^ithe
  policing of the Semi Final at Hillsborough, broke down ft and that
^ t h e main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control^

 Speaking of the conduct of some 65 police officers, giving
 oral evidence at the Inquiry, the report says, and I quote 'that
 for the most part, the quality of their e v i d e n c e was in inverse
 proportion to their r a n k 1, and later 1........ the senior officers
 in command were d e f e n s i v e and evas^ive w h i t n e s s e s ........... But
 neither their handling of problems on the day nor their account
 in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be expected of ,

 t h e i r r a n k -'
 in the final paragraph of the section of the report, (Paragraph 285 )
 tfyjaffiepj&Kt- says 11 It is a matter of regret that at the hearing, and
 in their submissions, the South Yorkshire P o lcie were not prepared
 to concede they were in any respect at fault in what o c c u r r e d 11.

 It was against this background that the Chief Police Officer,
 Mr Wright stated- that he held himself responsible for all that
 had occurred, ana took the sensible step of tendering his resignation,
 One must assume from this that he intended to resign, but sections
 of the press, a m i par               f-f-ie-M St-ari? are acting as
 though he did not intend to resign.  In the meantime however,
 Mr Wright, ha£ removed virtually every senior officer under his
 command, and who had any conection with the tragedy at Hillsborough,
 into new positions, and some of them away from Sheffield.

 As soon as the Interim Report came out. Sir Jack Layd«-n, chairman of
 the Police Committee, rushed straight into print to the effect that
 Mr Wright should not cea|e to be the Chief Police Officer of South
 Yorkshire.  He was supported in this by two members of the Police
 Committee,     Labour Member, and a Tory Member, who have not
 ceased to gain p u b l i c i t y MaTJaecsgtai;, claiming immense support for
 the stand they had taken.
        F'                  f
 This •"‘preemptive strike^ clearly intended to sway opinion on the
 Police Committee,, when eventuallyjfme^ to discuss the case, was most
 unfortunate* * f T h e y should have waited for the committee to meet,
 instead of seeking support for a one sided case.         It was against
 this backgro und that I decided to make a statement asking that Mr
 Wright should have his resignation accepted.         This appeared in TheS
 Star with a comment in lurid terms that 'The new call for his head
 came amid claims that the under-fire-force-boss had made highly
 placed enemies in Whitehall'.
                                                                      I               (
 This claim was under the heading in large black print of SackSg Chiet'

 explanation about the statement regarding^enemies in Whitehall.'*
In public life generally, and indeed, in other aspects of life,
whether it be a Prime Minister,a Commanding O f f i c e r , or,for instance
a Chief Police Officer, if a drastic mistake is made; it is accepted
that the person at the helm is responsible* aftd A n the evidence
shows that proper planning for Hillsborough was complacent and
neglectful, and for this Mr Wright must take blame. The Hillsborough
tragedy need never have occurred if he and the senior officers
involved had planned and carried out thS^r work properly, "jE"he
Interim Report, makes this absolutely clear, and it is therefore
incumbent on Mr Wright to resign his post, whatever finding the
Police Committee comes to.. <£TS r    .       r

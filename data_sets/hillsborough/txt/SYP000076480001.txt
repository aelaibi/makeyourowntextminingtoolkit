We a rr iv ed at the              t ur n s t i l e s at about         1450 hours,          my dad who       had a

ticket        for    the seating area             left us and went                 to his turnstiles,

an d    I joined        the    crowd at the            turnstiles.               There were a few          people

queuing at           the front          of the turnstiles               but      due    to the    lay out of the

g r o u n d 7 it caused a f u n n e ll in g             effect,         thus making            it impossible       to

queue        further      back.         It was more a mass               of      people.             and    I were

t ry in g to make           our way to the             turns t i l e s whe n s u d d e n l y the          crowd moved

       w ard and we were               carri ed along with them,                   the    next

thing        I knew was        that      I was    going        thro u g h the          tunnel,    to the    pens,

behind the goals.    I did not hajra my ticket in and I still possess. I

I cannot        really        remember       going      through          gate C as         I was    pushed along

and     i t was n ’t unt i 1 I act ua, 11 y saw t he                    p i t ch thr o ugh t he tunne 1

  iat I realised              I had entered            the ground.

I went        through       the    tunnel,       as    the     crowd was          going    that way.        I got

pushed along            the    tunnel      a nd to the           left    of      it and, ended^uj^*rf        rear of

pen 4.         As    soon as       I ente r e d       the    pen I realised that                 it was    very full

I have        indicated        on the      grid with a figure                    one where       I was    standing.

As     it was       so packed          I d ec i d e d to try and move                  left to get       to the

outer        pens.      Both              and    I tried to move                 left    but    it was    just    like a

brick wall           you couldn't move.                     P r e s s u r e was    being applied          from the

back     continually.              I a c t u a ll y mana g e d       to move           left a bit and forward

due     to the fact           that      people were          still      entering.          It was at this          stage

that     I got       s ep ar a t e d    from my friend,                    »      I have mar k e d on the          grid

with a number             two w here       I ended up.              Wh i l s t    being    pushed forward,          my

body got        turned        round      so that my back was                   facing     the    pitch and       I was

looking at           the west 8'f^and.            I came        to a halt                  had hit a crash

barrier across                 my    l o w a f back.       Pressure        was    still    being applied,

causing       the        barrier        to    push further         into my back,           I just          c o u l d n ’t move

or breath.                                                                                             I

t ried to move myself                      r o L n d s o that I was        f ac: i ng t h e    pitch.          But       it

was a gradual              movement,               I m an ag ed to move          round to        my right and as I

was    doing        this       1 also        got    pushed    right,       by that     I mean         I was moved               to

the    end of the              crash barrier           because w h e n       I had turned myself                    forw a r d

my    right        hip was          caught       on the    edge    of a crash barrier.                     People        from

behind were              still       pushing        and this was making             the    crash barrier                 go

fuller       into my hip.                  A man at my        left hand side saw that                      I was     in

trouble,           he took          hold     of me and       pulled me       towards       him.         The    force          of

him pulling              me,    and     the      release     of the      crush barrier on my hip caused

me    to fall        to my knees              the same man         immediately         pulled me up,                 I knew

then     that       I just          had to get out.              I a g a i n tried, to move             left,       it

was    over        full    but       no t a s/pa e k e d as i t had bee n at               the       r a a r of the           p en,

I m an a g e d      to move          1 & fjc and     reached a fence,             A chap       put his         knee

thro u g h for me              to    cl kub onto       to get      ov/r     the    fence.        I     found it

d if f i c u l t    to    climb over             the fence a«s my left leg was hurting                           but

see    people        going          thro u g h     the gate at       the    front    of the          pen.      I went

down     to the front and was                       helped thro u g h the          gate       by apoliceman,              I

went     onto       the    pitch a n d w a l ke d          round     looking       for               but    I c o u l d n ’t

see    him.        But     I saw my dad              in the N o r t h Stand,         I climbed             into the

stand and went                 to my dad.

After a couple                 of m in u t e s      I went    back      down to the        pitch to try and

find                 I found him              in the middle          of the       pitch.       I then went               back

to N o r th S ta n d           to rny Dad with                     I remained        there until              the

a n no u n c e m e n t was made              stating      that    the    game was     off.           All    three of

us then        left       the       ground at about           16E0 hours.           We wa l k e d       round to find

a phone and e ve nt u a l l y went                    to the      car.

             ~I c^ffi not     r eally      comment   how the s i t u a t i o n was       hand l e d once the     game

              was    sto p p e d as   I was     still    trying      to get     out    onto the     pitch and was

              not    paying a t t e n t i o n   to what was         hap p e n i n g   in general.

              Even    though     I am a sea s o n ticket            holder     I did not qualify        for a ticket

              for    the semi     final.        I thijate' Li ve r poo 1 sh o u l d have been a l l o c a t e d with

              more    tickets.        At        gro und     there was a lack of stewards.                 I also
<%r           think     that \ tfHT police sh o u l d      not have made a cordon across                 the    pitch
aw££S£.
C O M M W T but                have a s s i s t e d more with the            injured.

              I am aware       that a help        line    number      is in existence.

Dear Mr Eastwood

Judicial Review of Police authority Decision Regarding Financial Assistance to
Officers

On Friday 5 February 1999 the South Yorkshire Police Authority resolved that is does not
have the legal power to provide financial assistance to David Duckenfield and Bernard
Murray in relation to their costs and expenses of defending the private prosecutions
brought against them by Ms Ann Adlington.

They also resolved that any previous decision of the Authority, or any officer of the
Authority acting under any previous decision, to make such assistance available is null and
void. The Authority also resolved that they have no legal power to provide financial
assistance to Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray in relation to the costs of any judicial review
proceedings brought by-either of them, whether relating to the decision of the Crown
Prosecution Service not to take over the conduct of the private prosecutions or to any
decision of the Clerk to the Sefton Magistrates Court to challenge the payment of the
officers' costs of proceedings before that Court.

The Chief Constable s legal advice is that the Authority does have such powers and he has
begun proceedings in the High Court to ask for a judicial review of those decisions. The
Chief Constable is asking the High court to deal with his application promptly because of its
impact both upon your client’s particular case and because the matter is of importance
nationally.

Please feel free to use this letter in any manner you think fit.

Yours sincerely

    HILLSBOROUGH: FINANCING OF DEFENCE COSTS - MR D DUCKENFIELD

Having yesterday sought the advice of Leading Counsel following receipt of
representations concerning the financing of your client's defence costs, I will shortly be
asking the Authority to consider the issue of financial assistance, and to review the
decisions taken to date. I will at the same time ask the Authority to give consideration to
your further applications for support.

In these circumstances I have agreed with the Chairman of the Authority that the
presentations by representatives of the defendants and the Hillsborough Family Support
Group, which we had originally planned for Friday 15 January, should now be deferred to
a later date. I apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

In these circumstances, I must draw three further matters to your attention:

1     I am not at this stage in a position to authorise further payments in respect of lega!
costs in relation to your client's defence to the private prosecution.

2    As you are aware, no decision has been taken as                                              to funding any judicial review
proceedings against the Crown Prosecution Service or                                              any proceedings by way of review
or appeal of any future adverse decision as to costs by                                           the Sefton Magistrates Court
Clearly no costs should be incurred in respect of eifhe-                                          of these m atters unless your c?ie~
has other sources of funding.

any contribution which might be required and an analysis of how such a contribution might
impact on his personal financial position. This information must be supplied in advance of
any meeting of the Authority at which the future funding of your client is to be considered.
Please, therefore, treat this as a matter of urgency.

I will correspond with you further as matters develop.

     Dear Sirs

     A D L IN G T O N v D U C K E N F IE L D A N D M U R R A Y

     You wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service on 23 December 199S, follow ing the receipt o f a
     letter from the CPS dated 18 D ecem ber 1998, informing you o f the Service's decision not to
     exercise its pow er under Section 6(2) o f the Prosecution o f O ffences Act 1985 to take over the
     criminal proceedings against your client with a view to discontinuing them.

     You ask for further information; first, for full and detailed reasons for the decision taken;
     secondly, for confirmation that the evidentiary test applied by the CPS in com ing to our
     conclusion w as that set out in our letter to the HFSG o f 27 July 199S; and thirdly, as to the
     w ay in which the Service applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors in deciding whether to
     intervene.

     These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factors that the CPS considers when
     deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request o f a defendant, with a view
     to discontinuance. It may help i f I indicate again in broad terms the approach that the Service
      adopts to these decisions.

      As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general principles applied by the
      Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a prosecution it has taken over: or
      whether to institute proceedings, or to advise the police whether to do so. It is correct that the
      CPS decided in 1997 that the evidence at that time was not sufficient, in its view , to provide a
      realistic prospect o f the conviction o f eithei youi client oi Mi. M unaj foi an% offence.
      However, the decision whether to intervene in a private prosecution with a view to
      terminatine it calls for different considerations to be applied. It is quite possible for a private
      prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the CPS is not satisfied, on the basis o f its own
 assessm ent o f the strength o f the evidence, that the evidence w ould pass the evidential
 sufficiency test in the Code (that there should be a "realistic prospect o f a conviction").

 In broad terms, the reason for this is that Section 6(1) o f the Prosecution o f O ffences Act
 1985, the Act which established the Service's powers and duties, specifically preserved the
 right o f private individuals and prosecuting authorities or bodies other than the CPS to bring
 criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the limitation in
 Section 6(2) that the CPS m ay nevertheless take over the proceedings with a view either to
 conducting or to terminating those proceedings.

Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when deciding
whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the evidential sufficiency test in the
Code when deciding whether there is a case to answer. The S en d ee therefore recognises that
it is not appropriate to intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law C om m ission in its Consultation
Paper N o. 149 "Consents to Prosecution" (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).

The Service’s policy is that it will not take over a private prosecution with a view to
terminating it unless one or more o f the follow ing applies:

(i)     there is clearly no case to answer.      A private prosecution started in these
         circumstances would be unfounded and ought not to be permitted to continue; or

(ii)    the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour
         (exam ples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious; or the offence is
        one for which the defendant should clearly have been cautioned; or where, althoush
        the offence may be serious, the defendant is terminally ill); or

(iii)   the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.

In this case, I took the decision not to intervene. After careful consideration, I concluded in
respect o f the charges o f manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty (which, for
the avoidance o f doubt, were considered against each individual separately) that I could not
say that there is clearly no case to answer. It w as not right, therefore, for the Service to take
over the proceedings with a view to terminating them.

Against that background, and after specifically considering the appropriate course to take in
these circumstances. I concluded further that it would not be right to intervene in respect o f
the one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield.. o f attempting to pervert the course o f
justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case to answer on that charee
alone. The charge o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice is a serious one, particularly
when levelled against som eone who was, at the relevant time, a serving, senior police officer.
Nevertheless, in the context o f the case as a w hole that charge is not the gravamen o f the
criminality alleged against Mr. Duckenfield and I concluded that m y approach to that charae
should be led by my conclusions on the charges o f manslaughter and wilful neslect "to
perform a public duty.

1 also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors that
should lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance, but 1 came to the
conclusion that any public interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly
outweigh those in favour; nor        did I consider     tha, .he prosecution is d early .ikely to damage

the interests o f justice.

 matter, and would be grateful for your advice by return as to when the reasons can be
 expected.

 Yours faithfully

    Dear Mr Enzor

    A d lin g to n -v- D u ck en field and M urray
    L eed s M a g is tr a te s ’ C o u r t - 2 1 D ecem b er 1998

    W e refer to your letter o f 18 Novem ber and note the advice contained therein.

    In regard to the CPS conclusion that “we should nol intervene to take over any o f the
    charges'' w e are bound to say, as per our detailed letter o f subm issions dated 9 October
    1998. that full and detailed reasons for the decision taken are required to be made known in
    this situation and w e reiterate the request for those reasons.

    We ask for confirmation that the evidentiary test applied by the CPS in coming to its
    conclusion was that set out in your letter o f 27 July 1998 to HFSG, specifically “there is
    clearly no case to a n s w e r It may well be implicit that this is the case, but you will
    appreciate the desire for us to clarify the basis for the CPS decision before taking matters
    further.

    Insofar as the letter o f 27 July 1998 maintains that the CPS policy in this case builds on that
    contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, please advise which aspects o f the Code have
    been considered in com ing to the conclusion reached, and the weight given to any such
^   factors.

    You w ill appreciate that as the criminal prosecution is proceeding, w e are bound to take any
    appropriate steps follow ing receipt o f your letter with all due expedition, and accordingly
    would be grateful if you could let us have the advice requested by return. W e are aware o f a
    letter sent by the solicitors to Mr Murray, Walker Morris, on 18 December 1998 and
    notwithstanding any response you may care to give to that correspondence, we would ask
    you to deal specifically with the issues raised in this correspondence.

    YoupsTauhfully

           In early July 1998, you wrote to the Crown Prosecution Sen d ee asking that w e take over, in
           order to discontinue, the criminal proceedings against your client w hich have been brought by
           Ms Ann Adlington on behalf o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

           We have considered this request in detail.

           Mr. Duckenfield faces tw o charges o f manslaughter, one o f wilful neglect to perform a public
           duty and one charge o f attempting to pen'ert the course o f justice. Mr. Murray faces two
           charges o f manslaughter and one o f wilful neglect to perform a public duty.

           W e have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and all the
           surrounding circumstances o f the case. W e have concluded that w e should not inten-ene to
           take over any o f the charges.

           For your information I enclose a copy o f a press notice.

 HILLSBOROUGH CASE - ADLINGTON V DUCKENTIELD, ADLINGTON V
 M URRAY



 In rar!y July 1998, solicitors acting for Chief Superintendent David Godfrey
 DUCKENFIELD, (retired) and Superintendent Bernard Dean MURRAY (retired) asked the
 Crown Prosecution Service to take over and discontinue the proceedings against their clients
 which have been started by Ann Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support
 Group.

After a careful review of all of the evidence, and having taken account of all the
representations made to the CPS by the defendants and the private prosecutor, the CPS has

prosecution will continue.

    Dear Mr Enzor

    A d lin gton -v- D u ck en field and M u rray
#
    Further to your letter o f I Decem ber and the helpful advice contained therein. I write to
    confirm, although I anticipate you will probably already know , that the criminal
    proceedings have been adjourned further to Monday 2 1 D ecem ber 1998, and the
    Defendants are remanded to appear on that date.

    The prosecution has indicated a wish to apply for the issue o f W itness Sum m onses for the
    attention o f Assistant C h ie f Constable Ian Daines. and Former Inspector Henry White in
    regard to documents allegedly in their possession. It is intended that South Yorkshire
    Police will be represented on the 2 Ist to argue as to whether the Sum m ons should be issued.

    The magistrate has also fixed the committal to commence, on a 4 w eek estimate, for 19
    April 1999. I look forward to hearing your further advice regarding the decision to take
    over the criminal proceedings on or before 18 December as previously advised.

    Yours sincerelv

           RE : A D L I N G T O N v. D U C K E N F IE L D A N D M U R R A Y

           I write to inform you that the Crown Prosecution Service has not yet decided whether
           to take over the criminal proceedings instituted your client by Ann Adlington on
           b ehalf o f the H illsborough Family Support Group.

           I regret the delay but I can assure you that everything is being done to deal with the
           matter as quickly as possible. I anticipate that the decision w ill be made and
           com m unicated to the relevant parties on or before 18 D ecem ber 1998.

           The reason for the delay is the need to ensure that appropriate consultation takes
           place.

          Dear Mr Eastwood

         RE: HILLSBOROUGH : A D LIN G TO N v D U C K EN FIELD & M U R R A Y

         As I explained by telephone my report on this case has been sent to the Chief Crown
         Prosecutor for Central Casework prior to being considered at a higher level.

         I am now able to inform you that the new Director o f Public Prosecutions will not be
         involved in decisions over whether the Crown prosecution Service should take over
         proceedings in the Hillsborough matter, because o f his previous personal involvement in the
         case.   The matter w ill, how'ever, be considered at a very senior level in the Crown
         Prosecution Service.

         I regret that I am not able to give you a definite date when our decision will be announce,
         although I am told that it is hoped to make it by 7 Decem ber 1998.

         Yours sincerely

       For the attention o f George R Croston
       Prosecution Team Leader



       Dear Sirs


       Hillsborough: Adlington -v- David Duckenfield & Murray

      u ’t Tf f el ? P^ ’0Uf corTesP °ndence in this matter, in the light o f the requests made on
        e a lf o f the Defendants for the Director o f Public Prosecutions to take over the conduct
      o i proceedings, pursuant to Section 6 o f the Prosecution o f O ffences A ct 1985 and to
      discontinue those proceedings pursuant to Section 23. You have kindly provided copies
      o f the exchange o f correspondence between your office and the H illsborough Fam ily
      bupport Group (H FSG ), and w e refer specifically to your "policy letter" o f 27th July 1998
      outlining the p olicy to be adopted in cases o f this type, i.e., private prosecutions. W e have
      been provided with copies o f the representations made on behalf o f M U R R A Y by M essrs
      Walker M o m s and would adopt those submissions on behalf o f Mr Duckenfield insofar
      as the}’ relate to matters o f relevance to both defendants.

      Introduction


      T h e p o w e r o f t h e Director to intervene under Section 6 o f the Prosecution o f O ffences Act
         6 d is unfettered. It is not limited to a consideration o f the strength or w eight o f the
Q    evidence but embraces a consideration o f the wider public interest in whether a trial ought
w    to take place.


     All the subm issions o f the HFSG have concentrated on a perceived evidential basis for the
     sum m ons currently issued. I f the existence o f a prima facie case were the only basis upon
     which the Director could exercise the power under Section 6 then the effect o f the section
     w ould be largely redundant. I f no evidence existed an information could not be properly
     laid and i f no prima facie case was made out then the magistrates could not com m it for
     trial. Were these the only circumstances in which the power under Section 6 w ould be
     exercised then there would never be any need to exercise the power. It is submitted on
     behalf o f Mr Duckenfield that the power o f the Director is far wider than a mere
     assessment o f the evidence and embraces a consideration o f the wider public interest.

     The Director is well placed to assess where the public interest lies having had involvement
     in the ease over a period o f nine years and having seen the Taylor Report, the Stuart-Smith
     Scrutiny. the coroner s verdict, the judgment o f the Divisional Court and the review o f
    A1 1V1**                                 |j«)(,■!■ i ! • j ,   i i'.‘. v   IIk- linn is a titcmlvi ofEureSeaU
  evidence and the advice o f leading counsel obtained when the Director made the decision not
  to prosecute.


  We understand and sympathise with the sentiments o f the bereaved and injured who feel
  understandably that som eone must be made to pay for the disaster. W e also understand the
   isappointment they feel when at every stage the decisions m ade have been against anv
  recom m en ation for prosecution. It must be recorded that the lives o f everyone involved in
 D u c k e n ft(kl   ^   a^tere<^ ^ a consec3uence o f these terrible events, including that o f Mr


   n e ate o the disaster he had only been in his post o f c h ie f superintendent for 21 days
 an   his w as the first operation o f this type where he had been in comm and. W hile the
 impact of the events on him cannot be compared to the impact on those on the terraces thev
 were nonetheless personally catastrophic.


 Until the disaster he had been a highly successful career policeman with 21 years o f service
 to the com m unity and 3 commendations for good police work. H e has never worked since
 and has had his actions subjected to analysis and examination for a period o f nine years H is
 health has been destroyed and the trauma o f the disaster and the consequential need to assist
 the authorities in the various investigations and inquests has meant that any attempt to start
 a new life has been thwarted.


M any factors com bined to contribute to the disaster as Hillsborough and these have been the
subject o f the m ost exhaustive investigation by Lord Justice Taylor. One o f them -not
mentioned hitherto in the correspondence to the Director, is the construction o f pens on the
terraces with inadequate gates to enable fans to escape in the event o f an em ergency N o-o n e
appreciated at the time the danger these structures presented although as a direct consequence
of this disaster they have been removed from every football stadium in the country'.

We do not intend in this letter to repeat all the points made forcibly by Lord Justice Taylor
in his report nor analyse in detail the scrutiny o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. The Director is
well able to assess each and decide where the public interest lies in this case N on etheless
in view o f the assertion by the HFSG that a clear prima facie case exists, a v ie w w e find
ourselves com pelled to disagree with., and in the light o f a number o f important factual
inaccuracies in their subm issions o f 24 September we feel it necessary to set the record
straight at this stage.

The Stuan-Sm ith Scrutiny


One o f the terms o f reference o f Lord Justice Stuan-Smith was to ascertain whether any
evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium which was not available
to the Director or the Attorney General for the purposes o f discharging their respective
statutory responsibilities and to advise whether any evidence not previously available is o f
such significance as to justify their attention to be drawn to it. There w as none. A s part o f
the Scrutiny. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith read the joint opinion o f counsel dated 6 August 1990
he considered the resume o f evidence and the statement o f law set out therein.           The
conclusion reached was:
         "I do not consider that there is any material which should b e put before the
         Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which
         might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken",
                                                                         (Chapter 7 p 103(5))

It would seem that the subm ission made by H FSG that leading counsel, providing the joint
opinion, w ould have m isapplied the law relating to manslaughter to the facts o f the case
is wrong. (H FSG subm ission 17/8/98 para 14). N o such view was formed by Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith and the Director has available the opinion to assess for h e r self the merits o f
this subm ission advanced b y HFSG.

All the evidence alleged to b e "new" was available to the Scrutiny, it is inaccurate to
suggest to the contrary.


        "South Yorkshire P olice have an extensive archive o f material about the
        H illsborough disaster. There is a substantial storeroom full o f investigation
        files, statements, photographs, videotapes and computer records. T h ey have
        given m e and m y team unrestricted access to their archive for w ork on this
        scrutiny".
                                                                         (Chapter 5 p89(27))

Further Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered the editing o f statements b y M essrs Hammond
Suddards, the fact that the statements had been edited was known by counsel to the Taylor
Inquiry (Andrew Collins QC) and the Treasury Solicitor (Mr Whitehurst). Having
considered the editing exercise Lord Justice Stuart-smith concluded that "for the most part
the suggestions for am endments by the solicitors are not open to criticism". (Chapter 4
p93( 101)) and "I am quite satisfied that the exclusion o f these comm ents could not possibly
have affected the Director". (Chapter 4 p84(105))

It is wrong to allege that "the statements and documents sent to the D P P in 1990 were the
result o f a calculated selection, from which many statements o f central importance were
excluded and w hich included edited statements o f police officers". (H FSG submission
24/9/98 para 11(d))


The conclusion o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was to the opposite effect, furthermore he
investigated allegations o f improper interference with w itnesses m ade by the HFSG
(Chapter 4 p63) and concluded that the allegations were "not substantiated". (p84)

It is also wrong to allege that any evidence exists disclosing "prima facie such a thorough
manipulation o f the evidence to the past benefit o f the defendants and South Yorkshire
Police". Lord Justice Stuart-Smith again arrived at the opposite conclusion,.

Much o f the subm ission made by the HFSG involves an attack on the Stuart-Smith
Scrutiny and the conclusions it reached. It is alleged to be "economical with information",
it is suggested that "caution has to be employed in accepting facts set out in the report" and
that "the conclusions about the edited statements are seriously wrong" (H FSG submission
24/9/98 paras 114 and 112). The Director will be able to form an independent view about
the criticism o f the Scrutiny. What is clearly exercising the m inds o f the HFSG is that if
 the conclusions o f the Scrutiny survive then no new material exists to justify the current
 charges.


W e do not intend to correct each and every factual inaccuracy in the subm ission o f the
H FSG as it is know n that that task is being undertaken by those representing Mr Murray.
W e w ould like to draw the attention o f the Director to one false statement relied upon by
the HFSG , nam ely that Mr Duckenfield m et Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, notwithstanding that
the latter did not see fit to refer to it. This allegation is untrue as the tw o m en have never
met. It follow s that the criticism o f the Scrutiny for not recording the details o f the
m eeting are unfounded. It is also an exam ple o f the w illingness on the part o f the HFSG
to rely upon conjecture as i f it w ere uncontroverted fact.

A nalysis o f n ew evidence


The H FSG concedes that the findings o f the Taylor Inquiry fall short o f those needed to
establish a "prima facie" case.

        "The Taylor findings them selves amount almost to a prima facie case".
                                                        (HFSG subm ission 24/9/98 para 12)

The further evidence relied upon to support the prosecution is analysed in paragraph 17 and
all w as before the Taylor Inquiry including the action o f the p olice in 1988 (Taylor
Chapter 11 para 230). What is o f critical importance is that there is no evidence
whatsoever that Mr Duckenfield w as ever told about the police action the previous year,
or should have been aware o f it.


Reliance is placed upon the editing o f statements for which it is asserted "there can be no
honest reason" (HFSG letter 24/8/98). This allegation is w h o lly inconsistent with the
conclusions o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and cannot survive even a simple exercise o f
analysis.

The editing complained about to the statement o f PC W oodcock excludes material that is
clearly hearsay and relates to a conversation he had with Inspector W hite at the debrief.
Inspector W hite makes no mention o f being given the instruction spoken about and no
other officer at the debrief apparently heard this conversation. In any event, W oodcock’s
reference is not to the diversion o f fans m oving from the concourse to the tunnel, but to
the general dispersal o f fans on the terrace from one pen to another. W e note that not one
o f the deletions identified relates to any admissible evidence probative o f guilt against
either defendant but consist m ainly o f the type o f deletions described by Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith as "quite trivial and o f no consequence whatsoever" (p82 para 99) and were
o f a type which he concluded "were properly excluded".

B y reference to H FSG subm issions (their letter 24 August 1998, subm issions o f counsel
24 September 1998) it is self-evident that the question o f the 1988 events are central to the
submissions made by H FSG as they say that these events "prove foreseeability, which is
o f course critical to civil and criminal allegations o f negligence. They are o f the most
obvious relevance to the manslaughter issue in the prosecution".
  t is suggested by HFSG that the evidence o f police officers concerning 1988 indicates that
 senior officers monitored the pens, a diversion from the central pens took place in 1988, and
 t at there w as a failure to take this "known and obvious precaution" in 1989 resulting in the
   6 deaths. The HFSG suggest that "the South Yorkshire Police claim that the diversion o f
 the oncom ing supporters from the central pens in 1988 w as unknown to senior officers".
   hey fail to refer to the findings o f Lord Justice Taylor and the Coroner (see HFSG annexure
 H - Summary o f variances between findings o f Lord Justice Taylor and summing up o f
 coroner Dr Popper - page 5) that the South Yorkshire Police "claim" w as correct.

The evidence w'hich H FSG says is so important to the present reconsideration adds nothing
to the foreseeability case against the defendant. When view ed against the findings o f both
Lord Justice Taylor and the inquest the evidence referred to by H FSG (the n ew "unrevised
evidence ) cannot assist in any way in establishing that any failure to divert fans from the
central pens sim ply involved a "known and obvious precaution". In the circumstances w e are
bound to submit therefore that m uch o f the submissions made by H FSG , in relation to the
events o f 1988, adds no strength to the case against the defendants and i f HFSG believe that
this issue is at the "heart o f the case", w e say that it must patently fail even on the
prosecution’s ow n assessment.

Evidential Matters


In your policy letter you advise that the Code for Crown Prosecutors (Code), which contains
the principles applicable to CPS review o f criminal proceedings instigated by the Police,
provides the basis for the policy applicable to private prosecutions and as to whether-the
Director w ill intervene.


More specifically, you advise that in regard to the evidential requirement o f the Code a less
stringent standard is to be applied to private prosecutions, to the effect that the case w ill be
taken over and discontinued where there is clearly no case to answer.

B y comparison, when applying the Code to criminal proceedings generally, the evidential test
o f "a realistic prospect o f conviction" is a clearly more onerous standard. The implication is
therefore that in the terms o f the evidential requirements o f a private prosecution, the Director
may allow those proceedings to continue in circumstances where the evidence would not reach
the C ode's standard for a realistic prospect o f conviction.

W e note from the policy letter that "it has been considered that to apply the Code test to
private prosecutions w ould unfairly limit the right o f individuals to bring their ow n cases".
W e take issue with this statement o f policy, and its applicability in the present circumstances.

We accept o f course that the Director is bound to consider, as part o f the review, whether the
evidence is sufficient when considering intervention pursuant to the Prosecution o f O ffences
Act. We are also awrare that in the past the Director has adopted a less stringent test than the
CPS apply when considering whether to intervene under Section 6. Having considered the
observations m ade by the Royal Com m ission on Criminal Procedure ("Phillips C om m ission”)
(C M ND 8092) ( 1981) Para 8:8 and 8:9; and the Law Commission, Criminal Law: Consent
to Prosecution C.P. 149 (Para 6:5-6-17) w e are uncertain as to the justification for the policy
as applied in the past and request clarification accordingly.
 Criminal Law: Consent to Prosecution C.P. 149 (Para 6:5-6-17) w e are uncertain as to the
 justification for the policy as applied in the past and request clarification accordingly.

         The test applied to the Director’s cases ( ie, whether o r not there is a
        reasonable prosp ect o f conviction) should be extended to all cases and
        applied by all w ho make the decisions that bring a case to Court".
                                                               (Phillips Com m ission para 8.9)

In any event applying either test to the relevant material, such as that referred to on page
3 o f the p olicy letter, together with any further material provided by the HFSG, and
additional material m ade available b y the H om e O ffice and any other source, will lead
inescapably to the conclusion that has been previously reached by the Director, to the effect
that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect o f conviction. I f that be the case,
pursuant to the Code, the Director w ill be bound to take over the conduct o f proceedings
and discontinue "no matter how important or serious" the case m ay be.

On the basis that the Director proceeds as indicated in the p o lic y letter and therefore
applies a lesser standard, w e ask the Director to consider the tw o specific questions posed
in the Code as follows:-

1.      Can the evidence be used in Court?

2.      Is the evidence reliable?


W e invite the Director to consider those questions in the specific context o f the 4 charges
against our client as follows:-

1.     Unlawful Killing


       In the broadest sense it is right to say that the question o f unlawful killing, in the
       context o f involuntary manslaughter, requires p roof o f the follow ing:-

       - duty o f care
       - breach o f duty o f care
       - breach causing injury or damage
        - breach o f sufficient gravity, that is grossly negligent, to amount to a criminal
offence.


       At the time o f making these submissions, w e have been served with 3 folders o f
       copy statements and transcripts o f evidence served in support o f the prosecution.



       A bundle o f 35 statements, largely comprising the recollections o f spectators at the
       gam e on 15th April 1989 relate in general to the build up o f the crowd outside the
       ground, access to the ground, and the crush at the Leppings Lane end terrace. 3
       Statements included by P olice Officers do not involve the direct operational
       management within the control box on the day.



                                              6
                                                                                                 20
W e are bound to emphasise that no evidence has been served by the prosecution o f
any person other than the Defendants, that will assist a criminal court in considering
the issue o f the particular duty o f care to be alleged against the Defendants, and as to
whether their conduct amounted to a breach thereof. To be specific, there is no other
evidence, apart from the transcript material, relating to the circumstances and activities
within the control box on 15th April and Mr D ucken field’s role on that day. H FSG
correspondence has pointed to Lord Justice Taylor’s conclusions in regard to the
involvem ent and actions o f certain individuals on that day. H is conclusions were
based upon a mountain o f evidence which it w ould seem is not to be put before the
Court in the context o f the present prosecution. The hearings by their very nature w ill
be com pletely different and the evidence that can be adduced in support o f a private
prosecution for manslaughter w ill be considerably narrower than that heard by Lord
Justice Taylor.


The HFSG , in their most recent subm issions dated 2 October 1998, com m ent on the
 Evidence against Duckenfield on Manslaughter and Misfeasance" purely by reference
to the 1989 Taylor transcript material, which o f course the Director w ill have
considered previously in the context o f the consideration o f w hich charges, i f any,
should have been brought.


On the available evidence submitted in support o f the prosecution, w e therefore urge
the Director to consider that there is a clear paucity o f evidence relating to vital issues
that would need to be proved. A s L.J. Stuart-Smith pointed out in his Scrutiny report
at para. 56:-                                                                         - _


        "Any prosecution o f an individual police officer w ould have to
        establish his individual responsibility. It would not be enough to prove
        the com posite failure o f the police operation."

Notwithstanding the comments made by HFSG (eg see para 15 Subm issions 2 4 .9 .9 8 )
any admissions o f liability by South Yorkshire police in negligence proceedings can
only relate to those proceedings and South Yorkshire police. They can have no force
in relation to the specific actions o f individual officers and charges brought in separate
criminal proceedings.


In terms o f reliability w e must take issue with the observation o f the H FSG (their
letter 27th July 1998) that all the facts are clear and that no-one will have forgotten.
The events in question were obviously traumatic for all concerned, and the passage o f
9 years since those events is a considerable period o f time. B y definition, the
recollection o f any relevant witnesses must be expected to have lessened either because
o f the passage o f time, or indeed the natural mechanism o f avoidance o f the m em ory
o f the horrific events that occurred. In those circumstances, w e suggest the Director
treat with great caution the reliability o f the evidence that is or may be served in
support o f the prosecutions.

N o evidence exists o f the current ability o f witnesses to recall the events and those that
were heard by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith were described by him variously as "vague
and confused" (per Miss Martin), "version changes in various w ays over the years"
(per Paul Taylor) and "unable to accept Mr Holdsworth’s recollection o f events as now
being accurate". There is no reason to suspect that the m em ory o f other w itnesses is
any more reliable than those seen by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

M isfeasance in Public Office.

A s indicated by the subm issions as to issue o f summonses, from the HFSG, the same
facts are to be put forward in support o f the allegations for this offence as for
unlawful killing. The prosecution have referred to the case o f R -v- Dvtham (1979)
69 Cr.App.R. 387 as indicating the relevant standard. Our only observation in regard
to this case in the present context is that it clearly indicates that for culpability to be
established concerning the misconduct o f an officer o f justice, mere misfeasance will
not suffice, but a deliberate failure and w ilful neglect w ill be required. W e raise again
the issues as to what reliable evidence the prosecution intends to adduce to satisfy this
onerous test as indicated by the reliance o f HFSG (subm issions 2/10/98) on alleged
adm issions made by the Defendant in 1989 transcripts which the Director will have
considered previously. From the material w e have been served with so far, w e believe
the evidential test is not satisfied either on the basis o f "a realistic prospect o f
conviction" or in the alternative that there would be "clearly no case to answer",
justifying the Director’s intervention and discontinuance.

Acting with Intent to Pervert the Course o f Justice

A ccording to the HSFG submissions as to issue o f Sum m onses, this relates to the
alleged false and deceitful allegation by Mr Duckenfield that the gates had been
broken by the supporters. It has never been suggested that the words complained o f
were ever uttered by Mr Duckenfield to anyone charged with investigating the disaster.

In terms o f the evidence so far served, w e point out once again that there is no
evidence apart from the transcript o f the Defendants’ ow n evidence, regarding any
such discussion. The H FSG (submissions 2/10/98) have referred to the Taylor
evidence o f the Defendant which the Director is aware of. W e note that further
evidence will be called but emphasise the prosecution have not served statements from
other w itnesses in relation to this charge.

The thrust o f the recent (2/10/98) submissions appears to concern the "transmission"
o f the alleged comment o f the Defendant to parties who were not present at the time
the alleged words were spoken. We are bound to point out that no evidence has been
served to support the contentions made to the effect that the Defendant played any role
in the "transmissions" referred to, or in the alleged "limitation" activity (paras 5-22).
The H FSG ’s critical reference to the Sharpies statements when subject to realistic
appraisal can not be justified. In the context o f this charge, w e submit the true import
o f his recollection is that between 3 and 5 pm on the day o f the event, the question
o f "how" and "why" was not at the forefront o f the minds o f those in the control
room, who were "all deeply shaken" officers endeavouring to carry out their duties.

W e think the argum ent is overw helm ing that proper analysis o f this charge cannot
satisfy either o f the evidential tests that might be applied in this case and accordingly.
 the DPP ought to intervene and discontinue without need to refer to public interest
 issues.

 Public Interest


 W e have noted the exchanges in correspondence between your office and the HFSG
 and for the purpose o f your review would like to point out by reference to the
 individual components set out in 6.4 and 6.5 o f the Code our view s as to the relevance
 or otherwise o f the public interest factors set out therein. W e are o f course mindful
 o f the fact that this exercise is ’’not simply a matter o f adding up the number o f factors
 on each side".




Conviction is likely to result in a significant sentence.

Cases o f manslaughter vary enormously and in many cases a non-custodial sentence
w ill be passed. W e believe in all the circumstances o f this case, the prospect o f a
sentence^ o f immediate imprisonment is remote. The Director w ill be aware that
prosecutions for involuntary manslaughter, such as in the H ouse o f Lords’ leading case
o f R -v- Adom ako, notwithstanding a conviction, the Court im posed a suspended
custodial sentence, as did the Court in the associated Court o f Appeal decision R v
Prentice & Snllman

A weapon was used or violence was threatened.

This is clearly not applicable here.

The offence was committed against a person serving the public.

Once again this is not applicable. It is relevant that the alleged offences occurred
whilst the Defendants were engaged in the conduct o f their public duties.

The Defendant was in a position o f authorin' or trust.

This strictly speaking is true, but the import o f this factor is, w e submit, that authority
or trust has been abused. There is no evidence that w e have seen that suggests that
the Defendant in any way consciously acted so as to abuse the authority or trust placed
in him, and rather to the contrary, acted to the best o f his ability' to discharge his
public duty, in the most difficult o f circumstances.

The evidence shows that Defendants was a ringleader or an organiser o f the offence.
This clearly cannot apply.

There is evidence the offence was premeditated.

The allegations in this case relate to the actions taken by the Defendant, in a life or
death context, without lengthy time for consideration. Judgment was exercised and
      decisions were taken. There can be no element o f pre-meditation in the normal sense
      relevant to a guilty mind.

(g)   There is evidence that the offence was carried out bv a group.

      Whilst the Defendants were working together as part o f an overall police operation,
      w e have not seen any evidence to suggest a conspiracy or joint enterprise to carry out
      a criminal activity.

(h)   The victim o f the offence was vulnerable, had been put in considerable fear, or had
      suffered personal attack, damage or disturbance.

      There can be no doubt that the loss and suffering o f the deceased and others involved
      in the Hillsborough disaster is a terrible tragedy. W e w ould not w ish to diminish that
      in any sense but emphasise that there is no evidence that the Defendant intended to
      place the victim s in this situation. Rather quite the contrary all the actions that were
      taken by the Defendant were taken with a view to m inim ising personal injury and
      suffering.

(i)   The offence was motivated bv any form o f discrimination against the victim s ethnic
      or national origin, sex, religious beliefs, political view s or sexual preference.

      This cannot apply.

(j)   There is a marked difference between the actual or mental ages o f the Defendants and
      the victim or if there is any element o f corruption.

      W hilst strictly speaking true, w e cannot see that this can have any relevance in the
      present circumstances.

(k)   The Defendants previous convictions/cautions are relevant to the present offence.

      Once again, not applicable.

(1)   The Defendant is alleged to have committed the offence whilst under an order o f the
      Court.

      N ot applicable.

(m)   There are grounds for believing that the offence is likelv to be continued or repeated,
      for exam ple, bv a history o f recurring conduct.

      The allegations o f criminal offences arising out o f Hillsborough are o f course in the
      most unusual o f circumstances.       The Defendant has long since retired from
      em ploym ent as a Police Officer, and there is no real possibility o f a recurrence. The
      circumstances, as all the subsequent inquiries have revealed, were unique.




                                             10
                                                                                                  24
 T h e.o ffen ce, although not serious in itself was widespread in the area where it was
 committed.


 The alleged offences o f unlawful killing, in particular, are serious, but occurred in a
 lim ited context in unique circumstances,. This factor is therefore not applicable.

It w ill be seen by reference to the foregoing comment, that the only factor tending to
support a prosecution pursuant to 6.4 o f the Code is the seriousness o f the charges.
It is in that light that w e believe the previous enquiries, reviews and the like that have
been conducted into the events o f Hillsborough are particularly relevant. Previous
correspondence with y ou from ourselves and the Solicitors for Mr Murray highlighted
the outcom e o f those reviews and the consistent conclusion, notwithstanding the real
concerns as to the events o f 15th April 1989, that no good w ill b e served by pursuing
criminal proceedings at this time. W e emphasise that point in the present context.

Further w e offer the follow ing observations with regard to the com m on public interest
factors that may tend against a prosecution, set out in the Code.




The C ourt is likely to impose a very small or nominal penalty.

W e reiterate the comm ents made above in regard to 6.4(a). W e think the likelihood
is, even in the event o f a conviction for unlawful killing that the appropriate sentence
in this case would, effectively, be non-custodial.

The offence w as committed as a result o f a general mistake or misunderstanding fthese
factors must be balanced against the seriousness o f the offenceV

Once again w e emphasise that the allegations in this case concern decisions made
under the pressure o f the moment in the course o f employment, at tim es when serious
injury and death w as threatened. To prove gross negligence manslaughter, the
prosecution has an onerous burden to prove to a high standard that any negligence
ought to be considered criminally culpable. The relevant authorities (see R v
Adom ako (H/Lords), R v H olloway & Others (Court o f Appeal) make it clear that
m itigating circumstances are particularly relevant in this context. Furthermore the
contribution to the disaster o f the unexpected late arrival o f so m any fans, the refusal
by them to heed requests to queue for entrance in an orderly manner and the physical
construction o f pens on the terraces without sufficient gates to permit escape in the
event o f an emergency all contributed in som e way to the disaster.

The loss or harm can be described as minor and was a result o f a single incident
particularly i f it was caused bv misiudgment.

Once again w e would not wish to diminish the suffering caused by the victims, or
others involved in the Hillsborough tragedy. W e would point out. however, that the
case against the Defendant is in essence one o f gross misjudgment on a singular
occasion.
 There has been a long delay between the events taking place and the date o f trial

 The offen ces are serious.
 The delay has been caused in part bv the Defendants.
 The o ffen ce has only recently com e to light.
 The com plexity o f the offence has meant that there has been a long investigation

It is clearly o f great concern that a private prosecution is being com m enced more than
9 years after 15th April 1989. The material w e have been served with in support o f
the prosecution in relation to the transcripts has been available since 1991 at the latest.
The 38 statements served by HFSG in our submission, firstly, do not raise any
substantial n ew matters that could not have been dealt w ith by evidence available
m any years before and secondly, do not go to the heart o f the cases, in respect o f
unlawful killing, neglect o f public duty, and perverting the course o f justice as raised
before in the context o f evidential issues.

O nce again the seriousness o f the offence is relevant, but on balance w e submit this
factor should not outweigh the significance o f the very considerable delay.

A s w e have noted the HSFG are o f the v iew that the recollections o f witnesses will
be accurate notwithstanding the passage o f time. It is interesting to note that in the
context o f the Judicial R eview o f the inquest (which o f course w as a hearing on oath
before a Jury considering issues o f unlawful killing) the D ivisional Court, commenting
on whether an exercise o f discretion to order a fresh inquest w as appropriate,
observed:


       "I have to take an objective view and I have to consider the
       interests o f all concerned, including those o f all the w itnesses
       w ho w ould have to com e along 5 years later and try to cast
       their m inds back to events that they must have been trying to
       forget. Taking that objective view and considering the interests
       o f all concerned. I would in my discretion conclude that this
       w as not a case in which it would be right to order a fresh
       inquest."


       - R v HM Coroner for South Yorkshire Exp Stringer & Ors. 17 BM LR 92 per
       LJ M cCowan.


W e submit similar considerations apply with greater force now that a further 5 years
has elapsed.

A prosecution is likelv to have a verv bad effect on the victim ’s physical and mental
health ahvavs bearing in mind the seriousness o f the offence.

Although som e fam ilies o f the deceased clearly are anxious to pursue a criminal trial
against the defendants others we suspect have been anxious to put these terrible events
behind them and will be distressed to find the facts yet again rehearsed in public and
have the m em ory o f the disaster revisited.
(f)    The Defendant is elderly or is. or was, at the time o f the events suffering from
       significant mental or physical ill health unless the events are serious or there is a real
       possibility that it may be repeated.

       Crown prosecutors must balance the desirability o f diverting a Defendant w h o is
       suffering from significant mental or physical ill health w ith the need to safeguard the
       general public.

       The Defendant retired from the Police Force in 1991 on ill health grounds. W e have
       noted with concern the HFSG comments regarding our client’s health, and advise that
       he continues to experience ill health as a result o f the H illsborough disaster.

(g)    The Defendant has put right the loss or harm that was caused (but the Defendants
       must not avoid prosecution because they can pay compensation').

       This does not apply. It o f course was not within the Defendant’s gift to redress the
       loss and injury suffered by the victims.

(h)    Details may be made public that could harm sources o f information, international
       relations or national security.

       We do not suggest that this factor is applicable.

On an overview basis, therefore, our submission is that the factors contained in 6.5-w h en
applied to the present case against the Defendant, strongly indicate the prosecution should not
proceed in the public interest.

Further, when paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5 are looked at in conjunction, w e believe the public
interest is overwhelm ingly shown to be served in this case by proceedings being discontinued,
as the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those factors tending
in favour.

W e appreciate that such a decision would cause considerable disquiet with the prosecutors,
but with respect, this is not a relevant consideration. The criminal prosecutions arising out
o f Hillsborough are by their very nature unique, relating to specimen charges o f manslaughter,
as w’ell as the lesser offences, in circumstances where 96 people died. It seem s clear that i f
a criminal prosecution were to proceed, such a trial would not take place until m ore than 10
years after the events in question, and it is relevant to point out that any trial subsequent to
April 1999 would take place against the background o f the 10 year anniversary o f events
having recently passed.

We believe that the case for the Director intervening, and discontinuing proceedings pursuant
to the Prosecution o f O ffences Act 1985, is in this case com pelling and that the circumstances
are exceptional, and we urge the Director to so conclude prior to the next hearing o f the
Magistrates Court proceedings at Leeds on 30th October. I f the Director w ishes to clarify any
matters arising out o f this or previous correspondence submitted on behalf o f the Defendant
w e would be grateful o f the opportunity o f confirming same. We are. o f course, aw-are o f the



                                               13

                                                                                                    27
significance o f this decision, and believe it entirely appropriate for the Director for clarify any
outstanding issues or concerns before a final decision is taken.

In view o f the importance o f the decision, w e are o f the v iew the Director is bound to give
full and detailed reasons for the decision taken addressing the issues raised by all the parties.

Accordingly, w e look forward to hearing from you once the review is completed.

Yours faithfully

           Dear Mr Croston

           Adlinyton v Murray Adlington v Duckenfield

           Supplementary Representations on behalf o f the Prosecutor


           1          On 8"’ October 1998 representatives o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group
                      attended the Public R ecord Office at Kew, to search for documents, and to test the
                      various claims o f “public interest immunity”, “legal professional privilege”, and other
                     confidentiality which have been made, notably by the South Yorkshire police, but also
                     by the H om e Office, CPS and W est Midlands police. They there obtained a copy o f
r~
 v        P          the W est Midlands P olice Report o f October 1989, which the H om e Office had placed
                     there at som e time in the past for public inspection.

          2.         The visit had taken place at a late stage o f the review by the Crown Prosecution
                     Service because it w as considered a relatively low priority to incur the costs and time
                     o f travelling to K ew , when the probability was that no relevant material would be
                     found there by reason o f the “public interest immunity” claim. In addition to the
                    report, there is a file o f correspondence to the Taylor Inquiiy from spectators at the
                    disaster, and statements from various police officers, including PC Bichard. The
                    H FSG was denied access to Bichard’s statements in the course o f the “Scrutiny”.
                    There is no indication at all that any o f these persons had consented to their statements
                    being made public, the condition (among others) that South Yorkshire Police imposed
                    for years for disclosing statements.

            3.     It is submitted that the lodging o f those papers in the Public Record Office makes
                   nonsense o f the claims to “public interest immunity" for statements and police reports.

            4     In July 1998, the HFSG asked to see material in the hands o f the Crown Prosecution
                  Service. M r Croston denied them access to it, and the material sought included this
                  report. The report would have given great assistance to the H FSG in compiling its
                  representations; its disclosure has how ever been withheld unjustifiably after it had
                  already been put into the public domain, unknown to the HFSG , causing expense, time
                  and trouble in obtaining it. A detailed submission upon the report is impossible within
                  the time allocated to Mr Croston’s review. Nevertheless, the following matters are
                  clear from a quick reading o f the report.

        The sig nifican ce o f the 19HH match


        5.        At page 17 o f the report, Mr Mervyn Jones asserted that supporters in 1988 “stated"
                  that access to the tunnel was cut o f f H e continued “I f this happened it is not
                  docum ented and was not a decision made by the senior officers present at the 1988
                  Sa™e” [This is o f course similar to the South Yorkshire/Bettison approach; see File o f
                  2 4 h August 1998], “Enquiries have found just one retired officer w h o recalls this
                  happening He. it must be said, is vague in his recollection but the probability is that
                  som e officers acting on their own initiative     [turned spectators away]”.

       6          This demonstrates the vice o f deliberately concealing the material evidence o f White,
                  W oodcock, Lang and Crawford. In any event the retired officer, Higgins, is not
                  vague. He said this in his statement o f 2Bd June 1989:

                          I received instructions to close the gates to the entrance and thereafter direct
                         fans to the outer pens o f the stand I cannot recall where the instruction came
                         form. Under normal circumstances instruction came from a Serial Inspector or
                         via radio from control. I cannot say from which the instruction came.”

       7.        The significance o f this evidence is that “control" used as a matter o f habit to give this
                 instruction, as did an Inspector, no doubt in liaison with each other. This instruction
                 w as given in 1988 when Murray w as in the Control Box. It is to be assumed that the
                 DPP was given the same account in 1990 about the opening o f the gates in 1988, as
                 appears in the Interim Report o f October 1989. If so, he was demonstrably misled.

       The perim eter gate

       8.        The Interim Report speaks at length o f the alleged “forcing” o f the perimeter gate,
                 exaggerating the significance o f the event out o f all proportion. This is an Aunt Sally,
                 rightly rejected as o f no real consequence by Lord Taylor, but raised often by South
                  Y orkshire officers. The purpose o f the suggestion is to imply that the lying assertion
                 made repeatedly by Duckenfield that the fans had broken down the gates might have
                 had som e basis in fact, and been the result o f some confusion. In fact, an unsuccessful
                 attempt had been made to push the gate shut against the oncoming supporters, and the
                 incident did not affect the inrush through Gate C, which, as the defendants themselves

                            to the In te rim Report


                These appendices, which are in the process o f being copied, appear to demonstrate
                that much time w as devoted by police officers (probably both West Midlands and
                South Yorkshire) to collecting statements from officers o f other forces to bolster what
                Lord Taylor derided as the “conspiracy theory" that there w as a plot by ticketiess, late-
                arriving and intoxicated supporters to force an admission into the ground. “Public
                interest immunity has o f course been claimed for police statements, including these

         10.    It is submitted that, because the Interim Report o f the W est Midlands police has been
                placed into the public domain, there can be no justification o f any kind for withholding
                the final report, or the advice o f counsel that was made on the basis o f that report.
                The CPS is asked to produce them.

                Substantial representations have been received from Murray’s lawyers today, and none
 •      "       from Duckenfield’s. It appears from a first reading that Murray’s lawyers have waited
                until effectively the last day o f the review, not just to reply to the material supplied
                recently by the prosecution, but to put forward wider arguments, at a time when a
                considered reply by the prosecutor is not possible.

               The H FSG will be ready to deal with any questions the CPS may have about its
               representations, or the material presented by the defendants, or other concerns.

        n summary o f the evidence on this charge was not attempted in the .substantial
        Representations o f 2 4 Ul Sep;cm her! 998. The evidence o f this chargc against Mr
        Duckenficld is compelling. anu much stronger, i? is submitted, than was presented 10
        the DPP by West Midlands Poiicc in i 990. The liict that previous inquiries were
        seriously misled about this aspcct by Mr Duekcnfield, South Yorkshire and West
        Midlands police, appears from die facts set out below.
tJ




        Lord Tayior found, at p.ige 16t paragraph 98 o f his Interim Report, that Mr
        ^ UCK’ClulCl^         Graham Kelly and Glen Kirton o f the F.A. and Graham Mackrell
        oi Sheffield Wednesday, at a lime when he knew there were fatalities (nnd ihal there
        would therefore be an inquest and no doubt other formal inquiries). Duckcnfifki
        indicated that a gate had been ibrced and there had been an inrush o f .supporters, and
        pointed out to them the gate allegedly lorccd on the screen.

        Kelly gave this cvider.cc on Day 25, page 58 and p 83. Kirton on Day 26. page 5.1
        Kirton s statement makes it clear that deaths had occurred ht ihe time o f ihi.s
        conversation which took piace in tiic Control Box, and that this was obvious Inin', lbc
        C ontrol Hox. Neither was in any doubt about ihe conversation. Mackrel! could not
        remember details o f the conversation at the Taylor Inquiry. (As may be imagined,
        neither Kelly nor Kirton was called at the Inquest.)

       When Mr Dyson for the Football Association put to Duckenlield that he had told thi-,
       lie ( 25" May, p S12). there was a half-hearted admission from Duckenlield. bui a
       denial ol an intention to ueceive, and Mr Duckcnriclv claimed to have been in a “stfite

The w.'tmms o f Assistant Chief Constohle Jackson

14          Further reluctant evidence o f the lies told by Duckenfield comes from Assistant Chiel
            Constable Jackson, who said, when asked about conversations in the presence ol
            Kelly and Makreil, “i have a feeling that somebody mentioned something a mut
            storming the gates”. (30/5/8*, page 7 . 7A-B.). “1 have a feeling it Wits somebody tn t.io
            1Jux that said that. In fact 1 think it may have been Ms l)uckcnfi«ld\ he was ju,.e to
            recall. Jackson said he learned the true facta only from Superintendent Marshali ui
            about 4.15 17 0 ), Until then he believed that the supporters had forecd the gate. (p46>

 ]*>        At the Inquest, although Jackson said that Duckenfteld was "doing a superb j n h \ at
            about 3 .12pm (Day 63, page 14), he repeated that he •thought- it was Duekcntield
            who had told Keiiy that ihe gates liitd been “stormed", adding mysteriously t >at tn a
            way that would be right because I think there were two gates stormed." 1here * no

             die match being conducted by South Yorkshire police, apparently in parallel to the
             similar investigation aiiegediy being conducted by West Midlands police. !i«s

paragraphs 6 and 7, above, that police records o f this Duckenlield-1vdmundson
conversation were not known (o counsel to the Inquiry. In the course ol cross-
examination o f Jackson by Mr Kallipctis, it was suggested that the radio messages
passed to Snig Ilill had not been recorded by police. (30/5/89 pages 50-1) ( Mcf
Inspector Kdmimdson was not called before the Taylor Inquiry, ami not ad led iti the
inquest. Kdmundson has made several unsworn statements to the South Yorkshire
poiicc-. disclosed to us this year, but none, so h r as is known, to the West Midlands
police. The Master Witness List records that a statement or statements ol Rdmundson
appeared al pages 2600-2605 in the midst o f a succession of statements including
(ioJdard, Bichard. Ryan, Sanderson and Jackson.

A one-page unsworn South Yorkshire statement by lidmuudson o f 18'" May 1980,
made a.s i ,ord Taylor was hearing the evidence, purported to produce “an extract of
the Racai tape recording o f the vadio transmissions to and from his control roonv
There was no exhibit or exhibit reference attached to tiic statement, lidmundson s
undated three-page “Amended Report* has no re.icrcneeto the tape at ah. 1here is no
indication at all that the Taylor Inquiry wits given the tape. The information available
to the prosecution suggests that it was not sent to.the DPP. At no stage in any ol his
statements did I&mundsor. record that he passed on to the Fire and Ambulance
services the allegation that supporters had broken down gates, although he says in lus
statement o f 14'"’ June that he passed on a’message" to the Fire Service. It is only on
reading die record produced by the Fire Scrvicc that it becomes obvious that
Fidmundson passed on the taise information at 15.14pm.

None o f the statements o f South Yorkshire police in April and May 19K9 dealt with
the Duefcenficld lies. Richard, who apparently made the call to hdniundson. did not
deal witii them in his eleven-page unsworn South Yorkshire statement of 3,d May
 1995. nor in his two-page West Midianus statement oi II'1' May. 1lowcver. Bichard
gave a three-page statement to West Midlands police on 9* January 1990, agreeing in
pari with the Kelly/Kirton account, but suggesting that Uuckenticld had been
innocently referring to the earlier opening o f Gate C to eject a fan. U is not clear
which o f Bichard's statements were sent to the Director, hut they occupy ele ven pages
 in the Master Witness List, the same length as the statement of?" 1May 1980

 Jackson’s nine-page unsworn South Yorkshire statement, also o f 3rd May 1989. failed
 io meuliou the lie at a!!. In marked contrast to his evider.ee to Tnylor. 27 days later, he
 said merely, "he [Duckcnfieid] was unable to say what happened at that stnge and 1
 recollect that the gome had been stopped.” Jackson’s statement or statements in the
 Master Witness List occupy Lea pages and. in spite o f his evidence to Tayior. he was
 not asked to make a West Midlands statement.

Murray made an unsworn South Yorkshire statement. again on 3rJ May 1989. In his
evidence to ihe Taylor Inquiry, he said he had been in the Control Room when the
first call was made to the ambulances. (31* May, page 101 A) This was almost
certainly not the call that referred to the gates being broken. Although Murray was
apparently out o f the Control Room when the emergency call was made to
Kdmundson. he was in the Control Room for much o f the period between 3 05 and
A. 15 pm, and told the Taylor Inquiry specifically that he went back at 3.30 pm to find
Duckenfield and Jackson there (I M F -105A). He too lailed to mention in his statement
that there had been talk o f Ihe supporters breaking down the gates, an allegation that
was known by then to Duckenfieid, Jackson, scniui members o f both football clubs.
 Fire and Ambulance services, the BBC, untold numbers o f television view ua. in t«».

Neither Ryar. (seven-page unsworn South Yorkshire statement o f 5/5/89 anti 2 page
unsworn South Yorkshire statement o f 19/5/89.! nor Goddard (12 page unsworn South
Yorkshire statement 5/5/89) mentions the lies ai all. Neither appears lo have been
questioned about them by West Midlands police. Ryan's statement or statemenl.v
occupy 8 pages in the Master Witness 1-ist; Goddard s 12.

A sinking aspect o f the evidence o f the South Yorkshire police officers on this
question is how late their statements are dated. Few contemporaneous notes are
referred to, and no witness or other statements were produced until nearly three weeks
alter the disaster from those senior end Control Box officers most closely involved. In
early May, ofcour.sc, over a hundred junior officers had provided original unsworn
statements, and were also signing secondary versions, edited for them by the same
interna! South Yorkshire inquiry which was no doubt taking a close interest in the
statements o f senior officers. It is impossible to accept that these crucial witnesses
hud not committed some rcenllcetions to paper beforehand, which have not been
supplied to the prosecution.

The statements o f James Sharpies, Chief Constable o f the Merseyside Police (Annex
{ ' o f the files o f 24A September 1998), show none o f the retiecnce in dealing with the
.subject oi Duckeiifield’s earliest assertions about the gates as had characterised the
first South Yorkshire statements, Sharpies was able, nearly a year later, to remember
that Duckenlicld’s account to Jackson after 4 pm, which he heard amidst the calm
control and professionalism o f which he spoke so highly, was obviously the first
 reference to the circumstances in which the gates were opened. No-one, he said,
 referred to any “storming" by fans o f gates.

 strategically inserted between the statements o f the principal suspects, Duckenfidd
 and Murray, in Part V o f the papers which the West Midlands Police sent to the DPI’
 in A p r i l 1990. The statement is, o f course, at obvious variance with the facts.
The West Midlands Police Report

2x      I nc ropuri o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smiih's “Scrutiny* suggests to ihc prosecution that
       ihc DIM* may not have considered in 1990 the question o f a charge o f attempting to
       pervert the course o f justice. Jt is thought likely (hat (he West Midland:; Police Report
       would have dealt with the Duckcufield lie by saying that the evidence oi Kelly and
       Kirton had to he looked at again in the light o f the further statements ol Richard and
       particularly Sharpies. It is considered unlikely that the report will have highlighted the
       laci that the Fire Brigade, Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday representatives, the
       fiiiC and television viewers, were all misled.

C'oniliision

29     The true position, it is submitted, is that the Duckenficki lie was repealed to a number
       o f persons, carefully and deliberately, by him, or by others with his encouragement
       for about an hour as the known numbers o f the dead mounted, for the purposes o f
       misleading an inquest and other legal investigations At various limes afterwards, the
       He was sfiil used on occasions, or hinted at, or used us confuse. The evidence against
       him is -strong, and its strength was apparently concealed from the DPI*. Taylor and the
       Coroner (who scarcely inquired into this aspect at all). The original lie retains some
       potency to this day. It is still believed by many people.

M)     Tiic wider significance o f these ninUcrs in relation to ihe integrity o f the investigations
       by South Yorkshire and West Midlands police, and to sonic 6 f the individuals
       discussed above, is obvious. It remains under active study, and will be ihe subject o f
       separate consideration by the HFSG. O f course, these matters further aggravate the
       concerns that the South Yorkshire police ought nol lo be holding «11 the papers.

               Evidence against Duckanfieid on Manslaughter attu Misfeasance

>1     No doubt the main features o f this are familiar, bat it may be helpful to make
       references in outline to some admissions relied on by the prosecution in evidence to
       the Taylor Inquiry.

       Dueken Reid’does not dispute that he looked round the ground on Is1 April 1980
       (Taylor Inquiry, 24/5 p 116) in preparation for the match. He does not dispute that he
       appreciated the problems o f tunnel and pens. Me was aware o f the ccninil tunnel, (p
        118)

        lie accepted that fans were likely to gravitate towards the central tunnel, if they liked
        io wuich ihe game from the buck o f the goal (24/5/89, p 1 J<i). and that the obvious
        way to ihc terracing was through the tunnel; anyone coming in would gravitate
        towards the tunnel, whether or not he wanted to go dirc-elly behind the go;;!..

        DuckcnHeld’s defence, at first, was that crowd management and filling o f pens was
        uut a policc responsibility but that of the club (120). hut later he said he did appreciate




                                                                                                       37
ihc importance o f ensuring that there was no overcrowding in the pens. <124B). Me
said that officers al the back, that is, in the concourse behind the tunnel, should know
the problems. Inspector White [see Representations ol 24|,‘' .A.ugust! knew the location
(127). Duckenfield’s own document emphasised that "our job is to ensure ihc saiety ol
spectators" (137)

Ouckenfield noticed by 2.30 that there was a concentration in pons 3 and 4 and asked
the spectators to move forward and spread along the terraces. (25/5 page 1213). In
pcrfomiing his duties, he was acting on the “advice" o f Superintendent Murray (28 A l
About 2.44 pm it was becoming clear trial they were not going            “sc crowd in
by 3 pm (33A-B). Duckenfield appreciated tiuit opening galea was “likely to cause
pojemiul problems inside" (page 39).

Ducker.ijeld conceded that when the second reuucst came to open the gates, that was
Inc lime when he thought about where they would go. (4 I B ). There was ol course
five minute between the first request and the command to open the gates lie knew
that it i k k pretty crowded in centra! sections; and that the tunnel gave on to thus'.' the
central .sections; that they would want to get to positions as quickly possih!c" and
that they would taka the obvious, cosiest route to terraces. (J5‘h May, p 4s(.i-H). lie
j: ;f fj(>t then think o f the tunnel. He might then h aw given instructions to close the
lutiml, but kc did not because he did not think o f the risk. (It is submitted that this
passage comes close to the slate of mind amounting to recklessness in the old
Caldweii/Lawrencc definition, sufficient in itself to satisfy the mens rea o f involuntary
manslaughter before the decision in Adomako.).

allowing people into the ground would have." (47F-I •) "T here was a possibility' ol
overcrowding everywhere.” (52G)

Duckcnfteki accepted that “I made a mistake but in fact other officers should have
remedied (hat mistake by using their initiative" (92B). Me would have cxpectcd that
an inspector or individual officers would have raced to the tunnel and taken action.
(1>3H). (O f course, oniy liiose in the Control Box had sight o f all relevant parts oJ that
end o f the ground and the area behind the lumstiiesj.

 On 26lh Mav 1989, Duckcnfield acceptcd that it was important to wart; police officers

 the rcsponsibi i ity o f trying to contact I ock o f Shcfr*c!d W ednesday. (page 10-11) Vie
 also told Lord Taylor that he knew when Gate A opened that u serial o' officers

 evidence shows forethought about the consequences o f opening the gates, and made

ii is submitted that Murray's account at paye 931 i is almost an admission to
Caldwell/Lawrence recklessness, tie admitted at H, “When I saw the gates opened 1
wils obviously looking in that {pens 3 and 4] direction". It was put to him thai the
obvious placc to tor them to go was down the tunnel;

        “it is now that I know. I know the ground. 1 know where the tunnel is. I know
       where C gate is. I had never drawn any -sort o! realisation that people uoininu
       through C gate would go towards the tunnel, or whatever.! have never
       envisaged C gate as an entry gate o f course, but the two tilings did not register,
       did not tie up. It seemed so obvious after the event hut certainly 1 gave it mi
       thought and no realisation before."

in cross-examination. Murray emphasised fhm he thought that fans could move from
pen to pen. However, he conceded that pens 3 and 4 tilled up hrst because they were
popular; and they tended to fill up to the back i 11SD-F)

it is submitted that this fact makes his assertions that supnoflcrs could walk through
the gates between the pens meaningless and irrelevant, when thousands were pouring
through gates that had been opeucd to relieve n terrible and constantly intensifying
crush. Murray conceded to Mr Woodward, for South Yorkshire police, that at 2.46.
according to photographs, the terraces looked “pretty full’ . (I'6/84/, page 3)

In answer to questions from !x»rd Taylor, Murray seemed to acknowledge that ii had
been an opium for the police to    up the pens in juries at the match (17)

As the lnque.su Murray accepted that he had full authority to lake steps to avoid the
risk lo occupants o f the ground as a result o f opening the gales, IukI he recognised
such a risk. (Day 67. page 3 i B-C'j. He would not have hcc;'. dependent on
Uuckenfield’s authorisation for any such steps.

Murray accepted at page 431) that the police “had a role (o play as regards the
distribution o f spectators across the Lsppir^s Lane teiiac.cs." Sec also 45A. At page
48C, he accepted that the police had a duty to monitor the build-up and filling oi the
terraces before kiek*up. At page 56B-D, he accept-u thai "there may well haw come a
time when it was necessary " for him to divert supporters from (he central pens. {It is
the prosecution case that he should have put in hand this diversion in any event,
hcca-j.se the outer pens were sparely occupied).

ik- accepted that ifit had beer, brought lo his nutrition that the central pens were full,
and there was space in the side pens, he would have taken some action. 5RD-L. It is
the prosecution case that that f:\ct was abundantly clear to anyone who looked

ivjun'uy accepted that he could have got manpower to block the. tunnel in the five
miiutes that Duckcnficld was considering the request Hiaf the gates be opened. (771)
and 78AJ. He knew' that the tunnel was in that part of ihe coneoursc. (page K(>('-87ki
55      M is submitted that ones it is shown by photoeraohs. s'idco recording find television
        film ilia; the pens were effectively full, or even n e a rly lull, at the time the gates were
        open, ihc eases against both Murray and Duckenfidd becomes very powerhil 1 lie
        suite ol the pens was dearly visible from the Control Bi>x and on the cameras,
        equipped with “zoom" facilities, in that Hox.

5()     The nature o f the relationship between Murray and Duckcn field is not manifest from
        the evidence, hat it may be inferred that there was a; least coolness between them.
        Duckeiifieid was entitled to look to Murray for advice and support. Duckcufidd had
        been promoted to a higher rank .than Murray very recently. Murray was three years
        older, and more experienced at policing o f this kind. The question hy Murray, “Arc
        you going to open the Gates. Mr Duckenfield?" does not show a warm or co­
        operative relationship.

         It is submitted that the Policc Complaint Authority rightly recognised that the charge
         o! iicglcct was “joint”. The reckless or grossly nrgiigenr decision to open the gates
         without ciosing. o ff the pens was the responsibility o f both defendants.

5H      The evidence becoming available, and previously concealed, about practices in 1988,
        add:; lo the weight o f the evidence. It suggests that other evidence exists, proving
         further the clement o f foreseeability. However, even without that new 19KK evidence,
        and irrespective o f the belief that the South Yorkshire Police is guarding much more
        evidence showing gross ncgiigenee. it is submitted tiul there is powerful'cvidencc
        against both defendants.

50      ?! is no t proposed lo set out further evidence, given by other police officers, about tlie
         conduct o f the two defendants. The prosecution may call .some o f them, as they think
         appropriate after a review o f the Sheffield archive, on.ee it becomes available.

                Public interest and “interests of justice" factors arc Jtviewsd below. I hc matters
                raised by the defendants win probably form the basis of an application thai the case be
               stayed, or nat aoanutted, because ihc prosecution, it will be said, is engaged in
               abusing the process of the court. If the defendants do not far tactical reasons present

               magistrates' court of its own motion, and may invite the court, if it wjsbes, to bear
               evidcncc on the subject.


               it is submitted that, except in the very plainest of cases, it would be a misuse of the
               discretion given to the Crown Prosecuuou Service to take over a ptostcmion such a<>

               this for the purposes of discontinuing it. Arguments about “abuse of process* involve
               questions of factand evidence. Matters such as the effect o f press publicity and
                                                           •         : **' ‘

               should be balanced and weighed in determining whether to stay a ease, and they

              Previous inquiries: the.relevance o f the 1*98 Home Office disclosure o f evidence.



               There have been a number of inquiries: by Lord Justice Taylor; ihc Director of Public
               Prosecutions; the Coroner; the Police Complaints Authority; and a “Scrutiny* by t./OTd
               Justice Stuart-Smith. 'Ike West Midlands police collected evidence for the first four of
               these, and appear also to have conducted a separate private inquiry Eoc the South
               Yorkshire police, which may be alleged to provide the justification for the cxclasrvc
               control of South Yorkshire police over most of the documentation in this case.


               The defendants ask why another, criminal, trial of these events should take place, and.
               in ihe light of those earlier inquiries and their findings, they ask tiic IMrceuw «>CPublic

                 "The immediate cause of the disaster was a senior officer's decision to open
                 the outer gate without cuttin8 O.Tacccss to the pens. U t ilit y for d,c deaths
                 and injuries of those spectators has been admitted by the three defendunts, the
                 first of Whom is Uie Plaintiff’s Chief Constallc.’


 If>    The sbuementt o f the 35 spectator witnesses which have been served on the defence
        and DPP prove this n e g lig e e , taken together with the transcripts otevidencc give.,
        by Ihe two defendants to Ihc Taylor Inquiry and the inquest. ITic stalcmenls should be

Some fcaturex o fth e evid&rce already served.



i7     Seme conspicuous features or the 35 witnesses are ss folicws. with a few references.
       In '988 Police officers diverted spectators away ftom the tunnel leading to those pens. '
       (eg Hilion, page 5). Tbc unedited statements of White and Lang, submitted on 24" •
       August, prove the same, and suggest that it had been the practice of senior officers to
       ensure that the tunnel was closed when the pens were‘fill], something that could be
       seen easily by White from the steps near the Control Box. This police evrdcncc wte
       suppressed until 1998.      In 1989, when the gate wus opened, a rush of people carried
       spectators straight into the tunnel, and it was impossible to turn buck (C*o«k).
    tH     Ihere was 110 obvious alternative lo the tunnel (Harvey, Murray. Fcllowcs, Southern.)
           rhcrc was no diversion away from ihis tunnel (Odger, Murphy, Langley). Spectators
          had to go with the crowd, for fear of felling underfoot. (Kdwards). Spectators were
          earned by the surge of people into.thc tunnel When Gate C was opened. (Anderson,
          Bums, Campbell.) The central pens in the terraccs were packed at ?..50 pm (Blayncy.
          Mullce). 1 C Guest said tiiat at 2.40 it was uol goiag to be possible to accommodate
          Uic crowd outside the Loppings Lane entrance in Ihosc pens. (Sec file of 24* August
          1998.) P.C.. Walpole (see Annex £), produced below) says the overcrowding was
          obvious a1 2.55pm. P.C Brooks says the central pens were loo lull at 2.50pm. (See
          Annux ])>



•         ,)uckwnfldd and Murray were in tl* Control Box.;They could sec il>c central pens.
         Cfused circuit television gave ifaem an even better view o f the pens, live minutes
         after Superintendent Marshall had asked for help to relieve possibly life-threatening
         pressure al the turnstiles in Leppings Lane, Duekcnlield, with the acquiescence and
         Utcii support of Murray, finally ordered the gate to be opened without closing off
         access to tiic already crowded pens. Thousands surged in: the deaths of 96 people
         were the immediate and direct consequence. Murray had been on duly at the semi­
         final in 1088 in the Comrol Box. He culpably failed in I9&9 to give the proper and •'
         obvious advicc. Ducken&eld, in Lord Taylor’s words, ‘froze*. Both defendants admit
         their presence in the Control Box, and Duckenfield admits that he lied about matters

20       The CC.TV fi Im, and footage hdd by tfac BBC, photographs and oilier vid«» of the
         circumstances, disclose, full pens before the gate was opened, and a homfymg and
         obvious overcrowding after the gates opened. Most of this evidence is in the hands
         of tbc South Yorkshire police. The HKSG, and IcaJing counsel, have seen some of the
         video evidence.

^          Jf has been an important part o f the prosecution’s approach to the Director's current
           review, and of our justification For bringing criminal proceedings in 1998, that the
           i HS(i has been deprived o f critical' information, statements and documents about the
           disaster for nine years. At the Taylor Inquiry in 1^0,-a policy appears to have been
           followed or providing copies of the statement of an individual survivor or spectator in
           the lawyers acting for him. Anachcdas Armor C is a letter orM iss K.M. Steel, a

          solicitor tor the 'Hillsborough Steering Committee" (now defunct), which records this
          p.uctke. 1hat practice was abandoned during or otter the Taylor Inquiry, and certainly *
          b> the lime the Director ofl'ubiic Prosccuiions became involved fotniuHy in Augml

®         11 wi,! b* not2tJ ‘Hat Miss* Steel did not say that these statements became generally
          available to the families collectively: only, in caeh case, to a particular solicitor. The
          extent t?» which these statements were distributed is unclear. Few have remained
          available to the HKSG.


2X        It appears (rum the Stuart-Smith report that police statements (and, perhaps, others)
          were distributed to this press. (See Report. Appendix 8. page 2 1>). (Where edited
          surtcments had been made, it was of course the policy of South Yorkshire police to
          distribute these, rather lhan the originals.) However, after the end of the Taylor

alleged by the HFSG, and which had given rise to the -Scrutiny- in the tlrst place.

    The edited South rorkskire police statements



    &     On 24"' August 1998 statements were sent by the WSG to the CVS demonstrating the
          practice of editing, by which, it was submitted, the DPP and counsel had been misled

          iU ‘m    (SCC » * * * 1 to IV * * * « e submitted on that day.) Further example, (**
          «((.ichcd new file ArMsxJb have been selected which show again, strikingly, the
          iwclicc or deleting factual matters, which office* had originally asserted in writing.
          and which were prejudicial to South Yorkshire ofliccn. The* exam ples provide
         further evidence that Lord Justice Sluari-Smitlu aJao. was misled on this subject in the
^        course of his "Scrutiny".



          There arc dozens o f other instances of editing, of varying degrees o f culpability.
         extending, in total and nature, far beyond the cases set out in the report o f l^ r d Justice

         Siuart-Smith. U nfortunately, some ofth ese statements have still not been supplied, as
         is apparent from, for example, the Master Witness List, and the exercise ofexammmg
         than us therefore incomplete. Two conspicuous missing statements are those nr Hoke
         and .Sykes. 'I'he task o f comparing those .edited and unedited statements;

         comprehensively is vast. .The time spent on the exercise must have already have
         exccx-dol substantially the time available to Lord Justice Stuan-Smiih or ihc people on
         whom he relied in 1997.


£        I he HFSG has little doubt that the statements provided by South Yorkshire police
        officers. where there were two versions, were the edited ones. It was pointed out in
        the teller o f 24thAugust 1998 that the page numbers on the index in the Master
        Witness List o f April 1990, prepared by the West Midlands poliec for presentation to
        the DPJ», indicated this. The statements referred to in that list formed the busia of the
        ^ 0X1 Midlands Police Report. An example was shown of an edited statement being
        one page shorter than the pages set out in the index to that list. The extra page was
        probably u Criminal Justice Act statement, attesting to the truih of the attached

         The materia] which ThcHFSG has now supplied demonstrates by itself that ;i polity

         issue of negligence, from Lord Justice Taylor irj 1989 {so fur as ihey were able), the
         Erector in 1990, the Coroner between 1989 and m i . and, presumably, the Police

      Sharp/vs statement



40       ITic policy o f editing statements is to be contrasted not only with the South Yorkshire
        statements setting out ad nauseam prejudicial comment about Liverpool supporters, but
        n lso   with the statement or James Sharpies,     now   Chief Constable of the Merseyside
        Police. It is dated 20“ March 1990. and it attaches a computer prinl-oul o f some earlier
        assertions and other/v™>ev                       HFSG did not know that Sharpies bud even
        been a witness to the disaster until after disclosure of the Master Witness List. A copy ’
        of his statement was obtained from the Merscysidt police. It will be holed that large
        tracts of both statements are expressions of hearsay, impression, comrnendation and
        eommem, none o f which has been excised.


41       I he author o f the statement is a friend of Assistant Chief Constable Jackson. Sharpies
        bestows lavish praise on the senior officers of Sourb Yorkshire, llis account provides a
        sharp contrast with the edited statements of junior South Yorfcsdure police officers, whose
        criticisms o f their senior officers were painstakingly excised. In the Muster Witness List,
        Pan V is composed for the most part of police officers. The first entry is the statement
        o f Duckcnfield (pages 2457-2469); the second is 18 pages or statements by Sharpies
        (2458-2375); the third is by the defendant Murray (2470-248X). No editing o f Sharpies
        has taken place. It is to be inferred that a deliberate decision was made to place his

              tillable, only 7 were i,n the Master Witness list, 8 were cullcd at the inquest, and 2 were
           titl led at the Taylor Inquiry.


     50     / he breakdown o f the provisional committal bundle is as follows. Of the 35 \spcctatnr”
           wimcN.'ies.



                   only Thomas Hilton and Peter Darcy gave oral evidence u> Ac Taylor enquiry;

                                             and                    are on the Master Witness List;

                  Stephanie Jones. Colin Henley, Frederick Maddox, and ICarl Mullee gave
                  evidence to the inquest.


51
          1 here arc about 571 statements in the Master Witness Li.ni. Lord Justice Stuart-,Smith
          records- that 5.776 statements were taken by the West Midlands Police. Some hundreds
          were uiken by South Yorkshire police officers. Ihe Police Complaint* Authority records
          (■produced below) tell us thaL 5341 statements were taken in the •overall investigation".
          It follows therefore that the Director had access to about 12% o f the total statements
          generated in the enqvury. (Very few appear to have been made after August 1990).
          Obviously, many o f these would have been irrelevant or oflittle rclcvnnce to the question

          of criminal liability, but Dot, surely, 88% of them. How were the 571 selected?

    60     li is now apparent that throughout all the enquiries in this ease, the South Yorkshire
           police has had access to all or most infonnaiion obtained by West Midlands, bul that the
           South Yorkshire fonrc has instructed the West Midlands police, iu its own inierusis, and

    The role* o f the West M idlands Police      '



    61     the ostensibly independent West Midlands police force has reported to, and collected
           evidence for, four official bodies:
                                                 ‘i


^         ‘0      I -ord Justice 1 eylor's Inquiry of 1980, which reported to the 1tome Scurcuuy;


          h)      Ihe Director o f Public Prosecutions in 1989 and [ 9<X);


          c)      The Coroner’s Inquest between. 19th April 1989 and the end o f March 1991;


          d)      The PoKce.Coirtplaints Authority's supervision of investigations made by officer*
                  from, not only West Midlands, but troni a variety o f other police l<xrce.s into
                  complaints made against a number of South Yorkshire officers.


          In these circumstances, it would seem obvious w the layman that the paper* in the case
          would belong to one or other of these four bodies, who would okIj be expected to reiain
          them (or copies, if one of the other bodies had the originals.) Alternatively, it might
          possibly be thought normal that the West'Midlands police might retain the originals or
          copies. In fact, the South Yorkshire police appear to hold ihe entire archive, except for
          such copies as are stored by the Coroner.


          Only if the investigating police force was truly independent of those it investigated, and
          impartial, could any o f the four inquiries be regarded as full, independent and complete.
          ITU were demonstrated that the West Midlands police inquiry was not independent, but

  .•f/W ft> Auyusl JWQ; The Coroner, L a rd Taylor and ihc two private police investigation*



  <A          II was reported in the newspapers on*17ik April 1989 that the Chief Constable of the
              South Yorkshire Police, Peter Wright! had asked Ok; Chief Constable o f ihe West
              Midlands Police, Gcof&cy Dear, on 16* April *to nominate a senior officer to carry out
              an investigation into the policing of Ihe match* It is not known what power was invoked
              by Mr Wright in making that request. This appears lo be the same subject Tor which Mr
              Phillips was commissioned as an expert witness in 1989. and. if the April press reports
              were accurate, the Phillips report may have been commissioned by West Midlands police
              in the furtherance of this role. Other early prey's reports, Iwwcvcr, make it clear that Mr
              Dear's ofl’icer was to rcpon to thc Taylor Inquiry, which had been announced by llic
              Government on 16th April.


  f)5         On 16* April 1989, the Assistant ChiefConstable of West Midlauds, John Mervyn Jones,
              was nominated by Dear os an investigating officer. According lo the evidence of Jones
^             to the *nnni-inqucsl‘' in April 1990 (Annex F). he uiel the Coroner on Tuesday 18* April
              1989 when Popper first gave instructions to him to gather evidence on Popper’s behulf.
              "At that time my other master was Lord Justice Taylor*. At ihe time Jones was giving
              evidence in 1990, the West Midlands police were assembling evidence, he said, for the
              DPI*.


  66          li appears to the HFSG, although they cannot he sure of the point, that West Midlands
              became the force nominated to help T<otd Tkylor and the other bodies simply becausc
              Wright had asked Dear to investigate on 16thApril 1*#89. The West Midlands force had

                                                                 20
     had .such poor publicity for the year before April 1989 that ii is hard lo believe that the
     1lome Office would have chosen it


67   However, it is dear from the reports and statements of ll»c Svialii Yorkshire Police
     (supplied to the FTFSG this year at the request ofihe Home Secretary) tliat by 17* April

     1989 ihe South Yorkshire police were carryiny tmt their own investigation into the
     policing of the match, The relationship between Uiis and llrc separate West Midlands
     police investigation into the policing of the match, requested by South Yorkshire police,
     is unclear,


6K   Ai all even Is, Mr Jones was reporting to both the Curoitcr and lx>:d Justice Taylor, Hie
P    stntcmenis that he and his olTicers look were taken on behalf of. and for ll»c puipo.se of
     .presenting to, one or other of those persons, or to both of those in succession. U cannot,
     plainly, be said that those statements were taken as agent for. or on bcltali'of. the South
     Yorkshire police office or its Chief Constable. although the fael lhal Wrighl first called
     in Dear allows a spurious claim to be made for such agency.


69   On 26* April 1989, a meeting occurred in which Chief Superintendent Wain of the South
     Yorkshire policc said "our job is merely lo collate what evidence South Yorkshire polio:
     officers can provide to iheir Chief Constable in order that we can present u suitable case,
     on behalf of the force, lo subsequent enquiries." The accompanying memorandum,
     distributed lo all officers present m the ground when the disaster oceuired. said "This
     exercise has no connection with the investigation into ihe policing orthe I ,.A Cup semi­
     final which is being conducted by the C h ief Constable of the West Midlands." (See
     Suiiirt:Smith report, pages 78-9; and questionnaires contained at the bcyjnning of the file
     submitted on 24* August 1998.) This latter ’investigation must plainly refer to the
     inve^igalion commissioned by Mr Wrifilil on i 6* April 1989.


70   Jt appears therefore that then; were four separate investigations at litis sbge. The Coroner
     had opened the inqussts formally. A second was conducted by West Midlands into the
     policing of llie match, and commissioned by South Yorkshire.               A third w»vs an

                investigation by West Midlands for Lord Taylor. A fourth was an internal South
               Yorkshire police investigation into their own policing, for the benefit c*r presenting
               evidence lo, among others. Lord Taylor (confirmed by Appendix 8 to the Report of Lord
               Justice Stuarl-Smhh. page 211).


        7i      1his fourth investigation, conducted by Ihe Soulh Yorkshire police, appears to have luid
               full and unimpeded access to ail the papers, unrestrained by any restrictions imposed by
               West Midlands police. See the two-page memorandum nf Peter Carr. R1A for example,
               dated 25J' April, in which he spoke of the briefing which the Chief Constable (of South
               Yorkshire) had with “Operational S alF on 16'\ 17* and 19* April. He also referred to
               vunous documents in his longer twenty- page rej>ort of the same day. of video tapes and
^   ®         pliotographs. which were obviously iu the possession of the South Yorkshire, not West
               Midlands, investigators. Ilicsc Carr documents are Aan-xJ. Why had the West Midlands
               poliec not taken these exhibits for their own inquiries?


        72    It is c k»r from the report oflx>rd Justice Stuart-Sraith that the South Yorkshire officers

               drafted their own statements, und that the editing was done not by West Midlands ollicerx
               but by S<uiih Yorkshire officers or Hammond Suddanls.(See Report, page 78-79). but
              apparently for the purpose of presenting evidence to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, and to any
              other official investigation.

- • 73        Alter the Taylor interim report was published, it appears that in August 1989, the Chief
              Constable of South Yorkshire wrote to the Director o f Public Prosecutions, requesting
              a decision in relation to criminal liability. I'hc Director or Public Prosecutions
              commenced an investigation by writing lo Mr Wright on 15* August 1989, saying that
              the matter should he the subject of a‘fu1! investigation. *1 he West Midlands Police had
              already done considerable work in gathering evidence for Lord Justicc Taylor's Knquiry.

     74    On 5,h /anmiry 1990 the Chief Constable reported'that the West Midlands police

    7f>   a is necessary to consider uutjust the role of the West Midlands policc. but the position

           report shows the prominent part played by Mr Metcalf of that linn in the early .stages of
£         the Taylor Inquiry (see pages 78-81 and 211). Mr Metealfor an assistant ativmded the
           Business Meetings*, to which interested lawyers and others wcrv invited by the Coroner,
          before the main and interim inquests were beld. tbrthe purpose ol'managing ihe inquest.
          Mr Metcalf .spoke of both the coronal and civil law aspect* of the ease, and was clearly
          concerned in each. Copies o f notes of these Business Meetings arc attached as dti/U&Jj.


    77    At page 9 of the minutes of the meeting of 26,h February 1990. Mr Metcalf made the
          following observation;



                                                  23


                                                                                                        64
          "In general terms, an inquest lakes place before a civil action and it’s always

          legitim ate expense to go and he represented at the Inquest because something

          might com e out that will be relevant to the civil action.*



In April nr.d May 1990, the Coroner held “mini-inquests* at which contentious cross-

cxamination w as not allowed, so as not to' “prcjudio:h the investigation o f the DI’P and

any possible ctim infj proceedings. The cvidcncc adduced asserted that in all cases, death

had followed rapidly from unconsciousness, which.had followed rapidly from the crush.

A eonsequcncc o l this.-of course, is that damages Rjr pre-death su llen ng would be lower
than i f suffering had been greater.


                                      \ . .;
In Jui'iC 1990, Mr Justice Hidden heard civil cases in which Ihc cvidcnce ofsuddon death,

given at the mini-inquests, was adduced. That evidence defeated the families* claims fur

damages for pre-death suffering. 1"he apportionment o f liability between the police and

other parties, such as Sheffield Wednesday 1'ootbal] Club, was not determined until
October 1990.



In September 1 99 0, the Coroner, Dr Popper, announced that tlie lull inquest would be

resumed in November. At this time. South Yorkshire policc was defending iisolfiu.a

number o1 civil actions, including the issues whether claims could be mnde by those who

luid watched events cjd television, and appeals by the victims" fam ilies in the pre-death

suffering cases. Further litigation was outstanding in relation to a number o f spectators

or relatives o f victim s who were present at the match and had suffered injury or mental
trauma.



The thrce-ycar limitation period had not cxpiivd. A verdict o f unlawful killing ul the

inqut^t might lead to prosecutions, in spite o f the l>irector's earlier decision. At the time,

it was known, and topical in the revet, that prosecutions by the director in the Zecbrugge

ease Itad been comm enced only after a verdict o f unlawful killing nt the inquest and the
DPP had declined to projccote oi an earlier stage.

     in tern* adapted from the letter to Mr flicks o f November            Mr Reechcy'.s name
     will be familiar to the CPS. He was fortunately able to fiiul the lime to prepare himself
     for the task of acting as Coroner's officer, which he eventually performed on a daily
     basis, because, as a former Head of the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad, he had hoon-
     removed in August 1989 from operational duties atier thui squad had been disbanded, so
     low had iis reputation sunk.



     1hese facts are set out in "Unsafe and Unsatisfactory”, an independent repori by Tim
     Kaye in 1991. Appendixes A and C to that report are attached lA/wex <)\. Appendix A
     supplies the interesting information that in.1989-90, West Midlands investigated South
     Yorkshire: (page 85): South Yorkshire investigated We$i Yorkshire; ;uu.l West Yorkshire
     in turn investigated West Midlands. No doubt do serious faults in police officers were
     detected by any of these enquiries. Appendix C shows that fteeehey wax removed from
     operational duties in August 1989, but was restored in time to act as Coroner's o nicer Jin’
     the bulk o f the inquest from 304 November 1990. and to deal with ihe question of
     disclosure o f information.

         Information could only be released on the order of a court which could include lhal 0f the
                  er. In the course of the inquest, Mr Hicks hud not been told of the advice tiuit hod
        tx-'-n tf.vn. p r e ^ b i y by Haroaond Saddatds. The transcripts o f the i^ues;

        Whl,C lhC hlqUCSt    COaliflU^ therefore. and South Yorkshire police had ,hc power

       fdting the families before, during, and after the inquest, are cvideni from the letters in
       Annex hi



       It may be expected that, if South Yotfcshire police had access ,0 all tl.c material in I»W
       lo r the   inquest nnd for civil proceedings, the individual officers w h o were represemod.av
      the mquest also bad similar acccss. No conlUct or interest appears tu have cmwrrass.-d
      Hammond Suddards or indeed Winkwottl, and Femberto,,, the lawyers w h o advised ,hc
      South Yorkshire police in the course of the -Scrutiny-. Winkworth and I'cmbcrton
      reminded lhe CPS of this when the* wrote on Mr DuekcnLicld's behalf in July i m           Tlx;
      iU SG believes that South Yorkshire Police Authority are fu n d in g the defen ce o f both

      defendants, and the elose relationship between that force and the defendants is further
      proved by the ■fact that Packenfield instructed lawyers who had worked closely with the
      South Yorkshire police, and who. it is to be presumed, have knowledge o r the history o f
      the control of documents in *fois ease.

    106     This is not the occasion for a consideration as to whether the C hief Constable o f South

             Yorkshire Policc can claim public interest immunity for the archive he holds.

             However, until the W iley case, it seem ed clear lhal if documents had been collccted or

            obtained for the purpose, principe!?)', o r a disciplinary investigation info complaints

             against police officers, public interest immunity attaehed to tl>osc documents on a

             “class’ basis. K cncc. i f it could be claimed that a police force was taking statements

|           for the primary purpose o f investigating complaints, it was very hard for members o f

             the public or interested parties to obtain copies.



    107       However, the existence o f this line o f cases suggests that the South Yorkshirc policc

             believed that they could claim possession o f the ealire archive on the ground that they

             had appointed W est Midlands police to investigate mailers o f n disciplinary character;

             that West M idlands policc had therefore been its “agents": and that, as a further
             advanu-fcH:, public interest immunity attached to the contents o f the archive.




                                                      31



                                                                                                               72

    108    It is submitted that such a claim would be wholly wroijg. even abs'urd, mid thfl! the

           pnisocuiion is being wrongly frustrated in its legitimate desire to obtain sight ol

           probative statements to give further support lo its ease. The documents arc iml the

           properly o f South Yorkshire: they surely •belong lo" one or more o f the various

           official bodies that have inquired into the ease.

           relationship o f principal and a g e n t demolish by themselves the contradictory claim

           that Ihc previous inquiries have been served by an independent force. South Yorkshire

           police can be said lo “ovai" the.archive only i f West Midlands police were working,

           not independently, but in reality as agents for South Yorkshire police from I6*h April

            compared to that against defendants in the cases o f Rosemary W e s t K evin and lan

            M axwell, the Jan>cs Bulger defendants, the Kray brothers, the Guinness trial, the

)          f7roposcd Lockerbie defendants, the Moore murderers, and muny others. In fact, as

            Lord Taylor found, there w as widespread, false and defnmorory propaganda put about

            in 1989 by South Yorkshire police officers In flic prejudice o f Liverpool supporters.

            This prejudice has never been completely dispelled.

                                 The lim ilcuiuni o f the Stuurf-Sniljh report



       II1    The defendants invite the CPS to heed the conclusions o f the “Scrutiny*. It is

              submitted that the conclusions o f Lord Justice Stnart?Smiih in relation 10 "new

              evidence" arc not significant in this review. That report upheld tlK* general Approach o f

              J.ord Taylor. on which the prosecution relies, bur its review o f “new evidencen was

              confined in the evidcncc tendered as new in 1996. However, that exorcise was

              necessarily a lim ited one, bccauscthe l.iverptioi families had been starved o f evidcncc

              tor years. T he existence o f the edited statements was unknown. One example only,

              IM'. Frost w as offered to the "Scrutiny” by a third party. The scale o f the editing, now

              revealed, exceeds anythine shown tn l<ord Justice Stuart-Suiilh.

'w '
       112    Further, it is subm itted that caution has to be- employed sr. acccpiing fuels set out in

              the report, i l has been pointed out that the conclusions about the edited statements arc

              seriously wrong. The dates on page ], in paragraphs 4 and 5. should read 1l :l>July

              199] and 19th N ovem ber 1991. Duckenfield did not.retire ul the bcgiiming o f the

              main inquest. Me gave evidence to it in full uniform. The “autumn o f 1990" in
              paragraph 6 should read '30* August 1990". In paragraph 15. page $7. it is wrongly

              asserted that the main inquest began in March P)91•. in fact it began on 19m November

              1W .



       I I3   The South Yorkshire policy of making statements available to relatives, described ai

              pages 89-90, is inconsistent with the history o f difficulty experienced by. for example,

              Sundra Stringer (S ee Annex N'. above). The discussion o f the decision not to

              piosecuic for m anslaughter (page 10. paragraphs 5 3 ,5 6 and 57) uses the word

              “recklessness". There is no recognition o f the significance o f the decision in

              Adomakn, w h ich replaces the complicated "recklessness” lest apparently applied in

              19V0, and reinstated the gross negligence test.



       114    The Stuart'Smith report is itself economical with information. Fur example, only
              small parts o f the advicc o f counsel in 1990 are set out. The provision o f the whole

          advice is required, so that the whole reasoning is apparent, rather than a I'cvv snippets
          Clearly, privilege has been waived by the prevision of that report to the "Scrutiny'’.
          Why do Souih Yorkshire police have the advice and the West Midlands police report?

          i f the CPS advises that a driver should not be prosecuted for manslaughter, a copy o f

          that advice is not sent to him or his employer. W hy does tho Coroner have the West

          Midlands police report in addition to the statements? D ocs he have the advicc o f

          counsel? Why in these circumstances is the prosecutor in this cose not given access to

          these: documents?



115       'Ihe terms o f reference o f the “Scrutiny" are set out at pages v and vi. They called

          upon Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ithto examine whether any evidence existed which           was

|         not available to, am ong others, the DPP. The knowledge available to the I-iFSG now .

          from the 35 statem ents, the Master Witness List,-and the edited statements, proves that

          maieria! was not available, a*sd information o f a critical kind had been withheld.



1J6       There is no evidence that I,ord Justice Siuari-Sraith saw the Master w itness List, or

          knew what material the D P ? had considered. There is no ground tn b elieve tliai Ik,-

          sought to compare the evidence available to the Director with the total evidence

          available. H e looked only ai the comparatively small pieces o f new evidence then * ••

          known to the fam ilies. A "Scrutiny* is on unusual legal animal. A bsolutely no

          opportunity was g iven to the HFSG, before it was published, to see the edited and

           unedited unsworn statements. Ths Group was evun denied access to the statement o f

I         P.C, Bichard, w h ose account was at the centre o f the matters under investigation.

          Control over the archive w as jssistaioed.



    117   1f the HFSG had known then what the Home Secretary has allowed it to discover

           since, it is subm itted that the result o f the •Scrutiny” would have been very different

           and that the fla w s and partiality o f previous investigations would have been exposed.

           A “Scrutiny* Ls an inquiry, it seems, with little opportunity for those whose concerns
           have prompted its establishment to ask questions, only to be questioned. The account
           given by Roger Houkisworth is set out in full, and his evidence criticised, l^tc tepon

  479U -C and 485C that the Serious Fraud Office and Department o r Trade and

  Industry had disclosed in thai appeal qua/iriiics o f documents lltul would normally be

  expected to attract claim s o f public interest immunity and legal professional privilege.

  Public bodies are usually prepared to disclose matters when they nave notniDg to hide,

 considerations o f confidentiality notwithstanding. When the documents they p o s s ^

 are embarrassing, they seek to withhold them by invoking the "public interest" nnd
  “privilege”,



  Tiic recent secrecy o f the South Yorkshire police. acting under the advice o f

  Hammond Suddards, merely intensifies the justified belief o f ihc- Liverpool fam ilies..

  thui they have tw in manipulated and chcated over the years, that the DPP wus misled

  in IWO when he took his decision on the basis o f care fully selected nutteriui. and that

  the course o f ju stice h is been perverted.



  Copies o f these subm issions and supporting documents will be sent to die Home

  Secrcutry and Attorney-General, who was included in the terms o i‘reference set out in

  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report, and to those Liverpool Members o f Parliament

  who have supported the HFSG this year in attempting to obtain fulier access to the

  materials considered in the "Scrutiny", as promised by the 1 Inme Secretary.

       17 August 1998

      Your Ref: YBF/3341/89

      Mr MG Kennedy
      Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor
      CPS Central Casework
      50 Ludgate Hill
      London EC4M 7EX

      Dear Sir

      Adlm gton v Murrav: Adlingion v Duckenfield


       1     Thank you for your letter of 11* August, which we received on 14*“. We are pleased
             that the matter will be considered at the highest level, and we appreciate'that it will be
             helpful that you yourself are involved, having been concerned in the matter, we
             believe, in 1990.

      2.    However, we remain concerned about the custody o f the papers. You say in your
            letter to us thsi you appreciate our concerns about the propriety o f the South
            Yorkshire Police holding the papers, but that you are not in a position to make any
            request for alternative measures ‘In the absence of a formal role*’.

      3.    However, the South Yorkshire Police are arguing, in stark contrast, that CPS guidance
            is the very justification for its “policy” o f maintaining custody o f the archive. We
            enclose copies of a letter from Mr Ian Dairies, Assistant Chief Constable o f the South
            Yorkshire Police of 3rt August, a letter o f 7* August from Hammond Suddards, our
            letter to Hammond Suddards of 12* August, and their faxed reply o f today’s date.

      4.    You will see that it is said that the Crown Prosecution Service had issued a “response”
            to the effect that “the Chief Constable might wish to delay any voluntary disclosure o f
            documentation until that [CPS] review was complete and a decision made.” This was
            “guidance” provided, it was suggested, pursuant to section 3(2)(e) o f the Prosecution •
            o f Offences Act 1985, which it was said would be followed ‘impartially”. You will

             5            We should point out that we regard it is inappropriate that die South Yorkshire Police
                          should be seeking your views undersection 3(2) W , « « * they take the position
                          apparently that there were no “criminal offences at all.

             6            However, they have done so, and guidance has been express^. In the
                          w e repeat our suggestion that you should request the South Y o r k s h r e Pohce » »glee
                          to thetransfer of the papers, perhaps to a neutral third party o f your choice, a^d that
                          they should allow the contents of the archive, subject to any proper claim to fo
                          example, legal professional privilege, to be examined by prosecution and defence under
                          suitable security conditions, ■with facilities for copying.

             7.           N o doubt, the South Yorkshire Police will respond to any further “ g u id an ce” . Given
                          the scale o f the task of examining the material upon which the CPS has engaged and
                          the likely delay, we can see no reason why this process should await a decision und
                          section 6(2) and section 23(1). The power to take over and discontinue a case is
                          surely to be applied only in clear and exceptional circumstances. The nght o f a private
                          citizen to bring a prosecution was preserved specifically by section 6 1o f the
                          Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. The provision was reviewed in R
                          M agistrates Court, ex pane South Coast Shipping Company (1991) 96 Cr App R405.

                 8         We can see no statutory basis for delaying the magistrates’ court proceedings pending
                           a determination of this question. Under section 6(2), you may take over the conduct
                           of the proceeding “at any stage” in those proceedings before or after committal. Why
                           should the conduct o f those proceedings before the magistrates’ court be delayed for
                           weeks or months before you decide whether to take them over? You will, we suggest
                           be in a much better position to make this decision if we have had access to relevant
                           and probative material obtained to provide further and additional support to our
                           allegations and the case has advanced. You will be free to monitor and observe the
                           progress o f the case, and free to make reasonable requests o f us for information and
                           submissions about the material.

                 9.        Our case on the allegation of manslaughter and misfeasance is cogent and essentially
                           simple. Lord Taylor’s findings in his interim report on the disaster in 1989 were clear.
                           He said at paragraph 265 o f his report:

                            “The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the
                            failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut off access to the central pens which were
                            already overfull.”

                     10    This w a sa "blunder ofthe first magnitude". The evidence o f forensic pathologists
                            called at the mini inquests in 1WO was that in almost all eases death resulted rapidly
                            fiom unconsciousness that was caused by the crushing that followed the miush o f
                            spectators, in full view of the two defendants, followng the order to open the gates

                            259. w here it was stated:

                                                                   -2-                                                82

                      ‘The immediate cause of the disaster was a senior police officer’s decision to open an
                      outer gate without cutting off access to the pens. Liability for the deaths and injuries
                      o f those spectators has been admitted by the three defendants the first o f whom is the
                      plaintiffs’ Chief Constable.”

               11.   M r Duckenfield was in overall charge, and primarily responsible for the decisions and
                     lack of decisions which led to the crushing M r Murray shares in this responsibility.
                     He knew the ground much better. He had been in an important position of
                     responsibility at the identical semi-final the year before, when the Liverpool supporters
                     were also at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. A similar concentration o f
                     supporters in the pens 3 and 4 had occurred, and, we contend, was clear to him, but
                     crushing had been avoided by the simple expedient of diverting the incoming
                     supporters from the tunnel which led to those overcrowded pens.

       ^       12.   It is the case as Taylor found, that in 1989, M r Duckenfield was entitled to call on M r
                      Murray’s experience. M r Murray foiled in breach of his duty, like M r Duckenfield
                      failed, in breach of his duty, to take, demand or recommend the obvious steps to avoid
                     the obvious dangers.

               13.   It is alleged that, the actions and omissions of the two were a substantial cause o f
                     death; that they owed the deceased a duty of care and were negligent and that a jury is
                     entitled to find that the negligence was o f such a gravity as to amount to a crime within
                     the principle in R vAdomako [1995] 1 AC 181.

                     “The essence o f the matter which supremely a jury question, is whether having regard
                     to the risk of death involved the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the
                     circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission”. [1995]
                     1AC 187E (Annex 4).

               14.   This test was not thought to be correct in 1990 when the DPP decided not to
       W             prosecute any individual in relation to the disaster. The prevailing legal view was that
                      involuntary mansJaughter of this kind involved the complicated concept o f recklessness
                      deriving from statutes setting out crimes of causing death by reckless driving and of
                      criminal damage.

               15.   In Adomako, the House of Lords did not change the law. It declared that gross
                      negligence rather than recklessness was and is the basis of the crime. That approach
                      governs the facts of this case.

               16.   You will k n ow from previous correspondence that we allege that relevant information
                     was improperly withheld from the Director and other bodies in 1989 and 1990. We
                     have important copies of many witness statements, disclosed to us during the
                     “Scrutiny” o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which w e had never seen before, but which
                     strengthen Lord Taylor’s findings, and which it appears were not supplied to the
                     Director in 1990. Our letter of 4* August contains a regrettable error when we said
                     that w g put to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith certain amendments. This of course was not

               the case. These representations were made by others and not by us personally.

        17.    Against all this background, we do not understand how il can be right for the South
               Yorkshire Police, which has an interest o f its own to serve, to deny us access to
               relevant and probative evidence, under your “guidance”. The practice to which you
               refer must surely apply only to those cases in which a police force acts as the impartial
               investigating body, examining allegations against civilians or its own junior officers.

       18.     This case is o f course very different. The South Yorkshire Police force was itself
               under investigation. It was concerned to defend itself as a combative litigant against
               claims o f negligence. And yet, for reasons which remain unexplained, the West
               Midlands Police force entrusted it at some point with not only all the original
               documents and exhibits, but also its internal police report into the allegations, and even
               counsel’s opinion, obtained by the Director, on the question of criminal liability. Is
               there any precedent in the Director’s or police practice for sending to a person or body
               under suspicion the privileged advice of counsel, or the confidential police report into
               the crimes alleged?

       19.    We respectfully invite you therefore to recognise that the South Yorkshire Police
              retain possession of the papers because the CPS has suggested that it should; but that
              that advice ought to be changed. We should inform you as a matter o f courtesy that
              we propose to apply for a witness summons directed to M r Daines, directing him to
              produce relevant statements exhibits and other documents. We shall raise this at the
              Leeds Magistrates* Court on 20* August. No doubt someone from the CPS will
              attend and, if necessary, make representation.

              A bove all, we should invite you to explain what possible damage to the interests of
              prosecution or defence, or justice could be inflicted at this stage by a simple transfer o f
              documents from the possession of an interested party to an uhcontroversiaJ outsider
              and by an examination of that material by prosecution and defence7

             Dear Sir,

             RE: HILLSBO RO UG H: A D LIN G TO N -v- DUCKENFIELD and M U R R A Y

             Your letter of 4 August 1998 addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions has been
             passed to me for reply in the absence of the Director herself and the Chief Crown Prosecutor
             for CPS Central Casework.

             You raise two issues, the first of which eoncems the storage of original statements. I do
             appreciate your concerns about the propriety of the South Yorkshire Police holding the
             originals, particularly as they were not the investigating force.

             In most cases, the normal practice is that the police retain the originals of witness statements
             until they are required for the purposes of committal proceedings or trial at the magistrates’
             court. The CPS does not usually receive them until they are so required. (There are some
             exceptions where, for historical reasons, the police send the original statements at an earlier
             stage). This practice applies in all cases even where police officers themselves are the
             defendants or potential defendants.

             ]ii the Hillsborough case, the matter is obviously sensitive, but it is not different in principle
             to cases where police officers have been investigated by their own force.

             The West Midlands Police carried out the investigation in this case but I understand that
             currently they have no involvement in the matter.

             The Crown Prosecution Service has no formal standing in the case at the moment as we
             decided some time ago not to commence proceedings ourselves. We are considering whether
             to take over the prosecution you have launched but we have not yet made a decision. In the
             absence of any formal role at this stage, I am not in a position to make any request for
             alternative measures in relation to the safe keeping of the original papers.

                                                                                                                           85

     they have no objection to disclosure o f their correspondence to us, provided they are supplied
     with copies o f correspondence to the CPS from the solicitors for the defendants and South

     I propose to supply them with copies unless you indicate that you object to doing so.

           Dear Madam


          This letter is being written at the express request ofA km Jone& Q C andLbe has a sk ed that i f at
          all possible you consider it personally. This is because he takes the view that th e situation is
          very unusual perhaps unique and delicate enough to warrant your personal attention.

          For some time now the HFSG has been trying to get originals o f witness statements taken
          either for the Taylor Inquiry or the Inquest or by a Police Force. A private prosecution
          alleging niter aha manslaughter has now been commenced by way o f summons and obviously
          this makes it even more important w e should have access to those originals. It is clear that, to
          put it at its lowest there are significant amendments to statements and your office w e are su’re
          has not always been given the unamended statements. The degree o f amendments is
          significantly greater than w e put to Stuart-Smith LJ so w e are not simply as it were re-hashin^
          that point                                                                        ®


      ^   For the first time by letter dated 24 July and received here 31!‘ w e have now been told that
           ‘for storage purposes” all the originals are now with the South Yorkshire Police. This is the
          force that employed the Defendants and w hose behaviour is at the core o f the incidents. It
          w as not the investigating force nor did it take the majority o f statements. Alun Jones has
          asked that you consider the propriety o f this arrangement and that you ensure that, if it is to
          continue, what restrictions/security arrangements ought to control access to the material.

          Mr Jones is presently in Spain otherwise he would have been in touch personally but I can say
          this letter is being sent with his approval following a phone call between him and me.

On a general point Mr Jones is anxious that any m omentous decision such as would be any
decision effectively discontinuing the existing prosecution be taken at the highest level and
asks that i f at all practicable it be reserved to you and if that is totally impracticable the person
delegated {de fa cto not de ju re only) be o f similar authority and capability or as close as can
be

  RE:        HILLSBOROUGH: ADLEVGTON v DUCKENFTELD and MURRAY

  Thank you for your letter of 31 July 1998. Unfortunately our fax            was Dl, vfal m
  and we only received pan 0f it by fax on that day. H e original arrived by post on 3 a S ^


 I have noted carefully the representations you have made and I will draw Mr Croston’s
 attention to these on his return from leave. I think it appropriate for me tom akT ^m e
 comments about particular issues you raise.                                  maKe 501110

  You particularly mention the Stephen Lawrence case and the approach taken by Mr
  Youngerwood. Obviously I am aware of the case but not the fine detail I know that Mr
 Croston has been in touch with colleagues who wet* involved in the                   in
 Lawrence case. The only point I would make here is that the Crown Prosecution Servia
 considers each case on its own merits. We do. o f course, endeavour to apply
 standards. As mdicated by Mr. Croston, so far as the evidence is co n cem ed .T ap troo n ^
 test is whether there is clearly no case to answer. That is the test we will app)^

In your letter you mention a number of public interest factors and you ask specifically which
of those factors might apply. I -cannot give you a clear indication until the review has been
fimshed. You will be aware that the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out some common
public interest factors both for and against prosecution. The list in the Code is not
exhaustive. I note your observations but, until the case has been reviewed again I cannot

   say which factors may or m a y not apply.

   You specifically raise passage o f time. This is frequently a factor which is considered in
               u i T d° D0 beUer ***“ refer you t0                6.5d o f the Code for Crown
   Prosecutors whjch sets out some o f the key points. Whilst delay may be a matter for the
        ’ eS        “ dicates that it is also a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service to
         e[' ^or e reasons mentioned above, I am not able to give you a considered view as
  to whether delay is or is not a factor o f weight in this case.            •

  You mention health as a public interest factor. I note what you say but make no further
  comment.

 You also raise publicity. I disagree with your assertion that "it would be a most dangerous
 precedent to discontmue a prosecution on this ground". There will undoubtedly be cases
 where a prosecution is stopped in -order to protect sources o f information, international
 relations or national security. Whether "publicity" has any relevance to this case is not clear
 to me and will only be apparent once Mr. Croston’s review is complete.

  You also mention that you fail to see the relevance o f the additional criterion "likelv to
  damage die interests o f justice". There might be cases where the continuation o f a private
 -prosecution could interfere with the investigation of other criminal offences. In those
 circumstances, we would have to make a judgement.


 qi^stk.e^ ti0n ±C PreVi0US                 and 1 note wilat y °u     In particular you raise two


                 the extent to which statements were made available to solicitors for the injured
                 and bereaved;

             •   the reason for compiling the master witness list.

 I am unable to answer these questions at this stage. Indeed, my view at the moment is that
 the answers will be apparent once the papers have been reviewed by Mr. Croston.

  You raise the issue about the editing o f statements. Again, this is an issue which will have
 to be considered carefully in the overall review o f the case and it will be inappropriate for
 me to make any detailed comment. I can add, however, that we would normally exclude
 from our minds opinion and comment contained within statements when making prosecution
 decisions on the grounds that they would be unlikely to be admissible in evidenoe in a
-crirmnal court in any event.

You make reference to the Phillips report. It appears from your letter that this report was

                                          A d lin g to n v D u ck en field



    1        Thank you for your letter o f 2 7 th July. Y ou do not invite a reply o f substance, but w e
             wish to deal w ith som e o f the issues you raise. Obviously, y ou do not w ish to conduct
             an elaborate trial o f the issues involved, taking evidence and representations from the
             prosecution and defence in turn, before making a decision. N either d oes the
             Hillsborough Family Support Group, but I ask you to bear the follow ing matters in
             mind.

              The C riteria f o r discontinuance: insufficiency.

    2        In my last letter I set out the basis on w hich w e had brought the prosecutions. In
              contrast to this case, you will k n o w that the prosecution o f the youths w h o w ere
              alleged to have killed Stephen Law rence in London w as brought on an apparently
              speculative basis w ith little supporting evidence. At the public enquiry into that case,
             Mr Y ou ngerw ood o f the Crow n prosecution Service said, according to T he Tim es and
A            The Independent o f 2 nd July 1998, that he w as so “ desperate” at the decision to bring a
              private prosecution w hich, i f it failed, w ould prevent for all tim e a prosecution o f the
              youths, that he “ collapsed in the street”. W e enclose copies o f the articles, from which
              it is clear that the C row n P rosecution Service considered that there w a s no proper
              basis for the prosecution at all.

    3        N onetheless, the C PS did not then take over and discontinue the prosecution. W e
             have som e difficulty in reconciling that decision with the criterion you set out at the
             foot o f the second page o f your letter, namely, that you w ould take over and
              discontinue i f “T here is clearly no case to answer” . W e w ould have far greater
              difficulty in understanding h o w you could apply such a test in the present case, given
             the findings o f Lord Taylor, so emphatically reinforced by the recent “ Scrutiny” w hen
              there is clearly, applying the Adom ako, test a powerful case to answer9 .

     The criteria f o r discontinuance: “'public interest factors .

     I f there is sufficiency o f evidence, w e should be grateful if you c o u l d ^
     “public interest factors” m ight impel you to take over and discon ue P           that

     couA from examining t h ^ c o g e n t and well-supported allegations. It is ^               t0
     foresee familiar and w ell-w orn “abuse o f process arguments un er e
     headings, to w hich w e m ake brief observations, relevant to your presen

     Passage o f time. This surely cannot be a factor o f weight. W e told you in
     letter o f the n ew material that has been disclosed to us in the last y e a r R egular Y   ^
     prosecutions take place w here relevant events have occurred m uc o g ag
     H illsborough D isaster. F or example, there are a number o f cases o f all
      abuse, prosecuted by the CPS, in w hish complainants havew aited many y              ,
      decades, before laying their complaints before the police. The W a r C n m « deds
      with alleged crimes comm itted b etw een fifty and sixty years ago.- There
      cases which take place ten years and m ore after the events complained o £ and tfter
      long and som etim es slo w investigation. T he CPS has been know n to argue m the
      Divisional Court that extraditions arising out o f events many years age> sh<>uld n o .b e
      prevented as being unjust and oppressive on the grounds o f passage o f tun .
      criteria do you apply to alleged delay?. I f you tell us, I hope w e can resP °^ _
      know o f no cases in w hich you have discontinued on grounds o f delay, and no
      reported case o f Judicial review in w hich such criteria have been examine .

      Surely the question whether there is delay causing prejudice at trial ought: not tc>be
      considered by you, but by a Court deciding at an in t e r partes hearing whether the
      proceedings are a^ ab use o f process?. Our case will be that all th eb a ic facts of the
      disaster are clear. No-one will have forgotten them. At an                          £ e
      parties can call evidence. Skeleton arguments can be consider^ Oral arguments can
      be tested by a court with full sight o f the committal evidence. The a b u se o f process
      authorities are well-known and do not need to be cited here, but you will be aware,that
      the courts and House of Lords have said , over and oyer again, that a case should b
       stopped at court on this basis only in the m ost exceptional cases.



       Health Mr Duckenfield escaped disciplinary hearings brought against him by the Police
7.
      Complaints Authority for neglect o f duty on the grounds of ,11-health I t ™ * ™
      thought unfair to prosecute Mr Murray. It was obviously believed that evidence o f
      nedigence existed against both and the Police Complaints Authority must have
      considered that the evidence of negligence could be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
       Given the Home office disclosures as to police retirements on health grounds, only'the
       most naive person would accept at face value a statement or written evidenceuntested
       in cross-examination or by further scrutiny that Mr Duckenfield ought not to be tried
       for such a reason.



                                                                                                      9

Ru b l i c i i W e doubt whether you would consider that the publicity that has arisen in
the case is a reason why you should interfere: it would be a m ost dangerous precedent
to discontinue a prosecution on this ground. Again, w e know o f no case in which this
has happened or indeed any case in which h has been conceded by the prosecution in
court that it should not proceed for this reason.

 The criteria f o r discontinuance: “ likely to dam age the interests ofju stice ”

W e do not understand what, if anything, this adds to the “public interest factors”
criterion.


The relevance o f previous investigations

 Obviously the history o f the investigations is relevant to your decision. W e would
 argue that even if there was no hint o f controversy about them, there would be no
justification for intervening to discontinue. H ow ever as I set out in outline in my
previous letter, the Group suspects that the CPS was given incomplete information in
 1990. The Group is becoming increasingly disturbed by what w e are learning as more
and more papers are revealed to us. Our purpose in asking to see your previous
papers, and those held by the tw o police forces and coroner, is to gain necessary
access to original evidence, whether w e have seen it before or not. W e believe that
there is much more evidence, previously concealed from the Group, which is directly
relevant to gross negligence issue, and which is probative o f guilt o f the charges laid, in
the possession o f the police in South Yorkshire, and W est Midlands. W e also believe
that provision o f this information will enable us to prove that the decision in 1990 was
taken on a false basis and on the basis o f absence o f full and frank disclosure.

The task that you have embarked upon o f considering whether you have seen all
relevant material is a formidable one. W e were supplied by you last year with a
“Master W itness List (Alphabetical)” with the name and badge o f the “West Midlands
Police” on it, and the words “Hillsborough Inquiry”. The beginning o f the first page o f
the alphabetical list is dated 4* April 1990. Leading counsel w ere instructed by the
Director on 16* February 1990, but they did not advise until August. It is reasonable
to believe that this “Master Witness List” w as the list o f statements tendered to
counsel. W e know in fact that the W est Midlands Police took 3,776 statements (and
did not take any o f the hundreds o f statements provided by South Yorkshire police
officers: see below ). The Master Witness List contains statements from supporters,
South Yorkshire police and many others.

W e have recently been examining and selecting witness statements from those that
have com e into our possession in the last year for the purpose o f compiling a
committal bundle. W e have selected a group o f 35 spectators who give clear
evidential support to Lord Taylor’s findings as to the “blunder on opening the gates”
and provide further evidence pointing clearly to the guilt o f the tw o defendants.
 Leading counsel then checked that list against the “Master Witness List” and
 discovered that o f those 35 only 6 w ere in the Master Witness List, only 8 w ere called
 at the inquest, and only 2 at the Taylor Enquiry, although with a few exceptions their
 statements were taken in April, May, June 1989.


 W e suspect the DPP w as not supplied with these statements. W e enclose for your
 information a copy o f a letter written to the Director on 5® February 1990. It appears
 that copies o f som e statements were made available to solicitors acting for som e o f the
 injured and the bereaved relatives, but w e do not know the extent o f this. W e invite
 you to tell us. H ow ever it appears also that the Director put a stop to this practice on
 the ground that the police were investigating potentially “eveiy individual w h o w as at
 the ground”.


 W e have therefore concluded that many o f the witness statements sent w ould have
 been said to be relevant to misconduct by supporters as well as police. Is this why the
 Master W itness List w as compiled?.

 The two sets o f South Yorkshire P olice statements

In my last letter I referred to unsworn statements made by South Yorkshire police
officers and sent to us by the H om e Office this year. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
comments upon this subject in his report. It is clear from Appendix 8 that tw o sets o f
statements were made. The first were “o f immense value to our [South Yorkshire
P olice’s] counsel” w ho w as representing their interests in civil and no doubt other
areas H ow ever, since they contained “comment and opinion” amendments w ere
made: but the second letter show s that leading counsel to the Taylor enquiry had no
objection at all to receiving written statements containing comment (The letters are
attached).


Astonishingly, there appears to have been a “personal undertaking” given by the W est
Midlands Police to South Yorkshire Police that the original statements w ould not be
used. Neither I nor counsel has ever before com e across a case in which statements
are obtained by an allegedly impartial investigator who is prohibited by an
“undertaking” from presenting them to a tribunal.


W e believe that the D irector w as therefore given the edited statements. Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith comments on these statements at Chapter 4, pages 77-84, but he seem s
to accept at paragraph 105 that the Director did not have the unedited statements.
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says very little about the material in your possession in
1990.


The Group knew virtually nothing about the South Yorkshire statements until after the
Report w as published. W e have now had an opportunity to go through all the
statements in much greater detail than, clearly, was placed before Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith. The situation is appalling. D ozens o f statements omit crucial statements o f
fact, relevant to the question o f negligence. W e were not surprised to see that,
although many edited statements went to the Taylor Enquiry and, presumably, to the
 Director, very few o f the witnesses w ho had made such edited statements were called
 as witnesses to the enquiry or at the Inquest, where they might be cross-examined.

  W e are preparing a detailed report on the editing, but the attached statement o f Chief
 Inspector Bettison, which w as obviously not placed before the “Scrutiny”nor before
 the Director in 1990, is in itself a deeply disturbing example. See the comments about
 the responsibility for monitoring the pens at the end o f page 3, a critical issue on the
 question o f negligence, and the responsibility o f the police and the tw o defendants. Is
 there any indication at all in the 1990 material at the D irector’s office that Counsel
 advise knew that this “clarification w as going on, or had taken place.

 The Phillips R eport

W e do not know whether this document w as presented to the Director o f Public
Prosecutions. It is a report commissioned by the South Yorkshire P olice from the
D evon and Cornwall Police allegedly for the purpose o f civil proceedings. The Group
has been deeply concerned to hear that, whilst the South Yorkshire P olice statements
w ere not made public (except to the extent that the edited versions w ere given to the
Taylor Enquiry), the South Yorkshire Police had clearly been given access by the West
Midlands Police to the statements provided by the Liverpool supporters for use in
private litigation. W hy w as such a different policy adopted than w as used towards the
Liverpool families?.

The n eed fo r early disclosure

These matters make it clear why w e wish to see all statements and exhibits in your
possession. It will take you w eeks or months to make a proper audit o f the papers.
The statements you have must include statements directly relevant to the offences
alleged which w e have not seen, and to which w e, as prosecutors, are entitled.

In addition, w e need to protect ourselves against an abuse o f process application, as
well as the present application made by the defendants to you, based on an argument
that previous authorities have examined all the relevant material.

W7e see no reason why you should not supply us with material quickly. W e have to go
to court on 20* August and will be expected to inform the magistrate o f progress. In
the Lawrence case, w e read that Mr Youngerw ood immediately m ade his papers
available to the solicitor for the prosecutors. W hy is this case different?.

The D irecto r’s advice to the South Yorkshire Police

I have to say that, given the controversy surrounding the South Yorkshire Police and
its approach to the collection and editing o f evidence, w e regard it as surprising that
the Director should be offering advice to that force. It has patently looked not for
justice in this case, but to the need to protect itself and its senior officers above all
other considerations Surely, when the Director o f Public Prosecutions has found no
sufficient evidence o f any crime, it is inappropriate to say that you can advise the South
                Yorkshire P olice under section 3 (2) (e) o f the Prosecutions o f O ffences A ct 1985.
                Would it not be better that they should be advised by Hammond Suddards w h o have
                acted for that force in the past and told us earlier this month that they act for them
                now?.


        26      I should be grateful to know whether you have passed a copy o f my last letter to the
                  efendants. W hat are the ground rules?. F or our part, w e do not mind i f you pass a
                copy o f our correspondence to the defendant’s solicitors, provided o f course that w e
                see copies o f their letters to you.



                   ook forward to your reply. I suggest that there is no need for you to devote serious
                and long consideration to the possibility o f taking the wholly exceptional course o f
                intervening to stop the prosecution. There are no grounds. I f you w ere to consider
                depriving the Group unreasonably o f its statutory right to prosecute, how ever, I
    I           respectfully suggest that it w ould be a further wrong to do so before you had
                com pletely allayed all the doubts on the matters w e have discovered, and continue to
                discover, about the previous investigations, i f it is possible to do so.

 he expected.                   The    inclusion             of   references          to

where         persons       were       last       s een alive            dilutes

these        were     omitted,           it m i g h t        be   interpreted

          Dear M r O wston

          HILLSBOROUGH: Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

          I am aware o f the latest sum monses taken out by the Hillsborough Fam ily Support Group at
          Leeds M agistrates’ Court returnable for 2 0 August 1998.

          Enclosed is a copy o f our latest letter to the Hillsborough Family Support Group and which
          explains the policy that w ill be applied in this case. W hile w e w ould w ish to complete the
          CPS review as soon as possible w e do need to be assured that w e have all the relevant
          evidence before us w hen com ing to our decision.

          I w ould be grateful if you could let m e have voluntary disclosure o f any material in your
          p ossession that you consider m ay be relevant to our review. I do hold or have access to all
          the evid en ce that was available to the Taylor Inquiry, the Inquests and to the Judicial Review
          hearing. I m ay not have all the material that was submitted to the Scrutiny. Please contact
          m e i f you have any queries on this point.

            D ear Sirs


            HTLLSBOROLGH: Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

            Thank you for your letter o f 2 0 July 1998 addressed to Mr C .H .E n zor and informing us that
            you have taken over the conduct o f the case from Watts Leather. Mr Enzor has asked me
            to reply on his behalf as I am involved in the CPS review o f the papers.

            F o llo w in g the receipt o f the Watts Leather letter o f 30 June w e had been in communication
            with them and were about to send a m ore substantive reply. I shall incorporate that
            inform ation in this letter.

            I am aware that the original summonses issued at South Sefton M agistrates’ Court have been
            withdrawn because o f perceived problems with the court’s jurisdiction. Thank you for your
            confirm ation that sum m onses were issued on 13 July returnable for 2 0 August 1998 at Leeds
            M agistrates’ Court.

            Y ou m ay already know that the two firms o f solicitors acting separately for M r Duckenfield
            and for Mr Murray have formally requested the Director to exercise her pow er under section
            6(2) o f the Prosecution o f O ffences Act 1985 to take over the conduct o f the proceedings
            instituted by the private prosecutor for whom you act, and then to discontinue under section
            23 o f the Act.

            It m ay help if you were acquainted with our policy in cases o f this type. The Code for
            Crown Prosecutors contains the principles that apply to the CPS review o f criminal
            proceedings started by the police. There are tw o stages in the decision to prosecute. The
            first being the evidential test. I f the case does not pass that test, it must not go ahead, no
            matter how important or serious it may be. If the case does pass the evidential test then a
            Crown Prosecutor must decide if a prosecution is needed in the public interest. This second
            stage is the public interest test which I shall com e to later.



                                                                                                                i
T ^ j v i d e n t i a l test is an objective one and a Crown prosecutor m ust b e satisfied that there
is enough evidence to provide a ‘realistic prospect o f conviction’ against each defendant on
each charge. In other words a jury or bench o f magistrates, properly directed in accordance
with the law, is m ore likely than not to convict the defendant o f the offen ce charged.

Where there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect o f conviction the public
interest must be considered. Crown Prosecutors must balance the factors for and against
prosecution carefully and fairly.

The policy where proceedings have been comm enced by a private prosecutor builds on that
contained in the C ode for Crown Prosecutors. The right to bring a private prosecution is
preserved by section 6(1) o f the Prosecution o f O ffences A ct 1985 subject to the pow er under
section 6 (2 ). The CPS w ill take over a private prosecution w here there is a particular need
for it to do so on behalf o f the public.

A s you know the original review decision released in August 1990 w as m ade follow ing the
joint advice received from tw o leading counsel. The advice was that there w as "no sufficient
evidence to support criminal proceedings o f any kind against those m entioned in the W est
Midlands Report". The subsequent Press release made on b ehalf o f the Director o f Public
Prosecutions w as that there w as "insufficient evidence to justify the institution o f proceedings
against any officer in the South Yorkshire Police Force or any other person for any other
offence".

F ollow in g the show ing o f the Jimmy M cGovern drama documentary o n national television
in Decem ber 1996 and the representations made to us by a number o f parties including the
H FSG on 4 March 1997, the CPS commenced a further review o f what w as said to be ‘new
evid en ce’. Our responsibility focused on whether or not there was n ew material, which, if
properly investigated, m ight lead to a realistic prospect o f conviction o f any person. The
conclusion that w as reached was that there were no grounds for reopening the police
investigation into the H illsborough disaster. In the subsequent Scrutiny set up by the H om e
Secretary, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was asked to ascertain whether any evidence exists
relating to the disaster w hich was not available to the Director o f Public Prosecutions for the
purpose o f discharging her statutory responsibility. H is conclusions are laid out in detail in
his report and in Chapter 7 he says that he does not consider there to be any material that
should be put before the D P P or the P olice Complaints Authority w hich m ight cause them
to reconsider the decisions they had taken. These decisions w ere m ade in accordance with
the principles laid dow n in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. It w as decided that there was
insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect o f conviction.

In the instant case w here w e have been asked by the defendants to take over the prosecution
in order to discontinue it, w e would do so if one (or more) o f the follow in g circumstances
applies:

•      T h er e is clearly no case to answ er. A private prosecution com m enced in these
       circumstances would be unfounded, and would, therefore be an abuse o f the right to
           bring a prosecution.

•      T h e pub lic interest factors tending against prosecu tion clearly ou tw eigh those
           factors ten d in g in favou r.
t




            The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.

    The CPS would then regard itself as having to act in accordance with our policy.

    I f none o f the above apply there w ould be no need for the CPS to b ecom e involved and w e
    would not interfere with the private prosecution.

    Clearly there is a distinction betw een the "realistic prospect o f conviction" test in the Code
    and the "clearly no case to answer" test m entioned above. A ccordingly w e recognise that
    there w ill be som e cases w hich do not m eet the CPS Code tests where nevertheless w e will
    not intervene. It has been considered that to apply the Code tests to private prosecutions
    w ould unfairly lim it the right o f individuals to bring their ow n cases.

    Before this decision can properly be m ade the CPS must be assured that all relevant material
    has been considered. W hile w e have access to material available to the Taylor Enquiry, the
    Inquests, the judicial review hearing in the H igh Court and that submitted to us by the
    H illsborough Fam ily Support Group, it m ay be that other important evid en ce is not known
    to us. Y ou have kindly provided the CPS with schedules o f evid en ce in your possession and
    w e have asked the solicitors for the defendants for the same inform ation. Where there is
    evidence that w e have not seen w e shall be asking the relevant party for voluntary disclosure
    o f the same.

    Until there has been a detailed review o f     the many papers in the case the Crow n’s position
    cannot be determined. This review will         o f necessity take som e little tim e to complete. I
    regret that at the m om ent w e are not able   to give a date for the prom ulgation o f the decision
    but I can assure you that our review w ill     be expedited.

    In order to be assist your review o f the papers involved in the private prosecution I shall
    arrange for a schedule o f our papers to be sent to you as soon as possible. H ow ever this will
    not apply to those documents subject to either public interest im m unity or to legal privilege.

    Under the circumstances outlined above w e do not feel that it is appropriate for us to
    consider your request for voluntary disclosure o f our case papers until our decision has been
    made.

    W e have advised the C h ief Constable for South Yorkshire Police on disclosure o f documents
    in his possession in similar terms to those above.

    I shall be writing to the solicitors for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray enclosing for them a
    copy o f this letter.

    F ollow ing our review I should be able to advise in m ore detail as to the stance w e take on
    the other issues raised by yourselves.




                                                                                                           117
          m e know i f there is any way in which I r-an assist you further.

 Adlington v M urra y; A dlin g to n v DuckenfiplH


 I would inform you that I have now taken over conduct o f the above matter from Watts
 Leather, Solicitors.


I refer to their letter to you o f 30th June 1998 and enclose a copy, and write to you now to
report the most recent developments. The defendants intimated a lone technical argument as
to whether a justice at the South Sefton Magistrates Court could compel by summons
defendants who now live in W est Yorkshire and Dorset to attend court in Liverpool. It was
not disputed, we believe, that any magistrates court in England and Wales has jurisdiction to
hear committal proceedings in respect o f indictable offences committed anywhere in the
country, provided that a defendant appears before it.


Solely in order to avoid delay, w e have withdrawn those summonses, but taken out
summonses in Leeds, the area in w'hich Mr Murray lives. We enclose copies for your
information. We hope that you are now- in a position to provide us with the documents and
information w'e seek. The return date for summonses is 2 0 th Aueust.


We wish to be able to study your documents well in advance o f that date, so that, as the
prosecution, w e can assist the court with timetable, an estimate o f the number o f witnesses to
be tendered at committal, and so on. W e also have some copy witness statements, but
obviously will require the originals. W e note from the recent newspaper reports o f the
Stephen Lawrence enquiry in London that when the solicitor for the Lawrence family
announced that he was intending to begin a private prosecution, the relevant officer at the
Crown Prosecution Service immediately opened the entire contents o f his files to him.

We hope that you will raise no objection to the disclosure to us o f all documents in your
possession We can inform you that in the last year, the Hillsborough Family Support Group

  has received many copies o f witness statements from spectators at the ground. The H om e
  Office has made available to us this year large numbers o f unsworn statements from officers o f
  the South Yorkshire Police. W e already know the names and have statements o f many o f the
  witnesses who will be called or tendered at committal, but there are significant gaps that w e
  must fill.


 The Home Office has adopted a deliberately open policy o f making available the information in
 its possession. W'e enclose a copy o f extracts from Hansard for 18th February 1998. Y ou will
 note from the last paragraph o f page 1088 the importance the H om e Secretary attached to the
 publication o f material which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith had examined. Wre invite you to do
 the same.


 This prosecution has not been undertaken lightly. W e have considered with care the new
 material disclosed to us by the H om e Office, and the recently revealed witness statements. We
 have taken careful and detailed advice from leading and junior counsel.

 W e regard the prosecution case as strong. It is evidently much stronger than the case against
 the alleged killers o f Stephen Lawrence, in which the DPP disclosed everything. The
 comments o f Lord Taylor in his 1989 report into the Hillsborough disaster are as powerful
 today as they were then. H e considered that the order to open the gates, combined with
 failure to close o ff access to the tunnel, was a “blunder o f the first magnitude”, remarking:

                ‘T h e immediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was
                the failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut o ff access to the cental pens which
                were already overfull.”


  Since then the H ouse o f Lords has held that in offences o f involuntary manslaughter not
. involving an unlawful and dangerous act the appropriate test is as follows:


                 The essence o f the matter which is supremely a jury question, is whether
                having regard to the risk o f death involved the conduct o f the defendant w as so
                bad in all the circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or
                omission” R v Adomako [1 9 9 5 ] 1AC 187E

The South Yorkshire Police has admitted negligence on many occasions. The negligence
found by Lord Taylor caused death. Our case is that the persons responsible for the decision
w-ere the tw o defendants. The prosecution argument here is that, in the words o f Lord
MacKay, [1995] 1AC 187E, it is “supremely a jury question” whether, having regard to the
risk o f death involved, the undoubted negligence was so bad as to amount to a criminal act or
omission. W e simply want the jury to judge this matter “in all the circumstances”. W e are
invoking the right, enshrined in the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 to conduct a private
prosecution.


W e do not kn ow why a decision not to prosecute was made in 1990, but we suspect that vou:
office, and therefore counsel who advised, were given incomplete information. We attach a
transcript o f further comments by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith o f 8'h October 1997 as to the
question whether a prosecution might originally have been brought.
The allegation o f misfeasance is based on the same and other facts and the allegation o f taking
s eps to pervent the course o f justice refers to Mr Duckenfield’s “disgraceful lie” as Lord
        Stuart-Smith called it, that the supporters had broken down the gate.

to the South Yorkshire Police and the West Midlands Police.

 29       LORD JUSTICE STUART- SH IT H :
 30               I absolutely take the point about that they could see with
 31               their own eyes and it is an extremely important aspect of
 32              the case.
 33                      Different people might have taken-a different view or.
 34              the question of prosecution.                I am obviously not going to
 35              disclose what I might have thought about it, I do not
 36              know. But quite clearly it might be possible to find



     f           somebody who took a different view from the DPP.
                         That does not mean to say that the DPP was wrong or
      3          that his decision can now be reversed.                    There are
      4          imperfections in our system.                Somebody has to filter and
     5           decide and whether prosecutions of this                    gravity are to be
     6           brought.       That is entrusted to            a senior lawyer, probably
     7           he consults with other people.                   In this case he had the
     e           advice of two very experienced leading counsel,                      who also
     s           toox the same view ss him.
 10                     I am not saying that there might not have been who
 11              somebody could have taken a different view.                      I am not
 12              saying that I might not have taken a different view,                        I do
                not know.       But the problem is that I cannot recommend that
     I          that decision be reconsidered unless there is something
 15             which clearly points to a greater degree of responsibility
16              than the evidence hitherto has suggested.                     That is the way
17              it is and I am afraid people may find that unpalatable,
ie              but that is the way it is.
19                     Our criminal prosecution system depends on somebody
20              taking a decision that there is enough evidence to warrant
21              prosecution with the prospect of success.                     That is
22              entrusted to a, as I say, very responsible senior person
23              in a case of this gravity. _ I doubt whether he considered
24              it alone,     he had the advantage of leading counsel's                           ~   12t
25             opinions and there we are.               That is his decisions, that is
26             the way the criminal justice system works.                      You will think
27             it is inadequate, you will go on thinking it is inadequate
28             for the rest of your life I dare say?

Dear Mr Croston,

Adlington -v- David Duckenfield & M urray

Thank you very much for your letter o f 6th July.

Since receiving that letter, w e have received the enclosed letter from Watts Leather Solicitors
dated 9th July. W e have advised the Court that w e consent to the Informations being
withdrawn, subject to the appropriate costs order, and await advice as to the formalities.

I anticipate that Watts Leather w ill take steps to lay the Informations elsewhere, as indicated
in their letter, and in that event, the request for the Director o f Prosecutions to take over the
conduct o f the matter w ill be reiterated. At the m om ent how ever, it m ay be appropriate to
await further developments and as necessary I w ill respond to the matters set out in your letter
at that time.

I f you would like to discuss any matters arising from the correspondence, please do not
hesitate to contact m e or m y colleague, Simon Eastwood, at your convenience.

Yours sincerely,




N A F O W STO N

     Dear Mr Owston

     Thank you for your letter o f 1 July 1998 with enclosures.

     Your letter addressed to the Director o f Public Prosecutions has been forwarded to m e so that
     I can give a m ore detailed preliminary answer to your representations. I have been asked
     to read all the papers and make recommendations concerning the available options open to
     the Crown Prosecution Service and to your request that w e take over this private prosecution
     in order to discontinue it.

     In order that I can be sure that I have all the relevant material before m e, I w ould be grateful
     if you could let m e have a schedule o f any documents in your possession that you consider
     to be relevant to the prosecution.

     Tne issues raised in your letter can then be fully considered and a detailed reply given to you
     as soon as possible.

     I regret that I am unable to provide an estimate for the conclusion o f this review as there are
     a number o f factors which are not within m y control.



     Yours sincerely

     Crown Prosecution Service
     50 Ludgate Hill
     London EC 4M 7E X                                                    1 Ju]y 1998



     Dear M adam                                                         By B A m

     D a v id D u ck en fie ld


(    W e represented South Yorkshire P olice in connection with the recent Scrutiny carried out by
     U>rd Justice Stuart-Smith. A s such w e are familiar with the facts and the history o f the
     H illsborough disaster although w e no longer act for South Yorkshire Police, having accepted
     instructions on b eh alf o f the above to represent his interests in the event o f any further
     proceedings directed at individuals.


    Mr D uckenfield w as the superintendent o f police with operational command o f H illsborough
    football ground on the day o f the disaster. H e retired from the police service in 1991 on
    m edical grounds.


    W e are enclosing a copy o f a Sum m ons dated 26th June 1998 indicating that informations
    have been laid before B ootle Magistrates Court by Ann Adlington on b ehalf o f the
    Hillsborough Fam ily Support Group. Our client is summoned to appear on Friday 17th July
    to answer the informations which amount to two counts o f unlawful killing, one count o f
    w ilful neglect to perform a public duty and one count o f doing an act which had a tendency
    to pervert the course o f justice.


    W e are enclosing a copy o f a letter w e have today sent by fax to the Clerk to the South
         °n M agistrates Court questioning the validity o f the Summons. W e do not have their
    response yet. H ow ever w e think this letter is necessary in any event in v ie w o f the steps
    w hich have been taken by the Hillsborough Fam ily Support Group because a private
    prosecution o f som e kind n ow seem s more than likely.


    In the light o f the history o f this case and the previous consideration given to the matter by
    the Crown Prosecution Service, the unrelenting m edia coverage, the Taylor Reports, the civil
    litigation and compensation claim s which have also been made and ultimately the Stuart-Smith
    Scrutiny w e think you may find this a proper case to take over the conduct of.

    Under the Prosecution o f O ffences Act 1985 s.6 you are entitled to take over the conduct o f
    proceedings instituted by a private prosecutor in circumstances where you could have
    instituted those proceedings yourself and you are able to discontinue them under s.23 i f the

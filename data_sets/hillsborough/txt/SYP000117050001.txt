            With          reference         to    the      request        for    account          of       duties       performed                at

            Hillsborough                  13.4,89       I report          as    follows!

            At    8.15         am    Saturday,          13      April     19 8 9 ,    I    reported              for    dutyat         Armthorpe

            Police          Office         and    was      subsequently              transported                 to    Doncaster             D H G for

            onward          transportation                 to    Hillsborough              F o o t b a 11        Ground.

            Around          9.30      am    we    arrived         at     Hillsborough             and       a    briefing             was    held       in

            the       North         Stand.        I was         attached        to    Serial          29    together             with       PC    3145

            Reynolds.

            Following               the    briefing          I took       a    meal       break       and       at    approximately

            11.00         am    the       serial      was       deployed        to    our       respective             points          I was

            allocated               the    road       barrier       at    Leppings             Lane    junction          with          Shenstone

            Road,         together          with      PC     1169      Kerr     and       PC    2840       Pearson.

            As    the       day      progressed            supporters           walked          along       Leppings             Lane       towards

            the       Leppings            Lane    entrance          with       the    numbers          increasing                as    the       time

            passed.             Numerous          supporters             were    drinking             from       cans    and          were

            carrying            as    many       as    four      cans     which       I assumed             they       were       consuming

            prior         to    entering          the      ground        which       was       approx       75       yards       away.

            A    complaint            was    received            from     a    resident          of    Shenst                "                          ecj
|             ])- to     the             effect          that       youths       had    been        urinating                  against       his

 house        wall       therefore                      several       walks       along          the    road          were       made    and

 several           youths                were       prevented          from       walking           down         the       road.

 As     the    afternoon                      progressed             the    amount          of    people          passing          towards          the

 gates        increased                   greatly,             the    majority          of       people          appeared          to    be       in a

 good     mood          with             the       occasional          singing          and       shouting                group.        At    S.30       pm

 approximately                       the       supporters             walking          past       showed          no       signs    of       slowing

 down     and       several                   people          who    were    sat       on    walls          of    local          gardens          had    to

 be     ushered          towards                   the    ground       in a n         attempt          to  get t he m inside prior
                                                                                                         \
 to     the     start            of       the       match       because          it    became          inc r ea si ng l y obvious that

 there        was       no       way          that       they       would    be       inside        before            3    pm.     Many       people

 simply         moved            a       few       feet       away    and    stopped             again       for          no    apparent          reason

 in     fact       many          made          no       attempt       to    get       into       the    ground             until    the       last

 mi n u t es       at    2.45             pm       people       were       still       sat       o u t s i de     a       nearby    fish          shop

 eating         and      drinking                   cans       of    beer/lager.

 It     was     obvious                  that       many       had    been       drinking           although               they    were       not

 drunk        to    the          falling                down    stage.

‘^T^uiri m y       position                   at    the       road    barrier          I saw        numerous               people       climbing

 over     a    wall          near             to    the       turnstiles,             this       continued                for    about       1/4    of

 an     hour       until             a    Police          Officer          who    I believe             was       a       Special       Constable

 (wearing           a    flat             cap)          appeared       on    top       of    the       wall,          even       then    people

 continued              to       climb             to    the    top    of    the       wall,        this         incident          occurred

 sometime           between                   2.30       pm a n d     3.00       pm.

 A    large        number                of    supporters             were       walking          away       from          the    ground,

 mingling           with             approaching                supporters             and       asking          for      any     spare

 tickets,           I would                   estimate          the    ticketless                fans       to    be       in    excess       of

 ■100    (the       ones             who       passed          me).

 Approximately                       3.00          pm m y      attention          was       drawn       to       the       Leppings          Lane

 entrance           by       a       request             to    attend       there       regarding                public          order,       I

 cannot         recall               where          the       request       originated.                 I attended                the    entrance
together          with       PC    Kerr       and          PC    Pearson,           as    I arrived             the    majority             of

the    Police          present          were       either             mounted        branch          on    horseback             or       Special

Constables,             numerous          supporters                   were        climbing          over       the    turnstiles,                   I

pulled       one       youth       back       and          was       instructed           by    a Police          Inspector                who       I

do    not    know       to    close       the          turnstile              doors,       this       was       done    and       the       crowd

of    supporters             present          were          moved          back     to    the       road    side       Of    the          main

gates       which       were       then       closed.                 I remained           on       the    outside          of    the       main

gates.           Qn    my    arrival          at       the       entrance           initially             the    large       gates          into

the    ground          were       closed.

At    this       time       I was       unaware             of       what     was    happening             inside       the       ground,                I

was    not       in    possession             of       a    personal             radio.         After       a    short       while          1

heard       conversation                relating                to    people        inside          the    ground       being

injured,          an    ambulance             arrived                and    was     directed          into       the    ground.

Numerous          people          were    still             milling           around       outside          the       gates       when          a

fire    tender          arrived,          conversation                      was     then       heard       relating          to       3

fatalities,             people          then       slowly             started        to    1eave          the    ground,          further

ambulances             then       arrived          together                with     other       fire       tenders,          by       now

people       were       leaving          the       ground             in    large        numbers          many    were       shouting

abuse       at    Police          Officers             saying          it     was    our       fault       for    opening             the       gate

and    accusing             the    Police          of       killing           people,          the    atmosphere             outside                the

ground       was       so    tense       with          the       obvious           signs       of    hatred       towards             the

Police       that       I was       fully          expecting                an     assault          against       me    and       other

officers.

Word    was       now       being       passed             around          that     there       were       numerous          deaths             and

supporters             were       talking          about             bodies        being       all    over.           Some       of       the

supporters             were       obviously                injured          and     when       offered          help    they          refused

it    and    just       became          abusive             towards           the    officers.

I    remained          outside          the    ground                in a n      attempt        to    keep       the    road          clear

for    emergency             vehicles,             I       returned           to    the    North          Stand       sometime             later

when    the       ground          had    been          cleared.

  I    canngt    say    what l i m e          the    turnstiles       opened          to    the    public       but    can

  say    that    I was    not       aware       of    any    problems       outside          the       Leppings       Lane

  entrance       which    I    could          see    from    my    point.

  I have       performed       duties          at    previous       major    events          at    Hillsborough             and

  have    always       been    in    the       locality       of    Leppings          Lane       there       have    been    no

  serious       incidents       at    previous          events       I have       attended.

  From    my    observations          I would          say    that    the    major          cause       of    the    incident

  was    the    fact    that    so    many          people    arrived       late      and        had    no    intention       of

  entering       the    ground       in       good    time.        They    had    consumed             large    amounts       of

  alcohol       although       only       a    few    were    obviously          drunk r and            there       were

  hundreds       of    supporters             present       without       tickets          who    usually       still       try

  to    gain    entry    any    way       they       can.

  I was    also       asked    by    supporters             where    the    nearest          pub       was.

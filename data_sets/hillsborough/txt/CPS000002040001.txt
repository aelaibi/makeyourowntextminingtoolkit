 These representations are made in opposition to the requests by the defendants to the
  Crown Prosecution Service, asking that the prosecution of the defendants be taken
 over under section 6 (2 ) of the Prosecution of Offences Aet ] 985. for the purpose of
 discontinuing it under scciion 23 (3). These submissions reflect further reading of
 materials that have become available in.the last year, nod are still becoming available.
  Iliey should be read in the light of the documents submitted previously, particularly
 the following:


 (i) informations of 10* July 1998, and supporting document*, laid before the Leeds
 Magistrates Court

<iii) ihe letter from the HFSC5 to Mr Crosum 01*24* August 1998 and supporting
documents.


 rhe M-.SG is a non-political organisation, and draws its members from many walks of
lite. The author o f these representations had no involvement in the ease until Ik*was
instructed in the case in the Judicial Review proceedings as leading counsel in about
September 1993 for the six families. After the hearing* he took no part until the end of
1996. when he was again asked.to advise in the light o f the new evidence discovered,
some of which was the subjcct o f the drama-documentary televised in December
1996. lie then represented and advised the Group before, during and after the
“Scrutiny1*in 1997-8.
  It is re&rolted that this submission and supporting documents conic at a laic stage of
  (he review. The Home Secretary said in Parliament in February 1995J fhal he would
  make available all material in the House of Commons library considered by him “save
  whca* there are overriding reasons for doing otherwise", (/tmiex-A page 1988). The
 attached correspondence (Jm ssJi) shows that this process is incomplete, and that
 obvious omissions have not been made good by the South Yorkshire police. Since
 July 1998. the Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire ha.s Liken it upon himself
 to slop the provision even of documents that tlx? Home Secretary ordered in he
 disclosed. (Sec Tab 17, pages 202-7, file or 24tb August 1998.)


                               The right to prosecute


 Ths fljjht to l?P?sscuW "pnvfltely*- This right wiia preserved specifically by section 6
 o f Ihe Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985. The provision \v4ic reviewed in R v. Row
                    .Court, cx parte South Coast Shipping fomnanv / lrem 96 Cr.
App. R. 405. This is not the occasion for a full review/or the right of private subjects
to prosecute. It is a right o f constitutional importance, and may properly be exercised'
wlierc a “public" body, such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, has declined to *
prosecute.


1 he tests that the Crown Prosecution Scrvicc adopts under its Code fur Crown
Prosecutors were borne well in mind in the decision lo prosecute in this- case. On the
basis of the Taylor findings alone, supported by a proper basis o f witness stolenicnus,
there is a realistic prospect o f conviction tor the oftehces of manslaughter and
misfeasance m public office. Further, the prospect of a conviction for manslaughter is
enhanced by the decision of the House of Lords in R v. ArionuAti j 1995] j /\.C. 151.
However, it is submitted that a "private* prosecutor would be entitled to apply a less
strict test in deciding to prosecute; he need not.follow the text imposed upon itself by
the CPS. The CPS should not approach a review of the present kind on the basis thut
it should apply its own test o f evidential sufficiency.
Public interest and “interests ofjustice- factors arc review'd below. The matters
raised by the defrr*fants will probably form the basis of an application thai the case be
stayed, or oat committed, because the prosecution, it will be said, is engaged in
abusing the process of the court. If the defendants do not for tactical reasons prcstD t
such an argument, the prosecution may well decide to raise this m atter wish the
magistrates' court of its own motion, and may invite the coart, if it wishes, fo bear

evidcncc on the subject.        .


It is submitted that, except in the very plainest of cases, it would be a misuse ol foe
discretion given to the Crown Prosciuuoa Service to take over a pioaecurdon such as
this for the purposes ©^discontinuing iL Arguments about "abuse of process* involve
questions of fact,and evidence. Matters such as die effect of press publicity and
alleged prejudice caused bydel&y &tt evidential and thsy should be subject to
empirical tests. Increasingly, witnesses are called before the tribunals which arc
called upon to dccioe “abuse ofprocess" arguments. Above ail, ail circumstances
should be balanced and weighed in determining whether to stay a ease, and they
 should be considered “in the round'. See lanv.CflmcTOfl £1992] 2 A.C. 205,225F-

the last year at the insistence of the Home Secretary, after the "Scrutiny", which was
not previously in the public domain or known to the families of those who died, and
which has hitherto been concealed in the possession of those who have been held
liable for negligence, the South Yorkshire police.


The significance o f the witness statements disclosed in the course of the "Scrutiny",
and die hundreds of unsworn police statements, edited and unedited, disclosed by the
Home Secretary in 1998, is difficult to overstate, ’l'hey disclose, prima facie, such a
thorough manipulation of the evidence to the past benefit ol the del aidants and South
Yorkshire police in general, that they cause all aspects ot tbe investigation, all known
statements, indexes to evidence and correspondence, to be examined diflcrcmly.


The documentation referred to below is relevant to the defendants* reliance on the
outcome of previous inquiries and investigations. In summary, it indicates the
following:


(a) the alleged independence of the West Midlands police throughout these enquiries
was a sham;                       o ^


(b) the South Yorkshire police statements sent to the, DPI* by West Midlands policc
were known by both forces uv include edited statements: the “undertaking” given by
Mr Mervyn Jones o f West Midlands Police (“Scrutiny* report page 213) that he
would not release the unedited statements to the Taylor Inquiry discloses u principal-
agent relationship inconsistent with independence;


<c) West Midlands police allowed full or at least wide access to the papers in the case
lo South Yorkshire police at the inquest, civil proceedings (and presumably the Taylor
Inquiry), while denying it tt> the Uyeipool families;


(d) the statements and documents sent to the DPP in 1990 were the result o f a
 calculated selection, from which many statements of central importance were
       >/      O i 'j i „ j U i   S \J Li




             excluded, and which included edited statements of policc officers;


            (e) Hammond Suddards, solicitors to South Yorkshire policc, and in particular IVter
             Metcal i\ have acted under a serious conflict of interest in the course of previous
            inquiries', and continue to deny acecss to the Liverpool families 10 the South Yorkshire
            archive. No protest is made at this by the defendants, whose defcnce, it is believed, is
            funded by the Sooth Yorkshire Police Authority, and one of whom, Mr Duckenficld.
            is represented hy solicitors who acted for the South Yorkshire police in the “Scrutiny".


                                            Sufficiency o f evidence


12          Jt has already been pointed out in previous submissions that the Taylor findings in
            themselves amount almost to a prima facie case of manslaughter by gross negligence
            and of misfeasance. The decision to open the gates without taking steps to diverT the
            oncoming spectators .was a “blunder of the first magnitude" and w as an immediate
            (and therefore substantial) cause of death. The decision was token by DuckenfiekK
            with the agreement or acquiescence of Murray.


13          The witness statements already provided to the dcfcncc and DPP provide cogent
     • evidential support for the manslaughter and mi.sfcas8ncc allegations, combined with
            admissions of fact-made by each defendant in his various statements, and evidence to
            the Inquest and the Taylor Inquiry. Exhibit* such as videos, photographs, plans etc, in
            support o f the Taylor findings are not to hand, bccause the South Yorkshire police,
            with the encouragement of the Director .of Public Prosecutions, refuse to hand them
            over pending the outcome of this review.          .


14     In an offcnee in this spccics of involuntary manslaughter, following Adomako, the
            prosecution must prove: (a) a duty of care; (b) a breach of that duty; (c> thin that
            breach was a substantial cause of death; (c) "The essence of the matter which is
            supremely a jury question, is whether having regard to the risk of death involved the
            conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the circomstances as to amount in their

                                                       5
        judgment to a criraijial act or omission." per Lord Mocksy l.C JJ995 f 1 A.C. J X7Ff.


        It is submitted that all elements but the last have never been seriously disputed. The
        remaining element is for the jury. Lord Taylor found, and it is Inherent in the
        acceptance of liability by Soutb Yorkshire police m the various negligence cases, that
        the police were under a duly, and that there was a breach of Ihe duly ufcatx;.
        causative of death. See also FrOSly- Chief Constable of the.Sputh Yorkshire PoKct:
        11997) I AI1.K.R. 540, 544b-c, per Rose IJ:


               ""I he immediate cause of the disaster wus a senior officer's decision to open
               the outer gate without cutting off access to the pens. Uabiiiiy for die deaths
               and injuries of those spectators has been admitted by the three defendants, the
               first of whom is the Plaintiffs Chief Constable."


I f>   The statem ent o f ihe 35 spectator witnesses which have been served on the defence
       sind DPP prove this negligence, taken together with the transeripis o f evidence given
       by the two defendants to Ihe Taylor Inquiry and the inquest. The statements should be
       read in full. It is not intended hereto set out Ac evidence as might be appropriate in
       an opening speech, nor to treat the CPS in this review as ar. examining magistrate, ’
       considering whether a case to answer is made out on the papers.


Some features o f ihe evidtsnce already served.


       Some conspicuous features of the 35 witnesses ate ss follows, whh a few references.
       In ‘988 police officers diverted spectator; away from the tunnel leading to those pens,
       (eg Hilion, page S). The unedited statements of White and Lang, submitted on 2 4 -
       August, prove the same, and suggest that it had been the practice of senior officers to
       ensure that the tunnel was closed when ihe pens were'fizli, something that could be
       seen easily by White from the steps near the Control Box. This police evidence whs
       suppressed until 1998. In 1989, when the gate was opened* a rush of people carried
       spectators straight into the tunnel, and it was impossible to turn back (Cook).

21    The basis of the charges of misfeasance and attcmpti ng to pervert the course ot j ustice
      is dear from the Taylor interim report, and the informations and submissions lodged
      at Leeds. The HFSCr cannot obtain the important statement of Graham Kelly of the
      Football Association, because South Yorkshire policc refuse to supply it. or even a
      copy. It is intended that Kelly and two witnesses from Liverpool football Club. Peter
      Robinson, and H.H. Judge linsor, will be called to say they heard Duckcntield’s lie. It
                                          •I .: !>• •
      was said after deaths had been caused. It will be argued it was an obvious attempt to
      impede inquiries, and to suppress the truih.


22    In leading counsel’s opinion, there is sufficient evidence on which to commit for irial
                                    •. .   -JXj-•. «i-. -
      already. If, for the soke of argument, committal proceedings were to begin in a
      week's time, without any. farther disclosure by South Yorkshire policc, the
      prosecution would call the 35 spectator witnesses, the three policc witnesses whose
      evidence has been served (cxcept Guest, who is dead), other oflicen;, and a number of
      live witnesses, including Kelly4on the basis o f transcripts of the evidence given.


23    Hie prosecution has already identified farther witnesses from tin: transcripts of
      evidence given at the T a y lo r Inquity^and some from the Coroner s proceedings, who
       it might call at committal, a n d police:officers who were at the ground, who lave made
       contact with us. It is not necessary, to. identify thfiir names at this stage. 1here is no
       rcuson to believe that &committing magistrate would lake a different view of this
       evidence from Lord Taylor. It has.been agreed at’thc magistrates court that the old
       pro* 1997 committal rules govern the case, becausc a policc investigation took place
       before 1* April 1997. The provisions of Ac Criminal Procedure and Investigations
       Act 1996 do not apply.


 24   For the reasons that appear lielow, however* there can be little doubL that the archive
       ofstaicmcnts and exhibitsinthcpossession of the South Yorkshire policc will add
       significantly to tfco p r o s e c id o tt^ at continittal, and then at trial. Assuming that the

The absence o f ddluilcd information unlil 1997-8


2o     it has been an important part or the prosecution’s approach to the Director s current
       review,   and o f our justification for bringing criminal proceedings in 1998, that the
       lltSG has been deprived o          f   wferpation- statements and documents about the
       disaster tor nine years. At                      in I9*9,*a policy appears u> have been

        by the lime the Director o fl’ublie Prosccuuon* became involved fecftudly in August
        im


 27     U will be noted Ifel M i s s Steel did hot say that these statements became generally
        available to the families collcctivcly: only, in caeh case, to a particular solicitor. Ilic

         distribute these. rather ih »  original.) However, after <be end o f the I aylor
      Inquiry, when the DPP investigation began, this policy changed permanently.
      Information and statements were guarded closely. The investigations conducted by the
      West Midlands police for the DPP, Coroner and Police Complaints Authority put an
      end to the policy of disclosure, except in isolated instances.


29    The new information the Divisional CV>url was asked to consider iti ihe 1993 Judicial
      Review had been obtained by dint of the persistence of individual families,
      dissatisfied and at times appalled by the fact that South Yorkshire police appeared to
      tiavc access to inforrhation, whilst they themselves had liule. The Divisional Court s
      judgment of SIh November 1993 records only n few of those efforts and the statements
      discov-ercd, but the feet that the substance of the various 'investigations was unknown
      10 them is evident from a reading of the transcript as a whole.


30    Over the years, more evidence became available, sometimes accidentally and
       haphazardly, and often after many frustrated efforts. The appointment ot the
       “Scrutiny* of U rd Juslicc Stuart-Smith followed intense ruitional nnd televised
       publicity about material which bad been discovered after the inquests.


31    Only the open approach of the Home Secretary in 1998, in siark contrast to the
       miserly approach of the police forces and the Coroner to the dissemination of
       information, has permitted the 111‘SG to obtain the information a* which to embark
       with confidence on prosecutions. The information now available, it is clear,
        undermines the inquest verdicts o f accidental death, and calk into question the
        validity of all previous investigations.


 The decision to prosecute


 32     I laving advised the HFSG fa reg io n to the •Semtiny'.the author was          * -M *
        m possible briber steps. I V report of Lord Justice Stuart-Sraith. published in
        February 1998. was regarded with profound disappointment and fmstniion. u. say the
        least, insofar as it related to the new evidence. It seemed important that a decision as
to how to procccd, if at all. should be taken after a pause lor reflection, and alter the
material examined by Lord Justice Stuart-Smiih wus disclosed as promised by the
Home Secretary in Parliament. (See remarks of die Home Secretary, 1lansard, d m xz
&. However, the first batch o f statements of the South Yorkshire police arrived in
I.ivurpool only a few days before the uuthor went to Liverpool in April to address the
members of the HFSG about future action, and it seemed wrong to delay a decision ui

principle further-


leading counsel's advice, delivered orally to the Group, and beforehand to the
Committee in writing, was that the findings oF Lord Justice I aylor had surs ived
inuici for •>years. They had been upheld by the Sluart-Krotth report. Prosecutions lor
manslaughter, misfeasance and attempting to pervert the course o) justice
 (Duckentleld’s "disgraceful lie" )were justified. Prosecutions for additional oflences
 on the basis of the new material were feasible in spite of the "Scrutiny". However, the
 Group was advised that it might be better to confine any prosecutions to tlw plain
 original facte, in order to avoid long and expensive technical trials involving expert
 evidence about videotapes and cameras.


 The other reasons put forward by counsel, relating to the'present charges, were similar
 lo those that appeared in the written submissions attached to the informations
 presented in July to Ihe I*cds Magistrates Court. There was evidence, in law. to
 justify prosecution. Whether to proceed, it w-as argued, was a decision for the Group.
  The HKSG decided that afternoon to accept counsel's advice, to instruct him to
  consider the various statements that had come to light before and in Ihe course ot the
  “Scrutiny\ and to formulate charges accordingly on the basis of the 1 ay lor imdmgs.


  It was only after that decision was taken, and after members of the HFSli and counsel
  had read the police statements disclosed by the Home Secretary, that it appeared that
  there had been, on the race of things, a sustained suppression of th* truth in the course
  of the original investigations which went fer beyond the matters which had been
   alleged by the HFSG, and                           *> ** ‘Sdruti^ ’ in * c fiwt p,WX*

 The edited South Yorkshire police sUtlcmenLs


 ;<(>    ()n 24lh August 1998 statements were sent by the Hl’SG lo the CTS demonstrating llw
         practice of editing, by which, it was submitted, the DPP and counscl had been misled
         in 1990. (See pages I to IV of the file suhmitleU on that day.) Further examples (see
         attached new file Annex D) have been selected.which. shew again, strikingly, the
         practicc of deleting factual matters, which officers had originally asserted in writing,
         und which were prejudicial to South Yorkshire officers, these examples provide
         further evidence that I.ord Justice Sluari-SmitJu also, was misled on this subjcei in the
         coursc of his “Scrutiny’'.


  37     There are dorens o f other instances of editing, of varying degrees ol culpability,
         extending, in total and nature, fer beyond the cases set out in the report of 1x>rd Justice
         Stuurt-Smith. Unfortunately, some of these statements have still not been supplied, as
         i.s apparctU from, for example, the Master Witness List, and the exercise of examining
          them is therefore incomplete. Two corcpicuous missing statements are those of Hoke
          and Sykes. Ibe utsk o f comparing those .edited and unedited statements
          comprehensively is vast. -The time spent on the exercise must have already have
          exec-tided substantially the time available to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith or ihc people on
          whom he relied in 1997.


) ?,Jt    The HFSG has litUe doubt that the statements provided by South Yorkshire police
          officers, where there were two versions, were die edited ones- It was pointed out in
          the letter o f 24* August 1998 that the page numbers on the index in the Master
          Witness List o f April 1990, prepared by the West Midlands policc for pnatentauon to
          the DPI*, indicated this. The staieto en ts referred to in that list formed the basis of the
          West Midlands Police Report. An Sample was shown of un edited statement being
          one page shorter *han the pages set oui in Ihe index to that list. I lie extra page was
           probably u Criminal Justice Act statement, attesting to tlie truth of the attached
            unsworn statement. 01 would be interesting lo know, if this inference is cornel,
           ' whether those formal statements Were on West Midlands or South Yorkshire witness
            statement forms, or, perhaps, on paper which boic the printed name of neither force.)


    .10     The material which the HFSG las now supplied demonstrates by itself lhal a policy
            was adopted by die South Yorkshire police of withholding information, critical to Ihc
            issue of negligence, from U x i Juslic<! Taylor in 1TO (so Tar as they were able), the
            Director in 1990, the Coroner between lW>and W l. and, presumably. the l-ofcc
            Complaints Aulhority between 1990 and 1992.' How much more is there in the

i^niftccincc o f the. Phillips "Inquiry ansi Report"


  The HKSG learned of the Phillips “Inquiry and Report” only in the                   coutsc   of
  correspondence during the *Scrutiny". Attached sk Annex F arc letters of 8J’ August 1997
  (which contained the first refoenee to the report which the HFSG saw). lO* and 19c’
  September and 6* October). 'Hie first of these letters claims that the rcjx?rt was ordered
  for civil litigation. The report itself is; dated4August 19W . the same month in which the
  DPP decided not to prosecute.


  Ibc origins of this report are not entirely clear. It is suggested that the South Yorkshire
  Policc commissioned it. but the report would obviously have been relevant to Ihc various
  investigations of the West Midlands policc... Attached as Annex.it are extracts from thal
  report, namely, the covorsbeet, contents page, and pages 1-4.41,92-3. 100-105.148-9.
  I    !73. and Appendix C. (The whole report will be supplied lo the CPS on request.)
  The conclusion indicated that the report attributed negligence (but weakly) to
  Ouclcenftcfd and Murray, suggested that fault was broadly spread, and offered mitigation
  for the negligence shown. It was highly sympathetic to South Yorkshire police.


  The date of the report is significant. Counsel advised against prosecution on 6 * August
  1990. but “contribution hearings* were pending in the High Court, to be lusinl in October
  1990. at which the division ofliabilily between the police, football club, and engineers
  was to be established, and proportional financial contributions to damages were to be
          determined. Th«s reference to the closing of the tunnel in IV88 at pm*cs 92-3 ol the Report

         Midlands Policc Report in April 1990. Other very important edited statements have not
         been disclosed yet by the South Yorkshire police, in spite of the Home Secretary s
         instruction of February 1998.


53       (iiven the circumstances set out above, it is impossible lo argue that there is no relevant
         material to which the Director did apt have access in 1990, and every reason to believe
         that the documentation submitted in 1990 was chosen with partiality; and that the archive
         held in Sheffield conUiins further relevant and important material that lias been carefully
         withheld from the.Director and the Coroner, and which is adverse to the South Yorkshire
         police and the defendants.


The seleciivc supply o f information 10 the Coroner


54       The defendants refer, in connection with their arguments in favour ol discontinuing ihc
          prosecutions, lo the findings ofaccidental death by the Coroner's jury. On Monday 14*
          September 1998, the author of these representations, togetlier with Ann Adhngton and
          Philip Hammond of the HFSG. inspected documents in Sheffield given in evidence at the
          inquest, and which were now made available in accordance with Rule 57 of the Coroners’
          Rules 1984. The present Coroner. Christopher Domes, told us that among the Coroner, s
          archive is a copy of the West Midlands Police Report, sent t<>ihc DPP in 1990. Thosaroc
          incomplete material, including the edited statements, was sent to Dr Popper in 1990. ("nun

          about 200 witnesses, of whom, it should be nolcd, only 56 had given cv jdence u> the

          Taylor Inquiry.


    55     This selection produced a wildly different emphasis to that contained in the Taylor
           report. Attached to these representations is ail analysis prepared by Ann Adlmglon,
           contrasting the findings of Lord T   a y lo r   with the summing-up of the Coroner. idntuzJi)-

           ■as in ihe 571 statements tendered to the DPP.

5(>        The Director knows from recent correspondence of our deep concerns that the South
           Yorkshire police hold all the original papers in the ease, and that the 1hrcclor has pven
           -guidance", apparently under the Prosecution of .Offences Act 1985, thai the ( hief
           Constable might decide against disclosing these, or copies, until she has completed her

           officers who the prosecution wishes to interview. (Tab 17. file ol 24h August 1998)


  58        Mr Kennedy .of the C r o w   n P ro s e c u fib n   Service has said that “voluntary disclosure is
            inappropriate at this stage, and that he understands that the archive is ihe property <>f

      59    In search of the origin of the jngwraeht that South Yorkshire policc •‘owned* the archive,
            members o f the Group have looked back to previous correspondence and events in rl>e
            early yearn after the disaster and have examined them in the light of the material now
            available. The true position is that West Midlands policc appear lo have regarded
            themselves as agents or s e r v a n t s of South Yorkshire policc in the dissemination, eoutml
            and protection of information, and in the presentation of Taels In the DPP. Coroner and
             PC A, and to a lesser extent Lord Taylor.
60     U is now apparent that throughout oil the enquiries in lhb case, the South Yorkshire

The roles o f the West Midlands Police


bI     The ostensibly independent West Midlands police force has reported to. and collected
       evidence for, four official bodies:


       a)       I.ord Justice Taylor's Inquiry of 1980, which reported to the 1lome Secretary;


       h)       'I'hc Director of Public Prosecutions in 1989 and 1990;


       c)       The Coroner’s Inquest between. 19th AprilT989and theend of March 1991;


        d)       The Policc,C om pile A u t l ^ ^                   of investigations made by officers
                 from, not only West Midlands, but from a v<*iety of other police liirces into-
                 complaints made against a number of South Yorkshire officers.


 (i2    In these circumstances, it would seem obvious to ihc layman that the papers in the case
        would belong to one o ro th e r o f these four bodi«»* who would »»etj be expected to retain
        them tor copics. if one of the other bodies had the originals.) Alternatively, it might
        possibly be thought normal th a tth c West'Midlands police might retain the originals or
        copies. In fed, the South Y o A s h i r e police appear to hold the entire archive, c*ccpt for

         such copies as are stored by the Coroner.

             no weight could be attached to its reports, and the value of the conclusions or those to

             whom their officers reported is diminished.

        71    This fourth investigation, conducted by Ihe South Yorkshire police, appears to have had
               lull and unimpeded access » aU the papers, unrestrained by any restrictions imposed by
               West Midlands police. See the two-page memorandum of Peter Carr. R1A for example,
               daled 25'Jt April, in which he spoke of the briefing which the Chier Constable (of South
               Yorkshire) bad with “Operational Staff” on I(A 17* and 19th April- He aho referred ti

               police not taken these exhibits for their own inquiries?


        72      It is clear from the report o fU rd Justice Stuart-Smith that the South Yorkshire offiecn
                drafted their own statements, and that the editing was done not by West Midland* oll.cers

On 30lh Octobcr 1990, Hammond Suddarrfs were represented at a !iimrxss Meeting hy
Belinda Noreliffc ofllammond Suddards. (She had announced at payo \ ol ihc mimiiir-?
ore* March 19 9 0 that she wils fr o m lhat fir m ). The Coroner announced at thul meeting
(pages 9 -1 1 o f the minutes for that day) that he would not he distributing copies of
statements 21 the inquest (p L0 - 11) and &lso thzt he wo\i!d not be circulunnti a list ot
witnesses he intended to call (middle o f page 10). He also announced that he was
proposing to impose a “cuL-oIT1time in respect of the disaster, after which                no events
would be ibe subject of inquiry.


The claim of *aocncv". Attached is correspondence of November 199!) in the eases c<*
Sarah and Victoria Tlicks fJrw & M ■ On 15* November 1990. Mervyn Jones. Assistanl
Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police, wrote to the solicitor Tor Trevor Hicks.

 The letter made it clcsr that a sUiie.’ncnt of Paul fayior couklnei he released wiu.n.t t
 permission of South Yorkshire policc. The utterly extraordinary assertion is made that,
 the West Midlands police were “constitutionally’ the agent of South Yorkshire poRcc.

formed one of The grounds on which judicial review was applied for in 1993, and is
discussed in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's report.


In this connection, therefore, Mr Mervyn Jones gave the advice tlmt the South Yorkshire
policc wys responsible for advising on the question of disclosing mutters relevant to the
jury's decision: the South Yorkshire police had the "ownership" of the information. The
actions or the South Yorkshire police were of course at the centre of the inquest. They
were under attack. The proposition that the Coroner hud had responsibility for the release
of information at some earlier period, but did not have it as the main inquest was uboul
to begin, is ridiculous and legally indefensible. The conflict of interest in South
Yorkshire policc and their lawyers whs scverv.


The role o f Chief Superintendent Bcechev. The letters to and front Sandra Stringer
throw further light on this (Annex A/VOn 28ih March 1991 Chief Superintendent
Beechey of the West Midlands Police, on behalf of Mavyn Jones, wrote to Mrs Stringer
in terms adapted from the letter to Mr flicks o f November 199tl. Mr Reechcy \x name
will be familiar to the CPS. lie was fortunately able to find the lime to prepare himsell
for the task of acting as Coroner's officer, which, lie eventually performed on a daily
basis, because, as a formerHead of.’(fy&Wcii Midlands Serious Crime Squad, he had been-
removed in August 1989 from operational duties after that squad had Ixxn disbanded, so
low had its reputation sunk.


These facts are set out in "Unsafe and Unsatisfactory*, an independent report by T*r i
Kaye in 1091. Appendixes A and C to that report arc attached (dftnexJl). Appendix A
supplies the interesting information that- in.X989-90, West Midlands investigated South
Yorkshire; (page 85); South Yorkshire investigated West Yorkshire; and West Yorkshire
in turn investigated West Midlands, Nodoubt do serious lsults in policc officers were
detected by any of these enquiries. Appendix C shows that Becehey was removed Irom
operational duties in August 1989,-but was restored in tune to act as Coroner s officer lor
the bulk o f the inquest from 30* November 1990. and to deal with the question of
disclosure o f information.

       l he penultimate paragraph of ficcchcy’s letter to Sandra Stringer of 28th March 1W ]
      indicates that the South Yorkshire policc had “directed" him not to disclose material, after
      advice had been taken: South Yorkshire were ihc “principals" of Ihc information.
      Information could only be released on the order of a court which could includc that of the
      coroner. In the course of the inquest, Mr Hicks had not been told of the advice that had
      been given, pxessaafciy by Ifanusosd Saddacds. t he transcripts of the inquest
      proceedings show no reference to the disclosure of statements. The notification of this
      new poJicy came too Jate. The 28th March was thy last day of the inquest.


W    V, hilc the inquest was continuing, therefore, and South Yorkshire police had tiic power
      u» determine disclosure, they, the "principals*, did not disclose. Only when the inquest
     was over was it alleged that the legal advice was to the effect that the Coroner could have
     taken thus decision. 'I'he Coroner’s approach to this question, and the seven* difficulties
      facing the families before, during, and after the inquesr, ore evident from the letters in
     A n n ex M.



91   It may be expected that, if South Yorkshire police had access to all die material in 1990-1
     for the inquest and for civil proceedings, the individual officers who were represented .ut-
     the inquest also had similar access. No conflict of interest appears to have embarrassed
     Hammond Suddards or indeed Winkworth and Pemberton, the lawyers who advised ilie
     South Yorkshire police in the course of the “Scrutiny". Winkworth and Pemberton
     reminded the CPS of this when they wrote on Mr Duekenllcld's bclxil f in July 190S. The
     UI’SG beiieves that South Yorkshire Police Authority are funding the defence of both
     defendants, and the close relationship between that force and the defendants is further
     proved by the fact that Duckenficld instructed lawyers who had worked closely wiih the
     South Yorkshire police, and -who. it is to be presumed, have knowledge of the history of
     the control o f documents in this ease.

            •said at the “Business Meeting- on 30* October 1%'G foar he would not distribute copy
            statements. (Iowyo-, it now appcaxs that the West Midlands policc. aclinj: amon&oihcr
            capacities as Coroners’ olliccrs. had been supplying copies of statements ofl.iverpool
           supporters to the South Yorkshire policc before tlwt date. This is apparent from
           Appendix C lo (he Phillips ReporL Phillips had bcen ssked in October 1989, allegedly
           by the South Yorkshire police, to prepare an inquiry and Report" into the policing of the
           match by South Yorkshire police, and had also been asked at some point to inquire into
           Uic behaviour o f Liverpool supporters on the occasion of ihc di.sa.srcr.

           It will be scon from the Appendix to the report that, although most of those witnesses
           gave evidence at the Taylor-inqiarjr,                   did not, and ii is reasonable to conclude that
           (heir statements came to Mr PftiU i^fokStm ih Yorkshire police, who in turn obtained

          documents wanted for use at the inquest. If Jones was telling the truth. South
          Yorkshire was able to deprive the families of materials at the in q u e s t, hut to have fu ll
          or extensive access, as the Phillips report shows, lo the statements and evidence
         collected by the West Midlands police. In this way, the inquest, ostensibly objective
         and dispassionate, is now shown lo have been manipulated by S o u th Yorkshire police
         for their own ends, and by West Midlands policc. For this reason, the defendants are
         not   entitled to rely upon the inquest verdicts to put an end to ihis pmsecution.

    The continuing role o f Hammond Suddards


%         Peter Mctcalf of Hammond Suddards continued lo advise South Yorkshire police on
          (he subject of disclosure after the inquest. See, for example, the letter from Miss Steel
          to Mr Teareof 16,hJuly 1991 contained in Annex N.         Metcalf is, of course, the
          lawyer who is currently advising the South Yorkshire police not to disclose any of the
          documents in their possession to anyone at all. He has written to the HFSO that "That
          policy will continue to be applied impartially Lo prosecutor, defendants und to any
          olhcr parly” (letter of 17'hAugust, page 202 of Hie submitted on 24"' August) and "In
          the interests o f fairness and justice this policy will apply to all requests received.”
^         (letter 7rt' August, same file, page 206).


97        Mr Metcalf did ro t reveal, as we have recently been informed by a confidential
          so time, that South Yorkshire Police Authority a»v funding the defence of the present
          defendants; a fact which he mt^hl have thought it proper to disclose when he claimed
          a principled impartiality in the handling of confidential materials, and when lw
          a&serted tlial neither he nor the Chief Constable was aware of <u\y conflict of interest.
                                                                       t


I ‘J 99-199 1; The rule o f the Police Complaints 'Authority


l>#       ()n the retirement o f Geoffrey Dear & the beginning of April 1990. iho investigation
^         supervised by the PCA was taken oyer by the Chief Constable of the Cumbria police.
          Attached as Annex P arc a number of PCA formal reports of Aujiuxi 1990, which
          suggest that officers from the Cumbria police force performed a centml investigative
          role after April 1990.


99        On 111**July 1991 the Policc Complaints Authority diicctcd the South Yorkshire
          Policc lo bring disciplinary charges for neglect o f duty against D u ck en field and
          Murray. On 26'* July 1991, Mr 13uckenfield. who had been suspended from duly in
          August 1989 after the interim report of I x>rd Taylor, went on “sick leave*, though still
           suspended.



100         On 1Q,s November 2991, the Chief Constable cf Sou* Yorkshire ref:ivd Mr
           Ducken field on health grounds, after a report had been submitted by a local police
           surgeon. Thereafter. South Yorkshire police asked permission «o abandon the charge
           against Mr Murray, and were dlowed to by Ihtr PCA, on the fiftwhd that *«would *
           ■unfair* to proceed against Mr Murray for wha» was in effect a.joint chur^c. A public
           announcement to this effect was made on 13* January 1m                        Subsequently. Mr
           Murrav also retired on “health grounds".


    i 01    It is submitted that no proper legal basis can exist tor claiming that documents.
^           collected for the Police Complaints Authority by the Cumbria police, can he said to be
            the properly ofSouth Y orkshire. Those reports mast contain confidential mutenal
            about the conduct of South Y o r k s h i r e police officers. Can it possibly he said that
            Cumbria policc or the PCA w e r e the "agents’ of South Yorkshire police?


    The law relating H> accexs ti* policc documents


     1U2    There is no reason to impute bad faith to the Cotoner for his decision oRO* October.-
             I ‘390 not to disclose statements. though the decision was depressing unhelplul: no
             doubt he was ignorant o f the feet that South Yorkshire had had copies or the West
             Midlands material. If the Coroner had known that, it is impossible lo imagine that he
£            would have withheld access to those statements by the bereaved families.


     103     There have b c e n   a n u m b er o f c a s e s in   the last twenty years m wluch the courts have
             considered the confidentiality or papers acquired by police in the course ol
             investigations.   In a le tte r   to S a e d ia   S trin ger   aidzHKsJV above, the Coroner, Mr
             Dome* wrote on a dare in 1093 that he was constrained by the ciuse o t g_v,

104        II is submitted that this approach by Mr Domes, advanced in good faith. is wrong.
           The Peach ense decides only that where documents have been compiled or trailed by
           a police force in the course of a disciplinary enquiry into its own officers, those
           papers remain the property of the policc force. Jn this ease, Jones was appointed by

106        'l'his is not the occasion for a consideration as to whether the Chief Constable of South
            Yorkshire Police can claim public interest immunity for the archive he holds.
            However, until the *W‘ileVcase. it seemed clear that if documents had been collected or
            obtained for the purpose,prfecipaliy, ofa disciplinary investigation into complaints
            against police officers, public interest.inununjiy’attached to those documents on a
            “class* basis. Hcncc* if it could be ciairncd that Apolice force was taking statements
^          for the primary purpose of investigating complaints, it was very hard lor members ol
            the public or interested parties to obtain copies.


107           However, the existence of thi$ line of cases suggests that the South Yorkshire police
             believed that they couki claim possession or the estire archtvc on the ground that they
             had appointed V/cst Midlands police to investigate matters o f n disciplinary character,
             that West Midlands pulicc had therefore been its “agents’*: and that, as a further
             advantage, public interest immunity alioched to the contents ol the arehivc.

    i OS   it is submitted that such a claim would be wholly           even absurd, and tha*. the
           pnisceuiion is being wrongly frustrated in its legitimate desire to obtain sight ol
           probative statements to give further support to its case. The documents arc nut toe
           property of Soulh Yorkshire: they surely "belong to” one or niore o f ihc various
           otticial bodies that have inquired into the case.


    10<)   1lowcver, the very claim of ownership by South Yorkshire. and the alleged

            abuse o f process application to consider *in the round*, together with all other relevant
            factors. Any prejudicial publicity in this case towards the defendants is minor
            compared to that against defendants in the eases of Rosemary Wesu Kevin and lan
            Maxwell, the James Bulger defendants, the Kray brothers, the Guinness trial, the
            proposed Lockerbie defendants, the M o o ts murderers, a n d muny others. In fact, as
            Lord Taylor found, there was widespread, false and defnmorory propaganda put about
            in 1989 by South Yorkshire police officers to the prejudice ofUvcrpool supported
            This prejudice has never boeri completely dispelled.

                                The limitations ofihr Stuiirf-Stnljh report


      111    The defendants invite the CPS to heed the conclusions of the Scrutiny . It is
             submitted that the conclusions of Lord Justice StnartrSn'iith in relation to new
             evidence’ arc not significant in this review. 1 hat report upheld the general approach of
             Lord Taylor, on which the prosecution relics, bur its review or “new evidence'’ was
             confined lo the evidence tendered as new in 1996. However, that exorcise was
             necessarily a limited one, bccausc the i .iverptioi families hiui bihiii starved o« evioctice
             for years. The existence of the edited statements was unknown. One example only.
             l\t.\ Frost, was offered to the “Scrutiny* by a third party. The scale of the editing, now
             revealed, exceeds anything shown to I-ord Justice Stuart-SiuiUi.


     ^ 1 2   Further. it is subnv.ticd that cautionhas lw be- esiployed »n acccpting feels set out in
             the report, il has been pointed out that the conclusions about the edited statements arc
             seriously wrong. The dates on page J, in paragraphs 4 and 5. should road 11* July
              1991 and 19* November 1991. Duckcttfteld did nol.rctire at the beginning of (he
              main inquest, l ie gave evidence to it in full uniform. 1he "autumn ol 1v-/0 in
              paragraph 6 should read *30?.Aagwi;JW * ln paragraph 15. page S7. it is wrongly
              asserted that the main inquest began in March 1991: in fact it began on )9mNovember
              1990.


       113    The South Yorkshire policy of making statements available u» relatives, described at
              pages 89-90, is inconsistent with jhe history ordifficuity experienced by. for example,
              Sandra Stringer (See Annex N*. above). The discussion of the decision not u»
              prosceutc for manslaughter (page 10, paragraphs 53,56 and 57) uses the word
              “recklessness*. There is no recogmtion of the significance of the decision in
              Adomnkn- which replaces the complicated -recklessness" test apparently applied in
               1990, and reinstated the grossnegligence test.


       114    'Ihc Sluart-Smith report is itself economical with information. For example, only
              small parts or the advice o f c o ^ i in 1990 are set out. The provision or the whole

                 advice is required, so lhat the whole reasoning is apparent, rather than a l'cw snippets.
             Clearly, privilege has been waived by the provision of that report to the “Sep.!Liny*.
                 Why do South Yorkshire police have the advice and the West Midlands police report?
             If the CPS advises that a driver should not be prosccutcd for manslaughter, a copy of
             that udvicc ia not sent to him or his employer. Why does tho Coroner have the West
                 Midlands police report in addition to the statements? Does behave the advicc of
             counsel? Why in these circumstances is the prosecutor in this cose not given access to
             these: documents’?


    115          The terms of reference of the "Scrutiny* are set out at pages v and vi. They called
                 upon Lord Justice Stuart-Smithto examine whether any evidence existed which was
                 not available to, among others, the DPP. The knowledge avaiiaoic to the l-fl;SO now.
                 from the 35 statements, the Master Witness List,-and the edited statements, proves that
                 maieria! was not available,                information of a critical kind 113.4 been withheld.


    116          There is no evidence that I/Ord Justice Siuari-Snitth saw the Master Witness List, or
                 knew what maierial the DPP had considered. There is no ground to believe that he
                 sought to compare the evidence available to the Director with the total evidence
                 available. He looked only at the comparatively smalt pieces of new evidence then *-•
                 known to the families. A -Scrutiny* is an unusual legal animal. Absolutely no
                 opportunity was given to the HFSG,befoce it was published, to see the edited and
                 unedited unsworn statements. Ths Group was eviti denied access lo the statement of
                 p.C. Bichard, whose account was ait the centre of the matters under investigation.
                 Control over the archive was maintained.


    117          If the HFSG had known then what the Home Secretary has allowed it to discover
                 since, it is submitted that the result of the “Scnriny” would have been very different,
                 and that the flaws and partiality of previous investigations would have been exposed.
                  A “Scrutiny* is an inquiry, it seems, with little opportunity for those whose concerns
                  have prompted its csablisfcraent to ask questions, only tobe questioned. *1be account

  Jusiicc Stuart-Smith referred to them casually in discussion with one of the families.

  1 lie IlFSG docs not have copies o f the West Midlands police report nor the advice of
 cmuiscl. It is submitted that justice requires ihal they should he disclosed lo the
 Group. In TL^JSannte [3996] 1 Cr. App. R. 463. Lord Taylor CJ puinied out at page
 479B-C and 485C that the Serious Fraud Oi’Llce and Department oH'rade and
 Industry bad disclosed in that appeal quantities of documents ilmt would nonnully be
 expected to attract claims of public interest immunity und legal professional privilege.
 Public bodies are usually prepared to disclose matters when they have nothing to hide,
 considerations ol confidentiality notwithstanding. When the documents they possess
 are embarrassing, they seek to withhold them by invoking the “public interest” nnd
 “privilege”.


 I he recent .secrecy of the Soujft Yorkshire police, acting under the advice of
 Hanunond Suddards, merely intensifies the justified belief of the Liverpool families..
 that they have been manipulated an<i chcated over the years, that the DPP wus misled
 in 1090 when he took his decision on the basis o f careiuily selected mutcriui. und that
 the course of justice has been perverted.


 ( opics of these submission and supporting documents will he sent lo the Home
 Secretary and Attorney-General, who was included in the terms o f reference set out in
 Lord Justice Stuart-Sraith’s report, and to those Liverpool Members of Parliament
 who have supported the HFSG this year in attempting to obtain fulier access to (lie
 materials considered in tte “Scrutiny", us promised by the I lome Secretory.

        A summary of the evidence on this charge was not attempted in the substantial
        Representations of 24* September 1998. The evidence of this charge against Mr
        Uuekeniield is compelling, and much stronger, it is submitted, than wa> prescnte to
        the DPP by West Midlands Police in i99u. The fact that previous inquiries were

       Dear Mr Croston

       Adlin^ton v Murray: Adlington v Duckenfield

       Supplementary     Representations on behalf of the Prosecutor

       1.        On 8"’ October 1998 representatives o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group
                 attended the Public Record Office at Kew, to search for documents, and to test the
                 various claims of “public interest immunity", “legal professional privilege”, and other
                 confidentiality which have been made, notably by the South Yorkshire police, but also
                 by the Home Office, CPS and West Midlands police. They there obtained a copy of
                 the West Midlands Police Report of October 1989, which the Home Office had placed
   ^            there at some time in the past for public inspection.

       2        The visit had taken place at a late stage of the review by the Crown Prosecution
                Service because it was considered a relatively low priority to incur the costs and time
                of travelling to Kew, when the.probability was that no relevant material would be
                found there by reason o f the “public interest immunity” claim. In addition to the
                report, there is a file o f correspondence to the Taylor Inquiry from spectators at the
                disaster, and statements from various police officers, including PC Bichard. The
                HFSG was denied access to Bichard’s statements in the course o f the “Scmtiny .
                There is no indication at all that any o f these persons had consented to their statements
            .   being made public, the condition (among others) that South Yorkshire Police imposed
                for years for disclosing statements.

     3.          It is submitted that the lodging of those papers in the Public Record Office makes
                 nonsense of the claims to “public interest immunity” for statements and police reports.

     4            In July 1998, the HFSG asked to see material in the hands o f the Crown Prosecution
                 Service. Mr Croston denied them access to it, and the material sought included this
                 report. The report would have given great assistance to the HFSG in compiling its
                 representations; its disclosure has however been withheld unjustifiably after it had
                 already been put into the public domain, unknown to the HFSG, causing expense, time
                 and trouble in obtaining it. A detailed submission upon the report is impossible within
                 the time allocated to Mr Croston’s review. Nevertheless, the following matters are
                 clear from a quick reading o f the report.

      The .significance o f the 19X8 match

      5          At oa-e 17 of the report. Mr Metvyn Jones asserted that supporters in 1988 "stated"
                 that access to the tunnel was cut off He continued “If this happened ,t ,s not
                 documented and was not a decision made by the sen,or officers present at the 1988
                 game" [This is of course similar to the South Yorkshire/Bettison approach, see Fil o
 |               24,h August 1998]. “Enquiries have found just one retired officer who recalls this
                 happening. He. it must be said, is vague in his recollection but the probability is that
                 some officers acting on their own initiative     [turned spectators away] .

      6           This demonstrates the vice of deliberately concealing the material evidence o f White,
                  Woodcock. Lang and Crawford. In any event the retired officer, Higgins, is not
                  vague. He said this in his statement o f 2nd June 1989:

                            “I  received instructions to close the gates to the entrance a n d thereafter direct
                             fans to the outer pens of the stand. I cannot recall where the instruction came
                             form Under normal circumstances instruction came from a Serial Inspector or
                             via radio from control. T cannot say from which the instruction came.

          7       The significance of this evidence is that -control" used as a matter o f habit to.give this
                   instruction, as did an Inspector, no doubt in liaison with each other. This
                   was given in 1988 when Murray was in the Control Box. It » to be
                   DPP was given the same account in 1990 about the opening of the gates in 1988 as
                   appears In the Interim Report of October 1989. If so. he was demonstrably misled.

  For the attention o f George R Croston
  Prosecution Team Leader


  Dear Sirs

  Hillsborough: Adlington -v- David Duckenfield & M urray

  We refer to previous correspondence in this matter, in the light o f the requests made on
  behalf o f the Defendants for the Director o f Public Prosecutions to take over the conduct
  o f proceedings, pursuant to Section 6 o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 and to
  discontinue those proceedings pursuant to Section 23. You have kindly provided copies
  o f the exchange o f correspondence between your office and the Hillsborough Family
  Support Group (HFSG), and we refer specifically to your "policy letter" o f 27th July 1998
  outlining the policy to be adopted in cases o f this type, i.e., private prosecutions. We have
  been provided with copies o f the representations made on behalf o f MURRAY by Messrs
  Walker Morris and would adopt those submissions on behalf of Mr Duckenfield insofar
  as they relate to matters o f relevance to both defendants.

   Introduction

   The power o f the Director to intervene under Section 6 of the Prosecution o f Offences Act
   1985 is unfettered. It is not limited to a consideration of the strength or weight o f the
   evidence but embraces a consideration of the wider public interest in whether a trial ought
   to take place.

   All the submissions of the HFSG have concentrated on a perceived evidential basis for the
   summons currently issued. If the existence of a prima facie case were the only basis upon
   which the Director could exercise the power under Section 6 then the effect o f the section
   would be largely redundant. If no evidence existed an information could not be properly
   laid and if no prima facie case was made out then the magistrates could not commit for
   trial. Were these the only circumstances in which the power under Section 6 would be
   exercised then there would never be any need to exercise the power. It is submitted on
   behalf o f Mr Duckenfield that the power o f the Director is far wider than a mere
   assessment o f the evidence and embraces a consideration of the wider public interest.

    The Director is well placed to assess where the public interest lies having had involvement
    in the case over a period of nine years and having seen the Taylor Report, the Stuart-Smith
    Scrutiny, the coroner’s verdict, the judgment o f the Divisional Court and the review of
                                                                                             MM WAJ TS                         The firm is a member

evidence and the advice o f leading counsel obtained when the Director made the decision not
to prosecute.

We understand and sympathise with the sentiments o f the bereaved and injured who feel
understandably that someone must be made to pay for the disaster. • We also understand the
disappointment they feel when at every stage the decisions made have been against any
recommendation for prosecution. It must be recorded that the lives o f everyone involved in
the disaster have altered as a consequence o f these terrible events, including that o f Mr
Duckenfield.

On the date o f the disaster he had only been in his post o f chief superintendent for 21 days
and this was the first operation of this type where he had been in command. While the
impact of the events on him cannot be compared to the impact on those on the terraces they
were nonetheless personally catastrophic.

Until the disaster he had been a highly successful career policeman with 21 years o f service
to the community and 3 commendations for good police work. He has never worked since
and has had his actions subjected to analysis and examination for a period o f nine years. His
health has been destroyed and the trauma o f the disaster and the consequential need to assist
the authorities in the various investigations and inquests has meant that any attempt to start
a new life has been thwarted.

Many factors combined to contribute to the disaster as Hillsborough and these have been the
subject o f the most exhaustive investigation by Lord Justice Taylor. One o f them ,-not
mentioned hitherto in the correspondence to the Director, is the construction o f pens on the
terraces with inadequate gates to enable fans to escape in the event o f an emergency. No-one
appreciated at the time the danger these structures presented although as a direct consequence
o f this disaster they have been removed from every football stadium in the country.

We do not intend in this letter to repeat all the points made forcibly by Lord Justice Taylor
in his report nor analyse in detail the scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. The Director is
well able to assess each and decide where the public interest lies in this case. Nonetheless
in view o f the assertion by the HFSG that a clear prima facie case exists, a view we find
ourselves compelled to disagree with, and in the light o f a number o f important factual
inaccuracies in their submissions o f 24 September we feel it necessary to set the recor
straight at this stage.

 The Stuart-Smith Scrutiny

 One o f the terms o f reference of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was to ascertain whether any
 evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium which was not available
 to the Director or the Attorney General for the purposes o f discharging their respective
 statutory responsibilities and to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
 such significance as to justify their attention to be drawn to it. There was none. As part o
 the Scrutiny, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith read the joint opinion of counsel dated 6 August 19W,
 he considered the resume of evidence and the statement of law set out therein. The
 conclusion reached was:
       "I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the
       Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which
       might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have ^ ^ e n ^ ^


It would seem that the submission made by HFSG that leadm gcoun^l prodding
opinion would have misapplied the law relating to manslaughter to the facts o f the case
is wrong. ( H F S G submission 17/8/98 para 14). No such view W% f°™ ed                    of
Stuart-Smith and the Director has available the opinion to assess for herself
this submission advanced by HFSG.

All the evidence alleged to be "new" was available to the Scrutiny, it is inaccurate to
suggest to the contrary.

        "South Yorkshire Police have an extensive archive of material about the
        Hillsborough disaster. There is a substantial storeroom full of
        files, statements, photographs, videotapes and computer records. They have
        given me and my team unrestricted access to their archive for work on this
        scrutiny .                                                       (Chapter 5 p89(27))


 Further Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered the editing of smtements by Mesa* H ^ o n d
 Suddards, the fact that the statements had been edited w as t a o « i b y      ,l h e £ y t a
 Inquiry (Andrew Collins QC) and the Treasury Solictor (Mr T O rfm sQ . t o g
 considered the editing exercise Lord Justice Stuart-smith concluded that ^ * e m ostp
 die suggestions for amendments by the solictors are not open to t n U        - (ChapW
 p93(101)) and "I am quite satisfied that the exclusion of these comme
 have affected the Director". (Chapter 4 p84(105))

 It is wrong to allege that "the statements and documents sent to the DPP m 19^0 were the
 result o f a calculated selection, from which many                       submission
 excluded and which included edited statements of police officers . (HFbG submis

 Analysis o f new evidence
 The HFSG concedes <h* die findings of the Taylor Inquiry fall short of those needed to
 establish a "prima facie case.

               "The Taylor findings themselves amount                                        para 12)

senior officers monitored the pens, a diversion from the central pens took place in 1988, and
that there was a failure to take this "known and obvious precaution in 1989 resulting in the
96 deaths. The HFSG suggest that "the South Yorkshire Police claim that the diversion of
the oncoming supporters from the central pens in 1988 was unknown to senior officers .
They fail to refer to the findings of Lord Justice Taylor and the Coroner (see HFSG annexure
H - Summary of variances between findings of Lord Justice Taylor and summing up of
coroner Dr Popper - page 5) that the South Yorkshire Police "claim" was correct.

The evidence which HFSG says is so important to the present reconsideration adds nothing
to the foreseeability case against the defendant. When viewed against the findings of both
Lord Justice Taylor and the inquest the evidence referred to by HFSG (the new unrevised
evidence") cannot assist in any way in establishing that any failure to divert fans from the
central pens simply involved a "known and obvious precaution". In the circumstances we are
bound to submit therefore that much of the submissions made by                 relation to the
 events of 1988, adds no strength to the case against the defendants and if HFSG believe that
 this issue is at the "heart of the case", we say that it must patently fail even on the
 prosecution’s own assessment.

 Evidential Matters

 In your policy letter you advise that the Code for Crown Prosecutors (Code), which contains
 the principles applicable to CPS review of criminal proceedings instigated by the PolKe
 provides the basis for the policy applicable to private prosecutions and as to whether-the
 Director will intervene.

 More specifically, you advise that in regard to the evidential requirement of the Code a less
 stringent standard is to be applied to private prosecutions, to the effect that the case will be
 taken over and discontinued where there is clearly no case to answer.

 By comparison, when applying the Code to criminal proceedmgs generally, the ^identialtest
 of "a realistic prospect of conviction” is a clearly more onerous standard. The “ P ' ^ n i
 therefore that in the terms of the evidential requirements of a private prosecution,. the O ^ o r
 may allow those proceedings to continue in circumstances where the evidence would not reach
 the Code’s standard for a realistic prospect of conviction.

  We note from the policy letter that "it has been considered that to apply the Code test to
  private prosecutions would unfairly limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases.
  We take issue with this statement of policy, and its applicability in the present circumstances.

  We accept of course that the Director is bound to consider, as part of the review w h e tte the
  evidence is sufficient when considering intervention pursuant to the Pro* cuti0" ^ 0 ® nC“
  Act We are also aware that in the past the Director has adopted a less stringent test than fte
  CPS apply when considering whether to intervene under Section 6. Having considered the
  obMi^ationsmade by the 4 a l Commission on C rim W Procedure «
  /riv/fxm sn c m n QRl ) Para 8 8 and 8 9, and the Law Comm ission, Crim inal Law . co n sen t

  as applied in the past and request clarification according y.
    Criminal Law: Consent to Prosecution C.P. 149 (Para 6:5-6-17) we are uncertain as to the
    justification for the policy as applied in the past and request clarification accordingly.

           "The test applied to the Director’s cases (ie. whether or not there is a
           reasonable prospect o f conviction) should be extended to all cases and
           aDDlied bv all who make the decisions that bring a case to Court .
           applied oy an wno                                 (Phillips Commission para 8.9)

    In any event applying either test to the relevant material, such as that r e f i n e d o n page
    5 of the Dolicv letter together with any further material provided by the HFSG, and
    L d f t i l l 'I t e r i l f m a d e 'available by the Home Office ^ d anyoth=         "
    inescapably to the conclusion that has been previously reached by th e D irw ^ , to Ihe_effect
    that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. If that be the case,
    “              t " d e , the Director will be bound to take over die conduct of proceedings
    and discontinue "no matter how important or serious the case may e.

     On the basis that the Director proceeds as indicated in the policy letter aid therefore
     applies a lesser standard, we ask the Director to consider the two specific questions posed
     in the Code as follows:-

     1.     Can the evidence be used in Court?

     2.     Is the evidence reliable?                                                        ___

     We invite the Director to consider those questions in the specific context of the 4 charges
     against our client as follows:-

      1.    Unlawful Killing

             In the broadest sense it is right to say that the questi,m o    f   i ui n& in 1116
             context of involuntary manslaughter, requires proof o f the followmg.-

             - duty of care
             - breach of duty of care
*             I breach                              is grossly negligent, to amount to a criminal
      offence.
              At the time of making these submissions, we have been servecI with 3 f o lte s o f
              copy statements and transcripts of evidence served in support of the prosec




                 management within the control box on the day.


                                                      6
We are bound to emphasise that no evidence has been served by the prosecution of
any person other than the Defendants, that will assist a criminal court in considering
the issue of the particular duty of care to be alleged against the Defendants, and as to
whether their conduct amounted to a breach thereof. To be specific, there is no other
evidence, apart from the transcript material, relating to the circumstances and
within the control box on 15th April and Mr Duckenfield’s role on that day. HFSG
correspondence has pointed to Lord Justice Taylor’s conclusions in regard to the
 involvement and actions of certain individuals on that day. His conclusions were
 based upon a mountain of evidence which it would seem is not to be put before the
 Court in the context of the present prosecution. The hearings by their very nature will
 be completely different and the evidence that can be adduced in support ° f a p n v a e
 prosecution for manslaughter will be considerably narrower than that heard by Lord
Justice Taylor.

The HFSG, in their most recent submissions dated 2 October 1998, comment on the
"Evidence against Duckenfield on Manslaughter and Misfeasance purely by reference
to the 1989 Taylor transcript material, which of course the Director wi         a
considered previously in the context of the consideration of which charges, if any,
should have been brought.

 On the available evidence submitted in support of the prosecution, we therefore urge
 the Director to consider that there is a clear paucity of evidence relating to vital issues
 that would need to be proved. As L.J. Stuart-Smith pointed out m his Scrutiny report
 at para. 56:-
         "Any prosecution of an individual police officer would have to
         establish his individual responsibility. It would not be enough to prove
         the composite failure of the police operation.

 Notwithstanding the comments made by HFSG (eg see para 15 Submissions 249.98)
 anv admissions of liability by South Yorkshire police m negligence proceedings can
 onlv relate to those proceedings and South Yorkshire police. They can have no force
 in relation to the specific actions of individual officers and charges brought in separate
  criminal proceedings.

  Tn terms of reliability we must take issue with the observation of the HFSG (their
  letter 27th July 1998) that all the facts are clear and that no-one will have forgotten^
  T t ev Jn t b question were obviously traumatic for d l « » * « ? ■£ %            £ £ £
  o vears sinCe those events is a considerable period o f time.          By definition, to
  recollection of any relevant witnesses must be expected to have lessened
  of the nassaee of time or indeed the natural mechanism of avoidance of toe memory
  °of             t n t s Jhat occurred. In those cir—         s w e ..ggest * e
  treat with great caution the reliability of the evidence that is or may be servea
   support of the prosecutions.

   No evidence exists of the current ability of witnesses torecaH * ^ ~ d thosethat
   were heard by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith were descnbed by him variously as vag
   and confused" (per Miss Martin), "version changes in various ways ov

                                            7
(per Paul Taylor) and "unable to accept Mr Holdsworth’s recollection of events as now
being accurate". There is no reason to suspect that the memory of other witnesses is
any more reliable than those seen by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

Misfeasance in Public Office.

As indicated by the submissions as to issue of summonses, from the HFSG, the same
facts are to be put forward in support of the allegations for this offence as for
unlawful killing. The prosecution have referred to the case of R -v- Dytham (1979)
69 Cr.Apn.R. 387 as indicating the relevant standard. Our only observation in regard
to this case in the present context is that it clearly indicates that for culpability to be
established concerning the misconduct of an officer of justice, mere misfeasance will
not suffice, but a deliberate failure and wilful neglect will be required. We raise again
the issues as to what reliable evidence the prosecution intends to adduceto satisfy this
onerous test as indicated by the reliance of HFSG (submissions 2/10/98) on alleged
 admissions made by the Defendant in 1989 transcripts which the Director will have
 considered previously. From the material we have been served with so far, we believe
 the evidential test is not satisfied either on the basis of "a realistic prospect of
 conviction" or in the alternative that there would be "clearly no case to answer ,
 justifying the Director’s intervention and discontinuance.

 Acting with Intent to Pervert the Course of Justice

 According to the HSFG submissions as to issue of Summonses, this relates to-the
 alleged false and deceitful allegation by Mr Duckenfield that the gates had been
 broken by the supporters. It has never been suggested that the words complained of
 were ever uttered by Mr Duckenfield to anyone charged with investigating the disaste .

 In terms of the evidence so far served, we point out once again that there is no
 evidence apart from the transcript of the Defendants’ own evidence, regarding any
 such discussion. The HFSG (submissions 2/10/98) have r e f o ld to the T a ^
 evidence of the Defendant which the Director is aware of. We note that feth er
 evidence will be called but emphasise the prosecution have not served statements fro
 other witnesses in relation to this charge.

  The thrust of the recent (2/10/98) submissions appears to concern the "tmKmssion"
  of the alleged comment of the Defendant to parties who were not present at the ume
  the alleged words were spoken. We are bound to point out that no evidence has bee
  ^ e d to support the contentions made to the effect that the D e fen d ^ played any rate
   in the "transmissions” referred to, or in the alleged "limitation a c t t v i t y (paras )
  The HFSG’s critical reference to the Sharpies statements when su je
                  not be justified. In die context of this charge, w e j W .
   o f his recollection is that between 3 and 5 pm on the day of the                 ,    q
   of "how" and "why" was not at the forefront of the minds of those in the control
   room” who were "aU deeply shaken" officers endeavouring to carry out their duties.

  We think the argument is overwhelming that proper analysis of this charge carmot
  satisfy either of the evidential tests that might be applied in this case and according y,

                                            8

             There can be no doubt that the loss and suffering of the deceased and others involved
             in the Hillsborough disaster is a terrible tragedy. We would not wish to dimmish tha
             in any sense but emphasise that there is no evidence that the Defendant mtended to
             place the victims in this situation. Rather quite the contrary all the actions that were
             taken by the Defendant were taken with a view to minimising personal injury and
              suffering.

     m        The offence was motivated bv any form of discrimination against the victims ethnic
              or national origin, sex religious beliefs, political views or sexual preference.

              This cannot apply.                                                                  ___

        (n)    The offence, although not serious in itself was widespread in the area where it was
               committed.

               The alleged offences of unlawful killing, in particular, are serious, but occurred in a
               limited context in unique circumstances,. This factor is therefore not applicable.

               It will be seen by reference to the foregoing comment, that the only factor tending to
               support a prosecution pursuant to 6.4 of the Code is the seriousness of the charges.
               It is in that light that we believe the previous enquiries, reviews and the like that have
               been conducted into the events of Hillsborough are particularly relevant. Previous
               correspondence with you from ourselves and the Solicitors for Mr Murray highlighted
               the outcome of those reviews and the consistent conclusion, notwithstanding the real
               concerns as to the events of 15th April 1989, that no good will be served by pursuing
               criminal proceedings at this time. We emphasise that point in the present context.

               Further we offer the following observations with regard to the common public interest
               factors that may tend against a prosecution, set out in the Code.


    •   6-5
        (a)    The Court is likely to impose a very small or nominal penalty

               We reiterate the comments made above in regard to 6.4(a). We think the likelihood
               is, even in the event of a conviction for unlawful killing that the appropriate sentence
               in this case would, effectively, be non-custodial.

         (b)   The offence was mm mi tied as a result of a general mistake or misunderstanding (these
               factors must be balanced against the seriousness of the offence).

               Once again we emphasise that the allegations in this case concern decisions made
               under the pressure ofthe moment in the course of employment, at times when serious
               iniury and death was threatened. To prove gross negligence manslaughter, the
               prosecution has an onerous burden to prove to a high standard that any negligence
)              ought to be considered criminally culpable. The relevant authorities (see R v
    A          Adomako (H/Lords), R v Holloway & Others (Court of Appeal) make it clear that
               mitigating circumstances are particularly relevant in this context. Furthermore the
               contribution to the disaster of the unexpected late arrival of so many fans, the refusal
               by them to heed requests to queue for entrance in an orderly manner and the physical
                construction of pens on the terraces without sufficient gates to permit escape in the
                event of an emergency all contributed in some way to the disaster.

         (C)   The loss or harm can be described as minor and was a result of a single incident
                particularly if it was caused bv misiudgment.

                 Once again we would not wish to diminish the suffering caused by the victims or
                 others involved in the Hillsborough tragedy. We would point out, however, that th
                 case against the Defendant is in essence one of gross misjudgment on a singul
                 occasion.

                                                         11
There has been a long delay between the events taking place and the date o f trial.

The   offences are serious.
The   delay has been caused in part bv the Defendants.
The   offence has only recently come to light.
The   complexity of the offence has meant that there has been a long investigation.

It is clearly of great concern that a private prosecution is being commenced more than
9 years after 15th April 1989. The material we have been served with in support of
the prosecution in relation to the transcripts has been available since 1991 at the latest.
The 38 statements served by HFSG in our submission, firstly, do not raise any
substantial new matters that could not have been dealt with by evidence available
many years before and secondly, do not go to the heart of the cases, in respect of
unlawful killing, neglect of public duty, and perverting the course of justice as raised
before in the context of evidential issues.

Once again the seriousness of the offence is relevant, but on balance we submit this
factor should not outweigh the significance of the very considerable delay.

As we have noted the HSFG are of the view that the recollections of witnesses will
be accurate notwithstanding the passage of time. It is interesting to note that in the
context of the Judicial Review of the inquest (which of course was a hearing on oath
before a Jury considering issues of unlawful killing) the Divisional Court, commenting
on whether an exercise of discretion to order a fresh inquest was appropriate,
observed:

         "I have to take an objective view and I have to consider the
         interests of all concerned, including those of all the witnesses
         who would have to come along 5 years later and try to cast
         their minds back to events that they must have been trying to
         forget. Taking that objective view and considering the interests
         of all concerned, I would in my discretion conclude that this
         was not a case in which it would be right to order a fresh
         inquest."

         - R v HM Coroner for South Yorkshire Exp Stringer & Ors. 17 BMLR 92 per
         LJ McCowan.

 We submit similar considerations apply with greater force now that a further 5 years
 has elapsed.

 A prosecution is likely to have a very bad effect on the victim’s physical and mental
 health always bearing in mind the seriousness of the offence^.

 Although some families o fth e deceased clearly are anxious to pursue a criminal trial
 against the defendants others we suspect have been anxious to put these terrible events
 behind them and will be distressed to find the facts yet again rehearsed in public and
 have the memory o f the disaster revisited.
              The Defendant is elderly or is, or was, at the time of the events suffering from
    (*)
              significant mental or nhvsical ill health unless the events are serious or there is a real
              possibility that it mav be repeated.

               Crown prosecutors must balance the desirability of diverting a Defendant who is
               suffering from significant mental or physical ill health withthe need to safeguard,the
               general public.

               The Defendant retired from the Police Force in 1991 on ill health grounds. We have
               noted with concern the HFSG comments regarding our client’s health, and advise that
               he continues to experience ill health as a result of the Hillsborough disaster.

               The Defendant has put right the loss or harm that was caused (but the Defendants
    (g )
               must not avoid prosecution because they can pay compensation).

               This does not apply. It of course was not within the Defendant’s gift to redress the
               loss and injury suffered by the victims.

0    (h)       Details mav be made nublic that could harm sources of information, international
               relations or national security.

               We do not suggest that this factor is applicable.

     On an overview basis, therefore, our submission is that the factors contained in
     applied to the present case against the Defendant, strongly indicate the prosecution should not
     proceed in the public interest.

     Further when paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5 are looked at in conjunction, we believe the public
     interest is overwhelmingly shown to be served in this case by proceedings; being; discontaued
     as the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those factors tending
      in favour.

      We appreciate that such a decision would cause considerable disquiet with die
      but with respect, this is not a relevant consideration. The criminal prosecutions ansing out
      of Hillsborough are by their very nature unique, relating to specimen                        j
      as well as the lesser offences, in circumstances where 96 people died It seems clear that it
      a criminal prosecution were to proceed, such a trial would not take place until more than 10
      years after the events in question, and it is relevant to point out that any trial subsequen
      April 1999 would take place against the background of the 10 year anniversary of events
      having recently passed.

          We believe that the case for the Director intervening, and discontinuing
          to the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, is in this case compelling ^ d that
          are exceptional and we urge the Director to so conclude poor to the next hearing 01 tn
          Magistrates Court proceedings at Leeds on 30th October. If the ^ irecj°r          odFend^it
          matters arising out of this or previous correspondence submitted on behalf of the G lenda*
           we would be grateful ofthe opportunity of confirming same. We are, of course, awar

significance of this decision, and believe it entirely appropriate for the Director for clarify any
outstanding issues or concerns before a final decision is taken.

In view of the importance of the decision, we are of the view the Director is bound to give
full and detailed reasons for the decision taken addressing the issues raised by all the parties.

Accordingly, we look forward to hearing from you once the review is completed.

Yours faithfully

  Manslaughter and Misfeasance - Mr Duckenfield

  3-‘            ••to p J rfo n S g his duties, he [Mr Duckenfield] was acting on the “advice” of

Manslaughter and Misfeasance - Mr Murray
4.1   §42. The first sentence is an extraordinary proposition; mere assertion without proof or
any basis in evidence.

4.2     The prosecutor cites extracts from INQUIRY and INQUEST as evidence o f the two
offences. Nothing identified and relied on here is in any way ‘new’. (Citations are given without
indication of whether they are from INQUIRY or INQUEST evidence.)

4.3    §42: “... for the purposes of the present review...” If this is meant to imply the existence
of further evidence on which the prosecutor may seek to rely, it should be identified now.

4.4    §§43 to 55. All of this was fully taken into account by the INQUIRY, INQUEST,
SCRUTINY. It must have been known to and taken account of by counsel advising the Director
in 1990.

4.5    §47. The prosecutor cannot distinguish between foresight and hindsight. 93G-H
(INQUIRY evidence) is nowhere near an admission to Caldwell/Lawrence recklessness. It ought
not be necessary to point out that “almost an admission” is not an admission.

4.6     §50. Careful consideration of the evidence given is necessary. It appears at INQUIRY
1 June 1989, pages 18C-19A (not page 17 as indicated in §50). Mr Murray was there referring
to the position at league matches where fans from opposing teams had to be segregated behind
the same goal. The position was different where tickets for the whole stand were allocated to one
team. But the prosecutor has simply translated the evidence into an acknowledgement that it had
been an option for the police to fill up the pens in series at the match” (our emphasis), meaning
on 15 April 1989. This is not what the witness said. Further, the policy o f ‘find their own level’
was fully considered by INQUIRY: (§§171-4), with reference to past practice at both league and
cup matches.

4.7 §§53-54. References are to INQUEST 11 March 1991. Nothing here amounts to a case
against Mr Murray on manslaughter or misfeasance. The prosecutor wholly ignores the critical
context in which the events occurred.

4.8      §56. A shabby argument.

4.9      §57. The PCA decided that it would be wrong to continue disciplinary proceedings
against M if unable to do so against D. To use this in support of the proposition that M must be
responsible for all the acts or omissions of D is captious reasoning.

4.10     §58. This theme is no more convincing by repetition.

4.11    §59. Is there other relevant evidence or not? If there is, why has it not been served or
        disclosed? The situation is irregular and unacceptable.

       In early July 1998, you wrote lo the Crown Prosecution Scrvice ^ k m g that we take over in
       o rd « to 6iscontmue, the criminal proceedings against your client which have been brought by
       Ms Ann Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

       Mr Duckenfield faces two charges of manslaughter, one of wilful neglect t o p a f o m a p i i M i c
       duty and one charge of attempting to petvert the course o f justice. Mr. Murray faces two
       charges of manslaughter and one of wilful neglect to pcnorm a public duly.

        We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the p itie s and all the
        surrounding circumstanccs of the case. We have concluaed that we should not trrtervene
        take over any of the charges.

              prosecution to continue, notwithstanding in
9


assessment o f the strength of the evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential
sufficiency test in the Code (that there should be a "realistic prospect o f a conviction").

In broad terms, the reason for this is that Section 6(1) o f the Prosecution of Offences Act
1985 the Act which established the Service's powers and duties, specfica ly preserved the
right’o f private individuals and prosecuting authorities or bodies other than the CPS to bring
criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the limitation n
Section 6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless take over the proceedings with a view either
conducting or to terminating those proceedings.

    Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when deciding
    whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the evidential sufficiency test in the
    Code w h e n deciding whether there is a case to answer. The Service therefore recognises t o
    U is nm appropriate to intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. T W
    general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law C o _ n m its C o n s u l t s
    Paper No. 149 "Consents to Prosecution" (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).

    The Service's policy is that it will not take over a private prosecution with a view to
    terminating it unless one or more of the following applies:

    (\\          there is clearly no case to answer.     A private prosecution started in these
    W            circumstances would be unfounded and ought not to be permitted to continue; or

     (ii>        the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh
     ( >         (examples might be where die prosecution is malicious, or vexauous; o r t o o ffen ce »
                 one for which the defendant should clearly have been cautioned, or where, although
                 the offence may be serious, the defendant is terminally ill); or

     (iii)       the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.

      over the proceedings with a view to terminating them.

      Against t o b a c k e d , a                   n                  d                    £ £

I, CHRISTOPHER WILLIAM PAUL NEWELL, of 50 Ludgate Hill, London EC4M TEX,
MAKE OATH and say as follows:                                     ^


1.      I am Director of Casework of the Crown Prosecution Service at the above address and

        it was I who took die decision in this case on behalf of the CPS and the DPP not to

        intervene in the private prosecution against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray. I refer

        to my letters of 1 February 1999 to the solicitors for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray,

        in which I sought to set out the reasons which led me to that decision. I am now asked

        to elaborate on my conclusion that any public interest factors tending against
t




          prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour and on my conclusion in relation

          to the specific charge against Mr Duckenfield alone of attempting to pervert the course

          of justice.




    PUBLIC INTEREST FACTORS

    2.    As I now recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution which I

          considered were as follows.

          (1)    Previous reviews of the case, in particular those carried out by the DPP when

                 considering the question whether criminal proceedings should be taken against

                 Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray and the more recent report of Lord Justice

                 Stuart-Smith.

         (2)     The fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions that the DPP

                 did not intend to prosecute.

         (3)     The delay which had occurred between the commission of the alleged offences

                 and the commencement o f this prosecution and its likely effect on the

                 Applicants, although I took the view that delay may be offset by the seriousness
    l
                of the alleged offences (as is reflected in paragraph 6.5(d) of the Code for

                Crown Prosecutors) ("the Code”).
                                                                                    *
         (4)    The effect of the delay on the evidence, for example in terms of the potential

                impairment of the recollections of witnesses.

         (5)    The assertion made on behalf of Mr Murray of ill-health, although I noted that

                no medical evidence had been .put forward in support of this assertion and that,

                as again reflected in the Code (at paragraph 6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by



                                                2
              the seriousness of the offence.




3.    As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was in my view one

     extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely the very serious nature of

     the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged offences of manslaughter.         In tny

     opinion, the allegation that two senior police officers were responsible for the deaths

     o f a number of people as a result of criminal negligence was a very grave allegation.




4.   Paragraph 6.2 of the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by the CPS to the

     seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the right balance as to the

     factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to the opening words of paragraph

     6.4).   Having carefully considered the factors tending against prosecution and this

     extremely important factor in favour of it, I came to the firm conclusion that the factors

     tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh what I considered'to be the very

     strong public interest factor in favour of prosecution.




THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE AS AGAINST MR DUCKENFIELD ALONE

5.   I was fully aware of the seriousness of this additional charge.        I also tentatively
                                                                                    \
     concluded that partial intervention (i.e. intervening in order to take over one charge but

     not intervening in relation to the other charges) was in law open to the CPS and I

     proceeded on that assumption. However, the existing policy did not cover the situation

     which arose in this case, namely where the conclusion was reached that there was

     clearly a case to answer in relation to some of the charges but not in relation to others.
        (I can say that with some confidence, since I had overall responsibility for formulating

        the policy). I had therefore to consider the question which arose in relation to this

        additional charge without the benefit of any specific or settled policy. Having carefully

        considered the question, I concluded that it was in fact inappropriate to intervene only

        to take over (with a view to discontinuing) this additional charge.




 6.    First, partial intervention was not, in my view, either appropriate or desirable. It

       seemed to me that the DPP should either intervene so as to take over the proceedings

       in their entirety or not at all. To have intervened partially would still have left criminal

       proceedings in place in relation to the other charges which included the even more

       serious charge of manslaughter.       Secondly, I took into account the fact that Mr

       Duckenfield would not be left without any remedy in relation to this additional charge.

       On the contrary, he would be entitled to invite the Magistrates’ Court 10 dismiss it on

       the basis that there was no case to answer. Thirdly, the charge arose, out of essentially

      the same events as the events which gave rise to the other charges and thus those events

      would be scrutinised in any event.

               “55 From my meetings with the bereaved families and their
               representatives, I am left in no doubt that there was v v ^ p r e a d
               disappointment at the DPP’s decision not to prosecute. They find .t difficult
               to understand in the light of Lord Taylor’s trenchant criticisms of the South
               Yorkshire police and the fact that the force had been paying compensation.

                56 What the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, lu>«e' CT'
                fs t h e significantiy different and greater degree of culpability w . c -
                involved in manslaughter, or culpable misfeasance in pub he: off i ce, as
                against the degree of negligence which gives rise t o liability, and
                c o m p e n s a t i o n payments, under civil law. Any prosecution of an individual

                police officer would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would
12
                 n o t be enough simply to prove the composite failure of the police operation.



                   57. The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So fai-as these two
15
                   officers [sc D and M] were concerned, the prosecution would have to prove
                   " h i g h standard required for a criminal conviction that the failure o
                   give the order to close off the tunnel when Gate C was opened amounted
18
                   the serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute manslaughter.

21     Para 5 o f Chapter 7 (“ Sum m ary”) stated:

                         I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no
                   « . . .                                                                   which
                                                                                               b   ^   i s   u   p   o   n



                   there should be a further judicial inquiry or a re-opening »f Lord Taylor s
24
                   inquiry I do not consider that there is any material which shou d be

          vulnerable to a challenge on W ednesbuty1 grounds (as indeed M r Harrison claims it is)
          since there would be nothing in public interest terms to weigh in the scales against
          discontinuance. W hen the case was opened there was no affidavit from the DPP
    3
          dealing with the point, nor did M r Havers’ skeleton argument articulate any such
          factors. So it was that, effectively at the court’s invitation so that the m atter could be
    6     clarified, M r Newell swore an affidavit for the DPP on 22 March 1999. He is the CPS
          Director of Casework and the author of the reasons letter. Paras 2 - 4 are as follows:


    9               “2. As I now recall, the public in terest factors tending against prosecution
                    which I considered w ere as follows:

                               (1) Previous reviews of the case, in p articu lar those carried out by
    12
                               the D PP when considering the question w hether crim inal

• •5                           M u rray and the m ore recent rep o rt of L ord Justice Stuart-Sm ith.

                               (2) T he fact th a t th e A pplicants had been told on previous occasions
    18                         th a t the D PP did not intend to prosecute.

                               (3) T he delay which had occurred between th e commission of the
                               alleged offences and the commencement of this prosecution and its
    21
                               likely effect on th e A pplicants, although I took the view th a t delay
                               may be offset by th e seriousness of th e alleged offences (as is reflected
    24                         in p arag rap h 6.5(d) of the Code...).

                                (4) T he effect of th e delay on the evidence, for exam ple in term s of
    27                          the potential im pairm ent of the recollections of witnesses.

                                (5) T he assertion m ade on behalf of M r M u rray of ill-health,

                                although I noted th a t no medical evidence had been put forw ard in
     o




                                support of this assertion and th at, as again reflected in the Code (at
                                p ara g ra p h 6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by th e seriousness of the
    33                          offence.

                      3 As against these factors tending against prosecution, th ere was in my
     36               view one extrem ely im portant factor in favour of prosecution, namely the
                      very serious n a tu re of the alleged offences, in p articu lar, the alleged
                      offences of m anslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation th a t two senior
     39               police officers w ere responsible for the deaths of a num ber of people as a
                      result of crim inal negligence was a very grave allegation.

     42                4. P arag rap h 6.2 of the Code reflects the considerable w eight attached by
                       the CPS to the seriousness of th e alleged offence when seeking to strike the
                       right balance as to the factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to

                  the opening words of paragraph 6.4.) Having carefully consideredthe
                  factors tending against prosecution and this extremely important factor in
3                 favour of it, I came to the firm conclusion that the factors tending agai
                  prosecution did not clearly outweigh what I considered to be the very
                  strong public interest in favour of prosecution.”

                       One of M r Harrison’s complaints, advanced before this affidavit was
9         sworn, was that the policy should have taken account o f para 10.1 o f the Code whic
          includes this:

12                 “Normally, if the Crown Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant
                   that there will not be a prosecution... that is the end of the matter... But
                    occasionally there are so c ia l reasons why the Crown Prosecution Service
15                 will re-start the prosecution, particularly if the case is serious.

            This is one of the points relating to the Code which, as it seems to me, bear on the
           application of the policy rather than the policy itself; and para 2(2) of M r e
18
           affidavit shows that regard was had to assurances or statements made to D and M
           for his part the DPP would not prosecute. Clearly it was right to do so within the
           ™ bhc f i n e s t b a L e . But I think there is a qualitative difference between the
21
           situatiorTwhere fie DPP him self goes back upon a previous assurance not to prosecu e
           ancTon(Twhere f ie DPP does not change his mind but a private prosecutor chooses to
24         instigate proceedings.

                               to reply having by then seen M r N ew ell's affidavit, M r Harrison made

discontinue; but, as it seems to me, para 2(1) o f M r N ew ell’s affidavit shows that in
this case he has done so.

               Then M r Harrison suggested that para 3 o f the affidavit demonstrated
that the DPP’s view of the gravity of the allegation was informed simply by the fact
that there was a manslaughter charge. He had not properly considered the real degree
o f culpability inherent in the facts alleged; and the gravity o f the offence of
manslaughter can vary very widely. There is nothing in this. M r Newell made it
perfectly clear that he had regard to the species o f manslaughter in question
(“ crim inal negligence”) and it cannot sensibly be doubted that he was well aware and
took account o f the circumstances in which the alleged offences are said to have been
committed.

              Lastly on this part o f the case M r Harrison submitted that the refusal to
discontinue was simply perverse, given the “ enorm ous w eight” o f the public interest
considerations going the other way.

              The DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to discontinue.
The tragic events at Hillsborough have been the subject of repeated, detailed, thorough
enquiries. Nearly ten years have passed. But the judgment was for the DPP to make. If
we acceded to M r Harrison’s submission, we would I think usurp the role of the
primary decision-maker.

               In my judgm ent the decision not to discontinue is no more unlawful than
is the policy which the DPP applied.

 The fir s t applicant: attem pting to pervert the course o fju stic e

                M r Harrison discretely submits that the decision to let the charge of
 attempting to pervert the course of justice go ahead was unlawful, because it runs flat
 counter to the “no case to answer” test in his own policy. It will be recalled that the
 reasons letter said:

          “I concluded fu rth e r th a t it would not be rig ht to intervene in respect of the
          one rem aining charge against M r Duckenfield, of attem pting to pervert the
          course of justice, albeit I had form ed th e view th a t th ere w as clearly no case
          to answ er on th a t charge alone... in the context of th e case as a whole th at
          charge is not th e gravam en of the crim inality alleged against M r
          Duckenfield and I concluded th a t my approach to th a t charge should be led
          by my conclusions on the charges of m anslaughter and wilful neglect to
          perform a public duty.”

                  “5. I was fully aw are of the seriousness of the additional charge. I also
                  tentatively concluded th a t p artial intervention... was in law open to the CPS
3                and I proceeded on th a t assum ption. However, the existing policy did not
                  cover the situation which arose in this case, nam ely w here the conclusion
                  was reached th a t th ere was clearly a case to answ er in relation to some of
6                the charges but not in relation to others. (I can say th a t w ith some
                  confidence, since I had overall responsibility for form ulating the policy.) ...
                  I concluded th a t it was in fact inappropriate to intervene only to take over
9                (with a view to discontinuing) this additional charge.

                  6 . F irst, p artial intervention was not, in my view, either a p p ro p riate or
12                desirable. I t seemed to me th a t the DPP should either intervene so as to
A                 take over the proceedings in th eir entirety or not a t all. To have intervened
                   p artially would still have left the crim inal proceedings in place in relation to
15                the other charges which included the even m ore serious charge o
                   m anslaughter. Secondly, I took into account the fact th a t M r Duckenfield
                   would not be left w ithout any rem edy in relation to this additional charge.
18                O n the contrary, he would be entitled to invite the M ag istrates’ C o u rt to
                   dismiss it on the basis th a t th ere was no case to answ er. T hirdly, the charge
                   arose out of essentially the sam e events as the events which gave rise to the
21                other charges and thus those events would be scrutinised in any event.”


24                         I o f course accept that M r Newell did not subjectively believe - or intend
           -         that the policy covered this situation. But the policy has to be read objectively; there
           can be no doubt that it gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part o f D and M
m         that it would be applied according to its terms. The first question, then, is as to the true
•         m e a l g o f the poUcy on a fair reading o f the letter o f 27 July 1998 and fie reasons
           letter. It is true that the letters use the singular: “the prosecution and a private
30        prosecution” . But it is elementary that in criminal cases each count constitutes a
            separate indictment; it is as if there are separate trials relating to each. And this is no
           mere technicality; for it means, of course, that where there is more than_ one: charge
33          any question whether there is “no case to answer’ is, as regards each m dm du
            charge, wholly discrete. I do not consider that the policy cam fairly be read as
            indicating that the DPP would necessarily either take over or discontinue a pnvat
 36       prosecution in its entirety. In my view the articulation o f the “no case to
            would be taken by any informed reader, facing a multiple private Prosecution^ to imply
            that the DPP would consider whether in his view there was clearly no case to answer
 39       on each charge.

                           The DPP concluded that there was clearly no such case in relation to this
 42         charge against D, and yet decided to allow it to proceed. It follows, in my judgment,
            that there is a breach o f D ’s legitimate expectation that the policy      b   e  ^
            The pragmatic factors spoken to by Mr Newell m para 6 can make no d iff e r e n ^ Nor
    45      o f course, can the vigorous assertion by the HFSG that there is m fact a case to
             answer What matters for present purposes is the DPP's conclusion on that issue.

                    For these reasons I would quash the DPP’s decision only so far as it
     relates to this charge against D. I make it clear that I say nothing as to what might
     follow as regards any further decision concerning that charge to be made by the DPP.

                         Otherwise, for the reasons I have given I would dismiss the application

     The Second Case: the Decision o f the SYPA
12
                    First I should describe the further facts which are specifically relevant to
     the second case. These must be read into the narrative o f events which I have already

i5   given in relation to the first case; it seems to me clearer and more convenient to isolate
     here the particular facts which bear on the challenge to the decision o f the SYPA.

                   The history shows that at earlier stages the SYPA had been prepared to
18
     provide financial support for D and M (and other officers) to be legally represented in
     matters arising from the Hillsborough disaster. On 7 December 1990 they resolved to
21   fund the representation of six police officers, including D and M, at the mquest. They
     had earlier resolved not to do so; the decision of 7 December was taken after
     considering “the m ost recent legal advice available” . Then on 1 August 1997 the
24   SYPA resolved to set aside £500,000 for financial assistance for police officers in
     connection with Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny. In both instances they had considered a
     report from the Chief Constable (or a joint report of the Chief Constable and the Clerk
27   and Treasurer). The latter decision was said to be taken “in accordance with the
     principles set out in Hom e Office C ircu lar No 77/87 Financial A ssistance to Police
     Officers in Legal Proceedings”, to which I will have to refer.

                     On 27 February 1998, following publication o f the Scrutiny, and
      considering that “th ere w ere indications th a t private prosecutions could be brought
33    against 3 officers” , the SYPA resolved in principle to authorise consideration being
      given to applications by officers for financial assistance. On 5 March 1998 D’s
      application for such assistance was approved by the SYPA, and M ’s was approved on
36    29 June 1998. It will be recalled that three days earlier, on 26 June, AA had first
      sought to institute criminal proceedings against D and M in the South Sefton Petty
      Sessional Division. On 20 November 1998 M applied for further financial assistance
39    in relation to the judicial review which was then seen to be in prospect should the DPP
      decide to allow the private prosecutions to continue; and the HFSG had made it clear
      that were the DPP to take over the prosecutions and discontinue, they would seek a
42    judicial review. On 21 December 1998 counsel for D and M indicated to the
       Stipendiary Magistrate their intention to seek a judicial review o f the D PP’s decision; I
       have already referred to this in dealing with Mr Jones’ misconceived argument that the
45     first case should be dismissed on grounds of delay. The following day, 22 December
       1998, in a letter o f over six pages AA made written representations on leadmg

         counsel’s advice to urge the SYPA that the decision to fund the defences of D and M
         was “unlawful, irratio n al, ultra vires and procedurally im proper on various
    3    grounds” . On 23 December 1998 D applied for further financial assistance in relation
         to the prospective judicial review proceedings. On 5 January 1999 AA wrote a further
         lengthy letter to the SYPA repeating and expanding her assertions that the funding
    6    decisions were unlawful.

                        Then on 5 February 1999 the SYPA passed the resolutions under
    9    challenge, “th at, on balance, the A uthority has no legal power to provide financial
          assistance” to D and M in respect either of the private prosecution or a judicial review
          of the DPP’s decision. On 10 February 1999 the CCSY’s application for judicial
    12   review in these proceedings was lodged, and on the same day solicitors for the SYPA
          wrote to the Crown Office to consent to the grant of leave and seek expedition. They
^        stated:
                 “ SYPA passed these resolutions with great reluctance on the basis of advice £

                       The legality or otherwise o f the decisions under challenge ultimately
    21   turns on the construction and application o f s.6(1) of the Police Act 1996 and s. 111(1)
         o f the Local Government Act 1 9 7 2 .1 shall have to look at other statutory provisions,
         but it is convenient to set these out at once. The cross-heading to s .6 reads G eneral
    24   functions of police authorities” , and ss.(l) provides:

                   “E very police au thority established under section 3 shall secure the
    27             m aintenance of an efficient and effective police force for its a re a .”

          S. 111(1) of the Act o f 1972 in its present form provides:
    30                                                                                •
                   “W ithout prejudice to any powers exercisable a p a rt from this section but
                    subject to the following provisions of this Act, a local au th o rity shall have
    33             power to do any thing (w hether or not involving expenditure, borrow ing or
                    lending of money or the acquisition or disposal of any pro p erty or rights)
                    which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the
    36             discharge of th eir functions.”


    39                  S.111(1) applies to police authorities (but in light o f my conclusions it is
          unnecessary to go into the legislative history relating to that). Now, it might be
          thought - indeed this is the applicants’ case - that by s.6 ( 1), securing “the
    42    m aintenance of an efficient and effective police force” is plainly made the function
          of a police authority, and that accordingly it is no less plain that s. 111 ( 1) empowers
          the police authority to do such things as fund the legal representation o f police officers
    45    in proceedings if the authority reasonably concludes that to do so is conducive to that
          function’s discharge. That has been the settled view of the Association o f Chief Police

         Officers, the Police Superintendents Association, and (until 1998) the Home Office.
         The decision to provide such finance, in common with any decision taken under
         s. 111 ( 1), would o f course be subject to well known public law constraints enshrined in
         the Wednesbury and PadfielcF principles. There is before the court an affidavit o f Mr
         Daines, Assistant C hief Constable o f South Yorkshire, in which he describes what he
         regards as the “absolutely vital” requirement “th a t officers should know th a t if they
         act in good faith in perform ing th eir duties th eir Police A uthority will support
         them in the event th a t they face litigation” . If as a matter o f vires s. 111(1) allows a
         police authority to incur expenditure in furtherance of the general function seemingly
         conferred by s.6 ( 1), then in my judgment the use of s . 111 ( 1) to finance police officers’
         legal expenses in litigation, including private prosecutions brought against them and
    12   the bringing o f judicial review proceedings, cannot in principle be ruled unlawful on
         Wednesbury or Padfield grounds. The circumstances in which such funding might be
         provided in any particular case is another matter. The policy has in the past been to the
         effect that the authority m ust be satisfied that the officer has acted in good faith in the
I   15
         discharge of his duty; and I can see that, at least where a private prosecution is
         involved, there may be issues for the authority to consider which would involve their
    18   taking a view o f the merits in advance o f any trial. But in these proceedings we are not
         concerned with any question whether, when, or to what extent the SYPA might
         provide financial assistance to D or M. We are only to decide whether the power
    21   exists to do so at all.

                       In fact the argument of the CCSY was put two ways by M r Baker QC. It
    24   was first said that s.6 ( 1) o f itself, without the aid o f s.. 111 ( 1), enabled the funding
         decision. Alternatively, it was enabled by s. 111(1) read with s.6(1).

    27                Upon this issue Miss Baxendale QC for the SYPA submits that the
         apparently obvious relation between s. 6 ( 1) and s. 111 ( 1) is in fact no relation at all.
         The essence o f her argument may be expressed very shortly, as follows.
£30
                       (a) S.6(1) confers no powers o f any kind. All the powers possessed by
         police authorities are conferred elsewhere in the Police Act and by the local
    33   government legislation. S.6(1) does no more than to provide the purpose for which the
         authority’s powers are to be exercised; it states the A ct’s “policy and objects”, in the
         language o f the Padfield case, as they apply to police authorities. If this is right, it
    36   would contradict Mr Baker’s first argument, that s.6(1) alone is enough to empower

    39                 (b) S. 111(1) cannot be read as enabling the authority to do anything
         which is not ancillary to a power which is elsewhere conferred upon it. If this is right,
         then taken with (a) it contradicts M r Baker’s second argument which relies on
    42   s. 111(1).

                                                                     Ex Parte South Yorkshire Police Authority



                      There is no doubt that express powers are conferred on police authorities
      by a raft o f statutory provisions. Miss Baxendale says that such provisions support
3     proposition (a) which I have set out, by application o f the canon o f statutory
      construction expressed by the Latin maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. Thus,
       she submits, where Parliament has seen fit to confer a range o f specific powers on
6     police authorities, the intention must have been thereby to set the limits on what such
       an authority may do and it cannot be supposed that s.6 ( 1) provides an undefined and
       open-ended power to do anything else which the authority may choose, merely on the
 9    ground that in some way it may be said to support the general aim o f “the
       m aintenance of an efficient and effective police force” . The high water-mark o f this
       submission is found in s.88(4) of the Act o f 1996 which confers an express power to
12    fund police officers’ costs in certain circumstances which do not include the defence
       o f private (or any) criminal prosecutions or participation in proceedings for judicial
       review.

                      I shall have to look in a little more detail at s.88(4). I have concluded,
       however, that the correctness or otherwise o f proposition (a) is not in the end at the
18    centre o f the case. The reason is that in the particular statutory context proposition (b)
       is in my judgment wrong; so that the SYPA is enabled by s. 111(1) (subject to
       Wednesbury and Padfield) to finance D and M in the criminal and judicial review
21    proceedings even if s.6 ( 1) confers no powers as such.

                      The scheme o f the Act o f 1996 involves the distribution of
24    responsibilities between three bodies: the Chief Constable, the Secretary o f State, and
       the police authority. The C hief Constable’s role is principally given by s. 10:

27              “ ( 1) A police force m aintained under section 2 shall be under the direction
                and control of the chief constable appointed under s .l l .

30              (2) In discharging his functions, every chief constable shall have regard to £
                the local policing plan issued by the police authority for his area under
                section 8 .”
33
       (S 11 provides for the appointment and removal o f the Chief Constable, by the police
       authority with the approval o f the Secretary o f State.) I should notice also ss.22(l) and
36     44(4);                                                              ,           , »    »
                “ 22(1) E very chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end ot each
                financial year, subm it to the police authority a general rep o rt on the
39              policing during th a t y ear of the a re a for which his force is m aintained ”

                 “ 44(4) E very chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each
42              financial year, subm it to the Secretary of State the like rep o rt as is required
                 by section 2 2 ( 1 ) to be subm itted to the police authority.”

 45     The role of the Secretary o f State is principally given by ss.36 and 37(1):

                 “36(1) The S ecretary of State shall exercise his powers under the provisions
                 of this A ct referred to in subsection (2) in such m anner and to such extent
    3            as appears to him to be best calculated to prom ote the efficiency and
                  effectiveness of the police.”

    6              37(1) The Secretary of State m ay by ord er determ ine objectives for the
                  policing of the areas of all police authorities established u nder section 3.

     9   As regards the Secretary o f State’s position I should notice also these provisions o f the
         Act o f 1996:
                 “38(1) W here an objective has been determ ined under section 37, the
    12          Secretary of State may direct police authorities to establish levels of
                 perform ance (perform ance targets) to be aimed a t in seeking to achieve the
                   objective.

•5                 39(1) The S ecretary of S tate may issue codes of practice relating to the
                   discharge by police authorities established under section 3 of any of their
    18            functions.”

          The role o f the police authority is given first by the subsections o f s .6 which follow
    21    subsection ( 1):

                   “ 6(2) In discharging its functions, every police authority established under
    24            section 3 shall have regard to -

                   (a) any objectives determ ined by the Secretary of State under section 37,
    27
£                 (b) any objectives determ ined by the authority under section 7,

£30               (c) any perform ance targets established by the authority, w hether in
                   compliance with a direction u nder section 38 or otherwise, and

    33             (d) any local policing plan issued by the authority under section 8 .

                    (3)               In discharging any function to which a code of practice issued under
    36             section 39 relates, a police authority established under section 3 shall have
                    regard to the code.

    39             (4) A police authority shall comply with any direction given to it by the
                    S ecretary of State under section 38 or 40.”

    42     These provisions, o f course, confer duties rather than powers. In relation to the police
           authority I should next notice ss.7 - 9:

                           Looking at the whole picture displayed by these provisions, it is clear
    12   that the Chief Constable is in charge o f day-to-day policing (s. 10(1)); the police
£        authority has a role in relation to policy, or strategy (ss.7, 8 and other provisions); but
          this is subject to the overall direction o f the Secretary o f State (ss.37, 38, 39 and other
    15   provisions, taken with s.6((2) - (4)). The police authority holds the purse (s. 14). Those
         provisions specifically concerned with the police authority’s role confer duties rather
          than powers, though in some cases there is clearly a discretion as to how the duty is to
    18   be performed (as for example under s.37). Other powers (including those contained in
          s. 111 ( 1)) are conferred on the police authority by the local government legislation, to
         the extent that measures there contained were applied to police authorities by
    21   s.l4 6 A (l) of the Act o f 1972. The powers so conferred are listed in a helpful note
         provided by Miss Baxendale. I do not propose to set them out. They include (apart
         from s. 111 ( 1)) such matters as the disposition and treatment o f staff and the
    24   acquisition and disposal o f land.

                         The critical point which in my judgment emerges from a consideration
    27   of the interlocking roles o f Chief Constable, Secretary o f State and police authority is
^        that it cannot have been within the contemplation o f Parliament in enacting the
          scheme, and in embracing within it s. 111 ( 1), that the police authority should only be
    30   empowered to incur expenditure in support o f those duties, and ancillary powers,
         which are specifically conferred upon it. The police authority holds the funds from
         which expenses for its local police force will be supplied: s. 14. It is inherent in the
    33   system (as Mr Baker submitted in reply) that the Chief Constable will apply to the
          authority for authorisation to incur expenditure; it may be for the use o f resources such
          as helicopters, or the installation o f video surveillance systems in city streets, or a host
    36   o f other things. No doubt the Chief Constable presents a general budget. We were not
         referred to any provision in statute which shows or suggests that the police authority’s
         power to accede to such requests rests in anything other than the combination of s.6 (l)
    39   and s. 111(1). Given this, it seems to me plain that, in the particular context before us
         in this case, the legitimate scope o f the ancillary power provided by s. 111 ( 1) cannot be
         restricted so as to support only those powers and duties which are expressly conferred
    42   on the police authority. Those powers and duties are themselves ancillary; though they
          are very important, they take second place to the Chief Constable’s tactical role, and
          second place also to the Secretary of State’s strategic role. S. 111(1) must in context
    45    (whatever it does in other cases) allow the police authority to support what its express
          powers and duties also support; and this is no less than its general function conferred

        by s.6 (l). If that is right, the authority may in principle decide to fund officers’ legal
        representation in proceedings no less than they may fund any other activity which die
    3   Chief Constable might propose as being conducive to “th e m ain ten an ce o f an
         efficient an d effective police fo rce for its a re a ” .

    6                   This result is supported, if only ex silentio, by the decision o f this court
         in R v Derbyshire Police Authority ex p. Wilson (8 August 1989, unreported save in
         The Times). The court had to consider a decision of the police authority not to
    9   contribute to the legal expenses o f two police officers in relation to an auditor’s
         enquiiy. The court assumed that s.4 o f the Police Act 1964 (the predecessor o f s.6 (l))
         provided the power to grant financial assistance. However the point o f principle was
12       not argued. The applicants also point to other materials. In 1962 the report o f the
         Royal Commission on the Police was published. It indicated the then current practice
^       in relation to the provision o f financial support to police officers in civil proceedings,

           On 17 February 1998 Home Office Circular 4/1998 was published. Unlike its
39      predecessor it sits on the fence as regards the power of a police authority to fund
         defences to private prosecutions. It has no persuasive effect one way or the other upon
         the issues in these proceedings. The earlier Circular, though obviously not a source of
42      law, may possibly possess some force as regards the purposes to be fulfilled by
         s.6 ( l ) ’s predecessor in s.4 (l) o f the Police Act 1964: see per Scarman LJ as he then
         was in Bristol DC v Clark [1975] 3 AER 976, referred to in Wilson. But there are
45      great dangers in treating government pronouncements, however helpful, as an aid to
         statutory construction. I would prefer to base my conclusion, that s. 111(1) in principle

(subject to editorial corrections)                           R v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police
                                                                 Ex Parte South Yorkshire Police Authority



empowers the SYPA to support D and M ’s defence (and their participation in the
judicial review against the DPP), upon those considerations touching the correct
construction o f the material statutory provisions which I have already set o u t

                If m y Lords agree w ith this conclusion, it is enough to dispose o f the
case in the applicants’ favour. However we heard much argument on the question
whether s. 6 ( 1) conferred on the police authority any power, in any circumstances, to
take action not otherwise expressly authorised. This engages Miss Baxendale’s
proposition (a) as I have described it, and her reliance on the expressio unius est
exclusio alterius doctrine. It only has relevance if I am wrong to hold, as I have done,
that s. 111(1) in principle enables the SYPA to fund D and M even if s.6 ( l) does not
itself empower the authority to do anything. In this context I will deal only (and that
shortly) with s.88(4) o f the Act o f 1996, which as I have said is the high water-mark of
this part o f Miss Baxendale’s argument.

              S .88 contains a comprehensive scheme as to liability on the part o f the
police for torts. By ss.(l) the chief officer o f police for a police area is liable in
respect o f torts committed by constables under his direction and control in the
performance or purported performance o f their functions. Without this provision there
would be no such liability because police officers are not servants but office-holders.
Ss.(2) provides in part:

         “T here shall be paid out of the police fund -

                   (a) any dam ages or costs aw arded against the chief officer of police
                   in any proceedings bro ugh t against him by virtue of this section and
                   any costs incurred by him in any such proceedings so fa r as not
                   recovered by him in the proceedings...”

Ss. (4) provides:-
        “A police authority m ay, in such cases and to such extent as ap p ear to it to
        be approp riate, pay out of the police fund -

                   (a) any dam ages o r costs aw arded against a person to whom this
                   subsection applies in proceedings for a to rt com m itted by th at
                   person,

                    (b) any costs incurred and not recovered by such a person in such
                    proceedings, and

                    (c) any sum required in connection with the settlem ent of a claim
                    th at has or m ight have given rise to such proceedings.”

In my judgment this provision offers no support for Miss Baxendale s reliance on the
exclusio alterius rule. S .88 is self-standing. It has no implications for the general reach
of the police authority’s functions. And once s.88(4) was to allow the police authority

Draft 30 March 1999 12:55
         Judgment!. AEfiroyed by.the Court for handing down                            Ex Parte Murr    & Duckenfie|d
         (subject to editorial Corrections?                              R v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police
                                                                             Ex Parte South Yorkshire Police Authority



        to cover damages awarded against an officer in a tort action, it is no surprise that it
        covers costs as well. If it did not, there might well be an argument - based on the
    3   exclusio alterius rule - that costs were deliberately excluded.


    6                  In all these circumstances I do not think it necessary to go into the
        legislative history o f s.6 (l), or to canvass the arguments which were addressed to us as
        to the construction or effect of its predecessor, s.4(l) o f the Police Act 1964. In the
    9   end there are two possibilities: s.6 ( l) empowers the police authority to do things, or it
        does not. I have so far proceeded on the assumption asserted by Miss Baxendale that it
        does not; but given that assumption, nevertheless for reasons I have sought to explain
 12     the SYPA possesses in principle the legal power to fund D and M.

                      In fact I think the better view is that s.6 (l) enables the police authority to
^15     do things which reasonably support the function which s.6 (l) confers. Such a power is
        by no means open-ended. It would not allow the authority to invade the provinces of
        the Chief Constable or the Secretary o f State; and this is an important and
 18     considerable constraint.

                         In the course of argument some time was spent, in fairness at the
 21     encouragement of the court, in seeing whether the specific provisions in the Act of
         1996 or the local government legislation, conferring specific powers on the police
        authority, left gaps which only s.6 ( l) could fill. Points were made about lower ranks’
 24     rights o f representation in legal proceedings, which are covered as appropriate by the
        Police Federation; and about the representation o f higher ranks in various forms of
        legal proceedings. But the answer to the question we must decide, whether the power
 27     to fund D and M in principle lies in the hands o f the SYPA, cannot in my judgment
        depend on a trawl through all the things a police authority is expressly empowered to
        do. The provisions which expressly confer and impose powers and duties on police

#       authorities do not constitute an independent code. The police authority’s functions are,
        to use a questionable modernism, symbiotic with those o f the Chief Constable and the
        Secretary o f State. So judged, and for the reasons I have given, they allow the use of
 33     s. 111 ( 1) to fund officers in the defence of private prosecutions and in judicial review
        proceedings.

 36                    I would allow this application. It will be appropriate to hear counsel as
        to relief, and costs.

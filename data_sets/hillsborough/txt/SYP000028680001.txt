Dear Det. Chief Supt. Foster


               RE: HILLSBOROUGH JUDICIAL ENQUIRY


I refer to your letter of the 9th May in which
you request a copy of the material we shot at
Hillsborough on the afternoon of Saturday, 15th
April.


I am happy to let you have a copy of our material
provided that it is used to assist Judge Taylor's
Enquiry and that it is not used for broadcast
purposes.


I shall hand a copy of the tape to Inspector Layton
of your enquiry team who I understand is visiting
TV-am tomorrow.                The footage on the tape lasts
for approximately 19 minutes.


Yours sincerely

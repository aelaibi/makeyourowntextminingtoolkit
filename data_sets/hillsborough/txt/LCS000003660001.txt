Dear

     FArther to our brief telephone conversation yesterday, I would like to
confirm the request for CRUSE to undertake ar co-ordinate an evaluation of our
services established in Merseyside, Lancs and Cheshire following Hillsborough.
As I explained our response was organized very quickly of necessity.   Services
are in place in a number of local authorities to provide counselling* a training
programme was launched for counselling staff and a co-ordinating unit set up, based
in Liverpool.

     Ve would hope that an evaluation could include a qualitative examination as
well as quantitative analysis of the direct work with victims and their families.
Ve would also like to see the Helpline Service subject to evaluation.   Alongside
this piece of work we are also going to concurrently evaluate the computerized
data base and the public relations/media work.

     Attached are two papers produced here on Merseyside by a group of staff,
chaired by Professor                 The original paper has been the subject of
consideration by all seven local authorities and Sheffield and Nottinghamshire.
The principle of a Regional Assistance Unit was accepted by the leadership of these
Councils and officers requested to pursue funding for such a unit. The second paper
is the result of a brief piece of work by members of the sane gpoup who are
obviously concerned about the future viability of the services many of which to date
are still run on an ad hoc basis as there is as yet no financing.

     tfe have had no external assessment of the work and the local authorities wish
to see an evaluation as soon as possible.   Given that there are services in seven
north west authorities

                           Lancashire   Wirral
                           Cheshire     Sefton
                         ; Knowsley     St. Helens and Liverpool

                                                                     /cont'd

date collection and appraisal would not be easy or simple.   I would be able to
establish a reference group to assist any team you could create to facilitate the
process*

     I have also mentioned to you the possibility of incorporating our Church
Leaders into the process as they have excellent local knowledge and command locally
and nationally both respect and attention.   I have also received further
suggestions; that N.I.S.W. may be able to assist and X will explore this possibility
with                                     who recently retired f*om Sheffield
University, may be willing to help.

     Thank you for your encouragement and personal commitment yesterday.   I look
forward to hearing from you further.


                                Yours sincerely,

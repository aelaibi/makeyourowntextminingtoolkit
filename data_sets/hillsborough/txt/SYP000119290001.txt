                         On Saturday 15 April          1989,    I rang on duty it 9.00am.        My instructions

                         were to be at the ground at 9.45am for a briefing for the Semi

                         Final.      All the officers on duty were            seated in the North stand where

e - j/i                  they were given a full and comprehensive briefing by Chief

                         Superintendent Duckenfield and other senior o f f i c e r s .               I have no

                         doubt that at the end of the briefing                each officer knew what was ^            >

                         expected of him and what his specific                duties were.     The senior

                         officers in charge of any specific task or part of the ground were

                         introduce#' and stqod               in order that they could be recognised.              I

                         After the briefing packed meals were handed out and consumed.                       My

                         specific duties were to patrol the perimeter track from 11.15am to

                         kick off then take up a position on the perimeter track for the

                         duration of the game.              My point was in front of the North stand at

                         its junction with the Spion Kop.                I patrolled the perimeter track

                         until 12.30pm when I was released by P.S. Chapman to have a hot

                         meal.       Following this I returned to the perimeter track until 1.45pm

                         when because of the large volume of prisoners being taken to the

                         noiice room,      I was instructed by police control to ’m a n ’ the door to
                                                                            PAGE      2

the police room allowing only those with prisoners or other

legitimate access into the room.           Most of those arrested were for

offences involving drunkenness and many of them were v i o l e n t .        By 2.

30pm the drivers of the prison buses were reporting that the cells on

the buses were f u l 1 and that they were having to put two to a c e l l .

I was still manning the door to the police room shortly after the

kick o f f , when it was reported that there was a pitch invasion and

that all available officers were asked to go on to the pitch.                I made

my way to the pitch but on the way met P.S.           Paul Morton who had just

come from the pitch.        He was visibly shocked,     and shouting urgently

for an ambulance that was parked near to the pitch, between the North

stand and the Kop,      to follow him onto the pitch.        He stated that

there were at least twelve people dead at that t i m e .          He was met with

disbelief.     He got the ambulance to follow him on to the pitch and

slowly towards the Leppings Lane end of the g r o u n d .

I saw that there were between 200 to 400 people on the pitch and that

people were being crushed behind the wire fences at the rear of the

Leppings Lane Goal.        I went to the gate at the rear of the goal and

saw that although the gate was open,          there were about 4 or 5 b o d i e s ,

obviously d e a d , laying in the gateway and blocking i t .        I climbed

into the wall at the side of the gate and shouted to the people to

stop pushing and try to move back.          A number of supporters were

screaming and s p i t t i n g , obviously f u l 1 of hate for the police and

shouting that it was the fault of the p o l i c e .      I did not at that time

understand what they m e a n t .      Efforts were made to remove the bodies

without success until one youth braced his arms against the uprights

of the gate in an effort to relieve some of the pressure.               With his

help it was possible to remove all of the bodies and some small

children from the c o m p o u n d .   From that moment it was just a matter of

^Tisuring that people came out in a more orderly way wlthout falling.
                                                                               PAGE      3
                                                                               R290

An unconcious person was passed through to me and together with

another person,    I carried him into the pitch where I tried to revive

him with mouth to mouth and chest m a s s a g e , after a few minutes,         an

ambulance driver tried to resuscitator on him but stated that the man

was dead.    The man was mid 20s, slim buiId clean s h a v e n .      No other

desc.

I tried to revive at least two other p e r s o n s , without s u c c e s s .    When

the extent of the disaster was becoming apparent,            I told police

control on at least two occasions that a temporary mortuary was

required and asked them to suggest a v e n u e .      The Gymnasium was

designated and bodies and injured were taken and directed there,                 as

were any medical personel who volunteered their s e r v i c e s .

More and more Liverpool supporters were by this time on the pitch.

The Notts Forest supports for reasons best known to t h e m sel ves , had

started jeering.      This inflamed the Liverpool supporters who started

running towards t h e m .   They were held back by a line of police

officers across the p i t c h .   I saw one officer in a state of shock

being ranted and raved at by a supporter without apparently seeing or

hearing him.     At this stage in the p roc ee d i n g s , the fire brigade

arrived and assisted with the removal of the dead and injured.

When it became apparent that most of the dead and injured had been

released,    I assisted with carrying a stretcher to the Gymnasium.                 By

this time,    emergency medical supplies had just arrived and I assisted

in carrying them to the top end of the Gym where the injured were

being attended to by volunteer doctors and other medical s t a f f .             I

assisted a doctor in emptying and sorting the crates and handing out

medical supplies where required.          All the injured persons were

eventually transferred to hospital via a fleet of ambulances and I

tidied up all the remaining medical supplies into the crates in which

they came and left them piled up in the centre of the Gym.
                                                                                 PAGE     <
                                                                                 R290

Most of the bodies had been brought to the gymnasium by this time and

when a number of body bags arrived,            I assisted in placing some of the

bodies in them.       During the rest of the evening I obtained supplies

of body t a g s , rubber gloves reports and any other items required and

assisted with the reception of more bodies which had e a r 1 ier been

taken to hospital but which had been dead on arrival.

Numerous senior CID officers attended as did the police surgeon/

pathologist prof Usher and his team.              Numerous c o u n c il lor s, Social

workers, v i c a r s , salvation army workers and other personal were in

attendance to minister to the needs of the relati ves .                The local

councillor Irvin Patnick later attended with Colin M o y n a h a n , the

minister of s p o r t , and the Chief C o n s t a b l e .

Chief Superintendent Mole arrived quite early on in the proceedings

to co ordinate and supervise the police officers dealing with the

situation. Numerous officers have commented on the absence of Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield following the disaster and the arrival of

Chief Superintendent Mole was met with a great deal of relief by

officers in the Gymnasium p art ic u l a r l y .

An area was later screened off in the top part of the Gym where

relatives who had made a preliminary identification of a body from

Polaroid photos of the deceased taken earlier,                 could view the

particular body with a view to positively identifying them.                     C.I.D

officers were mainly concerned           with t h i s .

I ceased duty at about          1.30am. Sun 16th A p r i l .    When I arrived    home,

my wife was waiting up          for m e .I sat and recounted exactly what had

happened from start to          finish. This was accompanied by a very            large

glass of excellent malt W h i s k y ......

I found the telling of it quite d i f f i c u l t .         I did not sleep well that

.night.   Apart from that I do not feel that I have suffered any ill

iffects from the exper ien ce.
                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                       R290

         I feel that the manner in which the incident was dealt with can only

         reflect credit on the police.           Many officers were deeply shocked but

         those who could detach themselves from the emotional side of it acted

         in a professional manner and carried out their duties the best they

         could under difficult circums tan ces .        Again I have heard other

         officers comments about the policing outside the ground which include

         statements that the was no other option open to Mr Marshall but to

         open the gate and relieve the pressure on the w a l l .             Others have

         commented that there were not enough officers outside the ground at

         that point to cope with the numbers arriving.              These were no doubt

         depleted by the taking of prisoners.           The c ^ t r a l   feeling is that the

         fans arrived too late, and a lot of them under the influence of

         drink,     to get into the ground in time for the kick o f f .

         I have attended most of the matches at the SWFC since arriving in the

         division in 1981.         My duties at most matches have been the same, on

         the perimeter t r a c k .     Quite often at big g a m e s , I fly an aircraft and

         together with an o b s e r v e r , monitor traffic on the approaches to the

         ground and the crowds around the g r o u n d .      I was not required for that

         duty on /this o c c a s i o n .

             On Saturday 15 April      1989,   I rang on duty at 9.00am.     My instriittIons

was dead.    The man wafcs mid 20s,   slim build clean shaven.        No oth#r

I tried to revive at least two other persons, without success.                 When

the extent of the disaster was becoming apparent,          I told police

control on at least two occasions that a temporary mortuary #<a'$ /

required and asked them to suggest a venue.          The Gymnasium was

designated and bodies and injured were taken and directed there, as

were any medical    personel who volunteered their services.

More and more Liverpool supporters were by this time on ,tl*e

                                                                          d

running towards them.       They were held back by * 1 iti*: of*;’;                  '-'iy^

officers across the pitch.        1 saw one officer in a »ta.te of shock

being ranted a.nd raved at by a supporter without apparently iseeijrtg &r

hearing him.     At this stage in the proceedings,, the fire brigade

arrived and assisted with the removal of the dead -and injured. -

When it became apparent that most of the dead and i n j u r e d h a d §@@n,

released,    I assisted with carrying a stretcher to tfrte Gymnasium.                By

this time,    emergency medical supplies had just arrived and I assisted

in carrying them to the top end of the Gym where the injured were

being attended to by volunteer doctors and other medical              staff.      I

assisted a doctor     in .emptying and sorting the crates apd Handing: out

medical   supplies where required.      All the injured pe.r|.6®s were

eventually transferred to hospital        via a fleet of ambulances and I

tidied up all the remaining-medical supplies into the crates i n w h i c h

they came and left them piled t§.p in the centre of the Gym.
Most of the bodies had been brought to t*he gymnasium by this tinif and

when a number of body bags arrived,                               I assisted in placing some of the

bodies in them.             During the rest of the e v e n i n g                               I obtained.supplies

of b o d y ta g s , rubber gloves                 reports and any other                          items r e q u i r e d and

assisted with the reception of more bodies which had earlier been

taken to hospital             but which had been dead on arrival*

       reflect credit on the police.                        Many officers were deeply shocked but

       those who could detach themselves from the emotional side of it acted:

       in a professional warmer and carried out their duties the bestithey

Dear Sirs,

APPLICATION BY MRS ANNE WILLIAMS FOR THE ATTORNEY
GENERALâ€™S CONSENT UNDER SECTION 13(1)(B) OF THE CORONERS
ACT 1988

Thank you for your letter of 10th April 2006, the contents of which we note.

I can confirm th at the Attorney General will not be reconsidering the issue of
his consent under Section 13(1)(B) of the Coroners Act 1988.

I note that you are instructed to consider judicially reviewing the decision of the
Attorney General. This is clearly a m atter for you b u t you may wish to consider
the decision in R v A ttorn ey General, ex p a r t F errante (1995) where Mr.
Justice Popplewell, applying the decision of the Court of Appeal in G ouriet v
Union o f P ost Office W orkers (1978) indicated th at the decision of the
Attorney General in relation to Section 13 of the Coroners Courts Act 1988 is
not amenable to judicial review.


Yours faithfully,




NIMESH JANI

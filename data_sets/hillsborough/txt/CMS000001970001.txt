General Expenses


In addition to various miscellaneous expenses including the fees
for the shorthand writers, the HSE associated bills, and hire of
a cook and butler for the Judge1s Lodgings, the main element
which appears in the second quarter figure is that for the legal
costs of the two parties (the bereaved and injured and the
Football Supporters Association) to whom the Judge indicated at
the Preliminary Hearing that costs would be met by central
government.   I have allowed a figure of £200,000 for their costs.


2.   The other substantial element in the second quarter figure
relates to the Sheffield City Council bill for the Town Hall
facilities.   Although no formal bill has yet been received,
informal enquiries suggest that the figure is likely to be in the
region of £15,000 - £17,500 per week.   On Mr Preston's advice, I
have included this under H6(2) (General Expenses), rather than
H6(1)(3)   (Accommodation for Inquiry) because it includes a wide
variety of services (hire of photocopying machines and supply of
copying paper, hire of video and sound equipment, employment of
Town Hall security staff etc) in addition to the provision of
accommodation.


3.   Given that the Inquiry has now finished in Sheffield, the
third quarter figure may seem rather high, but it is intended to
cover the possibility of substantial research costs associated
with Part II of the Inquiry.

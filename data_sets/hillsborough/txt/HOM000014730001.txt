Thank you for your letter of 21 August about the position of the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Mr Peter Wright, and the
South Yorkshire Police Authority.

The decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority not to
accept Mr Wright's offer of resignation is a matter for the
Authority alone. There is no provision in police service
legislation for the Home Secretary to instruct or overrule them
on that.

You asked about the Home Secretary's powers under the Police Act
1964. There is a power under Section 29(1) of the Police Act
1964 for the Secretary of State to require a police authority to
exercise its power to call upon the chief constable to retire in
the interests of efficiency.  (The Police Authority's power is in
Section 5(4).) However, the Home Secretary is not aware of any
grounds which would justify his invoking Section 29(1) in this
case.

I know that the Home Secretary would want to express again his
sympathy to all the families and relatives concerned for their
great loss.

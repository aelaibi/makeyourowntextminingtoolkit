            At 0 8 3 0 on Saturday,                15 April    1989, T        reported a 1              c k irntM   o   r p e in

             full   Police      uniform.            I was d e p l o y e d on serial 5,            s u p e r v i s e d by

            PS    1088 Hodgett.              The   serial     was     then t r a n s p o r t e d to H i l l s b o r o u g h

            football       ground w h e r e u p o n all        serials were           briefed.

            The d e p l o y m e n t    of serial       3 was       on the S o u t h S t a n d ent r a n c e s 21               to 28.

             I was outside            turnstiles       entrance F,          s e a rching       fans who were entering

             by that turnstile.                 I remained at that              location until             approx.            1505

            whereupon        I was      a s k e d by anot h e r S e r g e a n t      to help      clear       the way along

             the side of the S o u t h S t a n d so ai /to enable A m b u l a n c e s                        to     leave        the

             ground w ith       c a sualties at this               stage    I became a ware             of a problem

             inside    the ground.

            After a s s i s t i n g w i t h the         clearance         of the     pass a g e w a y    I then went                to

             the entrance         19--2E E entrance            to assist         other     officers w h o were

             helping w i t h      casua l t i e s     from inside          the g r o u n d .    For the           next        few

            hours     I was a s s i s t i n g wit h       carrying         casualties        from       inside          the

            E n t r a n c e E 19-22 an d a s s i s t i n g wit h the             carrying       of several               bodies

            who were       carr i e d on the stret c h e r s              (boards),      to outside           that

             entrance      to wait          for Ambu l a n c e s    to transport         to hospital.                   At    no time

            did     I go onto         the    pitch.

            The mood of the fans at E n t r a n c e F wer e                      one of a jovial              m o o d all           of

 **hich were N o t t i n g h a m Forest      f a n s , and    it was quite a p p a r e n t   that

  alcohol    had been      consumed by a large amount               of these     f a n s , but not     in

  excess.     Regards      to the stewards           on the entrance F there were             none     in

  a t t e n d a n c e , the only ones   I saw were       near     to entrance 27-28.

  Regarding     the    radio trans m i s s i o n s    I was    not aware of any of the

  incidents whi ch we re h a ppening due to the fact                    I did not have a radio

  and there was        not one      in the   immediate        location.

  I assisted with a p p r o x . 20-24         casualties        of whi ch 3 a p p e a r e d to be

  dead.     I assisted" wit h talking           to and       reassuring    the   injured,     which

  were    outside     e n t rance   19-22.                                              Pc_

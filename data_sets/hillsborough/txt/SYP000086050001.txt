                this point arriving there at approximately 10.30 am.                               I saw that match

                traffic was considerate at this time and became heavier until about

                12.30 pm when the flow was comparable with the normal Saturday flow.

                However, at approximately 12.45 pm the traffic level built up and this

                traffic lasted until 1.30 pm, after which time only an occasional                                     car

were        milling                 around.             I was          under       the       impression                that          these           people            had

climbed               over          the      fence         onto        the    pitch          to       escape          fighting                  f a n s . The

supporters                     in     t he    North          Stand          were    pointing                to      the     Leppings                 Lane

these            officers,                 went       to     see       how    we    could             assist.              However,                it       was

impossible                     to     get     within             1 0 — IS    feet       of     the         fencing          because                of       the

sheer            density              of     the      crowd.            Scores          of     people            were       very           distressed                  or

in     shock              so     I tried           to      comfort           these       people             and       also       to        reunite               people

who        had        become            parted          from        relatives            or       friends.

At     approximately                         3,50       pm       some       calm    was        restored,               and       1     returned                  to    the

cordon            which             was      now      across           the    centre           line         of      the        pitch.

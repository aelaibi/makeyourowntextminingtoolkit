            I am      a Police           constable            in    the    S    Yorkshire            Police,       presently           stationed

            at      the    Force       Driving          School,       Sheffield,                At    9.0    am    (0900        h r s ) on

            Saturday            15th     April,         1989       (150489)          I commenced            duty       at    8rightsj.de       Ln;

            Sheffield,            and       then       travelled          with       other      officers          to    Sheffield

            Wednesday's               Football          ground       at    Hillsborough.




            At      10.0    am    (1000          hrs)    that       day    I attended            a    briefing          at     the    ground,

            conducted            by    senior          officers,          which       concerned          duties         related        to    the     FA

            cup       semi-final            between       Liverpool             and    Nottingham            Forest          whyrch w a s     to     be

            played         later       in    the       day.        I was       a member         of    S e rj/al    n o ^ S O , cal 1 - s i g n

            related         mainly          to    mobile       patrol          in    the   Parson        C r oss       y e a    of    the    City

                                                                                                                                    S2691




We    paid       particular          attention             to    Public       Houses          in    the    area       and          to    the

shopping          centre       at    Kilner          Way     and     whilst        large          numbers       of    Liverpool

Supporters             were    in    the       vicinity          and    consuming             alcohol       I did          not          see

any    evidence          of    any       trouble.




At    about       2.55    prn ( 1 4 5 5        hrs),       that      day,     it       appeared          from    radio             messages

passed       between          other       officers           that      some       sort       of    problem       had       developed

at    the    Leppings          Ln    end       of    the     ground.




We    attended          outside          the    ground          at   Leppings           Ln    arriving          at    about             3.0    pm

(1500       hrs).        There       were        large       numbers         of    both       Police       and       supporters                at

this    location          but       there       was     no      sign    of    any       particular          problem.                    I did

not    alight          from    the       Police       vehicle          at    this       time.




On    the    instructions                of    Inspector Robinson                      we    resumed       mobile          patrol.




At    about       3.20    pm       (1520       hrs)      t h a t day,        our       serial       was    on    duty          in

Halifax          Rd    near    to    the       “T r a v e l l e r s ' 5 P u b l i c     House.           There       was       a    heavy

build       up    of    traffic          travelling             towards       City          and    between       us       we       worked

'traffic          duty'       in    this       area     and      cleared          most       of    the    congestion.




I could          hear    and       see    a    lot    of     activity         involving             Emergency             Vehicles

travelling             both    to    and       from     the      direction             of    Hillsborough             football

ground.           There       were       numbers        of      Liverpool          supportes             walking          up

Halifax          R d , away        from       the    ground,         and     although             they    weren't          causing

any    trouble          they       were       very    abusive          towards          Police.




At    about       3.45    pm       (1545       hrs)      t h a t day,        we    attended          at    the       Penistone                Rd

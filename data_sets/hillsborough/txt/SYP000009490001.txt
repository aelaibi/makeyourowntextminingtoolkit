9 . 4 5 am.      -    15.4.89



Arrived         at    Hillsborough,           where       my    serial          occupied       seats     in the N o r t h

Stand      for       the m a i n    briefing.

P a c ke d meal         consumed        in C & V C r e w Bus               at    rear    of N o r t h S t a n d .




11.00 a m .




As   per    Operational             Order,        I depl o y ed my          serial       to a     position adjacent

to   the    police Gro u n d           Control        Box,      between          the S o u t h and       West      Stands.

At   this       point     the      ground     was     e m p t y a n d all         appeared        to    be    in

order.          Radio     tests       were    in     progress.




1 1 . 2 5 a.m.




I noticed approximately                      12-15        people      on    the S p i o n Kop,          indicating

that      the    turnstiles           may    be     open.       The    remainder          of     the    ground

appeared         empty       of    supporters.            At    this       time    my    serial        was    deployed

Pennistone           Road North.                 This        was    in    response          to a    request             by

Inspector           B o o t h who         ha d    insufficient                Officers       to    cover          turnstiles             *

access        to    the N o r t h         Stand and            this      area       being    allocated             soley          to

Liverpool           Supporters,              it wa s         contrary          to    the    principles             of       crowd

segregation            have         them     queuing           alongside            Nottingham          fans       wh o      were

seeking        entry       onto       the S p i o n Hop).

During        the    period          of     policing           these      turnstiles,             many a Liverpool

supporter           came       to    th e    Penistone             Road North End and                   when       faced with                the

closure        of    turnstiles              ’O ’ , m a d e        enquiries          regarding          access             to    the

North     Stand.           These          supporters             came     in v e r y       small    groups,             but at

regular        intervals.                 In m y       opinion        they      had       travelled          by    car.




Many Supporters                 were        in    possession             of    cans       which    contained

intoxicants.               They       comprised mainly                    of N o t t i n g h a m    supporters                   < (mostly

m a le,   but       females          were        included)            and      in t he      18 to 3 0 a g e             gr o u p .       I

was     suprised          to    find        t ha t     some      were     not a w a r e      of    control             of    Alcohol

at     Designated          Sports           Ground          Legislation.              Numerous          cans       containing

intoxicants,              were       discarded              into    plastic          bin    liners       and       kept          by

police        Officers          at    the        turnstiles.




Other      i t ems     confiscated                or    discarded,             included a          bulb       horn and                flag

poles.



At     2.45    p.m.       that afte r n o o n ,                I arrested a 48 year                 old,          Nottingham

supporter           for    the       offence           of      'attempting           to    enter    a    designated                   sports

ground whilst              drunk'.               He    was      in a v e r y        drunken       state       and       required

the     physical          support           of    his       friend.           He w a s     attempting             to    enter          the

Spion      Kop      via,       turnstile              *N ’ .

                                                                                                                                S853

I escorted             this m an          to    the       police        room a n d         noticed       him h olding            out

his    ticket          to    public        view?         before         any action           could       be    taken       someone

came       from    behind          and     exchanged             his     ticket        for       £10.00       note.




At    2.05       p.m.       we a r r i v e d at           the    Police         Room myself             a nd my      prisoner

were       photographed.                  He    was       then     placed          in the        holding       room       pending

documentation.




At a p p r o x i m a t e l y       £.55        p.m.       he was        subjected           to    documentation and                    then

returned          to    the     holding           room.



At ap pr ox im at el y             3.00        p.m.       I entered           the     g y m n a s u i m at H i l l s b o r o u g h        to

commence          the       necessary           paperwork              relating        to    the a r r e s t .            I w as

aware       that       two     other       persons           had       been a r r es te d         by m e m b e r s    of m y

serial       for       similar        offences             at    that        location.




At a p p r o x i m a t e l y       3.05        p.m.       Chief        Inspector           Sumner       entered       the

gymnasium          and       informed           me       that    there        wa s    some       trouble       at    the

Leppings          Lane       end     of    the       ground and              that     he    re-deployed             the    rest        of my

serial       to    that        area.           He a l s o       requested            other       officers       in the          gy m

to    go    to    the L e p p i n g s          Lane       End.



I immediately                entered           the       perimeter           track     via       the    entrance          between

the S p i o n K o p a n d            North S tand and made                         my way along           the       perimeter

track       (in f r o n t       of    the       N o r th Stand)              towards        the    Leppings          Lane       End.

The    game       was       sti ll    in       progress          and      I re c a l l      the     crowd      roaring          in

response          to a n e a r        miss        by L i v e r p o o l        at     Spion Hop          goal.        I seem          to

recall       Liverpool             winning           a    c o rn e r    as    a    r e sult,      but    I cannot          be

certain.           As       I neared           the       halfway        line       I s aw    so m e     supporters          on the

playing          area       in the        penalty          box at         the      Leppings        Lane       goal.        Some
                                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                                 S853

supporters          were        climbing        over        the    perimeter            security        fence          at     this

point      and may         others       were       congregating               on    the    tr a c k.        At    this       moment

t he    players         had     started       to    leave         the    fi e l d.        The    radio       messages              were

totally          incoherent        and       indeed         very    fe w      transmissions             appeared              to      have

been made          from 2.30           p.m.     onwards.            In the a b s e n c e          of a n y        other

information,             1 believed           that a         pitch       invasion          was    about          to    occur,          but

I had       no    idea     for    what       r e a s on .     The       c r ow d    in the       other       parts          of     the

ground were             very     orderly and            the       only       trouble       appeared          to       be    behind

the     Leppings         Lane     goal.




On     reaching         the L e p p i n g s     Lane        end and          standing          on the       track          in f r o n t

of     the N o r t h S t a n d ,       I still        could        not       see    the    c a use     of    the       trouble.

The     only      police a c ti o n          which      seemed          obvious         to me     was       to    form an             open

cordon across              the    touch       line      from       the       north west          corner          fl a g     towards

the     goal      mouth.         I ordered          officers            to    form,       this    cordon          to w h i c h

they      complied.




As     I neared         the     goal    mouth       I saw         that       the    emergency          gate       in the

perimeter          fencing        was       open and         police          Officers          were    attempting                to

pull      Liverpool           supporters           through and               onto    the       track.        (This          gate       was

the     one      immediately           to    the    left      of    the       goal,       as    viewed when                facing

the W e s t      S t a n d ).




Some      supporters            were    l y ing     on the         grass       j us t     off    the    playing             are a ,

some      were     in tears,           some     were        vomitting,             whilst       others       j us t        appeared

shocked and             dazed.         Shouts       and      screams          could       be    heard       from       the

supporters          in the        Central          pen are a .




I approached             the     perimeter          fencing         near       to    this       emergency             gate an d          on

looking          into    the     crowd       I saw a         pile       of    people       at    the    front          of    the
                                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                                               SS53

crowd.        T hey were         lying        on the          terracing         near       to       the    perimeter           wall

and    several       of    them       appeared           to    be    dead.          Bodies          were     l y i ng at       all

angles,       some      were     completely              buried         by o t h e r      bodies          on the       top     of

them.        Most    of    those       visible           were       blue      in the       face a n d           lips,     eyes

fixed and          staring,       their           hands       and arms        were        ivory          colour.         Traces          of

vomit    were       visable       around           their       noses       and mouths.                   They appeared

inconsisent          with       life.




The    crowd       behind       were       hysterical,              those      in d i r e c t        contact        with       the

bodies       were    still       under        crowd       pressure            from     behind.             The     only means

of    relieving         pressure           wa s    by a s s i s t i n g       persons          to    scale       the     fence       or

to    squeeze       through       the       gate;        both       these     means        being          hampered        by    the

presence       of    dead       bodies.




At    this    p o int     1 took       possession              of a      loud       hailer          (I    d o n ’t k n o w who

from)    and       shouted       instructions                 into      the    crowd       for       calm.         I also

pleaded       for    those       at    the        back    to    stop       pushing.             I was        aware       that

other    officers          were       atempting           to    remove         part       of    the       perimeter          fence

behind       the    goal.




After    a short          while       the     pressure          had      eased       in the          crowd       enabling

several       police       officers           to    enter       the      terracing             to    untangle          the

bodies.        I instructed                numerous           officers         to    enter          this a r e a a n d         be

observant          for a n y     persons           in the       pile wh o           may    s t ill        be a l i v e    and       to

give    them       priority.




I was    joined         by C h i e f       Superintendent                Nesbit        and Superintendent

Greenwood          (to w h o m    I handed            the      loud      hailer).              I then a s s i s t e d at             the

emergency          gate    by    causing           the    other         officers          present          to    form a        tunnel

thereby       endeavoring             to    keep      the      e x it    clear       of    persons           and    to
                                                                                                                             PAGE            7
                                                                                                                             SS53

facilitate              the    passage          of    bodies        through       the       gate.        A human         chain        had

developed whereby                     bodies         were    handled           onto    the    playing          area.




St    Johns        Ambulance             Officers       were        attemting          to    revive       the     bodies,         as

were    many        other          persons       including           fans       and Police          Officers.             M an y were

clearly        dead and             needed       to    be m o v e d       from    view.        I asked           some

supporters              to    collect          advertising           boards       for       use as       stretchers.              The

radio       wa s    faint          and    totally       incoherent.               No    instructions              were

forthcoming.                  I could          only    presume           the    gymnasium          to    be u s e d as       a

temporary mortuary,                       so    1 therefore              instructed          supporters           and Police

Officers           to    form       stretcher          teams        and    take       bodies       in t h a t     direction.




I was       aware        that       an A m b u l a n c e     ha d    stopped          behind       the L e p p i n g s     Lane

goal    and        that       dead a n d        injured        persons          were    lying       in t ha t a r e a .           I

instructed              one w i l l i n g       supporter           to    unhook       the    goal       net,     as     it w a s

obstructing              rescue          operations.




No mes s ag e s          had       been     passed      by     r a d io    or P.A.          System       and     the     crowd        on •
                                                                                                                                                 P
the S p i o n       Kop       could       not    as a w h o l e ,         have    been       fully       aware      of    the

s i t u a t i o n at         the    opposite          end    of     the    ground.           Those       being      stretchered

out    who     were          dead were          covered       by     coats       and    carried          on a d v e r t    boards

which       for     ease       of     carry were            held     by up to          some    12 to        14    p e ople.



It w a s     not        unreasonable             for    the N o t t i n g h a m        supporters           to    be     unaware

that    people           were       dead.        The    long        wait       caused       some    of    the N o t t i n g h a m

supporters              on    the S p i o n      Kop    to    jeer a nd          chant.        Liverpool            supporters

on    the    pitch,           some       of w h o m    were       in g r i e f    at    the    loss       of     friends         and

relations,              reacted angrily                to    this        and    some    ran    towards           the S p i o n H o p

with    arms        raised and              fists      clenched.               Some    seeing       others        running,

simply       joined           in the a d v a n c e ,         w h i c h wa s      immediately             dispersed         by
                                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                                SS53

Police       Officers.              As a     result       a    cordon was             formed across                 the    centre

line    of    the      pitch.




The    dead and          injured        were       slowly        being        cleared           from    the       pitch        but    the

terrace       wa s     now     clear,        save       for    those        uninjured.              Shoes,          coats,          keys

and    money       lying       on    the     terrace          was     guarded         by    other       Liverpool              fans,

most    of w h o m w e r e          still     hysterical.                From     the       outset         of     the     rescue

operation,            these     fans        had    been       blaming         Police        for      the     disaster           and

comments          s u c h as    'MURDERING BASTARDS"                        and   ’W H Y D I D Y O U O P E N              THOSE

B L O O D Y G A T E S ’ and         ' I T ’S Y O U R     FA U L T '     could     be       heard.




Emotions          were    extremely           high and           in the        eyes        of     some s u p p o r t e r s ,         the

Police       were      clearly         to    bl a me .        On e    supporter            was     so a n g e r e d       by    the

Police       t ha t    with     tears        streaming          down        his   face        he    took        hold      of m y

shoulders          in a v i o l e n t        manner       and        c a l l e d me     the       ch ief     of     killers.              His

colleague          restrained           him.        I did        not     witness           any     other attack                on

Police.           Many    fans       vented anger              at     the     p r ess      wh o    said      had     done

nothing       to      ’h e l p ’ , but       had    j u st     taken        photographs             of the        dy in g .          Any

person       in    possession           of a       camera        was     an    immediate             t a rg e t .




Several       members          of    the     Hillsborough               catering           staff       had      come      onto       the

field and were               distributing               cups     of w a t e r     to       rescuers          and     supporters.

They    were       greeted with abuse                    by    some      f a ns   wh o m a d e         reference           to       the

fact    that       water       would        not    restore           life     in t h e i r       friends.




There    wa s      outrage          and a     scuffle          on the         Leppings           Lane      terrace,            when       one

Liverpool          fan    tried        to    collect          money      from     the       property            behind         the

injured       or      dead.




At    various         points        during        the    r e s cu e ,    I had a t t e m p t e d           to     contact
                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                             S853

ground        control      via    radio,          but    this       was      to    no a v a i l .         In the       early

stages        I had a t t e m p t e d       to    contact         control          asking        for      the    evacuation

procedure         to     be a d o p t e d at       the       rear      of    the    central          pen,       there       was      no

response         to my      call.          It was       as     if a t r a n s m i s s i o n         switch was            jammed

open.




Eventually          the a n n o u n c e m e n t        was     given        that    the       m a t c h was      to    be

abandoned         and     the    c r o w d was         asked      to    remain          in s i t u     for a        few

minutes.          The     crowd,       however,          began         to    leave.           I took       my    serial         to

the L e p p i n g s      Lane    gates       on    the       outside         of    the       ground       unt i l     the

terraces         inside        were    emp t y ,        I then         ordered my             serial       to    perform

mobile        patrol      on    the    routes          leading         from       the    ground and             joined       them

in t h is       duty.       Radio      contact          ha d    been        re-established,                but      successful

transmissions             were    few and          far       between.




At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    6.30p.m.          we    were      directed          to       the N o r t h e r n G e n e r a l

Hospital         where      a disturbance               was     in p r o g r e s s       involving           Liverpool

supporters.              O n my a r r i v a l      I ascertained                  from       some    of    the      fans     that

t he    pre ss    ha d    been    intruding             upon      those       in gr i e f .          The     pre s s      had     been

asked      to    remain        in the       holding          area and were               under       the     directions              of

the    Health Authority,                   Press       Officer.             Some    had       become       over-

enthusiastic             and    had    taken matters                into      their          o w n ha n d s .       All     parties

including         the     Press       Officer          were     advised.




At     7.15     p.m.     my S e r i a l     gave       assistance            to    'D 1',       Sub-Division,               but      no

serious         incidents        occured.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 5 p m Chief            Inspector          Sumner         entered        the       qymnasiurn

and     informed         me    that     there       was    some      trouble          at    the L e p p i n g s       Lane    e nd

of    th e   ground and              that    he    re-deployed            the    rest       of m y      serial        to    that

area.        He a l s o       requested           other    officers          in the         gym    to     go    to    the

Leppings          Lane    end.




I immediately             entered           the    perimeter         track       via       the    entrance           between       the

Spion Kop and North Stand                          and made         my way along             the     perimeter             track

was     still          in p r o g r e s s a n d              I recall              the    crowd          roaring          in res p o n s e           to a

near    miss           by L i v e r p o o l            at   S p i o n K o p goal.                   I seem         to     re c a l l      Liverpool

winning        a       corner        as      a     re sult,            but     I cannot             be    certain.                 As   I neared

the     halfway             line     I saw             some       supporters              on    the       playing             area      in the

penalty        box          at    the L e p p j ^ g s                 Lane        goal. S o m e       s u p p o r t e rs w e r e          c lijs r b i ng

over     the       perimeter                 securityfence                   at     t hi s     po i n t       and many

others        were          congregating                    on        the     track.          At    this m o m e n t          the       pl^ers          had

started        to       l e ave      the         f^'eld.               Th e       radio m e s s a g e s were             totally

incoherent.                  In the           absence             of a n y         other       information,                   I believed             that

a    pitch     invasion was                      about           to    occ u r ,      but      I had          no    idea       for      what

reason.            The       crowd           iti the         other          parts        of    the       ground          were       vjsry orderly

and     the    only          t raum l e ap peared                      to     be    behind          the i - e p p i n a a / L a n e        g o a l.




On    reaching              the L e p p i n g s             Lane       end a n d         standing             on    the       track       in f r o n t

of    the N o r t h S t a n d ,               I s t i ll          could        not       see       the    cause          of    the      trouble.

The     only       police           action which                      seemed        obvious           to me         was       to    form an          open

xordon        across             thee t o u c h         line          from     the N o r t h          West         corner          flat    towards

the     goal       mout-fs.           I ordered                  officers           to    form        this         cordon          to w h i c h      they

complied.

         I approached             the    perimeter           fencing         nea/to           this        emergency          gate       and    on

         lookin       into      the     crowd        I saw a       pile p f         p e o p l e at        the    fron^'of          the

         crowd.        They were          lying        on t h e / e r r a c i j * q      near        to    tjae p e r i m e t e r       wall

         and    several         of    them appeared             to    be d e a d .           Bodies        were       l yi n g    at    all

         angles,       s o me     were    completely            buried           by o t h e r    bodies          on the          top    of

         them.        Most      of    those      visible        were       blue        in the        face       and    lips,       e ye s

         fixed and        staring,            their      hands       and     arms       were     ivory          colour.           Traces       of

         vomit     were       visible         around        their     noses        and       mouths.            They appeared

         inconsistent             with    life.




         The    crowd     behind         were        hysterical,           those        in d i r e c t      contact          with       the

         bodies       were      still     under        crowd       pressure            from     behind.              The   only means              of

         relieving        pressure            wa s    by a s s i s t i n g       persons        to    scale          the    fence       or    to

         squeeze       through          the    gate?        both     these means              being        hampered          by    the

         presence        of     dead     bodies.




«^jH ^ ^ A t   this    p o in t      I took      possession           a / a loud h a i l e r               (I    don't       k n o w who

         from)     and    shouted         i nst ruct ipns / n t o                the    crowd        for    calm.           I also

         the    goal.

         I instructed             numerous           officers        to    enter        this     area       and       be    observant          for

       3 .04     pm      (1504)           On       entering         the g r o u n d     from       the       N o r t h S tan d entrance,

       1 saw          the     players          were       still      on the       p itch         and a large number                  of      fans

       wera      on the           area        behind       the      Liverpool           goal      (Leppings            Lane      End).




       1 formed             the     impression             that      this     was       indeed a            pitch      invasion.             On

       reaching             the     fans       I found a number                  who     seemed          dazed and asking                   to    free

       their          friends           from       the Hop.

       civilians              trying          to    pull      the    fences       down         in o r d e r      to    free      the      fans

       trapped           behind          the w i r e .         As    i went       forward           to a s s i s t       these       Offi c e r s „

       I was          approached              by    two    men      carrying        a    civ il ia n who              a s k e d me     to    he;

                 started          to    resuscitate              him.        After       a while       the m a n      started        to       breathe

                        On arrival            I saw a         lar g e    number      of    f an s     in L e p p i n g s    Lane       shouting           and

                        pushing.             On    speaking         to a n u m b e r      of    residents          about     t hi s     I made        my

                        way     to     the    gymnasium.

                        Whilst         in the       gy m a w a i t i n g     our m ea l        an    inspector        who    I do       not      k no w
came       in a n d        ordered          us    out    onto          the    pitch.          He    said       that    there         had

been a         p i tc h     invasion.              This       would          be a b o u t     3.04      pm     ( '1504).

On    entering             the    ground          from       the N o r t h S t a n d          entrance          X saw       the      players

were       still       on    the       pitch and a                l a rge     number        of     fans      were     on the         area

behind         the     Liverpool             goal       at    the       Leppings         Lane       end.

I formed          the       impression             that       this       wa s     indead a          pitch       invasion.

On    reaching             the    fans       I found a number                     who    seemed         dazed        and asking            for

he 1 p .

1 sat       these          people          around       the       edge       of   the    pitch an d went               to      the    rear

of    the L i v e r p o o l           goal       area    where          1 saw a number               of      police        officers         and

civilians             trying          to    pull    the       fences          down      in o r de r       to    free       the      fans

trapped         behind           the w ire.

As    I went          forward          to a s s i s t        these       officers           I w as      approached             by two m e n

carrying          a    civilian             w h o a s k e d me          to    help      them.        They       said       he w a s a

f r ie n d .

J. s a w    that       the m a n was              blue       in the          facey^rnd a p p e a r e d          not    to      be

breathing.                 I placed          the m a n        on the          around        near     to      the     goal      nets a nd

started         to     resuscitate                him.

After       a while          the m a n           started          to    breathe         but      kept     slipping          back

unconscious'.

In t \~\jc r e c o l l e c t i o n w h i c h            I have          previously made                 I have        described            this

     n as      being        between          4 0 yr s        a n d 4 7 yrs,          3 68 tall          with       long     sideburns.

He    was    wearing             a bluey          coloured anorak                  type       jacket.           I previously

thought         that        this       m a n w as       wearing          cordoroy           trousers           but    in    fact      I'm

not    too      sure        about          the    clothing             apart      from      the     jacket.

Not    b e in g       any    stretchers             available                I obtained a hoarding                     and       with
                                                                                                   _______________________

Hop    end,       where          we    had       originally             entewed/the              pitch.

It a p p e a r e d as            if a n a m b u l a n c e          s t a t io n was         being       set     up    th e r e ,     and

there were             a    number          of    other       casualties             lying         on the       gr o u n d .

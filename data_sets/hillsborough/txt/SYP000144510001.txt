       No




Q48.   IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO

       THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

       It appears to be the popular view that the Liverpool      fans were

       in no way to blame for what happened.    I don't agree,   at 2.30 pm

       they were just a crowd of people                            (.ntent on

       getting    into the ground at any cost

(349» IT MAY BE ALLEGED THAT YOU ALLOWED SUPPORTERS THROUGH YOUR

         TURNSTILE WHO HAD NO TICKET AND THAT YOU MAY HAVE THEREFORE

         INCREASED THE NUMBER OF AUTHORISED SPECTATORS TO THE GROUND

         IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO SAY AT THIS TIME IN RELATION

         TO THAT POSSIBLE FUTURE ALLEGATION?

         Between 2,30 arid 3,00 pm I accept that people entered my

         turnstile either without tickets or with tickets for the wrong

         part of the ground.                 1   did let these people   in as 1 had no

         choice I could not send them back,                  they just could not have

         got back.         The only way would have been to close the turnstile

        and this 1 could not do as I am sure it would have caused

         serious problems outside.

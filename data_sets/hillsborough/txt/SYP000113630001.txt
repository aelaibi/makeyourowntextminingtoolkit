requx red a n d a s k e d               them      to    suggest           a venue»              Ihe bymnasiurn was

designated             and      bodies         and     injured           were       taken and          directed            there,          as

were       any medical             personal            who    volunteered                 their      services.

More       ana    more Liverpool                  supporters              were       by    this      time     on         the    pitch.

started          jeering.             This       inflamed           the       Liverpool          supporters               who       started

running          towards          them.          They were           held       b a ck     by a      line     of         police

When       it    became         apparent          that       most        of    the       dead and       injured             had      been

Incident at Hillsborough Football Ground, Saturday April 15th 1989

On Saturday 15 April 1989* I rang on duty at 9«00am. My instructions were to be at
the ground at 9.45am for a briefing for the Semi Final . All the officers on duty
were seated in the North stand where they were given a full and comprehensive
briefing by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and other senior officers.   I have
no doubt that at the end of the briefing each officer knew what was expected of him
and what his specific duties were.   The senior officers in charge of any specific
task or part of the ground were introduced and stood up in order that they could
be recognised. I was on Serial 1, which was supervised by P.S. Chapman.

After the briefing packed meals were handed out and consumed.    My specific duties
were th patrol the perimeter track from 11. 15am to kick off then take up a position
on the perimeter track for the duration of the game.    My point was in front of the
North stand at its junction with the Spion Cop* I patrolled the perimeter track
until 12.30pm when I was released by P.S. Chapman to have a hot meal. Following this
I returned to the perimeter track until 1.45pm when because of the large voltune
of prisoners being taken to the police room, I waB instructed by police control to
'man1the door to the police room allowing only those with prisoners or other legitimate
access into the room.   Most of those arrested were for offences involving
drunkenness and many of them were violent.    By 2.30pm the drivers of the prison
buses were reporting that the cells on the buses were full and that they were
having to put two to a cell.

I was still manning the door to the police room shortly after the kick off, when it
was reported that there was a pitch invasion £hd that all available officers were
asked to go on to the pitch.      I mads my way to the pitch but on the way met P.S
Paul Morton who had just come from the pitch. He was visibly shocked, and shouting
urgently for an ambulance that was parked near to the pitch, between the North
stand and the Cop,to follow him onto the pitch. He stated that there were at lea&t
twelve peojsle dead at that time.    He was met with disbelief. He got the ambulance
to follow him on to the pitch and slowly towards the Leppins lane end of the ground.

I saw that there were between ZOO to kOO people already on the pitch and that people
were being crushed behind the wire fences at the rear of the leppins Lane Goal.
I went to the gate at the rear of the goal and saw that although the gate was open,
there were about 4 or 5 bodies, obviously dead, laying in the gateway and blocking
it.   I climbed into the wall at the side of the gate and shouted to the people to
stop pushingand to try to move back.     A number of supporters were screaming and
spitting, obviously full of hate for   the police and shouting that it was the fault
of the police.   I did not at that time understand what they meant.    Efforts were
made to remove the bodies without success until one youth1braced his arms against the
uprights of the gate in an effort torelieve some of the pressure. With     his help
it was possible to remove m il of the  bodies and some small children from the compound.
From that moment it was just a matter of ensuring that people came out in a more orderly
way without falling.

An unconcious person was passed through to me and together with another person, I e
carried him into the pitch where I tried to revive him with mouth to mouth and chest
massageptfter a few mintes, an ambulance driver tried a resusitator on him but state t
that the man was dead.    The man was mid 20s, slim buildclean shaven. No other desc.

I tried to revive at least two other personal without success.  When the extent
of the disaster was becoming apparent, I told police control on at least two occasions
that a temporary mortuary was required and asked them to suggest a venue.   The Gym
-nasium was designated and bodies and injured were taken and directed there, as were
any medical peranel^e" who volunteered their services.

More and more Liverpool supporters were by this time on the pitch. The Notts Forrest
supporters for reasons beat known to themselves, had started jeering. This inflamed
the Liverpool supporters who started running towards them.   They were held back
by a line of police officers acress the pitch.   I saw one officer in a state of shock
being ranted and raved at by a supporter without apparently seeing or hearing him.
                                                                                -2L5)o

 At. some'stage in the proceedings, the fire brigad e   arrived and assisted with
 the removal of the dead and injured.

 Shen it became apparent that most of the dead and injured had been released, I
 assisted with carrying a stretcher to the Gymnasium. By this time, emergency
 medical supplies had just arrived and I assisted in carrying them to the top e
 end of the Gym where the injured were being attended to by voluteer doctors and
 other medical staff.   I assisted a doctor in emptying and sorting the crates
 and handing out medical supplies where required.   All the injured persons were
 eventually transferred to hospital via a fleet of ambulancesand I tidied up   all
 the remaining medical supplies into the crates in which they came and left them
 piled up in the centre of the Gym.

 Most of the bodies had been brought to the gymnasium by this time and when a
 number of body bags arrived, I assisted in placing some of the bodies in them,
 during the rest of the evening I obtained supplies of body tages, rubber gloves
 reports and any other items required and assisted with the reception of more
 bodies which had earlier been taken to hospital but which had been dead on
 arrival.

Numerous senior CID officers attended as dad the police surgeon/             Prof
 Usher and his team.   Numerous councillors, Social workers,vicars,salvation
 army workers and other personel were in attendance to minister to the needs of
 the relatives. The local councillor Irvin Patnick later attended with Colin
 Moynahan, the minister of sport, and the Chief Constable.

 Chief Superintendent Mole arrived quite early on in the proceedings to co ordinate
 and supervise the police officers dealing with the situation. Numerous officers
 have commented on the absence of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield following
 the disaster and the arrival of Chief Superintendent Mole was met with a great
 deal of relief by officers in the Gymnasium particularly.

An area was later screened off in the top part of the 6ym where relatives who
had made a preliminary identification of a body from polaroid photos of the
deceased taken earlier, could view the particular body with k view to positively
identifying them. C.I.D. officers were mainly concerned with this.

 I ceased duty at about 1.30am.Sunday 16th April.   When I arrived home, my wife
 was waiting up for me.   I sat and recounted exactly what had happened from start
 to finish. This was accompanied by a very large glass of excellent malt Whisky....

I found the telling of it quite difficult. I did not sleep wellthat night.
Apafct from that I do not feel that I have suffered any ill effects from the
experience.

 I feel that the manner in which the incident was dealt with can only reflect
 credit on the police. Many officers were deeply shocked but those who could
 detach themselves from the emotional side of it acted in a proffesional manner
 and carried out their duties the best they could under difficult circumstances.
 Again I have heard other officers comments about the policing outside the ground
 which include e.^iements that there was no other option open to Mr Marshall but
 to open the gate and relieve the pressure on the wall. Others have commented
 that there were not enough officers outside the ground at that point to cope
 with the numbers arriving.   These were no doubt depleted by the taking of
 prisoners.   The general feeling is that the fans arrived too late,and a lot
 of them under the influence of drink, to get into the groung in time for the
 kick off.

I have attended most of the matches at the SWFC since arriving in the division
in 1981. My duties at most matches have been^Jhe same, on the perimiter track.
Quite often at big games, I fly an aircrafiT-together with an observer, monitor
traffic on the approaches to the ground and the crowds around the ground*
 I was not required for that duty on this occasion.

                                                                                19 6 * "

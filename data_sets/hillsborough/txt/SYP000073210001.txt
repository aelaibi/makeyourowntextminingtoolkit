               When Liverpool        qualified for the F.A.Cup semi-final           to be played

               at Hillsborough Stadium,           Sheffield on April      15th 1989,    I contacted Mr

                         and he arranged a ticket for me. The ticket cost me £6.00 and it

               was for the Leppings Lane terraces,                there was no indication on the

               ticket as to which Pen it was for.

               On the morning of the game I wasjpiofced up in Ch^irch Street,                  Nuneaton,

I normally travel to football matches with a group of friends, On this

                                  /^cholas HEW^f/l^ and it was not until

after the game nad endexi, that I was'informed that they had travelled

to Sheffield on our coach.           I have seen them before when travelling to

a football match, as I recognised their                photographs following the

t ra ged y.

Almost as soon as our party boarded the coach, we started a card game.

I sat on the right of the coach facing the driving                  position,    my

group occupied the seats           in the middle of the coach and all five of us

were     involved in the card game.

The coach had already made a pick up in Coventry and was about half

full when we boarded.

I know that we also picked up supporters                in Hinckley and Leicester,

due to our card game,           I took no notice of how many boarded at those

locations and I did not see the HEWITT brothers get on,                    nor did I see

them at any time during the journey or upon our arrival at Sheffield.

Our journey to Sheffield was undelayed and we arrived at a road in

Sheffield,      where all of the other Liverpool           coaches appeared to have

parked, at 1.15pm.

At this time there was a good atmosphere and there were no unusual

incidents,      there had been no drinking of alcohol            on our coach,        that I

witnessed,      nor did I see other supporters drinking anywhere along our

rout e.

When we got off the coach in Sheffield there were Police officers
                                                                                     PAGE      3
                                                                                     S 1747

about and someone asked one which way we were to go, we were pointed

in the right direction and told it was a fifteen minute walk.

Other      coaches were arriving at the same time and we were walking

towards the ground with many other supporters. As far as I am aware,

everybody on our coach started this walk straight away and I do not

recall anyone           remaining with the coach.

I did not see the HEWITT brothers at this time.During jo y fifteen

minute walk to the ground,                I saw several    supporters,

that     I believe were following Liverpool,               drinlAr^f ou ts ide Public

Houses and Off Licences along the route. P e o V l i i n                     a good mood

arid I did not witness any disorder or drunkeness.

I arrived at the ground with                                    at about   1.30pm, we had

split up from the others because they had seats. We stood about

outside for a while taking                in the atmosphere,      I saw a few supporters

drinking from cans outside the ground,                   but again I saw no disorder or

cir u n k e n e s s .

I ^ v e n t u a l l y arrived at the turnstiles, Leppings Lane end, at               1.55pm.

I had no trouble finding my turnstile where the queues were about six

deep,      I had no difficulty entering the giAoum&/having been searched by
                            6ooV                           N
the Police outside and inside the turnst/i.’

I did not receive any Police or steward d i r                      n s at this time.      I had

handed my ticket              in at the turnstile.     I did not witness the

unauthorised entry to the ground by any person.

At no time did I see any open gates,                  nor did I witness the opening of

any g a t e s .

Having entered,              I did not see any signs f i i f f l c t iny"me to my match

viewing        point,       I went to the nearest available entry point to the

terraces,         which was the central         tunnel to Pens 3 & 4, I/did not see

any Police or stewards at this point and had free /passage along the

I did not witness any drinking or fighting within the ground at any

t irne.

At first,    I went    into Fen/3, /there was a large     crowd in this Pen at

this time,    because I am nfot/ L e r / tall   I made my way to a point close

to the front.       I could notKjnderstand why the majority of supporters

had chosen this Pen as I could see that there was far more room in Pen

4.    I had to struggle to get a good pojU            in Pen

I had arrived at my initial       vi            irtt in Pen 3           .05pit.. It was
                                                          *
very crowded and still       filling       Almost as soon as I had gained this

point,    still    in the company of my friend            I decided that        it would

be wise to move to a less crowded position.           We pushed our way to the

segregation fence between Pens 3 &/4.           I climbed onto a crush barrier

and then climbed over the fencej/into Pen 4,                had gone before me

and I joined him on the other side].                             -- -      n

I took up my final viewing       position at about 2.1Upm in Ken 4.             I was

stood with             in front of a barrier some 3 to 4 yards from the

segegating fence to Pen 3 and 4 to 6 yards away from the Perimeter

fence,.    At this time I was not subjected to any excessive crowd crush.

From this time up until about 2.30pm it was comfortable.                  I had been

reading my programme and we also          picked out our friends who were            in

the seats. Everything was fine,        there was no trouble and I was not

apprehensive about the crowd numbers.

It was at about this time that the Liverpool           players came out onto the

pitch for a kick about,       the crowd were happy and they began to sing

and sway back and forth,       it was still     comfortable at this time.

Within the next fifteen minutes the Pen steadily filled up, at 2.45prn

the players       left the pitch again.

At 2.55pm the crowd had become extremely compact,               I did not experience

a sudden surge,       probably because of the barrier behind us.

The   pressure had built up to a tremendous force by now.                I could not

see the playing surface because of the people          pouring    in,   in front of

me.   I could hardly move, my arms were folded up in front of me, my

elbows were being forced into my chest and stomach.           I began to

experience breathing difficulties and I was extremely hot.               It was

shortly after this that        I realised the teams were out and the game had

started.    I still    could not see,   I assumed this was due to the

crowd reaction.

People around me began crying and shouting to those behind to move

back,    they in turn shouted that they could not.        I could hear children

at the front screaming and I could see people around me going                red in

the face,     some had their eyes shut,      I do not know if they had passed

out or not.

I did not see anyone fall over,          it seemed impossible for them to do

so,   it was such a crush.

I believe most        people began to panic,   including myself,    I saw

 a Policemans helmet through the perimeter fence and saw

his hands above his head,        indicating to the crowd to move

back .

         aas helped    up on the shoulders of the crowd around us and         began

to make his way        to the perimeter fence.,! soon lost

sight of him and did not know if he       made it at that time.

A gate was opened in the perirnetef/ffrice, way down in the

left hand corner away from me,          l(jrauld just about see

people emerging onto the playing area,          I saw people making

their way to this gate along one of the gangways.

I could not get        towards this gate so I remained where I w a s ,expecting

the pressure to        cease as the supporters got out.

This was not the case, as soon as some went,          others just       piled into

their    places and the intense pressure just increased as the

minutes    passed.

It was at about 3.15pm that I began to lift myself up above the crowd,

people around me assisted and-7 1 eventually made my way to the         perimter

fence above the shoulders           he other supporters.    I got on top of the
 Cat                           (fa
fence where I caught my / r / lp e r s   on the spikes.   I released myself and

fell from the fence on tne track below.

I got to me feet and luckily saw               tanding by the goal and we were

re-united.

I looked back at the fence.        I saw Policemen and other supporters

climbing on it, some were urging the people to go back away from the

fence and others were     pulling    people out of the crowd.

I did not feel well,     I sat on the pitch,     I was very hot and sweating,

I was de-hydrated and shaking.

Everyone around me asked if I was okay,         I told them I would be alright.

I saw other people lying on the ground being attended to by Police,

Stewards and fans.     I was unable to assist,     I didn't know what day it

was .

I did not, see the barrier break in Pen 3, nor was          I near to it.

I remained on the pitch until about 4.30pm.         I felt alright and came

out of it uninjured.

I     made my way into the stands where my other friends were. We

eventually made our way out and got back to the coach at 5.10pm.

At 5.30pm                 told us that two from Leicester had not

returned,    but he did not say who they were. Shortly after this the

Police told us to carry on and they would arrange a lift back for them

when they were found.

I did not witness anything that I consider to be a criminal offence.

The only observations     I have    is that the opening of the gates    in the

perimeter fence     was delayed and that there was an apparant        lack of

communication. Once the situation was         realised everyone   involved did

all    they could to help.

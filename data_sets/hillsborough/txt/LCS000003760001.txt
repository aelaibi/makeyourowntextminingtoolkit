Dear

                   <Hi11sborough Disaster
I have enclosed our outline for a research and development
project based on an evaluation of the Merseyside social
services response to the Hillsborough disaster. You will see
that we have included costings and    preliminary details of
the studies.  Also included is a letter from the consortium
of Merseyside social services departments signed by David
Mason (Director of Liverpool Social Services).

Our short term goal is to provide the departments concerned
with immediate feedback on the effectiveness of their
services. Our long term aim is to develop the lessons learnt
into training and development material for much wider
application. We will undertake practice and development
activities in order to compare and contrast their experience
with that of others who have been involved in disasters
elsewhere.

Practice and Development Exchange has continued to thrive
since the early days made possible through the generous
support of the Trust. We first became concerned with social
work and social services response to disasters through work
with those responsible for organising services following the
Hungerford murders.   We have been exploring the feasibility
of exchange activities but have not wished to duplicate the
work of any of the other bodies involved in this field. ;
We were approached by the Merseyside consortium of
authorities independently through consultancy work we are
carrying out as part of the Community Social Work Exchange.
You will see from David Mason's letter that they are very
keen for us to do this work and will co-operate fully.

The discussions we have had so far have confirmed our belief
that there is important development work to be done in this
field. Since the first of the current round of disasters,
managers and staff have been able to get hold of some
relevant information.  Loose support and information sharing
networks of the professionals    involved   have now emerged.
But much work needs to be done.   John Crook, the Director of
Bradford, has also recently stressed the need for easier
access to and co-ordination of the relevant information.

We are not aware of any formal evaluation of any of the work
done in response to disasters.      Much of the counselling
undertaken is based on assumptions drawn from individual
bereavement counselling.    Workers involved in such work,
particularly those shilled and experienced in such work, have
felt that this is not enough with which to face disasters
striking whole communities of people.

We need to improve knowledge of practice in this area and set
up ways in which workers can be quickly prepared for such
work. We are sure that this development work will also be of
direct relevance to workers dealing with the far higher
numbers of people who are also sadly confronted with smaller
scale disasters but which are, of course,            no less
significant for them.

                of the Research Unit, has taken the lead in
developing this proposal and I know has had some contact with
you.   We will be forwarding our CVs as requested later,
either by Fax or by post.    We have had the opportunity of
giving a copy of the paper to Peter Barclay who attended the
Executive Committee meeting of the Institute on Wednesday
11th of October.

We will be glad to answer any further questions you may have
and look forward to hearing from you.


Best wishes,

Yours sincerely,

   Dear

                                         The Hillsborough Disaster

        I would like to confirm the commitment of the local authorities involved
   in providing the service response to Hillsborough to the pressing need for a
   systematic evaluative research project.   There is a requirement for this evaluation
   to be conducted by an independent agency of high standing.   It is for these reasons
   that the National Institute for Social Work was approached to undertake a study into
   the effectiveness of the response.

        The approach taken by the Institute in formulating their outline is supported
   by the Social Services Authorities and we would wish the study to begin as soon as
   possible.   I can also assure you that there is a high level of commitment to both
   service delivery and evaluation, so there would be excellent co-operation at all
   levels in Social Services Departments.

        I do hope that the Trust will feel able to support and finance this work which
   it is believed could have a major impact on the responses to disasters in the
   future.

                                               Yours sincerely,




                                               Director of Social Services.

                           SUMMARY




The proposed research and development study will focus on
evaluating the services provided by the Merseyside consortium
of social    services   departments    in  response to the
Hillsborough disaster and identify the practice elements
required at all levels in order to respond to such disasters
effectively.

Aims of the Project   The aims of the project are to:-

*   evaluate,    from    the   user's   perspective, the
     effectiveness of the services provided, by statutory
     and   voluntary sectors,   in     response   to the
     Hillsborough disaster    with particular emphasis on
     Merseyside.

*   to    describe and    compare the ways    in which they
     organised services in response to the    disaster,  and
     to analyse the organisational elements   and management
     performance' that aided or hindered      the effective
     delivery of services

*   organise exchange activities with those engaged in
    similar work and to identify the knowledge, skills
    and methods of work required by staff

*   devise training and organisational development
    materials appropriate for Social Services Departments
    and other welfare agencies and develop information
    packs suitable for professionals and agencies
    requiring such information when disasters strike in
    the future.

The work proposed is in two phases over three years.      The
first phase consists of three interrelated research studies;
a User Study - examining the benefit of the services to
users; an Organisation Study - concentrating on the
management practice in responding to a disaster; and a Staff
Care Study will identify the knowledge, skills and methods of
work required of front line staff.

The second phase, based on the research findings, will use
'practice exchange' activities in order to identify the major
social work practice and management issues learnt from this
and other disasters. It is anticipated that   this work will
produce training and development material based on research
and experience which will have major implications for social
services departments responding to disasters, also smaller
crises and, eventually, social work education and training.

Funding is sought for both phases. The research phase is
proposed to be completed in two years whilst the development
and dissemination phase would continue into a third year.

                                            Outline



Background


It    is   in     the    nature       of    disasters,      such    as    the    one     at
Hillsborough,            that    they       occur     unexpectedly,       that     their
specific        form cannot be predicted,                that they create great
personal distress on those who survive and on the bereaved,
and also that they place much strain on the organisations
which have to deal with the disaster immediately and those
that deal with its later consequences.                           It is also in the
nature of such disasters that they are outside the experience
of most people.               Thus planning           to deal with them can only
provide a         framework which,            given    individual       circumstances,
may be more or less helpful.


The ideas set out in this paper from Practice and Development
Exchange        (PADE)    at the National             Institute     for Social Work
stem       from    a     request       from        Merseyside      Social       Services
Departments         to have their             response     to    the     Hillsborough
disaster evaluated.               Crucial work is currently taking place
and    they       are urgently          seeking       feedback     in    the    form     of
evaluation of their activities so that they can adjust their
response and make the services they offer more effective.                                We
have therefore devised a research and development study with
this in mind


The paper         outlines       ideas       for    research     into    the     overall
effectiveness            of     the    social       services     response        to    the
Hillsborough           disaster       and    proposals     for   development          work.


                                               1
This    will    provide        immediate          help    to    those       working         in
Merseyside and essential information to agencies involved in
the aftermath of future disasters.                   The work will be carried
out through a partnership between the                       Institute1s Research
and Practice and Development Exchange Units                           and Merseyside
authorities.


The Institute's Research Unit has a long history of applied
research       in    personal         social       services.           Practice           and
Development         Exchange    (PADE)      was     established        in        1982    with
support from the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust to provide
information about innovations in the field of social care,
promote development work and the diffusion of new methods of
practice.


Exchange activities have led to the establishment of Niswis -
the    Institute's      information         service within           the     Institute's
library,    - a network of             information         officers         (SSIN)         and
information providing organisations                      (SWING).      PADE has also
developed      two major        DoH    funded      projects      -    'The       Community
Social Work Exchange'             and       'The Research            into    Practice'.
These exchanges have brought together expert practitioners,
managers       and    researchers          to     develop      new    approaches           to
practice,      to     establish        networks      throughout         the       U.K.     to
support     innovatory practice             and management,            and to           create
training materials.              There are now 21 PADE publications
including       directories           of   innovatory          projects,          training
material, descriptions of new practice, analyses and initial
evaluations of developments activities.                        Earlier this year we
published an account              of       work    undertaken         following           the
Hungerford murders.



Aims of the Project


The aims of the study are to:-


*     evaluate,        from     the        user's        perspective,              the
      effectiveness        of    the       services provided,               by     the
      statutory and voluntary sectors,                   in response to            the


                                            2 *
     Hillsborough disaster            with a particular emphasis on
     Merseyside


*    to     describe      and compare        the      ways       in which       they
     organised services in response to the disaster,                             and
     to    analyse     the     organisational          elements          and     the
     management       performance           of     staff     that       aided     or
     hindered the effective delivery of services


*    organise exchange          activities with            those       engaged    in
     similar work and           identify         knowledge,         skills       and
     methods of work required by staff


*    devise    training         and   organisational               development
     materials appropriate for Social                 Services Departments
     and other welfare agencies               and      develop information
     packs    suitable         for    professionals              and    agencies
     requiring such information when disasters strike in
     the future.


The work proposed is in two phases over three years.                                   The
first phase consists of three interrelated research studies;
the second is a development and dissemination phase.                             Funding
is sought for both phases. The research phase is proposed to
be   completed       in   two    years       whilst    the        development          and
dissemination phase would continue into the third year.

The Research Studies


The effectiveness of any social work service depends on the
skills     and methods        adopted by         those who       come     into direct
contact with members            of the public              who   require        help    of
themselves or in supporting others.                    Three interrelated and
crucial factors have emerged from our discussions with senior
staff from Merseyside social services departments.


*    the abilities of staff to respond appropriately;


*    the   steps     they     took,    in    partnership           with    other


                                         3
       agencies, to organise services;


*      the management and supervision given to                               front line
       staff.


This    understanding          has    led    to       the    three       studies      proposed
namely:-         a    'User Study';         an       'Organisation Study';             and     a
'Staff Care Study'.


'User' Study.                       Much of the literature about disasters
suggests that most                 of those involved               need       some    form of
debriefing or counselling.                   Some,          particularly amongst the
bereaved and survivors, may need longer term help in coming
to terms with the extraordinary experience,                              or alternatively
transforming           it    into     something             that    does       not     intrude
destructively into the person's ordinary life.


This study will describe the nature and scope of the work
practitioners           have       been     engaged          in    and       are    currently
undertaking           and    evaluate       the       use    made       of   them     by,    and
benefits        to,    the    survivors      and       bereaved.             We    propose    to
analyse the information contained in the national Helpline
database in terms of the problems noted and service outcomes
and interview in depth a sample of users of both the Helpline
and local counselling services.


Senior staff on Merseyside are keen to know why those who
could have           used    the    services,         set    up    in    response      to    the
disaster, have not done so.                  We will explore the feasibility
of tracing such people in order to explore this issue.                                        (A
preliminary draft outline of this study is appended).


Organisation Study.                    The Hillsborough disaster is unique
in this country in that the events unfurled in the course of
a national event - the FA Cup semi final, held in Sheffield,
between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC.                                    Thousands of
spectators at the ground saw it happen and countless others
watched it live on television.                        There is no way of tracing
all those who were 'involved' in the tragedy.                                     However,   the
majority    of         those who died or narrowly                       survived       and the


                                                 4
bereaved came       from the Merseyside            region which           includes    a
mixture of metropolitan and county authorities.


One   of    the     immediate      problems        was      co-ordinating           the
multiplicity of social services, other authorities and local
politicians in order that an efficient and effective response
could be mounted for the ongoing care for the survivors, the
bereaved     and    others     affected       by     the     disaster         in    the
Merseyside region.


This study will appraise the work of the 'Inter Agency Forum'
which was set up on Merseyside to co-ordinate responses to
the disaster.         This forum now has representatives from the
seven authorities that cover Merseyside;                     that       is,   Cheshire
and   Lancashire          county      social         services           departments
a n d ,Liverpool, Knowsley,          Sefton     and Wirral metropolitan
social services. There is also additional representation from
various     other    social     services,       health           and    educational
authorities including that from Sheffield and Nottingham.


The study will describe how it was set up and analyse those
elements    in the    organisation and management that aided                         or
hindered the effective provision of services that were seen
to be needed.       It will compare the work of the Inter Agency
Forum with the response of the two other locations from which
spectators were       likely to come;          Sheffield,         the city which
hosted the        game,   and Nottingham,            the    home       city   of    the
opposing side in the match.           (A preliminary draft outline is
set out in the appendix).


Staff Care Study.                      As     part    of    the management           of
services set up in response to a disaster, it is important to
understand the extent to which staff feel they were prepared
for the work        involved and were managerially supported and
adequately        supervised    in    doing     it.        The    problem      to    be
addressed    is    whether    staff    felt    they        had    the    skills     and
training required or whether the demands being placed upon
them were outside their range of experience.                      Associated with
this is the extent to which various forms of supervision were
felt by staff to be sufficient.               In addition to the training


                                       5
and special         arrangements       set up       by    the   social     services
authorities, the local British Association of Social Workers
(BASW)      established special supervision facilities for staff
working with members of the public.


This study will          examine that nature of the problems                      dealt
with by staff, analyse the knowledge and skills required to
deal     with    those     problems    and     assess      the    nature       of     the
managerial       support    and    supervision       required      and    given.        In
essence it would adopt a practice exchange approach in order
to     gain     this     information.        (A     preliminary          outline        is
appended).



Links with 'Cruse'


We have been           in contact    with     the    Disasters         Working      Party
funded by the Department of Health, undertaken and hosted by
Cruse.        It is anticipated that our research and development
activities       will     complement    the       Cruse   Working       Party     which
concentrates on the psychological and social aspects of the
several disasters,              which have happened in the                last        five
years, and their           terms of reference include the response by
all emergency authorities.             They will not be evaluating the
response to the Hillsborough disaster.



Development and Dissemination


Reports on the study will be produced and disseminated in the
usual way both to the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust and to
those who participated in the research.                     However, the major
dissemination effort,             in the second phase of the project,
will centre upon exchange activities and the production of
information and          training materials           for those working               with
disasters in the future.             During the course of the second and
into the third year we intend to:-


*       bring together practitioners                and managers        involved
       in   other      recent    disasters    throughout         the    U.K.     to


                                         6
    compare       and     contrast        their       experience           with    the
    research findings emerging                      from the Hillsborough
    studies.        Networks of such staff already exist on an
    informal      basis with participants offering help                           and
    support.        Some of these people are also linked into
    the    Disasters         Working      Party.         Our   activities         will
    look specifically at the practice issues, that is the
    knowledge,skills and methods of work that are needed
    by    counselling         staff      working      with     members       of    the
    public.             The        findings          from       the        proposed
    organisational and support studies together with the
    experience of others elsewhere, will be reviewed to
    identify        the      key    elements         which      promoted          good
    counselling practice.


*   review    the      developing        data      base of      the     Disasters
    Working Party and, if appropriate,                         establish a data
    base     of   relevant         information           including         training
    materials          and    descriptions           of practice           methods
    relevant to people in the aftermath of disasters


*   establish        working            groups      on    specific          issues
    identified          through          the       exchange      and       research
    processes to identify record and publish the major
    lessons       to    be     learnt       for      practice         development
    including social work                  training and          professional
    education in this field


*   work with practitioners                 and managers             to write      and
    publish       examples         of    their      work,      and    to   use    the
    research        findings        and        exchange         activities         to
    identify characteristics                   of exemplary practice


*   if appropriate,           to establish a data base of people
    who are available to participate in particular types
    of training and organisational                       consultancy         in   the
    event of future disasters.


The above work will yield a number of publications covering
both the research elements and the training and development


                                               7
material. In addition a final report would be made available
to the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust on completion of the
third year.

It is also intended that the results would be shared with
other bodies involved in disaster research,            for example, the
'Disaster     Prevention and    Limitation        Unit'       at    Bradford
University and the 'Disasters Working Party' hosted by Cruse.


Timing

The planned length of the research phase of the study is two
years    from the appointment        of a project      director;            the
development and dissemination is planned to take the project
into a third year.


Since the effects of being           involved in the Hillsborough
Disaster may continue for some time yet,            it would be very
advantageous    to be able to start soon.        In summary


Year 1      Research Studies - start
Year 2      Complete Research Studies and start development
            activities
Year 3      Completion of    Development Activities, publications
            of training and development material                   and Final
            Report.


Staffing


It is envisaged that a project officer together with research
and   secretarial assistance will       be    required        in    order    to
undertake     the whole    project.     The    value     of    having       two
researchers undertake this work lies in the speed with which
the work needs to be accomplished            and in the crucial need
for support in this highly stressful field of research.                      We
are also    proposing that      such   staff    need to       experienced
researchers in order to deal with the nature of the subject
matter and     relate to    senior   local    authority       officers      and
members.
Location


This    work   will    be    undertaken         from     within    the     National
Institute for Social Work's Practice and Development Exchange
with access to the resources of the Research Unit


Costs


The total costs of the research studies would be in the order
of £150,000.          This    includes        salaries     for two       full    time
research   staff,      secretarial       and     administrative         assistance,
supervisory time equivalent of a total of 3 days per month of
the Directors of PADE and the Research Unit,                       accommodation,
postage e t c . , travel and            equipment.        (Detailed costs            are
attached) . Costs           for   the     second phase          have    yet     to    be
identified in detail but will be                  in the     region      of£70,000.
The senior staff of the Inter Agency Forum are seeking funds
from various local charities and have agreed verbally that
should they      be   successful        and     should    the    Rowntree      Joseph
Rowntree Memorial Trust fund the proposed work in total, then
there    would   be    a    reduced      call    on the    total       grant    herein
requested.


Management


It is    proposed that a Consultative Committee be                       set up       to
which    the Joseph Rowntree            Memorial Trust will            nominate       at
least one member; other members can be agreed in consultation
with the Trust.

          THE   EFFECTIVENESS

    three research studies proposed.

Introduction

Two main services have been set up by the Inter Agency Forum
on Merseyside as a result of the Hillsborough disaster: a
national telephone Helpline initially staffed with volunteer
counsellors from social services and voluntary organisation;
and a longer term local counselling service staffed by social
workers.   It is hoped that a permanent regional centre will
be established.

The question of how far the services provided in response to
the Hillsborough disaster met the needs of those who used
them is of critical importance for the people caught up in
the disaster.    It is, however, equally important to the
service providers to know in what respects the resources
allocated were effective.

In attempting to evaluate the effectiveness and quality of
services provided it will be important to bear in mind the
different range of problems presented and the different
nature of the services created and used.    For example, some
may have used the Helpline just once and not have used it
again, as far as can be known; others may have used the
national Helpline to gain information about relatives who
were at the match and later needed assistance with
bereavement or other forms of counselling; yet others, having
survived the disaster, may have needed help in learning to
cope with that experience.    Furthermore the sensitivity of
the initial contact may have had an important bearing on
whether or not people returned for further 'counselling1.

Aims.

The aims of this study are to:-

*   describe the nature of the problems for which the
    national telephone Helpline was used and the service
    outcomes

*   describe from users' perspectives the nature of the
    problems stemming from the Hillsborough disaster and
    describe how they evaluate the services provided

*   appraise the services provided in the light of the
     perceived needs of the users and various outcome
     measures.

Method.

The   study would   be conducted in two parts. Part 1 would
analyse information on the Helpline database in terms of the
problems noted and the outcome as far as that service was
concerned.    The national telephone Helpline based in


                              12
Merseyside has a computerised record system.       Initial
discussions with senior members of the Inter Agency Forum
have indicated that it would be possible to gain access to
this database for these research purposes. The counselling
services have separate and to some extent overlapping
records.

Part 2 would comprise in depth interviews with a sample of
the users of the different services that had been established
by the Inter Agency Forum. If practicable we would also
compare the effectiveness of these services with that of
services received by people elswhere; for example, some of
the bereaved came from the south of England.


It is anticipated that, in terms of service take up, it will
be possible to use the Helpline database as a sampling frame
to   create four distinct groups of people and interview in
depth up to fifty people in each category.

*   Those who contacted the Helpline and were recommended
     for further counselling at a local level and took it
     up.

*   Those who contacted the Helpline and were recommended
     for further counselling at a local level and did not
     take it up.

*   Those who contacted the       Helpline and were   not
     recommended for further counselling at a local level
     but sought it and took it up.

*   Those who contacted the Helpline and were         not
     recommended for further counselling at a local level
     and did not seek it.

In addition, some people reached the counselling services,
other than through the Helpline.       It may therefore be
necessary to create a fifth group of people who used
counselling services but did not use the Helpline.

In terms of the sorts of people, it would seem that there
would be three main groups of people who would make demands
on the special services:

*   the bereaved

*   the survivors from the disaster site itself (that is the
     Leppings Lane enclosure)

*   witnesses of the   disaster    both   at   the   ground   and   on
    television.

There are a number of comparisons which could prove useful
including those between users and non users of the Helpline;
between those who used counselling services and those who
didn't; between those who used the special services and those
who used 'normal' services elsewhere; between the bereaved
and both the survivors and the witnesses.



                              13
It has also been suggested by senior staff of the Inter
Agency Forum that it would be useful to include in this stady
a sample of people who were at the match but who did not use
any of the services.    We will explore the feasibility of
contacing such people.

Measuring independently the outcome of contact with the
Helpline   and   further     counselling   services  will   be
problematic.    Not only will it be difficult to ascribe
particular outcome to the service interventions but the
consequences of being involved in a disaster may take some
time to emerge.     However,      it would seem, in the first
instance, that the following measures would be useful.
First, whether or not there had been a 'progression' from the
special services to hospital in patient treatment.      Second
whether as a result of the disaster people had become
estranged from their families of origin or generation even to
the extent of separation or divorce; third evidence of
continued personal disorganisation, for example, increased or
sudden financial debt; fourth, the length of time off work or
indeed resignation from work; fifth, changes in the people in
personal networks; sixth, in view of the expected youth of
some respondents, whether respondents 'dropped out'         of
school or college; the length of time taken off school or
college and whether it was felt that exam results were
adversely affected.

Resources.

The nature of these interviews, both in terms of content and
type of people to be interviewed, require experienced staff.
It is proposed that there should be two researchers which
will increase the speed with which the work can be
accomplished and who will be able to support each other
during the course of the fieldwork.     Supervision will be
provided by the Director of PADE and research consultancy is
available.

Timing.

It is expected that this study would take one year.   It is
envisaged that the organisational study would be undertaken
first as necessary background to this study.     This study
would therefore start in the first year but carry over

                      ORGANISATIONAL STUDY.


Introduction

Emergency services are by definition designed to cope with
the immediate impact of disasters of varying magnitudes -
that is to cope with the control, rescue and treatment and
immediate care of those caught up in disasters. Social
services authorities have responsibilities for the ongoing
social care of those affected. However, the 'victims' of the
Hillsborough disaster came from all over the Merseyside
region and beyond. The various authorities on Merseyside had
to collaborate in order to create a coherent response to the
tragedy, and to provide an efficient and effective service to
those who needed help in coping with the disaster.

They had no specific operational links at a metropolitan or
regional level with each other or with other service
authorities.   However, the day after the tragedy, a Sunday,
what later became known as the 'Inter Agency Forum' met for
the first time and started to plan and implement a co­
ordinated response.

Aims.

The organisation study will examine work of the Inter Agency
Forum in terms of how the social services authorities
responded to the crisis of having a disaster on its hands
which, while it took place in Sheffield, had consequences for
people primarily on Merseyside, and to some extent in
Nottingham and Sheffied.  The Inter Agency Forum is attended
by staff not only from seven Merseyside authorities but also
from Nottingham County and Sheffield City social services
departments.   In examining the work of the Inter Agency
Forum, there will be some scope for comparisons between
authorities

The     study aims to:-

*     describe the process by which the 'Inter Agency
      Forum'   was  set up,  is   maintained and,   if
      appropriate, disbanded

*     analyse the issues and problems of using inter agency
       collaboration as a means of setting up and running
       services of a longer term nature

*     appraise the work of the 'Inter Agency Forum' in
      terms of the services it provided and the speed with
      which it was able to respond.


Methods.

There will be two main sources of data; the record/minutes of
meetings concerning the 'Inter Agency Forum' (some of which
have already been made available) and interviews with key
actors for example those responsible for setting up and


                                15
running the 1Inter Agency Forum1.

In addition, it will also be necessary to interview those in
the constituent agencies   both officers and membersin order
to gain a perspective on the difficulties in implementing
•decisions' made by. an ad hoc body which technically had no
decision making powers and was not formally accountable to
anyone.  In Sheffield and Nottingham a more limited approach
will be pursued since staff from both those authorities have
participated in or are still part of the Inter Agency Forum.
This will amount in total to approximately 7 0 - 80
interviews.

The key areas of concern   are likely to be:

    how the predecessor    to the Inter Agency Forum1 was
    set up; getting the relevant people to attend;
    operating in a context when information about what
    had happened and what to do about it was scarce;
    gaining access to appropriate advice; perceptions
    about the key issues to be dealt with; setting up,
    organising, staffing and funding of 'extra' services;
    involvement of 'youth' in the disaster; support for
    staff; issues of implementing locally 'agreements'
    made in the Inter Agency Forum;   issues of providing
    separate/specialist or integrated/generic services;
    personal coping strategies; perceived benefits
    accruing.

Outcomes.

There are three expected outcomes from this study:-

    lessons learnt from this experience which could be of
    benefit to other organisations which have to deal
    with a disaster.

    the application of the lessons learnt from close
    liaison work, during the crisis period, to the
    everyday relationships with other agencies

    the application of the need for 'special' staff
    support for those dealing with the disaster to other
    types of crisis in social services (e.g. taking
    children into care or death of a child in care)

Timing.

It is anticipated that this study would be completed within
six months and would be undertaken first.
Resources.

As with the other studies it is anticipated that two members
of staff would be required.

                        STAFF CARE STUDY.


Introduction

The Hillsborough disaster necessitated using social work
counselling staff from social services and voluntary
organisations from many parts of the Merseyside region on
special duties for varying lengths of time. These included
the national telephone Helpline      and the setting up of
special teams or other arrangements to deal with referrals
from the Helpline and elsewhere.   All counselling staff, no
matter how experienced, need some measure of supervision and
support to enable them to continue to respond appropriately
to the crises of others and manage complex human relations.
At the interface with clients, dealing with the consequences
of a disaster would appear to create stress amongst two sets
of staff.   First, staff who counsel those with individual
crises, and second,     team leaders and area managers who
supervise and manage.

The front line counsellors may be or perhaps may feel
themselves to be ill prepared for working with these types of
crises whilst team leaders and area managers may not know
what type of management support should be made available to
counselling staff and also the added problem of dealing with
the workload of those who have taken on the special duties.
The local BASW office has also established a confidential
supervision and support service to counselling staff.


Aims.

The aims of    this study are to:-

*   analyse   the nature of the 'client' problems as seen
     by staff who worked on the Helpline and other special
     local counselling services

*   analyse and appraise the nature of the     supervision
    offered to the two grotips of staff

*   analyse   the knowledge, skills and methods   of work
     required for dealing with the 'victims' of disasters
     and those required for supervising staff in such
     tasks.


Methods.

It is intended to undertake this study by means of a series
of 'practice exchanges' in which those who participated in
the various services are brought together to exchange their
experience and practice.     The precise number of group
exchanges will not be known until more detailed information
is available about the numbers of staff who participated in
the different aspects of the special services.  However, it
is proposed that there should be the following types of
exchanges:-



                                 17
*    one involving social work or other staff who gave a
     front line service to 'victims' via the Helpline

*    one involving social work or other staff who gave a
     front line service to 'victims' via the longer term
     but local counselling services

*    one concerned with first line managers, frequently
     called team leaders, who gave support to the front
     line staff

*    one concerned with the next tier of management,
     frequently called area managers, to identify the
     management practice issues of working in the context
     of a disaster: for example, managing the workloads of
     those absent on the special services; managing staff
     who may feel second class because not asked to
     undertake special duties; supervising and supporting
     the team leaders of the special services

*    one concerned with the nature of support given by
     agencies or people outside the 'home' organisation,
     for example BASW.

It is anticipated that there would have to be up to six
meetings of each group and that for some there would have be
groups in the different social services departments and other
organisations that provided special services.    For example,
whilst there might be a single 'group' concerned with
assessing the nature of the problems and skills required to
work on the Helpline, there would probably need to be several
groups to cover the different social services departments
that set up special teams to deal with the ongoing work.

Timing.

It   is   expected   that this study would take   one   year.

Outcomes

The main outcomes from this study will be an understanding of
the skills training and supervision required in the face of a
disaster.   Such material could be transformed into training
material for use in the face of disasters.    In addition, on
the assumption that crises highlight general skills that
workers ought to have, then the material would become of
general interest toj social work training and education.   It
may also feed into the everyday practice of supporting
working in the face of equally acute but less general crises
- for example the death of a child in care.

Resources

It is anticipated that two members of staff will be required
both of whom would need to be experienced staff for dealing
with groups and be able to analyse material from group
settings.   The necessity for two members of staff rests on
the nature of the work to be undertaken and the need to
undertake such work quickly.

PERSONAL




Dear David,

                           Hillsborough Disaster

     Many thanks for your letter of the 12th October and the outline and
correspondence.

     I am extremely impressed with both the quality of the product and the
speed of its production.   I do hope that the Rountree Trust are equally
impressed but, if not, perhaps you and I and                         could get
our heads together regarding other sources of xinance.

     You mentioned in your p.8. that you were sending a copy of the Hungerford Paper.
Unfortunately you omitted to do so. I would be pleased to see it if you can let me
have a copy.

     Again, many thanks.

                                Yours sincerely,




                                Director of Social Services.

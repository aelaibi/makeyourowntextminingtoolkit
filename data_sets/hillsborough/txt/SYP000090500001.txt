                I am a Police Sergeant         in the South Yorkshire Police,            and currently a

               member of Headquarters Training Department              carrying out duties as the

                Divisional Training Officer for         ’D * Division.

               On Saturday 15 April       1989 (150489)    I was a member of D2 Sub Division,

                stationed at Attercliffe Police Station, Sheffield.

               At 8 am (0800 h r s ) that day I commenced duty at Attercliffe Police

                that day. The match was to be played at Hillsborough Football G r o u n d .

 F O E R S , 343 V E R N O N .Liverpoo 1 fans were escorted from the Midland

 Railway Station and onto buses.                      Two officers travelled with each bus

 to Hillsborough Football Ground and were to return after dropping the

 fans off at the ground to collect others.

 After the P C ’s in the Serial were all allocated buses, Police Sergeant

 593 RODDIS and myself travelled with a bus load of fans who were

 dropped off at Leppings Lane on the opposite side of the                                    road to where

 the turnstiles are.                 The^P^ns were met off the bus by a Police

 Sergeant - Sergean tVffiCTER a nd directed to the turnstiles.

 After the fans had debussed, Police Sergeant RODDIS and myself

 returned with the bus to the Midland Station.

 There were many fans outside the football                          ground in Leppings Lane but

 the numbers at that time                I thought were no more than I had seen in

 previous Semi final matches.

 At approximately 2.25 pm (1425 h r s ) that date,                           I was at the Midland

 Station and Liverpool fans had all departed.                              I boarded a bus with

 other officers,           including Police Sergeant RODDIS,                     from my Serial and

 other Serials,          to travel       to Hillsborough for standby :in the gymnasium

 where a meal was to be provided during half time.

 The bus followed the route previously taken and we got off the bus in

 Penistone Road North outside the front entrance to the ground and to

 the gymnasium.            I went to the gymnasium with my Serial where we stood

 by.

 At approximately 3.05 pm (1505 hrs)                       I was deployed with my Serial on

 the direction of Inspector DEWS on to the perimeter track alongside
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          S3476

' the pitch and in front of the North stand.       The football match was in

 progress at this time.

 With my Serial and Inspector DEWS,       I walked along the perimeter track

 towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground.         I could see fans on the

 perimeter track and the grass at the back of the goal at that end of

 the ground.

 I saw an officer   run onto the playing area from the corner of the

 Leppings Lane terracing and the North stand and speak to the referee.

 With other officers    I began to usher faj>«roff the p i t c h .   As we did so

 I could hear shouting that people W r e      being crushed in the Leppings

 Lane terracing behind the goal and I could see people at the front of

 the terracing being squashed against the wire e nc l o s u r e .    The crowd

 behind them were bearing down on them.

 I waved my hands to direct spectators to move back and stood on top of

 a low wall at the base of the wire fencing and shouted at them to move

 back.    There seemed to be enough room to relieve the pressure but no

 amount of shouting or waving appeared to have any effect.

 There were many other officers also doing the same as myself.            Many

 fans were now trying to climb over the fence and seemed oblivious to

 the persons trapped at the front and who were by then obviously in

 mortal   danger.

 With other officers    I assisted fans climh^rig over the fence and helped

 them down or caught    them as they ju

 Access to the enclosure was extremely difficult almost         impossible    in

 the circumstances,    the fence being toohigh from the playing area          side

 and being                 »tal spikes.

 There was     _           ie enclosure to the rear of the goal which was

 open and officers were attempting to pull people        clear and on to tprg

 track.    Due to the width of the gate,     it was very difficult for/two

 persons to stand side by side and drag persons through.             I a/sisted to

                 tendered by others

                 Chief Super intenderft N§J5B1T was at that location and was helping to

                 pull    people from the enclosure via the small gateway.             Because of the

            .    difficulty with the narrow gate,         two lines of officers were formed

a   V A O        wh.ch I joined and      a S people were pulled free they « r e         pressed along

                 this line and onto the playing area where others took them away.                   Son'ic

                 face,   others   injured but alive.
-Vo S ^ O -
                 Others were climbing through the gates as persons/bodies w e r ^ being

                 extricated.      E v e n t u a l ! / m y s e l f and Police Sergeant RODDIS managed to

                 get inside the encjrosure by which time almost all the persons who had

                 been crushed 4j/^he front had been recovered.

                 With other officers we cleared the remaining fans who were uninjured

                 towards the rear of the terracing.

                 When the enclosure was almost clear we went back onto the pitch to

                 attempt to regroup with the remainder of our Serial who were by now,

                 all split up.

                 There was a large number of spectators on the playing area by now and

                 a large number of them began shouting and gesticulating towards the

                 Nottingham Forest end of the ground and then began to charge towards

                 that end of the ground.

                 Someone shouted instructions to form a cordon across the pitch to

                 prevent them getting to the Nottingham Forest fans.

                 With Police Sergeant RODDIS I joined the cordon across the pitch at

                 the half way line.

                 With Police Sergeant RODDIS I went the full             length of the cordon in

                 order to find members of my Serial and regroup.               I was only able to

                 find a couple of officers from my Serial and spoke to Inspector DEWS

                 who    instructed me to stay with the officers          I had found whilst he went

         Upon the return of Inspector DEWS,    I was   instructed to return to the

         buses in Penistone Road North / Halifax Road,       together with the other

         officers mentioned above,   to transport fans back to the Midland

         Railway Station.

         I travelled on a double deck bus in company with Police Sergeant

         RODDIS and a number of football    fans.

         The coach off loaded at the Midland Station where       I remained to

         supervise returning fans back onto the Station.

         At 6.45 pm <1845 h r s ) that d a y , I returned to West Bar Police Stat ion

         and subsequently to Attercliffe Police Station where I went off duty

         at 8.00 pm (2000 h r s ).

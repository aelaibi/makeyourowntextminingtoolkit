         At this           time there was             quite a crowd at                 the    back of the              terraces             but

          It was as          the       players were           coming       out    or     just prior            to them         corning

         out     that       first      crush s t a r t e d, at           this     time P h i l i p was w it h me?                      1 was

          pushed towards               the     goal     in this          crush    I d o n ’t know what                h ap p e n e d        to

         .Phi lip,         and    I didn"t        see      him after        the    first       crush,        there were

          people all             round me and           I couldrt* t see a n y t h i n g             I had to            put my head

         to breath and all                    I could       see was       the sky.            I d o n ' t know how                long          I

         was     in this          crush for          but    eventually           the    pressure was              released             from

         me and        i. made my way out.

          It was also             during       the    crush that           1 started to fall                 to the          floor,

         and s o m ebody g rabbed                hold of my green jumper                       wit h buttons               and for

         quite        some       time my feet w e r e n ’t on the                  floor       by the        person ho ld in g

         On making my way out                     of the       g r o u n d 1 went        out    the    same         tunnel          that            I

         had e nt a r e d by .

         There w a s n ’t anyb o d y              else      I saw there           that       I knew.

           Dear Ms Firth,

           TODAY

           I refer to our telephone conversation earlier this week and
           confirm that I have now received copies of the article
           appearing in the edition of Today published on 30th January
           last together with a copy of the final Report of Lord Justice
           Taylor into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.  I set out mv
           comments below.

           1•                  Lord Justice Taylor's Report

                               The article appearing in Today purports to set out Lord
                               Justice Taylor's findings.  In this regard, the article
                               concentrates principally on Chapter 1 of the Report which
                               levels criticism at both the Football Association and The
                               Football League.  That criticism is contained mainly in
                               paragraphs 51 and 52 under the heading "Poor Leadership"
                               and can be summarised as follows:-

                               (a)                    The Administration (including The Football League)
                                                      has not taken a lead in securing reasonable safety
                                                      and comfort for the spectators and in enforcing
                                                      good behaviour.

                               (b)                    The Football Association and The Football League
                                                      have not seen it as their duty to offer guidance to
                                                      clubs on safety matters.

                               (c)                   The Football Association and The Football League
                                                     have been much concerned to avoid pitch invasions                                                                                                                                                           Brussels
                                                     because they interfere with the smooth progress of
                                                     the fixture list and incur criticism and penalties                                                                                                                                                          Hong Kong

Letter To    Ms G Firth



             2.   The Article in Today

                  The banner headline on the front page of the edition of
                  Today published on 30th January last reads "Treated Like
                  Dirt   and contains a photograph of victims of the
                  Hillsborough Stadium disaster,   a separate headline at
                  the top of the front page reads "Condemned: the football
                  bosses who put fans in a living and dying hell".    Against
                  that headline appears, inter alia, a photograph of the
                                T^ e         League, Mr Fox with the caption
                   Guilty, League Chief Fox".   in our view, this headline
                  is defamatory and is actionable both by The Football
                  League and by Mr Fox.   The imputation is that The
                  Football League (and its President) have been found
                  jJUiity by Lord Justice Taylor of causing the injury and
                  deatn of supporters at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15th
                  April 1989.   Any imputation which may tend to lower a
                  person in the estimation of right thinking members of
                  society or to expose that person to hatred, contempt or
                  ridicule is defamatory and actionable.   The common
                  defences to defamation are justification or truth, honest
                  expression of opinion on a matter of public interest and
                  fair comment.   There are also defences of absolute or
                  qualified privilege.   it seems unlikely that any of these
                  defences would succeed at trial although they are, of
                  course, likely to be raised.

                  There are other references to The Football League in the
                  a.r ticle which on ka lance we also regard as defamatory
                  although these statements are less clear cut.     For
                  e x a m p l e :-

                  (i)     It is stated in the left-hand column on the front
                          page in lines 14 to 20 that:-

                               "Lord Justice Taylor pinned the blame on The
                               Football Association, The Football League,
                               the Directors of the big clubs and players.
                               They encouraged hooliganism and the "cult of
                               excessive drinking" by their complacency and
                               mismanagement of the soccer industry."

                          There is no suggestion in the Report that The
                          Football L e a g u e _"encouraged" hooliganism and
                          excessive drinking although criticism is levelled
                          at the Football League for failing to take a lead
                          in enforcing good behaviour.

                   (ii)    It is stated in column 2 on page 4 in lines 4 to 9
                           that:-

                                "Administrators like FA Boss Bert Millichip
                                and The Football League's Bill Fox must
                                shoulder their share of the responsibility
                                for the situation soccer finds itself in,
                                says the Report".

                           The Report does not in fact draw this conclusion
                           nor does it single out Mr Fox for criticism.
                           However, it is (as I have said above) critical of
                           The Football League in a number of respects.

                  There are numerous other passages in the article which
                  are false and/or materially inaccurate and which we also
                  regard^as^defamatory. However, the passages in question
                  are principally directed at individual Club Chairmen and
                  would not be actionable by The Football League.  I do not
                  propose to deal with these passages in detail but set out
                  briefly below some examples:-

                   (i)     The banner headline on pages 4 and 5 reads "Scum of
                           the Earth" and is surrounded by photographs of
                           twenty First Division Club Chairmen.  The context
                           in which these words are published and the general
                           layout of pages 4 and 5 convey a defamatory
                           imputation namely that the Chairmen in question are
                           "Scum of the Earth".  On a closer inspection,
                           however, these words are qualified by a second
                           (smaller) headline which reads "That is how these
                           guilty bosses of football treat you, the faithful
                           fans".  Doubtless, Today would seek to defend any
                           claim on the basis of fair comment.

                  (ii)     It is stated in the left-hand column on the first
                           page in lines 1 to 9 that:-

                                "The bosses of British soccer were finally
                                damned yesterday as the culprits behind the
                                game's violence, seediness ... and death.

                                They were condemned for subjecting fans to
                                gross indignities as if they were prisoners
                                of war".

                         Criticism^is, of course, levelled at some Club
                         Chairmen in, for example, paragraphs 53 to 55 of
                         Lord Justice Taylor's Report.  There are also
                         references to a lack of positive leadership.
                         However, the reference to subjecting supporters to
                         "gross indiginities as if they were prisoners of
                         war" is a quote from the Report which has been
                         taken entirely out of context.  This reference
                         actually appears in paragraph 40 of the Report
                         under the heading "Segregation" and is a reference
                         to police methods of crowd control.

            3.   Remedies

                 In the circumstances set out above, we believe that The
                 Football League and Mr Fox could commence proceedings
                 against Today for defamation particularly in relation to
                 the headline on the front page.  The Football League
                 could also seek publication of a retraction and/or
                 apology from Today.

                 As far as damages are concerned, you are doubtless aware
                 from publicity in recent defamation cases that the level
                 of damages awarded are within the discretion of the jury
                 with the result that in some cases damages can be very
                 substantial indeed while in others damages are nominal.
                 In this case, it may prima facie be possible to apply for
                 exemplary damages on the footing that the article was
                 p u b l i s h e d >recklessly and on the calculated basis that any
                 damages likely to be paid as a result of litigation would
                 be less than the profit which the publication would have
                 generated.           The fact that the words complained of
                 comprised the front page story would obviously support
                 such a claim.

                 You should however be aware of the dangers of litigation.
                 Today may decide to defend the proceedings to trial
                 (which would probably be about 18 months or 2 years away)
                 and would seek at trial to justify the article by
                 reference to Lord Justice Taylor's report.   Even if they
                 failed to do so, this could result in bad publicity for
                 The Football League and could have the affect of reducing
                 the amount of any damages awarded by a Jury.

            In conclusion, I believe that it is worth exploring the
            possibility of commencing proceedings further and would
            recommend that if you agree, we should obtain some preliminary
            advice from Counsel.

Dear Phillip,

                                TODAY

     Thank you for your letter of 9th February.

        am pleased to confirm          that we wish  you tc obtain
preliminary advice from Counsel       with a view to the possibiJitv
of commencing proceedings.

     One point, of which you may not be aware is that Mr. Fox did
not become President of The Football League until A u a u s t ‘ 1989
some tour months after Hillsborough.    He was, of course, on tbs
Management Committee at the time as a representative of the
Second Division.

     X l„o/c forward to hearing further from you in due course.

                         Yours sincerely,




                            Se cr e t a r y .

     I made       my way         to    the      walkway          area         between                       Stand and           thjr L e p p i n g s

     stop      them     but      due     to     th e     sheer       numbers             of    people        coming          from     the

     turnstiles          and      immediately              urinating                against           the    walls        it    became

     impracticable               to    continue           my     efforts            to    prevent           the    men       urinating             so

One     of the O f f i c er s          shouted,       "Come    on t h e r e ’s a pitch            invasion."



I ran wit h them              into g a ng wa y        ’A ’ and     down onto      the      pitch,        I could see

I could see           very      little at          ground     level    except a vast              number    of

u n i f o r me d Police         Officers,          but    I could     see   p a o p 3.e c 3.im b i n g p v e r the

An    Inspector         ran towards            us and told us to f o rrn a cordon                     roug h Iy

we    rema ined        in this         p o s ition for      several     minu t e s    but     I saw that          there

were     very few,          “A ngry Men"           coming     from the L a p p i n g s LN terraces,                most

of the       suppo r t e r s         on the    pitch      looked shoc k e d and           ill,,



One     young man fain t e d                near   to my    position at        the    corner        flag.        I broke

the     cordon and a s s i s ted other                   Liverpool     supp o r t e r s    in sitting        the man

against        a dv er t i s i n g     hoardings,         he was    very flushed           but declined

medical        attention.



One man        then ran up to the                  cordon and shouted,            "What are you             lot doing

I gave       up after       several        minu t e s      in each       case     because        the    people were

o b v i o u s l y dead and         other    officers           informed me that               they had alre a d y

people and a s si st ed             in the         removal      of several          bodies.



Some       time    later    I heard the             only m e s s a g e w h i c h      came over         the P.A.

S y s t e m t hia t a f t e rnoo n         the message            informed the              crowd that        the match

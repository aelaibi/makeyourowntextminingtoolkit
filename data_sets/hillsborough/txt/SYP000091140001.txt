                            rday    15th April          1989(150489),            I was       on duty         in connection with

              t h / FA Cup Semi Final                 at Hillsborough.              With other Officers my duties

                    e to      patrol P ond Street Bus >otat ion an Public Order                                    duties           Our
                              -----------------------
              instructions were               to     patrol    until approx 3 . 4 0 p m ( 154-0) when we were                             to

              take meal at West Bar,                     Our duties were            from 8 a m (0800)              until       released,



              At about 2 p m (1400)             that     day we were            instructed to take a T r ansit Van

              in which we then              patrolled around the City C e n t r ^                             At about 3 .10 -
                                                                         ii .            ■       jp ^ m -                                 —


              3 . 1 5 p m (1510)-(1515)             we were d i r ected to H i l l s b r o u g h Football                      ground.

              The       only ex p l a n a t i o n    I heard for this move was                     because         of       crowd

              trouble at           the ground.



              On arrival           at the ground a bout 5 or 6 minutes                           later we were                directed

                                                                                                                   S3540A

          to the area between the S pion Hop and the gvmnasiurn.                                  About,-SQ

          Of f icers were a s se mb le d there and we were                   then d i r e c t e d on to the

          pitch where we             i n structed to stand on the            p e r i m e t e y track    in front of

          the N orth S tand facing              the spectators          in t h e r ^ / T h e    noise    of the

          crowd was treme n d o u s and           in particular          the s pectators          in the stand

          were    hurling abuse at us urging                  us to "get down there and do

          somethin g"       indicating         the L e p pings Lane       end of the ground.                 At    no time

    4 ?   since my arrival             at the ground had          I been told what was              happening.               On

          entering       the    perimeter       track      I was aware      of   large numbers          of

          spectato rs       on the      pitch at the Leppings Lane                end and our deployment

          sug g e s t e d that      s pectators      had    invaded the      pitch and our          task was to

          prevent      oppos i ng      fans f rorn meet i n g .



          After a few minu t e s we were                redeployed by forming a line of officers

          across      the w i d th of the football             pitch near        t q / t he half way         line

          A gain my      i mpression was         that we were                         a ppos i ng fans            clashing

          an the      pitch.         It became    obvious after a while              that      there was          no

          movement       of fans from the S pion Kop end towards                      the L e p pings Lane              end.

          As   I observed the happenin gs                  at the L e p pings Lane         end,    I was aware

          of a large        number      of people a p p a r e n t l y    lying    in the sun on the                pitch

          at   that    end.         I began to    consider why the officers at that                      end were

          making      no efforts        to   clear    these    people     from the        pitch.       At the same

          time    I was aware          of    large numbers      of fans      from the L e p p i n g s Lane             end

          who were       running       down the      length of the        pitch to        return with sections

      r   of ad v e r t i s i n g   hoardings.



k         Several      of the        persons    I had noticed       lying on the ground were                      being

          placed on these mak e s h i f t            stretchers and taken from the ground via the

          exit    between the Spion Kop and the New Stand.                           On    passing      by me with

          these     hoardings         I noticed that several             of the     persons       on them

       Liverpool         fans    came     up to the      line of officers            shouting      that      people

       were      dying at the L e p pings Lane                end that      lots of persons           had been

       badly      crushed.        Due     to the numbers          of people      on the      pitch      it was      not

        possible        to see what had happened behind the Leppings Lane                                  goal.        On

       observing         the    people     being     s t r e t c h e r e d off the   pitch     I saw that

       several who a p p e ar ed to be dead showed symptoms                            of a s p h y x i a t i o n with

       m o tt l e d and d i f f u s e d    complexion.           It reminded me of           pictures        of the

       Heysel      Stad i u m disaster         in Belgium.           I realised then that whatever

  W
  vr had happened              :it did not appear            to be a sit u a t i o n    involving          both

W J    sets of fans.             My   immediate       reaction was to try and get other                          officer?

       to join me and make my way towards                         the Leppings Lane            end.        2 or three

       officers         left the      line with me and we went                f o r w a r d s / 1 ' went    to a

       group of fans and P ’cs and a s s i st ed                    in carry^j^y a h o a r d i n g

       containing a y outh of about                   19 yrs.        1 assisted        in carrying          this

       y o u t h off the        pitch a n d we were           d i r ected to t h e g y m n a s i u m.       On

  J    arrival         there    it was     imp--^ g 'h 1 °     ^ ~^t the hoarding            through        the

       door      so together w i t h a                            duli Liverpool        fans    the youth

       was    carried bodily            into   the                   this    time there were about 20

       bodies      lying on the floor              of the gyrn and several              injured spectator?

        lying     round the sides and far end                    (Leppings Lane         end)    of the gym.



       On    leaving      the y outh       I had helped to carry              I returned to the

       entrance         of the gym with the             intention of         returning       to the        pitch to

       a ssist     further as         required.        However       due to the volume            of dead and

        injured being           brought     to the area          I was    unable to       leave the gym and

       a s s i st ed    removing      bodies from hoardings at the e n t r a n c e and

        carrying them bodily               into                    By this time quite a number                     of

       doctors and nurses               had a t t e nd ed at the gym to assist with the dead and

        injured.         I was    then direc t e d by a un i f o r m e d C/ I n s p e c t o r         I believe          it

            certify death on the            bodies    so far   brought      in.    It became apparent as

            I went with the doctor that               this was alre a d y     being    done   by other

            doctors        present.     It was     then decided    that     the doctor would examine

            the    injured      persons    present and a s c e r t a i n the s eriousness         of the

            injuries and to evacuate               them in order      of   priority.      1 continued with

            this    duty until all         casualties      had been    removed from the gymnasium.                  I

            left    the gym n a s i u m after      being   released from duty there at about 6.

            (30 pm ( 1830 )Y.



            On asking        for further     orders    I was   directed to        rejoin my serial

            which    1 did and shortly af te r w a r d s       returned to West Bar.             After

            debriefs       there    I f i n ished duty at 7 . 4 5 p m ( 1945).

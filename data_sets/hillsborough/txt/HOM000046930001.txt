Statement by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith at th e end of a three-day

fact-finding visit to Liverpool to meet relatives of th e victims of the

1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster:




      'During the last three days I have held a meeting to which all

      families w ho suffered bereavement w ere invited. M any came

      and expressed their concerns to me. This was followed by

      private meetings w ith 19 families w ho requested them . All

      these meetings have been fruitful and constructive and will

      help me to w rite my report.




      'As I explained to all the families w hen I met them, I am sorry

      if a casual remark made on Monday caused any offence. This

      was not intended and I hope th at the last three days have

      gone some w ay to reassuring th e families of my intentions.
'In his inquiry report, Lord Taylor concluded th at the principal

cause of this loss of control was th e failure of the police

operation and not the behaviour of th e fans. I can see no

basis for reviewing or altering this finding.




'None of the evidence I have so far been asked to consider

relates to w hat happened outside the ground before 3pm. It

relates entirely to w h a t   happened    inside th e ground.   It

concerns the knowledge of the police as to th e state of pens 3

and 4 at the tim e gate C was opened and w h a t happened

after the disaster, and in particular w h a t happened after 3pm.




'Any suggestion, therefore, th a t I have made up my mind on

this issue against the Liverpool fans is quite untrue.




'I am continuing my scrutiny of th e evidence about the

disaster and I hope to report my findings to the Home

Secretary by the end of th e year.
'Anyone who considers th a t they are able to submit material

to me should contact my secretary in Room 1106, Home

Office, 50 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AT.'

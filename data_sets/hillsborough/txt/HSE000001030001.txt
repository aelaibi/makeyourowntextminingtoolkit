            YOUR REF




             Dear Sir,

             Hillsborough

            We refer to your recent telephone conversation with our Mr
            ~ and confirm that we are instructed to act on behalf of
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club both with regard to the
            Public Inquiry and the civil claims arising from the
            Hillsborough disaster.

          We note that a joint inspection meeting did take place at your
?~~ offices on 15th April 1989 when the various experts instructed
          by the parties--~--the litigation attended to inspect the
          broken barrier.

            We now enclose a copy of our letter addressed to the Treasury
            Solicitors informing them that the experts involved will need
            to carry out tests to the broken barrier although we
            understand that the Health and Safety Executive have yet to
            complete their own investigations.

            We also understand from the Club that another barrier has been
            removed which was located immediately adjacent to where the
            broken barrier was positioned. This has been noted by the
            Plaintiff’s solicitors and we understand from the Club that
            the barrier was removed by the Health and Safety Executive for
            the purposes of testing. It would assist in order to allay
            any fears on the part of the Plaintiff’s solicitors if you
            would kindly confirm the identity of that barrier, when it was
            removed, and why. We can then pass this information on to the
            Plaintiff’s solicitors.
  NoI       We imagine that you may well want to provide a reply through

                                                                                                                      Cont/d...

                 L89/2117

      Dear ilr

      Hi! Isborou~h
      Thank ~you for your letter of the 17th July, together ~zith the
      enclosures.     As you may be aware,      test cases have been
      selected by the Steering Committee for the purposes of
      resolving liability and directions were given for the test
      case of Chapman, which relates to a death in pen number 3 at a
      hearing on 26th July.
      That particular test case will involve issues relating to the
      broken barrier, and the removal of barrier !44. A prelLmina~y
      inspection of the broken barrier was carried out by the
      various experts instructed by the Plaintiff’s SolicitOrs, the
      Club, South Yorkshire Police, and the City Council, at the
      offices of the Health and Safety Executive on the 15th August.
      Although I have provided my experts with a copy of the HSE
      report made available at the Public Inquiry, I understand that
,->   there is a much lengthier report prepared by ~,~he .... but ti::~
      was not made available to the various interesUs represented at
      the Inquiry.
      The much lengthier report may well contain records of the
      relevant tests carried out and other such details which may be
      of use to the experts instructed by the various parties An the
      litigation, i would therefore ask you uo provide a copy of
      that report, together with any other documents which evidence
      the investigations carried out by the Health and Safety
      Executive.
      I am already in contact with Mr~ of the Health and Safety
      Executive in Sheffield and he informs me that tests have not
      been completed. It would assist if you would kindly confirm
      when it is likely the Health and Safety Executive will have

                                                          Contd../..
   2/                                             17th August 1989

   completed any further testing they require to car~y out so
   that I in turn can inform my expert and the other parties’
   Solicitors when it is likely further inspections and testing
   can be carried out by them.
:,-- Zf you would like to discuss the above, please do not hesitate
     to telephone.
   Yours sincerely

              Dear Sir,

                               and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Plc and
                              Sheffield City Council and Eastwood and Partners

                                       Your reference: SMR/3~3/235/01


                    Firstly, I would like to express my appreciation and thanks
             for your assistance and co-operation on 15th August when the various
             experts inspected the barrier.    After that inspection, our consultants
             visited the ground and noted that barrier 125, which was immediately
             adjacent to 124a, had been removed completely.
            ~hip~e~l~2Iioi~i~ Our consultants wish to carry out further
             invest~ig~atlo-ns_-- They have asked me to obtain some further
             information. It may be that you will wish us, in the normal way, to
             make an application to the Court, for discovery of documents from
             yourselves, relating to this matter.    In those circumstances, I
             should be grateful if you would let me have a list of the documents
             in your possession, relating to this matter so that I can make an
             application to the Court. It may be that you will have to consult
             with the Home Office and in the circumstances of this case I would
             hope that it would not be necessary to make a formal application to
            *hi Court.



                                                                                                                       cont’d ....         /

      The information has been requested by our consultants and
which you can assist us with is as follows:-
       i. Results of all physical, chemical and metallurgical tests
carried out by you on barrier 12&a, together with access to or loan of
all the test pieces for their own examination.   They understand that
test samples were removed from wrought iron tubes between supports
four and three, front and back legs for support three, sealed tube
between supports one and two, and other unspecified areas.

       2. A programme of further work on testing and analysis by
yourselves of the failure of barrier 12&a, plus results and back up
data.
      3. They will also require samples from barrier 12&a, for
independent testing by themselves.  They will need the following:-

       (a) 300ram long sample of wrought iron tube from between
supports four and three.

       (b) One 300ram long sample of tube material from between
supports one and two.

       (c) One 300ram long sample from front and back legs of
supports three and four.

       (d) Section of corroded tube material including fracture near
supports three and two.

       (e) A sample of tubes circumfrential weld and 25mm of parent
material on either side near support two.

       (f) Two samples of deformed angle materials from supports
three and four.

                                                      cont’ d ...../

                                             _




            (g) Sample of gusset plates from support three together with
     bolts and tube retaining straps.

             (h) They will also want to take further measurements of the
     corroded sections of tube and leg and other measurements, including,
     as necessary, non-destructive testing.    In relation to these matters,
      I should be grateful if you could indicate ~when~yOu expect to be abiei
    ;~ito release the barrier for independent inspectioN.    I understand that
     this is a matter that has to be decided by the enquiry.

            The engineers have also asked me to find out more about the
     history of barrier 124a.     My understanding is that there are no
     original design calculations for the barrier, that there are no dates
     and details of repair work and alterations to the barrier or design
     calculations for alterations.    Also, I understand that the barrier pre
     dates 1931 and there is no information about the designer and the
     date of construction of it, apart from that.

            There is mention in your report of a need to test a similar
     barrier to destruction but I understand that that may not now take
9
     place and I should be grateful if you could confirm the situation.

                I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

                                     - DRAFT -
        i INTRODUCTION

        Following an incident on 15 April 1989, staff of the Health and Safety
        Executive visited Hillsborough Football Ground on 17 April 1989 at the
        request of Mr Paul Jackson, Sheffield Environmental Health Department.
        The crush barriers in Pens 3 and 4 (central pen), at the Leppings Lane
        end of the ground, were examined and identified with a paint marker in
        accordance with a drawing supplied by Mr Jackson. On each barrier the
        support locations were numbered sequentially from left to right when
        viewed from the pitch.

        Barrier 124A appeared to have collapsed and a length of the horizontal
        tube had become detached. This detached length of tube had been found on
        the pitch in front of gate 3 in the perimeter fence at the Leppings Lane
        end on 16 April 1989 by Dr C Nicholson, Deputy Director, Sheffield
        Laboratory, Health and Safety Executive. It was kept in a secure place
        by Club Officials and was placed in Pen 3 oN 17 April 1989 so that it
        could be examined in conjunction with the rest of the barrier.

        On 24 April 1989 the damaged parts of barrier 124A, consisting of two
        lengths of tube and two supports, were removed from Pen 3, under the
        supervision of the authors of this report, and taken tothe Sheffield
        Laboratory of the Health and Safety Executive for metallurgical
        assessment. The remainder of barrier 124A was removed by Mr P F Heyes
        and HSE staff on 7 July 1989.

        This report contains details of examinations performed both on site and
        in the laboratory. The work was carried out by the authors and by other
        staff of HSE working on their instruction and under their general
        supervision.

        2 ON SITE EXAMINATION

        2.1 BARRIER 124A

        Barrier 124A was located on the seventh, eighth and ninth steps of Pen 3
        adjacent to Pen 2. The overall length of this barrier before collapse
        was estimated to be 7.5m including a tube overhang of 0.6m near the
        radial fence adjacent to Pen 2. The horizontal distance from this
        barrier to the perimeter fence at the front of Pen 3 was approximately
        3.5m, and the distance of the tube end from the radial fence, separating
        Pens 2 and 3, was 28mm. There were no other barriers between barrier
        124A and the perimeter fence. A sketch of this barrier, showing our
        opinion of its appearance before the incident, is shown in Figure i.

        The evidence suggested that, prior to the collapse, barrier 124A had
        consisted of four vertical supports with a horizontal tube between them.
        HSE staff numbered the supports 1,2,3 and 4, beginning at the end nearer
        Pen 2.




                                           -i-
/




                                  -DRAFT-
    Each vertical support had consisted of two lengths of 52mmwide metal
    angle, having a thickness of 6mm, inclined at an angle of 20 degrees to
    one another. During manufacture each front support leg had been curved
    near the top to form a horizontal surface and had been joined to the
    rear support leg by a triangular gusset plate. The latter had been
    rivetted to the two lengths of metal angle. The horizontal tube had been
    made from hollow circular section metal with an outside diameter of
    60mm. An inverted U-shaped strap, approximately 50mmwide, had been
    bolted to the top of each support, and this was presumably intended to
    retain the horizontal tube.

    Figure 2 shows barrier 124A viewed from the pitch as it appeared on the
    morning of 17 April 1989. The detached length of tube had a transverse
    fracture at either end. One of these fractures matched the fracture on
    the length of tube in contact with support 2 and the other matched the
    fracture on the length of tube in contact with support 3. Hence it was
    possible to locate this detached length of tube in the correct
    position between supports 2 and 3. This detached length of tube had
    been bent symmetrically about its mid-point where the maximum deflection
    was 133mm.

    Support 4, shown in the foreground of Figure i, had been moved forward
    and twisted towards the front left-hand corner of Pen 3, viewed from the
    pitch. The lower portion of the front leg had remained straight,
    although by comparison with the front legs of other barriers, it
    appeared to have moved forward through an angle of 25 degrees
    approximately. In so doing the front leg had broken away from the edge
    of the concrete step in which it had been supported. Several pieces of
    detached concrete were observed nearby, two of which matched the
    fracture on the step, shown in Figure 3. The upper portion of the front
    leg had suffered localised bending and it had been twisted inwards with
    respect to the other supports on this barrier.

    The rear leg of support 4 had been deformed and kinked at the lower end
    near the junction with a piece of reinforcing steel angle which had been
    bolted on top of the original angle section. The latter had been thinned
    by corrosion in the area where this deformation had occurred. The rear
    leg also exhibited localised deformation and cracking in the vicinity of
    the lowest gusset plate attachment hole. The gusset plate appeared to be
    relatively undeformed but had been moved inwards towards the other
    supports. The tube retaining strap appeared to be intact and still in
    position.

    Support 3 had been deformed extensively and flattened so that it was
    almost horizontal. The general direction of deformation was towards the
    front left-hand corner of the pen, viewed from the pitch. At its lower
    end the front leg had been deformed adjacent to a piece of reinforcing
    angle, but both the latter and the surrounding concrete were
    undisturbed. The rear leg had been bent forward and the majority of the
    deformation had occurred at the junction with the concrete step. The
    step itself was intact. The gusset plate was undeformed but it had been
    torn from the upper part of the rear leg and moved forward. The strap
    retaining the tube at support 3 had been straightened partially but the
    tube appeared to be captive at this position. A transverse fracture of
    the tube, in the vicinity of some tube wall corrosion, was visible under
    the strap.


                                    -2-
                             -DRAFT-
The length of tube in contact with support 3 had been bent by 200mm at
midspan and it had a ragged fracture in a corroded region near the end
further from support 3, i.e. the free end. The latter had presumably
been located under the strap on support 4 before collapse occurred. The
fracture in the tube corresponding with support 4 was partly transverse
and partly longitudinal, the original manufactured end being deformed
but not fractured. At some stage the tube had also been partially
crushed at this location.

During the visit on 17 April, a small piece of metal, roughly
semi-circular in section, was found in Pen 3 by Dr C Nicholson amongst
the debris near gate 3 in the perimeter fence. The fracture on this
small piece matched that at the end of the tube corresponding to support
4. This end of the tube had apparently moved a distance of 1.4m in the
horizontal plane before coming to rest on the steps. In total, the
collapsed part of barrier 124A occupied an area measuring 4m along the
terrace and 1.6m down the terrace in Pen 3.

Supports i and 2 were free from damage and the length of tube between
them had not been deformed significantly. This length of tube contained
two circumferential welds positioned as follows when viewed from the
pitch side: one approximately 0.2m left from the strap on support 2; the
other 0.05m right from the strap on support i. The tube had fractured
transversely under the strap on support 2 and a smaller diameter tube
insert was observed protruding a distance of 25mm from this fracture.
There was evidence of considerable corrosion of the original tube under
this strap. The tube insert appeared to be approximately 150mm in total
length. The strap on support 2 had been welded to the tube on the left
side only. This was the only location on barrier 124A where a strap had
been welded to the tube.

Support i had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to each foot and the
rear leg had been braced by an additional piece of angle acting as an
outrigger. Support 2 had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to the
front foot only with an outrigger on the rear leg.

2.2 OTHER BARRIERS IN PENS 3 AND 4

The remaining barriers in Pen 3 and those in Pen 4 were examined. The
layout of all the barriers in Pens 3 and 4 is shown schematically in
Figure 4. On each barrier the supports were numbered sequentially from
left to right as viewed from the pitch. Several barriers had been
fabricated with rectangular hollow section supports and these appeared
to be somewhat newer than the rest. Most of the old-style barriers had
been modified in some way, for example by reinforcing of the support
legs and welding of the horizontal tubes. Corrosion was evident at all
joints and intersections, and rust "jacking" had occurred at many of the
gusset plate/support leg junctions.

Most of the horizontal tubes on the older barriers were open-ended and
in two cases (barrier 125 near support i and barrier 128 near support i)
holes in the tube wall, caused by corrosion under the support strap
were clearly visible. An example of this is shown arrowed in Figure~"K"
which depicts the end of barrier 125 adjacent to barrier 124A in Pen 3.
The hole is approximately 25mm in diameter and its centre is 60mm from
the end of the tube.

2.3 EXCAVATION OF BARRIER 124A SUPPORTS 3 AND 4 ON 24 APRIL 1989

It was agreed by the Inquiry that supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A could
removed for laboratory examination. Three cylindrical cores, measuring
0.1m in diameter and 0.4m in length, were cut from the concrete steps at
positions specified by Mr C Pertee, a Principal Specialist Inspector in
the Technology Division of HSE, before excavation of the supports
commenced. These cores, from steps 7, 8 and 9, were identified by the
letters P,Q and U respectively. After cutting, core P was found to
contain a piece of the front foot from support 4 and core U was found to
contain a piece of the rear foot of support 3.

It became apparent during excavation that each support leg had been
flattened and shaped to form a foot which had been positioned
horizontally in the ground and bolted to a base plate. The supports were
freed by unscrewing, or grinding off the nuts in contact with the feet
of the supports. In all cases the boundary between the support and the
concrete was marked using yellow paint.

When the front foot,of support 4 was exposed, considerable thinning and
loss of metal was observed in the vicinity of the bend between the
upright and the foot. This area was further weakened during core
drilling and the remaining ligament of metal, approximately 5mm wide and
0.8mm in thickness, became detached during removal of the support. Part
of the front foot was found to be in contact with a reinforcing wire in
the concrete and a length of this wire was removed for possible future
examination.

The pieces of reinforcing angle, noted previously on the rear leg of
support 4 and the front leg of support 3, were observed to extend below
the surface of the concrete to the bend at the start of the foot.

The length of tube remaining in contact with support 3 slipped out of
the strap during lifting of the support. It was apparent that this
length of tube had not been fixed intentionally to the strap and it had
been held temporarily in position by accumulated rust and debris only.

2.4 REMOVAL OF INTACT PART OF BARRIER 124A ON 7 JULY 1989

The feet of supports i and 2 were excavated to a depth of 50mm
approximately and subsequently cut using an angle grinder. This
permitted both supports, and the length of tube between them, to be
removed in one piece.

3.2 CONCRETE CORES

The three cores are shown schematically in Figure 6. They were taken at
different positions along the terrace but, for convenience, they are
shown here in the same plane. Core P was extracted in three pieces: a
cylindrical upper piece, approximately 85mm in length, which was
composed of an upper layer (27mm in thickness) containing relatively
fine aggregate, typically a few millimetres in section and a lower layer
(52mm in thickness) containing coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in
section; an irregular shaped intermediate piece, with a maximum length
of 120mm, which contained the coarsest aggregate, typically 20-30mm in
section, and bore an impression of a section of barrier support foot; a
cylindrical lower layer, 180mm in length also containing the coarsest
aggregate (20-30mm in section)

Core Q was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
approximately 138mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer (23mm
in thickness) containing relatively fine aggregate, typically a few
millimetres in section, a middle layer (65mm in thickness) containing
coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in section, and lower a layer, 50mm
in thickness, of loosely bound coarse material; a lower piece, 245mm in
length containing the coarsest aggregate, typically 20-30mm in section.

Core U was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
approximately 141mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer
(26mm in thickness) containing relatively fine aggregate, typically a
few millimetres in section and a lower layer (llSmm in thickness)
containing coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in section; a lower
piece, 200mm in length, containing the coarsest aggregate, typically
20-30mm in section. The lower layer contained a slice through a barrier
support foot consisting of, in descending order, a nut, a piece of foot,
a piece of bolt and a piece of base-plate.

3.3 LENGTHS OF TUBE FROM BARRIER 124A

3.3.1 Visual examination

The two detached lengths of tube (CEN/2 and PFH/I) are shown in Figures
7 and 8 respectively. The length of tube which had been between supports
3 and 4 was designated "tube 3/4" by the authors and the length of tube
which had between supports 2 and 3 was designated "tube 2/3". Each
length measured 2.3m and had an external diameter of 60mm. The length of
tube between supports i and 2 was designated "tube 1/2" and its overall
length was approximately 3m. The outside diameter of this tube was 60mm.

Bottom dead centre of tube 2/3 and 3/4 was located by examination of
paint runs and an accumulation of dried paint. It was deduced that both
lengths of tube had been deformed towards the pitch in a horizontal
plane.

Visual examination of the fractures indicated that in general the
failure of the tube had occurred in a fibrous, ductile manner. On the
two matching fractures which had been coincident with support 3 there
was however a region of bright crystalline fracture, shown arrowed in
Figure 9, consistent with a more brittle failure mode. This crystalline
fracture had occurred where the remaining wall thickness of the tube was
at a maximum.

In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode.
Fracture of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on
the uphill side of the barrier at a position at right angles to top
dead centre. The other tube fractures had suffered some post-failure
damage and the origins were not readily identifiable.

At all the fracture positions much of the wall thickness of the tube had
been reduced, mainly by external corrosion. The corrosion had occurred
under the locating straps in areas, approximately 65mm wide, which were
unpainted. The end of the tube at the position of support 4 had been
open to the environment and additional corrosion at the internal surface
of the tube had occurred. This had resulted in the formation of two
holes through the wall approximately i0 and 20 mm in diameter under the
strap. One of these holes, shown arrowed in Figure i0, appeared to have
initiated the fracture and led to the detachment of the small piece of
tube (arrowed in Figure ii) found on the steps, item CEN/I. These holes
were location at the 4 o’clock and 8 o’clock positions and their centres
would have been approximately 50mm from the open end of the tube at
support 4 before failure.


                                -6-
                             -DRAFT-
The extent of corrosion of tube 1/2 under the strap at support 2 was
disclosed when the strap was removed (Figure 12). Tube 1/2 was removed
subsequently from supports i and 2 to permit closer examination. This
revealed that two pieces of tube had been joined beneath support 2 by a
part circumferential weld which also served to join the strap to the
tube at this support. A 150mm long tubular insert (arrowed in Figure
12), with an outside diameter of 49mm and a wall thickness of 5mm, was
located inside the main tube at a position corresponding with support 2.
This reinforcement was retained by means of a tack weld on the inside of
the main tube between support 2 and the adjacent circumferential weld in
the main tube, which had been noted on site. Hence, neglecting the
insert, the tube between supports i and 2 apparently consisted of three
pieces joined by: a circumferential near support i; a circumferential
weld near support 2; a part circumferential weld beneath support 2.

An oval hole, shown in Figure 13 and measuring 35 x 15mm, was revealed
in the tube under the strap on support i, at the 4 o’clock position when
viewed from the end nearer support i. This hole had apparently been
formed by external corrosion of the tube under the strap.

A rolled-up newspaper was found inside tube 2/3. This was part of a copy
of the "Yorkshire Telegraph & Star", dated Saturday 24 October 1931. A
piece of another newpaper, "The Star" dated Saturday 26 September 1959,
was found in tube 1/2. Various other items of debris were found
elsewhere in the lengths of tube.

3.3.2 Tube wall thickness measurements

The wall thickness of the tube at the fracture positions was measured at
various locations around the circumference. The thickness range recorded
at each fracture is shown below:

Support 2      0.4 to 4.4 mm

Support 3      1.6 to 4.5 mm

Support 4      i.i to 4.5 mm (ignoring the edges of the holes)

Measurements taken along the lengths of tube using an ultrasonic
instrument showed that the wall thickness remote from the fractures was
in the range 3.2 to 4.9 mm. Corrosion was confined to regions about
70-75mm wide, centred on the support straps, and there were no areas of
pronounced thinning elsewhere. The ultrasonic thickness reading was
5.0mm throughout the length of tube between the circumferential welds on
tube 1/2.

3.3.3 Microstructural examination

A transverse ring section was cut from tube 3/4 at a distance of 65mm
from the fracture corresponding to support 3. Microexamination showed
that the tube had been manufactured from wrought iron and that it
contained a longitudinal, forged lap weld.

A microsection of a sample of paint removed from a similar position
showed that the paint consisted of 13 coats plus an initial metal loaded
primer coat. The total thickness of these coats was approximately 0.5 mm.


                                -7-
                             - DRAFT -
Various microsections from tube 1/2 indicated that this length of tube
consisted of both wrought iron and low carbon steel as follows: the
length between the end nearer Pen 2 and the circumferential weld near
support i was wrought iron; the length between the circumferential welds
was low carbon steel; the length between the circumferential weld near
support 2 and the part circumferential weld beneath the strap on support
2 was low carbon steel; the length between the part circumferential
beneath the strap on support 2 and the fracture was wrought iron.

3.3.4 Tensile tests

Two longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T343/I and T343/2,
were machined from tube 3/4 near the end corresponding to support 3. Two
further longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T1221 and T1222,
were machined from the central portion (low carbon steel) of tube 1/2.
In order to minimize the effects of previous work hardening, all test
pieces were taken as near as possible to what would have been the
neutral axis during bending.

These test pieces were tested in accordance with BS 18:1987 "Method for
tensile testing of metals (including aerospace materials)", and the
following results were obtained:

3.3.5 Hardness testing

Hardness tests were carried out on the ring microsection from tube 3/4
and on the microsections from tube 1/2 in accordance with BS 427:Part
1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers hardness test: Testing of metals". The
following results were obtained:

Tube 3/4, wrought iron                    142 145 HV i0

Tube 1/2, low carbon steel                146 152 HV i0

3.4 SUPPORTS FROM BARRIER 124A

3.4.1 Visual examination

Supports i and 2 had not been deformed. Supports 3 and 4 are shown after
excavation in Figures 14 and 15 respectively. Although the extent of the
deformation of supports 3 and 4 was noted on site (see section 2.1 of
this report), a number of additional features became apparent in the
laboratory.

The legs of supports 3 and 4 had been corroded, particularly at the
junctions with the concrete step and/or additional reinforcing angles.
At these locations the residual thickness was in the range 3.1mm to
5.9mm, compared with a nominal thickness of 6.3mm elsewhere. A
considerable amount of metal had been lost by corrosion from the
sub-surface region of the supports. For example, on the rear leg of
support 4, a ligament of metal 8mm wide and 2mm in thickness was all
that remained of the original nominal 50 x 50mm angle section at a
distance of 150mm below the surface.

The front leg of support 3 and the rear leg of support 4 had been
reinforced with additional sections of steel angle. Both these
reinforcements spanned areas of corrosion on the sub-surface region of
the supports. In general on the collapsed supports, the most severe
sub-surface corrosion was located at a distance which varied from 50mm
to 170mmbelow the surface depending on which step the barrier had been
located.

3.4.2 Dimensions

In general, the width of the steel angle from which the support legs had
been made was in the range 49 - 52mm and the thickness remote from
corroded regions was in the range 6.0 - 7.4 mm. In some above surface
regions of supports 3 and 4 the thickness of the angle had been reduced
by corrosion and buckling had occurred during collapse. This can been
seen in Figures 14 and 15 in which the thickness of the angle at the
positions indicated was:

           Support 3       (a)           4.6   to 5.9 mm
                           (b)           5.9   mm
           Support 4       (c)           1.5   mm
                           (d)           5.6   to 5.8 mm

The thickness of the steel angle in the sub-surface regions of supports
3 and 4 varied from zero, where through-thickness corrosion had
occurred, to 6.4mm.

3.4.3 Microexamination

Microsections were cut and prepared for examination from each of the
legs on supports 3 and 4 only. The following microstructures were
observed:

    Support 3 Front leg - 100% ferrite
               Rear leg - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                           region; ferrite at edges.

                              -DRAFT-
    Support 4 Both legs - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                           region; ferrite at edges.

These microstructures were typical of low carbon or rimming steel.

3.4.4 Tensile tests

One tensile test piece was machined from each leg of support 3. The test
pieces were identified FL3 and RL3 and were tested in accordance with BS

Both test pieces exhibited yield phenomenon and hence the upper yield
stress (ReH) was determined.

3.4.5 Hardness tests

Vickers hardness tests were carried out on the microsections taken from
the support legs. These tests were conducted in accordance with BS 427:
Part 1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers Hardness Test - Testing of
metals" and the following results were obtained:


    Support 3   Front leg      105 - 109 HV
                Rear leg       113 - 125 HV

    Support 4   Front leg      112 140 HV
                Rear leg       121 141 HV

These results are typical of low carbon steel.

4 ASSESSMENT

Barrier 124A had consisted originally of a horizontal tube and four
vertical supports. The barrier had failed apparently by partial collapse
and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the horizontal tube
at supports 2, 3 and 4. The length of tube which had been located
between supports 2 and 3 (tube 2/3) had been bent uniformly to give a
maximum permanent deflection of 133mm at midspan. The portion of the
tube which been located between supports 3 and 4 (tube 3/4) had been
bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 200mm at
midspan. Tubes 2/3 and 3/4 had been deformed in a horizontal plane
towards the pitch. Tube 1/2 and supports i and 2 had not been deformed.

Laboratory examination showed that most of the tube had been made from
wrought iron and each support had been made from two lengths of steel
angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset plate. Part of the
original wrought iron tube between supports i and 2 had been replaced at
some time by a 2m length of low carbon steel. In addition, the tube had
                             -DRAFT-
been strengthened at support 2 by insertion of a internal tubular
reinforcement. Thus tube 1/2 was probably stronger than the rest of the
tube and this may, in part, explain the lack of deformation in this
region. In addition, supports i and 2 had been strengthened by
reinforcement with angle section at three of the four feet and by
bracing of the rear legs with outriggers.

The tube fractures had occurred in areas which had been located under
the metal straps designed, presumably, to retain the tube. The tube wall
thickness, nominally 4.Smm, had been reduced significantly by external
corrosion under each strap. In some cases holes had been present in the
tube at these locations before collapse occurred. Corrosion here
appeared to be a highly localised phenomenon which was confined to a
distance of 30mm to 35mm either side of the centreline of the strap.

In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of ductile
failure of wrought iron in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. The
region of brittle fracture, noted in the tube near support 3, was the
last part of the tube to fracture at this location. The change in
fracture mode can be explained in terms of increased constraint as the
fracture entered thicker material and an increase in strain rate as the
fracture propagated round the tube. Both these factors would tend to
promote brittle fracture.

Corrosion at the tube/support junctions was predictable because liquid
would have been retained in crevices under the strap and the surface of
the tube under the strap had not been painted. At the open end of the
tube, near support 4, internal corrosion had also contributed to
deterioration of the tube since there was access for rainwater. Here the
tube wall had been perforated by corrosion under the strap at two
locations producing holes which we estimate would have been
approximately 10mm and 20mm in diameter before the collapse. The centres
of these holes would have been located approximately 50mm from the open
end of the tube at support 4. They would have resembled the hole in the
tube on barrier 125 (Figure 3) and, in our opinion, they would have been
readily visible to the naked eye.

The direction of collapse of supports 3 and 4 appeared to be towards the
front left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch. For the most
part the supports had been buckled and bent at locations which had been
weakened by corrosion. Although there was considerable sub-surface
corrosion of these supports, this played no part in the collapse. The
concrete which broke away at the front foot of support 4 did so because
this support had been positioned along the riser of a step in the
terrace.

In all cases the most severe sub-surface corrosion on the feet of
supports 3 and 4 had been located near the lower end of the region of
concrete containing the coarser aggregate. One possible explanation for
this could be that the height of the terrace had been raised at some
stage and the sub-surface corrosion may have occurred at or near the
original junction between the support feet and the terrace. This would
have reduced the effective height of the barriers.

The use of wrought iron tube, and the method of tube fabrication,
suggests that barrier 124A was many years old. British Standards
governing the use of wrought iron tube were in use in the 1920s and
1930s but are now obsolescent. The discovery of dated sections of
newspaper in the tube indicates that parts of barrier 124A were at least
58 years old, although clearly this barrier had received several
modifications during its lifetime.

5 CONCLUSIONS

5.1 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had been made from
wrought iron.

5.2 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had fractured at
supports 2, 3 and 4 in regions where considerable localised corrosion
had occurred.

5.3 The legs of supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A had been made from low
carbon steel angle section which had been corroded in some areas.

5.4 Two other barriers in Pens 3 and 4 contained tubes which had been
perforated by corrosion at support locations.

In our opinion,

5.5 The general direction of collapse of barrier 124A was towards the
lower left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch.

5.6 Two holes, caused by corrosion, had been present in the tube of
barrier 124A at the junction with support 4 before the collapse
occurred and these would have been visible to the naked eye.

2.3 EXCAVATION OF BARRIER 124A SUPPORTS 3 AND 4 ON 24 APRIL 1989

It was agreed by the Inquiry that supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A could
removed for laboratory examination. Three cylindrical cores, measuring
0.1m in diameter and 0.4m in length, were cut from the concrete steps at
positions specified by Mr C Pertee, a Principal Specialist Inspector in
the Technology Division of HSE, before excavation of the supports
commenced. These cores, from steps 7, 8 and 9, were identified by the
letters P,Q and U respectively. After cutting, core P was found to
contain a piece of the front foot from support 4 and core U was found to
contain a piece of the rear foot of support 3.

It became apparent during excavation that each support leg had been
flattened and shaped to form a foot which had been positioned
horizontally in the ground and bolted to a base plate. The supports were
freed by unscrewing, or grinding off the nuts in contact with the feet
of the supports. In all cases the boundary between the support and the
concrete was marked using yellow paint.

When the front foot of support 4 was exposed, considerable thinning and
loss of metal was observed in the vicinity of the bend between the
upright and the foot. This area was further weakened during core
drilling and the remaining ligament of metal, approximately 5mm wide and
0.8mm in thickness, became detached during removal of the support. Part
of the front footwas found to be in contact with a reinforcing wire in
the concrete and a length of this wire was removed for possible future
examination.

The pieces of reinforcing angle, noted previously on the rear leg of
support 4 and the front leg of support 3, were observed to extend below
the surface of the concrete to the bend at the start of the foot.

The length of tube remaining in contact with support 3 slipped out of
the strap during lifting of the support. It was apparent that this
length of tube had not been fixed intentionally to the strap and it had
been held temporarily in position by accumulated rust and debris only.

2.4 REMOVAL OF INTACT PART OF BARRIER 124A ON 7 JULY 1989

The feet of supports i and 2 were excavated to a depth of 50mm
approximately and subsequently cut using an angle grinder. This
permitted both supports, and the length of tube between them, to be
removed in one piece.                                                      !

        3.2 CONCRETE CORES

        The three cores are shown schematically in Figure 6. They were taken at
        different positions along the terrace but, for convenience, they are
        shown here in the same plane. Core P was extracted in three pieces: a
        cylindrical upper piece, approximately 85mm in length, which was
        composed of an upper layer (27mm in thickness) containing relatively
        fine aggregate, typically a few millimetres in section and a lower layer
        (52mm in thickness) containing coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in
        section; an irregular shaped intermediate piece, with a maximum length
        of 120mm, which contained the coarsest aggregate, typically 20-30mm in
        section, and bore an impression of a section of barrier support foot; a
        cylindrical lower layer, 180mm in length also containing the coarsest
        aggregate (20-30mm in section)

        Core Q was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
        approximately 138mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer (23mm
        in thickness) containing relatively fine aggregate, typically a few

                   barrier 124A and probably another barrier as well. (I have fed these
                   requests back to West Midlands Police as previously agreed. )

              .
                   Tne DPP P~s now agreed that the barrier could be released for further

4 TALK BY IVOR ROWLANDS

Much of what he said is contained within the brochures but my notes contain
some additional information.

The purpose of the system is to give a warning when the force on any of the
monitored barriers reaches a predetermined level. The cause can then be
investigated and any appropriate action taken. In an emergency such a system
would provide quantitative information so that the available resources can
be directed to those areas which are most in need. The main advantage is the
the system ’buys time’ so that appropriate action can be taken well before an
emergency can take place.

The system consists of force detecting sensors, fixed to the barriers, and
linked via a processor to a computer. The display screen in the control room
shows the positions of the sensors (eg barrier positions) and if the force at


                                         -I-
any barrier exceeds a preset level the screen colour changes at the particular
location. The present system display is normally green but has three levels
of warning; amber, red and flashing red. Additionally the force/time history
for a particular barrier may be inspected at any time and all the information
from all the sensors is permanently stored should further analysis be
required.

NNC are responsible for design, construction and commission of nuclear power
stations and have the technology for taking measurements of pressure, strain
etc inside the hostile environments of reactors. The same technology is at the
heart of CMS since the principles are the same.

The system has been tested on a barrier at Old Trafford on 14 March 90. The
site chosen was a ’lightly loaded’ area so that the ability to detect ’small’
forces could be assessed. It is interesting to note that the highest forces
were recorded prior to the start of the match. The system worked well and we-
were shown a force/time trace, notable events being recognised both by the
force level measured and the noise of the crowd.

A figure of 0.25 million pounds was mentioned by IR as a probable cost for a
complete football stadium but it would be less if only ’strategic’ areas were
monitored. In existing stadia the cabling costs, necessitating cutting
channels through the terraces, would be high but on new stadia the costs would
be much less. The computer graphics is relatively simple and the information
storage is cheap in relationship to the cost of the sensors and cabling.

The system has wider application than for football stadia and pop concerts eg
Underground railway stations and shopping malls. Portable ’smart’ barriers
could be used at events such as ’New Year celebrations in Trafalgar Square’
but a ’radio link version’ would probably need developing for this type of
application.

The safety and alarm levels (0.73, 1.46 and 1.82 kN/metre - 50,100 and 125
Ibf/foot of barrier) that have been chosen are based on the data that was used
for the ’Green Guide’, but NNC make no specific recommendations on safety
levels. It is a simple step to change the levels at which the display colour
changes and once the system has been in operation for a few weeks the data
accumulated on actual force levels could be used to make better judgements in
the future.

The system is ’self-checking’ and though IR did not elaborate on this I would
presume that a ’zero’ reading, obtainable with no people in the stadium, is
compared with other ’zero’ readings. I do not see how actual calibration
forces can be applied other than by a purpose built rig. The system appeared
to have sufficient sensitivity and a single person, pushing on the
demonstration barrier and braced against a wall, could activate the first
’amber’ level. NNC had considered the deliberate application of force by fans
but decided that at the ’red’ level the force would be too uncomfortable to
sustain. They had also considered ’short’ duration ’spikes’ and I think that
these are filtered out.

The possibility of vandalism to the sensors had been considered and IR was
confident that with NNC’s experience of hostile environments this didnot
present a problem. We were shown the ’demonstration barrier’ which consisted
of three posts and a top rail, all in rectangular hollow section steel, welded
together. The sensors, one at the base of each post, were shrouded in
protective steel plates and though I don’t think these shrouds were welded to


                                    -2-
the posts it should be possible to do.so though this may reduce the
sensitivity of the sensors because of the increase in stiffness.

Another problem that had been considered was the effect of the length of a
continuous barrier. A force applied over any portion of top rail is mainly
resisted by the posts adjacent to the portion but some of the force is
resisted by posts which are further away. NNC had carried out some analysis
and were confident that they could detect the force and their screen dispay
gave warnings not for the whole length of barrier but for each individual
portion of barrier.

The actual sensing elements are strain gauges but understandably NNC would not
discuss the actual configuration as this was a commercial secret. A patent has
been applied for and obviously they don’t want another company to steal their
idea.

IR mentioned that if a system incorporating pressure pads adjacent to the
turnstiles and sensors on barriers had been installed at Hillsborough, prior to
the disaster, then alarms would have been given in good time. My own view is
that the problem of congestion outside the turnstiles was well known and a
solution existed but had not been implemented because of financial
constraints. In other words I believe that finance should be first used to
remedy existing deficiences rather than to warn of problems arising from the
deficiences. The Hillsborough barrier layout was not in accordance with the
recommendations of the Green Guide and because of the post ’A’ frame
construction and corrosion of the barriers it would have probably been
necessary to install new barriers suitable for the sensors. The main cause of
the Hillsborough Disaster was overcrowding of the central pens and far cheaper
solutions than monitoring barrier forces could have prevented the
overcrowding, such as a secondary row of turnstiles.

Clubs have expressed an interest but as far as I know none are committed. Some
clubs are prepared to install the system once another club has done so.

The highest forces are likely to occur when the density is high but the
absence of a ’high’ force does not necessarily mean that the density is low.
The CMS therefore does not monitor crowd density and it is conceivable that a
well ordered over ’dense’ crowd could show little indication on the CMS until
a sudden exciting or contentious ’event’ took place. NNC readily acknowledged
my observation and they take care in their literature not to claim that CMS
measures crowd density but measures the force acting on the barrier.

5 COMMENTS
The CMS system is well thought out and technically sound. I think that
monitoring all barriers at this stage would not be justified but it may be
worth monitoring a few barriers in a strategic area at a selected stadium,
provided that the barriers conformed to the recommendations of the Green
Guide. The data obtained would then be used to decide on whether it was
worthwhile to extend the system to other areas of terrace and other stadia.

It is possible that a club may still want to retain terraced areas beyond the
deadline suggested by the Taylor Report. The data from monitored barriers
could help in assessing the risk.

I shc~ed them the parts of barrier 124A and described HSE’s examination as
!9~ported in IR/I#~E/MM/S9/Z.
Several consultants asked if they would be allowed to wi~m~s any
tests, eg barrier tests, which HSE may carry out. I suggeste~ tha= any Such
requests should be put in writing to Dr Nicholson together with any other
queries.

HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION
   F
Dr [              (SUMAC) visited SEL on 30 March 1990
in order to examine the failed barrier on behalf of
Eastwood & Partners. Mr Jones (ACC West Midlands) had
previously given written permission for this
inspection.

I showed the failed barrier and the microsections to Dr
Entwistle. He asked whether tests had been carried out
on the barrier to determine the collapse load. I
replied that some bend tests had been performed on
another barrier to establish the modulus but I was not
at liberty to disclose the results. Drl          Iknew
of the existence of HSE’s final report but had not been
able to obtain a copy.

He added that, in the near future, he was due to attend
a meeting of interested parties which would discuss,
amongst other things, the need to test a barrier
at the Hillsborough ground.

Dear Mr. Jones,
                       Hillsborouqh Inquiry, Crush Barrier 124A
     I have read the draft repot~ ~- ~h~ ~v=~,gtion of barrier
124A prepared by[          land~                 |of the Health and
Safety Executive, Research and Laboratory Services Division,
Sheffield. On the 29th November 1989 I visited the I~~t~L~
insDected the barrier and discussed the findings with           and

     I understand that plans are in hand for the laboratory to carry
out a bend test on a length of tube similar to one in 124A.
However, this will not require the presence of 124A at the
laboratory.
     The draft report is detailed and comprehensive, and I do not
think that it is necessary for the laboratory to carry out any
further metallurgical work on 124A.
     I can therefore see no objection should you decide to recommend
that 124A now be released from the custody of the Health and Safety
Executive laboratory.
                                        Yours sincerely,
                                                        %

arrangement and expects the following to attend:

    4)                                  Local Authority.
They may also be interested in obtaining "a photograph" from
the HSE report. Please arrange on the day of the visit.

          Hillsborough
         We are pleased to be able to tell you that all parties have now
         agreed that the bundle of reports collected under reference
         IR/L/MM/89/II and IR/L/ME/89/34 will now be admitted in evidence at
         the civil trial without the need for the makers to attend.
         Unless, therefore, some point arises out of the reading of the
         reports upon which the Judge requires some personal comment (which
         we think is highly unlikely) there should be no requirement for any
         of your staff or independent consultants to attend.
         I am most grateful to you for your assistance in the matter.

         Yours faithfully,

As indicated in a letter from Hammond Suddards, Solicitors dated
26 July, it may be necessary for you to attend court. I duly
informed them of dates during the 6-week period beginning 2 October
when you would not be available and that you could not attend court
without the issue of subpoenas.
I have today received a telephone call from Mr        Is secretary,
Hammond Suddards, informing me that as time is getting on and they
have not yet heard from the other side, subpoenas are being issued
even though they may not be used. These should arrive shortly.

   Dear Sirs
   HILLSBOROUGH
   Thank you for your letter of 26 July 1990. I apologise for the
   delay in replying but this was due to my absence on annual leave.
   You asked for dates when our Messrs
   will not be available in the 6 weeks following the trial
   commencement on 2 October. These are listed below:
                                   Not available
        Mr                         ii and 12 October 1990
        Mr                         2 and 3 October 1990
        Mr                         18 to 23 October 1990

   These dates are correct at the time of writing but I should point
   out that owing to the nature of our work other court appearances
   are pending, particularly for Mr Heyes, so I would appreciate a
   response as soon as possible.
   Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,
Hillsborough
Further to our let~=r ~F ~+h .T,,1,, ,,,~ have
                                          i    now identified the
reports of Messrs.                        I(IR/L/MM/89/II) and G.A.C.
Games (IR/L/ME/89/J~) as Dezng reports whichl - - -we would wish to place
before the civil court.
Can you please confirm that if, for any reason, the reports are not
agreed by the Football Club and Messrs. Eastwoods, the authors will
make themselves available, subject to payment of appropriate:fees,
as witnesses at the hearing without the need for Subpoenas to be
issued.
As we have previously indicated, the trial is to take place in
Manchester commencing on 2nd October with a six week time estimate.
It should, however, be possible to plan for the attendance of
professional witnesses on specific days to avoid undue
inconvenience.
                                                                                                                  p

Dear ~4~.{’~’~ O.
Hillsborough
Thank you for your letter of 13th June with            ¯ Report
IR/L/ME/MM/89/2 effectively consists of a number of different
reports on different aspects of the disaster.
It is highly likely that we shall wish at least some of the evidence~~
in these reports to be put before the Judge dealing with the civil
trial, which you may know is due to commence on 2nd October at the ~>~
High Court in Manchester with a hearing time of six weeks¯
At this stage, we do not know preciselywhich reports we shall wish
to rely on, nor do we know the extent to which the Football Club
and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners will be prepared to agree the
evidence contained in the reports¯
We are writing at this stage merely to indicate that if and in so
far as the evidence in the reports is to be relied on, but cannot
be agreed with the other parties, we shall wish to call makers of
the reports as witnesses at the hearing¯
We appreciate that some of the reports are commissioned from
outside academics rather than having been prepared by HSE staff,
but you may think it appropriate to advise the authors of each of
the reports that they may be required to appear as witnesses at the
civil trial. Of course, any such appearance would be limited to


                                                                                                                   /... contd.

 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - INQUESTS

 I thought I would take this opportunity to write to you and advise you that the
 Coroner has decided to re-convene the Inquests in Sheffield on Monday,
 19 November 1990.
 The purpose of these Inquests will be to consider the generality of what
 occurred at Hillsborough but not to go into details of the individual deaths as
 this evidence was taken in April/May of this year.
 I have had a number of long discussions with Dr Popper, the Coroner, and we
 both agree that it is likely that we will have to call yourself and]or members of
 your staff to give evidence to his Inquests. Consequently I will be in touch in
 the not too distant future to arrange a meeting with your goodself and the
 Coroner to discuss the evidence that you can give and what would be
 appropriate to be given. Dr Popper has had sight of your report and believes
 that there are many very relevant and interesting issues which will have to be
 aired.

 I look forward to~ seeing you in due course.

 With best wishes,




                                                   Chester

             Telephone call 28 June 1990
             Superintendent Inspector R Taylo~
             Midlands Police rang - he and Dr         of the
             Forensic Service had witnessed tests on barrier
             124A material by SGS. The tests had apparently
             produced very similar results to RISD’s figures.
             All tests will be completed by 4 July 1990 and
             Mr Taylor asked if we could again retain the
             pieces of the barrier which would be returned
             from Hal~. I said that we would and he
             undertook to arrange transport back to RISD.
             If storage space can be made available at Buxton
             then direct transport to Buxton would be
             preferable.

RECORD

HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

On 21 June 1990 1 received a phonecall from Ch Supt
Foster, West Midlands Police, concerning HSE’s final
report. He said that testing of barrier 124A was due to
begin at SGS today and, as yet, none of the consultants
had received a copy of our report.

I replied that, following discussion with Mr~
 (Davis, Arnold, Cooper representing Sheffield Wednesday
FC) a copy of the final report had been sent by
Datapost to each of the solicitors involved in the
civil action. He asked if was possible to FAX a copy of
the report to SGS. I said this was not practicable
because the report was consisted of approximately 180
pages. He accepted this and said he would inform SGS
accordingly.

Hillsborough Barrier Tensile Testing

Your minute of 6 July 90 asked for my comments on the SGS test piece results
which you received from West Midlands Police.

The discrepancy between results from SGS test pieces and RLSD test pieces
will not affect the validity of the collapse load calculations contained in
the report byI                  IReport IR/L/ME/89/36) since no test piece
results were used in the calculation.

The flow stress determined from RLSD full scale bending tests on tube from
Barrier 129 was 295 MPa. This value was used in the calculation of the
collapse load of Barrier 124A and reported in IR/L/ME/89/36. The reasons for
using full scale bending tests rather thanresults from test pieces
were as follows:

(i)    tests conducted on small specimens of a material that is known to have a
       heterogeneous structure may not provide results that are representative
       of a large sample;

(ii)   the tubes that had formed spans 2/3 and 3/4 were found to be permanently
       bent when they were recovered after the incident; it is known that the
       yield stress of wrought iron is likely to be affected by its previous
       loading history, and that wrought iron is sensitive to post-yield
       strain-hardening;

(iii) bending moments introduce compressive stresses as well as tensile
      stresses into the tube; we did not have data about the compressive
      properties of wrought iron that could be applied with reasonable
      confidence in calculations of the collapse load of barrier 124A.

If no full scale bending tests had taken place, then the results from the RLSD
test pieces would have been used to calculate the collapse load. We would have
used the approximation that the flow stress equals the mean of the 0.2% proof
stress and the tensile strength. A value for the flow stress of 312 MPa would
have been used in the collapse load calculation, giving collapse loads 6%
greater than those calculated from the full scale bending tests.

In my opinion the values of 295 MPa and 312 MPa, obtained by different
methods, are in close agreement and they suggest that the mechanical
properties of Barrier 124A (3/4) were not significantly different from those
of Barrier 129 and hence the flow stress obtained from Barrier 129 is
applicable for the collapse load calculation on Barrier 124A.

Even if tensile test pieces were made from Barrier 129 it is doubtful if this
would add significantly to the information that we already have in view of the
uncertainties given above.

A calculated flow stress of 345 MPa can be obtained from the SGS test pieces
results for tube 3/4. This is 11% greater than the RLSD value but could be due
to the different locations from which the test pieces were obtained.

RECORD

I received an inquiry from Inspector Curwen, South
Yorkshire Police Training Department, who is involved
in training police officers and stewards in crowd
control duties (recommendations 5 and 6 of Taylor
Report refer). He wanted to know whether HSE could
offer advice on how to recognise various crowd
densities so that overcrowding could be prevented.
SY police are making a video on the subject.

I said that HSE’s estimates of crowd density were
made by counting heads on photographs and relating the
counts to the terrace area. I suggested that
photographs depicting known crowd densities could be
an aid to estimating the actual densities at matches.




16/8/89
Suggested response to Mr I

I refer to your letter of 16 August 1989 in which you requested
information on crowd packing tests carried out at this Laboratory in the
course of the Public Inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster.

The tests were performed at short notice and involved packing volunteers
into a small room of known area in order to simulate specific crowd
densities. The aim of the exercise was to demonstrate to members of the
Inquiry what it felt like to part of a crowd of a particular density
rather than to obtain an accurate visual record different densities.
Although photographs were taken at the time, the small number of people
involved (a maximum of 29) and the use of a wide-angle lens resulted in
pictures which are unsuitable as examples of crowd packing densities
because of nearness to the subjects and distortion. In any case Lord
Justice Taylor specifically requested that these photographs remain
confidential to the Inquiry.

I suggest that you consider carrying out your own large scale crowd
packing tests, preferably in a representative area of terrace, in order
to produce photographs which can be used as visual comparators by
stewards and police officers.

As I am sure you remember, I promised to let you know when our programme
about the Hillsborough Inquiry was to be transmitted. I am happy to confirm
that it will be networked on BBC 2 at 8.15pm on Wednesday llth April.

I wish to thank you for the cooperation that you and your colleagues offered to
us. The sequences filmed at the H.S.E. are working well in the final edit. I
am confident they will figure very strongly in the finished programme.

With very best wishes

Yours sincerely

         To summarise, therefore, we do not see any significant involvement of
         the Health and Safety Executive in the future, other than perhaps giving
         evidence of their findings to any proceedings which may follow in the
Q~¢~ ~ Criminal Courts and which will certainly occur in the Coroner’s Court.

        Can I take this opportunity of thanking you for all the excellent work
        which has been carried out by Dr Nicholson and his colleagues. I was
        particularly appreciative of how they were able to explain in very
        simple and clear terms, highly technical subjects. It is the feeling of
        myself and all my officers on the investigation that it has been a
        pleasure to work with your organisation. Thank you.

        Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Jones

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER -            CRIMINAL INQUIRY

Thank you for your letter of II December and the information about
the future involvement of Dr Nicholson.   I see no difficulty in
agreeing to your consulting with Dr Nicholson and enlisting his
support in the ways you describe.
May I thank you for your kind words on the work carried out by
Dr Nicholson and his colleagues.    We were grateful for the
opportunity to provide technical support to the Inquiry and it is
pleasing to know that the response we were able to provide was
well received.    I shall ensure that your sentiments are brought
to the attention of all the staff involved and, in particular,
Dr Nicholson.
Yours sincerely

              After        briefing            and    packed          meal    at          Hillsborough               myself          and    other

               supporters,             who      we    were       detailed             to    escort           down        to    the       Leppings        Lane

              area        of    the    football            ground.           The          train        I understand                 was    to    arrive          at

              approximately                 H.QO      pm.        We    were       in       position            at    the       station          at

              a p p r o x i itia t e Iy     11.30      am.        On    the       wa 1k         up     f rom    the       f o o t b a 11    g round         to

              the     railway          stat ion        I not iced            that          a 11      the     pub 1 i c h o u s e s         had       their'

              front        windows          boarded         up    and    appeared                 to    be     closed.

               I was       standing            with    other          officers             at     the      entrance            to    the    railway

              station           near      to    the    road,          1 saw       a       constant           stream           of    fans    walking

              down        the    hill       towards         the       ground,             I also        saw     as       many       fans    walking           up

              hill     away          from      the    ground.           As    the          time        passed        the       number       of       fans

              walking           in    both      directions             increased,.                I also        realised             that       the     fans

              walking           downhill         were       carrying          cans          of       beer      not       just       one    or    two     but

1/2 doz or more.                   I then       realised        that    the fans walking              up hill were

p r o bab ly     looking          for an outlet           to    purchase alcohol.                After a w h i l e •

myself: and PC 2 9 29 Benn e t t                  and PC        1429 B a s h f o r t h were       d e t a i l e d by

to a     public        house       called       'The R a i l w a y ’ the       front      door was       closed and

the wind o w s         b o ar de d up.          I then saw a fan walking                   down to the ground

he was         carrying        12 cans         of Bud Weiser           beer, -in his        right      hand he was

carrying 3            c a n s , he was         holding     them wit h the           plastic       straps     with

w h i c h the      cans were         held together,              in his      left hand he had 4 c a n s ,

3 held by the               plastic       strap and the            fourth      one was      open and he was

dr i nking       from       it.     1 remember         this well          because        I like    drinking       Bud

mates.

As the         fans w al k e d      down       the hill        towards Hi 11sborough,              I noticed one

or two         turn    left       down the side           of    "The R a i l w a y ’ .     We f o l l o w e d and

went     into the           back y ard of the             public       house and saw that              the   back

door was         open a n d        that    the    place was         full     of Liverpool          fans

drinking.             A ma n who         I a s su me d to be the           landlord was           outside      in the

backyard.          I overherad            him say to other              officers         " I ’m not    letting

a ny m o r e    in because          they're       getting        rough."        We took         up our    position

back     on the m a i n           road.

The fans were              in a good mood a n d            caused        no    problems       none    I could see

made     their way           to enter.          I saw a large            number       of other       fans    sat on ,

the     bridge       parapet, an d on the             road and         pavement a c r o s s        from     the

turnstiles,             these     fans were mak i n g         no atte m p t         to gain entrance              to the

ground.

As    time     passed a Liv e r p o o l          fan spoke        to     Insp.      Ellis w hom       1 was

standi ng         next     to,    the     fan i n dicated that            he had just          p u rchased a

ticket       from a y o u n gs te r and he w a n t e d             to know           if    it was a forgery,

The     ticket       was     bright ye l l o w       in colour,          a check          revealed    that    indeed

It was a forgery.                      The man said that          the y o u ngster           was   selling        them

on anot h e r          road and         that he was      s u r r o u n d e d by other         fans    buying       them.

The     fans were a rr i v i n g           in greater        numbers          and Leppi n g s Lane was

becomi ng         cho                                                                                  j^s^a

w o u l d be      i mp o s s i b l e    to do so.       1 heard an            instru c t i o n from       Insp.

Ellis     to move          on all        the fans who        did not have             tickets,       this we

starte d       to do.          I saw again          that a    large       number          of fans were       still

sat     on the       bridge        parapet and across             the     road making          no attempt          to

gain entry.              The     crowd t hi ck e n e d and a constant                     number   of fans were

asking       for     d i r ec ti on s     to the N o r t h and West             stands and for            standing

only.        I could only just                see the signs at                the    respective       turnstiles

w hi c h were at           eye     level    but d if fi c u l t    to see over a mass                 of moving and

bobbing        heads.          A lot      of fans were, .milling about                     unsure about which

turnstile          to head        for,     because      of the d i f f i c u l t y         in seeing      the signs. 1

 pm ( 1 3 0 0 ) .    I can't    remember     the exact        times,    we   parked the      car    in a

 side street which was about                ten m i nu te s walk, away from the football

 ground.       When we       parked the     car,   myself

 split up from                                                                 us / L^Thirnk they



 Myself,              and                            ho we     call

 and got something            to eat,    we had a w a lk a round for a time and                 I can

 remember      seeing       quite a few policemen standi ngNiround                  in small

   roups.    1 saw the        police directing         traffic mainly.

 'We ar riv ed at       the Leppings Lane          entrance        to the ground as     best as       I

 can remember at about 2 .0Q              pm (1400).

 During     the time we were walking about                   in the vicinity of /the football

 ground     I saw quite a few supporters                   drinking    cans of h f t k r J but, I never

 saw anyone who          I thought was       drunk.         I never    saw any s c j a y f ighting

 or disorder.

 Whe n we ar riv ed outside           the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground we

 stood on the bridge wh ich              is by the entrance.              I could see that          there

 were a large amount            of   people m i ll in g about         in the area between the

 blue outer         perimeter    gates and the         roadway       it was very busy with

people       in that area.

In the area b e tw ee n the actual                entrance           to the turnstiles and the

outer    gates      it was    less busy with         people.                  I could see that                 peopie

were queuing at the tu r n stiles                 it was quite orderly.

We stood on the bridge              for about       fifteen minutes                            during   this   time     I

saw that      there were a number            of    policemen on / o ot by the turnstile

ent ranees who were searching                the s u p p o r t e r 4 /before they entered the

ground,      I also     saw about      two m o u n t e d    pj a l i j f p r s i e r i   w ho were si tuated          in

amon gs t    the    large    crowd wh ich had gayhe/jea in the area outside                                       the

outer    perimeter       gates    towards     the    rqra/Iwa^;— "1                      can't say what        the

mo un te d   policemen were a ct u a l l y doing.                   I cannot                   remember    seeing any

stewards outside the turnstile area.

We didn't      have any di ffi cu lt y         identifying which turnst il es we had to

 nter through,         all    three of us kept             together and we entered the ground

through a turnstile at about 2.15                    pm     (1415)               I ha ruled my ticket             into

the turnstile         operator.        I was se ar che d by a L i smceprfan before                               I went

through the turnstile,             once    through the turnstile                                I saw a few

policemen standing ar ou nd and a group of stewards                                             standing    by the

sta ir wa y w hi ch     leads    up to the West S ta nd seating area.

Wh e n we got       into the area between the back                            of the turnstiles and the

Jfe/c Stand        I saw the entrance         to the tunnel                      I never          saw any signs to

   rect supporters           to the terraces         but we were                         intending      to go down the

tunnel where         I had gone      for the       1988 semi              final.

On entering         the ground I had not seen anyone                                trying        to gain u nlawfully

entry to the ground,             I had not seen any gates open other                                      than the

turnstile      gates.

All   three of us went           down the/tunnel           w hi ch            runs under            the    centre of

the West Stand.             I did not sie any          policemen or stewards                              standing by

the entrance         to the t u n n e l M ar an yw h e r e        inside                 it.     We had free      passage

along    the tunnel         when we got to the end of the tunnel we went

to the      left hand side of the dividing                         fence    into what       I now know to be

pen number         f o u r , so we    could stand to see the match from behind the

goa l. B e t w ee n entering         the ground and getting onto the terraces                           I had

not seen any kind of disorder                   I did not see anyone                     drinking alcohol

inside the ground.

O n entering        onto    the terraces        into         pen number          four at a time       I would

say was about 2.17             pm    (1417)   we were able to walk                   inbetween the       people

standing      on the terraces           to a position I wo ul d say was                      roughly    in the

middle of the          pen,   this was the           position myself,                      and

intended to stand to w a t ch the match.                            I have marked this            position on

the separate grid             plan with a figure               (1)       one.     I produce      this grid

plan      (Ex No            ) (Ex Ref               1/1) .

When we were standing                in position number                  one we    were standing about 3

or 4 feet       in front      of a crush barrier.

We stood      in position one           (1)   for a time             I     wou ld estimate       to be about

twenty minutes,            during    this time,          between           about 2 .17 pm (1417)       and 2.

37   pm    (1437)    I was still with                        and                and during    this time the

terraces arou nd us had grad ua ll y filled up t o a point where at about

2.30      pm ( 1 4 3 0 ) the terraces were             packed a nd you were being                  squashed

like you would experience when the kop                              is packed at Anfield.

At this time about 2 .30               pm (1430)         I had noticed that                people were       being

pulled up from the back of the terracing                                 into the West Stand.           I also

saw people         climbing     over    the diviffing fence from our                       pen into    pen

number      three wh ich was          on my right            hand side as          I looked towards          the

pitch.

Having      been    in position one           (1)    for about            twenty m in ute s the       pressure

ar ou nd me had        increased to such an extent                        that    it was becoming

uncomfortable,          and    I found that the mov eme nt                      of the    crowd on the

terracing and the gradual                increase            in pressure          from behind was

beginning       to push me forwards             down the terracing against my will.

I had also       noticed that as the            pressure   increased where            people had

been jumping up and down o                                         |ing and    in hap py mo od the

atm os ph er e   now had become

I was gra dually          pushed for                               acing and as this

o cc urred   I lost sight of b                                        I found myself        being

pushed up against a           crush                                laged to duck down under.

Wh e n I got up on the other              side of this     crush barrier         I found    I

couldn't move anymo re          I was      stuck with my back up against                the barrier.

I got stuck       in this     position which          I have mar ke d with a figure             two       (2)

on the separate grid           plan at a time          I wo uld say was about 2.4 5             pm

(•1445).

In position 2 I was           crushed to such an extent              that     I was having

d if fi cu lt y breathing,      my arms were          pinned down against my side,               the

only    part of my body        I could move was my head.

At about 2 .45       pm    (1445)   when    I first     in position two         (2),    I n oticed

people ar o un d me were        screaming       out    in pain,     especi al ly      those who       I

think must       have been squashed up against               the    crush barriers,        there was

a   lot of panic among st           the   crowd and     people were shouting at the

police to open up the gates                to let     people out of the         pen.

Just after       I had got under          the   crush barrier and got to position two

(2)    I turned my head to look over my                 left hand shoulder and            I saw a

man screaming        out    in pain he was        crushed,    up against        the    crush barrier

I had just got under,           in a short       space of time his screaming               got       less

and    less until     he was    just mu mb lin g and his face had gone very white,

it was then that           I ma nag ed to turn sl ightly to my              left and with some

other    people who were aro un d me we m a n a g e d to push this man b ackwards

off the barrier an d he slid do wnwards an d                  came up on our           side of the

barrier,     he came up squashed up a g ain st me and a man standing                        on my

left hand side,           this mans head slumped onto the shoulder                     of the man

standing     on my    left hand side,           I could    look down into the mans face,

he was mumbling.              I couldn't make            out what       he was trying to say,          there

was a lot of saliva                coming     out of his m ou th and his face was very

white,       wit hi n a minute        or two this man stopped mumbling and was just

quiet,         he was    breathing      heavily as more           people got under          the barrier

behind us we were             pushed forwards aw a y from the barrier a n d as we were

m ove d forwards           this man who          had his head slumped between me and the

man standing            to my left slowly sunk down behind us dis appearing                           from

view.        When    I last saw this man he was alive al th o u g h he was very pale

and his breathing was very heavy,                        I think       I last saw this man at about

2.47    pm      (1447)     about    two minute s after           I had got under       the barrier

necked thick woo le n jumper                                           he had a thick       gold    chain

aro un d his neck and              I am sure he was w earing a lot of gold                    rings on

his hand.

Whil st        in position two         (2)    I also     saw a lad       in the    crowd behind me,           he

was    positioned about             five     feet to my        right    hand side and about          three

feet    behind my position,                and      I saw that    blood was       flowing    from his

nose,     having        looked at this           lad I turned aro un d       I    cannot    say what

hap pened to this            lad but       I would describe            him as a white       lad aged

about     17 or      18 years,       he k p p e t    red to bgK tal 1 about 6ft        1 ins,       he was

               people who were                in trouble and some              that     I think had probably passed

               out,     but    people all arou nd me were                     in trouble       so many but no others

               that     I could describe               in any detail.

               on the      pitch b e h i n d the goal.

               that     the girls face was blue,                      she had short         brown curly hair,             I c a n ’t

               I have seen a photograph                    in the Su nd a y                    n ewspjfer       dated April

               I can say that Vicki                   HI CKS       is the girl      I Wve      /escj^ffred a b ove being

               carri ed up pen number                  fo ur by the three              policemen and           laid down on the

               te r r r a c e s .

               I got out of the                pen by climbing              through a section of the                  perimeter

               I think        I got out onto the                   pitch some time         between 3.2Q          pm    (1520)   and

               3.25     pm (1525),            I had a look about and very quickly found

I did not assist          any of the dead or          injured,    the    pitch was fairly

                                   long time    for             but we    couldn't       find him.

                                    myself and                     left thjr >ground of our

own acco rd we met                   father outside       the grount/in/Lgjppi ngs Lane

and then we went          back to the       car where                          ^ / h e r s r friend was

wai t i n g .

We wai te d     in the    car for a time       for             when he didn't appear we

had a drive ar ou n d to         look for him.         At about 4.30       pm    (163Q)     w e were

stuck    in a traffic jam on a main             road quite       close to the ground whe n                   I

saw             running up the       road about       to go past the       car,     I called to

him and he came and got             in the    car,    he was    in a bad state          he was

crying and shaking,            he said he had been        chased by a big gang.

Just after                had got    into the    car there were a group of about

three Liverpool          su pporters      standing    on the other side          of the     road they

were    pointing at our         car and shouting,        "there's       that    lad,"     they     ran

across     to the      car,   one was banging        on the    roof and the wi nd o w they

were    pointing at                and shouting things          like,    "Haven't you got any

respect     for the dead."          and    "Thats him.                              drivers       side

w i nd ow was    open and one of these Liverpool                fans threw a punch through

the    car wi nd o w    striking                      in the    right hand side of his

face,    when this happened                    drove out onto       the wrong        side of the

road and drove off down a side                street    to escape.

I c a n ’t remember what         these Liverpool        supporters       looked     like,    I

c o u l d n ’t describe a n y of them,        I knew they were          scousers     by their

accents.

I was not       injured myself as a result of my experiences at Hillsborough.

I did not see an yt h i ng         on that day apart          from that    bloke     hitting

         which    I would have said was a criminal                offence.

The only obser vat io ns         I would     like to add to this statement                is that        I

think the Police          should have opened up the gates                in the front

                they should have      ripped downy the fencing.

                I think that the      police should have          checked peoples tickets a good

                distance away from the /ground and turned a w a y the           people wi thout

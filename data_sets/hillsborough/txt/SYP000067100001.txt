 parked,      one of these              shops was a          ' h o m e m a d e ’ pie shop.

After      parking         the van we decided to have                       s o m ething    to eat,         there was

a chip shop            close      by but       there was a large queue,                    so we      carried       on

walk i n g a p p r o x i m a t e l y a m ile away and                 came to another            chip shop,          we

had something              to eat and went              from there          to a nearby         public        house,

w hich    I thought was                called       ’The Beehive'           fcmt I'm not        certain,        we were

 still    all       together at             this    time.           Vw" 7

We went       into the           p u b , there were a few football                      fans,   m a i n l y Liverpoo!

...fans, it was           not    full,       just    comfortable,           we     then at this        time      split

up into three's                 to get      the     drinks    in,    and     the     other twcj/people            I was

with,     w hich were                                          nd                                    and    I know we

all     had three          pints       of    lager    each,    and     i n b e t w e e n times we          played

games     of snooker.

We were       in the        pub for          just    over an hour,           and     came out at

a p p r o x i m a t e l y twenty five              to t h r e e , whe re/we all          joined up t o g e t h e r

again,      and walked            down to the           ground.

Whilst      walking         down to the             ground we       never        saw any    police         o ff i c e r s and

 did not      receive any d i r e ct i o n from them,                       we     tr a v e l l e d down w i t h a lot

of other        fans,       but    did not          see any fans        drinking          on route         to the

ground.         I would          say that          everyone was        in good         spirits and          no hint       of

any     trouble.

We all        got    to the     entrance        of the/ground,            Leppings          Lane     stand at

appr oxirnate ly quarter               to    three/the          others went            in other          directions,

and my s e l f and                                         ^ere the only ones who                   had tickets

for     the    terraces.

When we arri v e d at             the e n t rance          the m ain gates           were     closed,       there

were     hundreds        of    people       in a crowd outside,                 no o r d e r 1y q u e u e s .         We

just     joined        the    end of this,           the    crowd Spain right               into    the    road,

going     back       some     distance.         I could see          that       the other          side of the

m ain    gates was           fairly empty,           people     seemed      to be       in orderly queues

and there was a large                  space        between    the mai n gates and the                     people

near     the    turnstiles.            On the        outside     of the gates,               there were          two

mounted        p o l icemen b l ocking          the entrance,           it was         so   crowded outside

the gates at            this    time     that the          people were          pushing against             the

horses,        myself and                     jere being       pushed a long            the       crowd,    so    I

decided        to    pul 1               3 the side,          to get      out      of the mai n           crowd a n d

try and make           our way to the front,                  we a t t e m p t e d     to follow the             train

railings along               to the    front,        whilst    nearly at           the front we            could       hear

people shouting at               the     two m o u n t e d    pol i c e m e n    to get       the gates          open

because        people were         getting          crushed,     more and more               people were

a r r i v i n g and    joining        the   crowd from the            rear,        causing         constant

pressure        on the        people at       the front,         so the         scr e a m i n g    con t i n u e d for

the     gates       to be open,        my s e l f   and             were        ne a r l y at      the    front,

directly        in front        of the horse,              and we felt          constant          pressure       on us

from the        back,        a n d tried to         push back.        I had no          control          over my own

m o v e m e n t s at    this    time.        I was      involved       in this         crush for a p p r o x i m a t e l y

ten minutes,           and saw a y oung              girl w e a r i n g a       red jacket          approximately

10 years o f age              be i ng he 1d up by the            fence      by a m a n who           I presumed

was     her    father.         People were           still    scr e a m i n g    for    the gate          to be open,

as young        children as well              as everyone          else were           being       crushed.

S h o r t l y a fter     because       of the        constant      pressure          of the        crowd,        the       gates

parted slightly,             myself and                       who were at          the    front m a n a g e d to

get     through,      the m o u n t e d    policemen          could not       hold their          positions any

longer,      and the opening              to the gates           became      larger,       and the       crowd

just     ran t h r o u g h , I think        the m o u n t e d     p o l i c e m e n just m a n a g e d    to move

to the side.

1 would      estimate a lot of              people went           t h r o u g h and      1 was    not aware

that     the gates were            shut after.

I ran towards          the    direction          of the       t u r n s i l e s , an d joined the         back       of

a n o t h e r mass    of people a t t e m p t i n g        to go thro u g h         the    turnstile,          I was

placed at the          right       of the       turnstiles,          and had to duck             under a low

railing      in order        to join the          crowd,       but    found myself          once       under    the

railing,       trapped a g a i n s t       it,    unable       to move                    was    next    to me       but

slightly       further       down     in the      same     position,         we    remained       in this

p o s i t i o n unable     to move        either way.

I stayed here for a p p r o x i m a t e l y a minute                   or so,      there was a p o l i c e m a n

standing       nearby the          oppos ite      side     of the      railing,          he said       ’Duck

back    under,       there's a gate open around                      the   s i d e ’ I ducked under             the

rai 1 i n g , managing        to    pull                wit h me,      whilst       ducking       under       I found

a watch,      a gents w a t c h          on the       f l o o r , I picked        it up and       put    it    in my

pocket.       Whe n we got          under       the    railing,       we    ran towards          the    gate we

had     been told about,            it was a          large    c o n c e r t i n a g a t e , w hich was        fully

open w hen we got            to    it,    I did not        see    it being open,            the gate was

situated      on the       canal     side,       right     of the      railings,          that we were          stood

We    ran through the             gate    into a large           courtyard         type area,          once

t h r o u g h we   stopped        running and started walking,                     a number        of other

people also          entered       thro u g h    this gate,          our    tickets were          not    checked

at any     point and         I am still          in poss e s s i o n       of my full       ticket,       of

O nce    inside      the   cou r t y a r d area,        we made       our way       to the e n t rance          of the

d irections.             We only made             our way to the tunnel,                    because          I thought

this was       the only way                in,    I was    not a w a r e       that we       could have entered

a round the         sides.

At    the entrance             to the        t u n n e l , there were          no    police       or s t e w a r d s

d i r ecting       the    fans,       we entered          the t u n n e 1 t o g ether with a large                      number

of other       Pans,       once       inside       there was          no way        out,    it was       so full,         we

stood stationary,                   and just m o v e d with the                crowd,       unable       to control

our     own movement.                The     tunnel      was    so full,         that      I was     shuffling

down     it towards            the    terraces,          w ith a constant             pressure          of    people

behind,       on    reaching          the     end of the tunnel,                 I was      pushed       into    the      pen,

s i t u a t e d on the         right       hand      s i d e , it was         though       there was a surge               of

people and          I was       thr o w n     into the back            in the        pen,    coming          to an abrupt

halt m e e t i n g       the    other        people      in the       pen,     so at       this    time we were

right at       the back             in the Pen          (Pen 3 ) .       The n      there was a nother            surge

from the       rear and we were                   thrown       F o r w a r d , further       into the          pen,     mo v i n g

towards       the    front,          the     people      in front m o v e d and we                had no       chance      but

to follow suit,                as    there were          hundreds        of    people       behind us          pushing

forward.           It was at          this       time    I lost       contact        with                    who was

f urther      in front          of me,        to my,      right,       I lost sight           of him

completely.              I was       not aware          of what       time     this was,          and    I was    not

aware     that      the match had started,                      I could not           even see          the    pitch.

The n    it seemed         I was          c o n s t a n t l y being    shunted        forward,          until    I had

gone     so far      forward that                I was    now v i r t u a l l y      in the       centre       of the       pen

g ett i n g   closer       to the          front     perimeter         fence all           the time.

Everything          a r o u n d me        seemed     blurred and          I was       e x t r e m e l y frightened.

I was     then      conf r o n t e d and          found myself           face       to face wit h a fe l l o w

I reali sed that             there was          o b v i o u s l y som e t h i n g    supporting          the    back

of this man,             and a s k e d    him    if there was a c rash / b u r r i e r behind                        him,

he y e l l e d that         there was,          and    vir t u a l l y    in the       same      breath he shouted,

"It's gone,           its gone",          and    I found myself             being         pro p e L i e d forward,

still      clutching         hold of this m a n who also                    lost all          balance,         but

did not fall             over,    he     continued to stumble                  bac k w a r d s    towards       the

front,      still        wit h me      holding        onto me.           After      regaining my balance

1 found myself              right at the .front of the                     perlm^er           fence,      still

w it h    this man        in front        of me,       unaware as          to how far            I had

tra v e l l e d    forward,       but     I could not           touch the           front     perimeter

fence,      I was a p p r o x i m a t e l y      five       feet away,         facing       the    pitch,       wit h

people      in front         of me.        The me n         r e m ained    in front         of me,       but    I

was      no longer        holding        onto    him,       my arms were            out    stretched       in

both directions,                and    I was     unable       to    pull    them       into my body.

I found myself              s t a n d i n g w ith my head           pushed       back      looking       up to sky,

gasping      for air,           the man        in front       of me       the same         one wit h the            g reen

coat,     who was         taller       than me,        kept     putti?ig his arms                on top of my head

in order          to support          himself,        I kept       s c reaming       at him to move             his

arms,     w hich     he did on two o c casions                     and    then      repla c e d    them a ga i n on

my head,          an d at    this      stage     because        he w o u l d     not      listen to what             I was

saying,      a n d because            if I had        not    have    done      something,          I'd have          been

suffocated          I bit       into     his    right arm,          very hard          until      he   removed his

arms,      during        this    the man seemed              to s lump down a bit,                 allowing          me       to

see the      fence        in front and the              pitch.

Through       the    fencing,          I could see a pol i c e m a n ges                               ,he fans       to

move     back,      and the       fans were           shouting       back words                        effect.            “

I remember             saying     to the       people a r o u n d me               “The worse          thing you          can

do    is    panic,        the worse          thing you          can do     is panic"             I was        obl ivious        to

anything          else.                                                                                  /

I could          see some       peo pi e a head of me              climbing          over       the/fence and             I saw

one    fan being           pulled over          the       fence,        by a ma n w k^o^as leaning                  ^ver

one    by one,          and onto       the     pitch,           I was    aware       of a gate         op/n        in    the

I kept       telling myself              it would be over                soon,       or that       I may die.

All    the       people      in f r o n t of me a p p e a r e d          to be on the             f l o o r,    they seemed

to be       lying       on top of each o t h e r , about                  four deep,             there was          no one

that       I was aware          dead     under my feet,             but       I was       pushed y i t h my knees

agai n s t       the    group of dead           people          in front       of me,       unat/ie to back,               as

there was          no one       to   push back            on,    and     then      I c o llap/ed on top                 of the

bodies,          face    downwards,          but     I    was     still conscious.

I was       then aware          of the        person b e h i n d me           trying       to s c r amble          up

and over my back,                 in order         to     reach the       perimeter             fence,       but he       then

s l i p p e d and fell          on top of m e , the               people       then       behind were           still

pushing,          and    it was      like a domino               effect       of    people       falling        on top of

me,    I tried          to s t r u g g l e   but     realised       it was all             in vain,           so just      lay

there,       gulping         for air,        and     it was at          this       stage    I thought           I was

going       to die.                                                                                            /

pulled him up also,                  and     the     next       thing    1 feel       is a foot              on my head,

feet,        it took time         for me        to stand up straight,                 as my legs were            trapped

a mo n g s t    the    bodies     on the        floor.

As    I tu rned        round,     a gap had seemed to form from the front                                of the       pen

running         up along       the      railing       separating Pens 3 and 4,                   up towards          the

tunnel.          I wa l k e d up towards              this gap,      a n d out      through the t u n n e 1

w h i c h was       empty.      I was        very dazed and w a l k e d out               through       the    tunnel

and    into the         cou r t y a r d a r e a .

On enter i n g         the    c o u rtyard      I saw a politman stoop i n g                over a supporter

lying        face     down,    I asked        the     police man       if he knew what               he was doing,

he just         turned       round and gave me a blank                  look.         I pushed the            policrnan

out    of      the way and tu r n e d           the    body over,       an d began to give m o u t h                 to

mouth        resuscitation,             the face       of this      body who        was <a man        in his

thirties         I can't       remember a n y thing            else,    was       blue,    so I then          checked

his    pulse,         he had no         pulse    in his neck,          so    I then       realised he          could

not    be saved.

I was aware            that    there were           other    people     lying       down    in this area,

there were a p p r o x i m a t e l y         ten      in number at          this    time,     I then m ov e d         to

another         body,    another        man,     who was       being a i d e d      by a policewoman,                who

was    giving m o u t h to m ou t h             on this      person.         I undid his            belt and     jeans

and    checked         his    pulse,      he had no         pulse,     so s t a r t e d giving          cardiac

mouth        resuscitation.             We    carried on this           p r ocedure        to this man          for a

few minutes,            but    reali s e d he         could not      be s aved and another                  p o liceman

came along and told us to a t t e m p t                      to    revive      someone      else.       Whilst

                   found my friend                                   I thfen made my w a y back                     into   the ground          via the

                   from my         local area,                  who /then helped me                      search     for my      last    friend

                                  /ho we e v e n t u a l l y             found           ten m i n u t e s      later.

                   Me all         then eventual ly lief t the ground,                                     I am     not sure about            the     time,

                   we    left      via the L e p p i n f s               Lane        e nd but         t h r o u g h a different         gate,        all

                   I would         like        to make a compa r i s o n on how                             crowded      it was    inside          the

The w a t c h     I had found         earlier,     I handed     to a Police Offi c e r           before

leaving       the ground.                                         /

The    obs e r v a t i o n s and    views     I have   is th4*t it was a total             shambles

from start         to finish.          We   should have more          ticket a l l o c a t i o n for   the

Liv e r p o o l   fans and       the bigger       end of the      gr o u n d to house      us.

The Po l i c e     s hould have        been o utside      directing        the   fans    to different

parts     of the ground and organising                  o r d e r l y queues.      There    should     have

been better         frist aid e q uipment and             the Po l i c e    trained      to handle

large     crowds and        potent iz A       explosive    situations.

The    injuries       I. s u s t a i n e d were   internal    b r u ising    to my      chest,    bruising

to my ar m and         le g s,     s (/rat ches on my     back,    I did not       receive medical

t r e atment      in Shef f i e l/d




I am willing          to go to        court    if required     but am unable            from the    1st to

the 7th of June           due      to exam c o m m i tments and        then not on the           15th June

                               John Aldridge converts one o f his two goals against Forest in last years semi.

                               No one wants to return to Wembley more than John Aldridge.
            fMiwMfi            Last season, the free-scoring Liverpool striker dragged himself o ff the most famous soccer stage in
                               the world, a forlorn F.A. Cup figure at the end of a sensational final tie against Wimbledon.

                               Lee Chapman beats Bruce Grobbelaar to score fo r Sheffield Wednesday a t Anfield.

                               Lee Chapman's return to his happy hunting ground today could be just what the doctor ordered —-
                               unlike his last appearance in an F.A. Cup semi-final.
                               The big Forest striker, back at the Hillsborough ground where he had such wonderful success in his career,
                               defied a serious illness to play fo r Sheffield Wednesday in the 1986 semi against Everton at Villa Park
       He had missed the penalty th a t m ight have changed the course o f a
       remarkable afternoon. Liverpool's defeat was very much down to their
       collective failure to perform as a team on the day, but the Republic of Ireland
       striker still blamed and punished himself fo r a defeat th a t made a mockery of
       the pre-match predictions.
       That's why John is desperate to put the record straight. He said: "If we can
       beat Nottingham Forest and get back to Wembley — and I can keep my place
       — it will be the perfect opportunity to get th a t penalty miss ou t o f my system
       once and fo r all."
        Aldridge is in the mood to conjure up something special. He's been scoring
        goals like there's no tom orrow, meeting a mighty challenge this season head
        on. The return of scoring legend Ian Rush to Anfield from Juventus before the
        start o f the new campaign suggested to many people th a t the form er Oxford
        star's days with the club he has always idolised m ight be numbered.
        Far from it, John, who won a prestigious Adidas Golden Boot a fte r leading the
        First Division scoring charts last season with 26 league goals, knuckled down
        from the word go to produce the goods once again.
        He returned to Wembley in the Charity Shield in August to plunder a
        magnificent double as Liverpool gained quickfire revenge over Wimbledon.
        His season really began to take o f f in a big way from mid-January when everything he touched seemed to turn to
        gold, or more to the point, goals! In tandem, Liverpool's form has been truly magnificent.
        The Merseyside Reds go into todays semi-final, looking fo r a repeat o f last season's result when they saw o ff the same
s.   •#^nPQ|118jn on the same ground, winning 2-1 thanks to an Aldridge double. But you won't hear Liverpool or any of
;    " v , ic i| | r H making any wild predictions.
       They will get on with the job in hand in their usual low key manner, letting their feet do the talking. Looking back at
       last season's meeting, Aldridge said: "I remember John Barnes had a tremendous game. I scored the goals, but he was
       our match winner. The second goal, when he rounded a defender and crossed fo r me to volley home, was vintage Barnes.
       "I m et the ball perfectly and it went in, as sweet as you like. It was a really great day."
       Aldridge had scored Liverpool's opener from the penalty spot. He hasn't lost his confidence when it comes to taking
       them — despite th a t subsequent Wembley nightmare, it says everything about his approach to the game, John is a
       Scouser who can relate to the fans every inch of the way. A fte r all, he was a Kopite himself as a youngster.
       He revels in every game in a Liverpool shirt. Today's clash — if selected — will be no exception. I say "if selected"
       because no member o f Kenny Dalglish's outstanding team is sure o f his place. That's the way it has always been at
       Anfield. The on-going battle fo r places, week in, week out, is one of the major reasons fo r the club's phenomenal success.




       Wednesday lost, but the ir manager then, Howard Wilkinson, said it was a miracle th a t Lee had played at all.
       Only a fter the match was it revealed th a t he was suffering from hepatitis, a liver complaint It was wondered at the
       tim e what effect this would have on his football career.
       He had to give up alcohol fo r six months and follow a fat-free diet. But he came back as good as new.
       Today he comes back to the ground where he scored some marvellous goals and was a huge favourite with
       Wednesday, fo r whom he scored 78 league and cup goals in fo u r seasons.
       And at Hillsborough last New Year's Eve, he and Forest played some flowing football as they won 3-0 against Wednesday.
       Lee, now enjoying himself in Brian Clough's side, stands out as one o f football's success stories.
       He began as a goal-scoring centre forward at Stoke, but suffered a fter being sold fo r £500,000 to Arsenal in 1982 His
       price had gone down to £100,000 when Alan Durban signed him fo r Sunderland the following year.
       But things got worse. Durban and the club parted company, and Lee fell out of
       favour with new boss Len Ashurst.
       Lee was playing fo r the Roker Park Reserves when Wednesday, about to
N      embark on their First Division comeback in 1984, signed him fo r £100,00.
       His power in the air has been a threa t to First Division defences ever since But
       he acknowledges th a t his game on the ground improved while he was at
       Hillsborough. And he went through one spell where he scored many more goals
       with his fee t than with his head.
       He became known as a centre forward with all-round ability.
       Sheffield fans were sad to see him leave last summer, fo r French club Niort,
       and so was Brian Clough. But when the French experience did not work out,
       there was only one club th a t Lee wanted to play for, and th a t was Forest.
       So now Lee is an im portant part o f Brian Clough's skilful, widely-admired side.
       Liverpool bar the way to Lee's Wembley debut. He not only finished on the
       losing side against Everton three years ago, but also suffered the same
       experience in 1983, when he went on as sub fo r Arsenal in their semi-final
       defeat by Manchester United.
       But th a t too was at Villa Park, and at Hillsborough, Lee is playing on a ground
       where he and the team he has been playing fo r have rarely failed.
       He can also count Liverpool among his victims        he scored against them at
       Anfield in a 1-1 draw on 16th November, 1986.
      it would not be a miracle if either side won today, but whatever the result,
      there will have been 100 per cent e ffo rt and com m itm ent from Lee Chapman.

when      passing           under           the     end      of     the      North       Stand,       I had          warned        Police

Constable              Fletcher             that      on     the       occasion          of   the     semi-final               the

previous           y e a r,      the        area      had     resembled             a waterfall               of     urine      from        people

using        the       stand.          At     that        time      the      ground         was     dry.

At     the    property             store           matters          were       quiet        with     little          property            seized

from       fans.         After          discussing                meal        arrangements            with          Sergeant         Booth

an d      Police        Constable                Campbell           we      left    the       store       intending            to r e t u r n

to     the     gymnasium.                   However,           immediately               on      leaving        I was         approached

by     a gateman            who        wa s      manning          Gate        A.   This       gate    is       normally            used     to

allow        Police         Officers               and      other           authorised           people        to    enter         the    ground

without           using          the    turnstile.                The        gateman        was     in an       agitated            state.

He     told       me     that          because            the c r o w d       outside         the    g a te     was      so    heavy        he

 was      unable         to o p e n           the      g at e to        allow      authorised             access         and

 accordingly                he    locked            the     gate.           I assured         him    he    had       taken         the

 correct          course          of    action,             but        during      the      course        of    ou r     discussion

 f an s      started          to a p p e a r         on     top        of    the   g a te     having        climbed           up    the

 outside          to     a height                of a b o u t 1 5 - 2 0       feet.         I signalled              and      called        out

 to     them      to     get      off         the      gate and             they   did      in    fact     climb         down        to    the




                                                                             3

PRIME MINISTER


                             HILLSBOROUGH AND THE TAYLOR INQUIRY


          I have now received the final report of Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry
into the Hillsborough football tragedy.             We are to discuss the report, a copy
of which was forwarded earlier today, at tomorrow's meeting.


2.         In the body of the report (in Part IV and in particular paragraphs 419
and 424) Taylor expresses grave doubts about the feasibility of the football
membership scheme, serious misgivings about its likely effect on safety, and
is very anxious about its potential impact on police commitments and control
of spectators.        For these reasons he cannot support the implementation of Part
I of the Football Spectators Act 1989.


3.         In the light of these observations I doubt whether we would secure
Parliamentary support for the statutory instruments which are necessary to
implement the scheme, and in view of the judge's detailed criticisms I do not
think that we should attempt to bring the scheme into effect now.


4.         Of course it will be embarrassing to have to announce the shelving of
the scheme, but it should be possible to present the decision in a positive
way.     We were right to provide          for a football membership scheme           in the
Football Spectators Act, but before Third Reading we made it quite clear that
the question of implementation could be considered by Parliament in the light
of    the Taylor report.         Taylor has had the advantage of considering               the
proposals against the details in the invitation to tender.                   He has said that
the scheme as proposed has serious drawbacks and we should accept that advice.
But the enabling provisions should stay on the statute book.


5.        We should make much of the other matters which are covered by the
report. In Part I it places the responsibility for complacency about safety,
for    decline   in    the   conditions   of   grounds,   and   for   poor    facilities   for
spectators firmly at the door of the football industry.               It suggests in effect
that if you treat people like animals they will behave that way. It makes
                                   ^
recommendations  for gradual progress towards all-seater stadia and for
improvements in facilities.           And it does not suggest, explicitly at least,
that the Government should bear the cost of these improvements.


6.        Part II of the report is concerned with details matters relating to
spectator safety, building on the recommendations o£ the interim report.


                                               1.

                                  PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL

Most of them are unlikely to be controversial and can be dealt with without
primary legislation.    Taylor supports the concept of an independent body to
supervise the responsibilities of local authorities              for safety of sports
grounds and our preliminary advice is that even if the football membership
scheme is not set up, the Football Licensing Authority could be appointed to
exercise this responsibility at least in respect of football grounds.                      (The
extension of the Authority's powers to sports other than football would either
require legislation or would need to be negotiated with the sports bodies and
local authorities on a voluntary basis).           We can also support, in principle
at least, those recommendations in Part III which relate to the police, to
crowd control and the control of hooliganism.


7.       In short, nPtthink? the report provides a basis on which to persuade the
football authorities that they must begin to put their house in o r d e r a nd for
improvements in the control of safety.           The alternative measures for dealing
with hooliganism proposed by Taylor deserve to be considered.


8„       I-;do not   propose    that   we   should   repeal    Part   I of   the    Football
Spectators Act.      The fact that Taylor has recommended against the present
membership scheme does not mean that an alternative scheme cannot be devised
in the future which does not give rise to the same objections.               Such a scheme
may stili be necessary if the football industry does not play its part in
improving the situation.

9.       As for handling, I shall need to present the report to the House with
our conclusions by means of an oral statement.          The earliest this can be done,
while ensuring that copies of the report are available in HMSO bookshops
throughout the country, is next Tuesday, 30 January.


10.      I am copying this minute to the Lord President, the Lord Privy Seal,
the   Secretary of    State   for the Environment,       the    Secretary    of    State    for
Scotland, the Chief Whip and Sir Robin Butler.

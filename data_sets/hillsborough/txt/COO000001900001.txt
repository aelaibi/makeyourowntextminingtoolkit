       EC GRANT FOR HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL

       I was telephoned this morning by Fulvio Paolini asking for
       details of the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal bank account to
       enable the EC grant of ECU 400,000 to be paid over.  The details
       are below, and I would be grateful if you would pass them to
       Paolini as soon as possible:

                  "Hillsborough Disaster Appeal"

                  Account Number:

                  Co-op Bank
                  West Street
                  Sheffield

                  Bank Sort Code:

       I have spoken to one of the trustees of the fund (Norman Adsetts
                    } and warned him that the EC would expect a report
       on the use of the funds in due course.  He confirmed that the
       trustees would produce a general report, but said,
       understandably, that it would be impossible to single out the EC
       contribution in terms of which sums went where.

       For the record you may wish to note that the manager of the trust
       fund is Mr C M Reddington, trustees of the Hillsborough Disaster
       Appeal, PO Box 220, Liverpool, L69 2PN (             .
Copies of this letter go to Mr Adsetts and Mr Reddington.

      FOOTBALL S PECTATORS BILL

      I am writing to bring you                   u p-to-da te     with    our    thinking      on   the
      Football Spectators Bill.

      After the H illsborough t r ag e d y it was right to have a p ause in
      d iscu ss io ns on the Bill/ both out of respect for the berea ve d and
      in order to p rovide time for c o ns id er in g additional measures to
      ensure that such an event can never happen again.           Two things
      have now b ecome apparent.

      First/ the need for action against h oo li g an i sm is as strong as
      ever.         The football season/ w hi ch finished last month/ has seen
      regular outbreaks of violent disorder both inside and outside
      football grounds.                   I n d e e d on M a y 13/ l e s s t h a n a m o n t h a f t e r
      H i l l s b o r o u g h / t h e r e w a s a s e r i o u s p i t c h i n v a s i o n at C r y s t a l
      Palace which r esulted in 26 arrests.                      16 people were injured/ two
      of them with stab wounds.                      Serious incidents took p lace all over
      the      c ou nt ry      that      we ek en d    with   more    than     300      p eople  being
      arrested/ inside and o utsid e grounds.                         Under the prov is io ns of
      the Bill any of these p eo pl e who are c o nv ic te d c ould be banned
      from all football league grounds/ for at least two years.                                      The
      existing p owers for the courts to impose exclusion orders under
      the Public Order Act have c le a rl y not s ta mp ed out the problem.
      And if one club bans hool ig an s from its ground/ they can travel
      to another club to cause trouble.                          O nl y a national m em be r sh i p
      s cheme can stop this happening.

      It is worth stressing that since the incidents on May 13 opinion
      has       h ar d en e d  in     favour       of     tough    action      against         football
      hooligans.            The P olice Fe,deration has r e- it e ra t ed its call for a
      national s ys te m of 100% home s up po r te r s o nl y schemes - a proposal
      that goes further than we have suggested.                             Furthermore/ the FA
      m ad e a s ig nificant c hange of d ir ec ti on on 18 May in a statement
      w hich e mb ra ce d the p ri n ci p le of a m e m b e r s h i p scheme.              They argued
      that away fans s ho ul d belong to an away clubs m em be r sh i p scheme.
      T h e y f u r t h e r c o m m e n t e d t ha t s u c h a m e m b e r s h i p s c h e m e w o u l d
      " e l i m i n a t e t h e t r i b a l a s p e c t s of f o o t b a l l s u p p o r t " .  Whilst
      details of any s ch em e they m ay be prop os in g are unclear/ their
      support for the concept of a m e m b e r s h i p scheme is a major and
      significant breakthrough.
Second, it is c lear that we                      must be in a p o s i t i o n to take any
n e c e s s a r y action to im pr ov e           g r o u n d s a f e t y as soon as possible.
It w o u l d be u n a c c e p t a b l e to        have to d e l ay a c ti o n on s a fe t y b y
w a i t i n g for a n o t h e r B il l.           T h a t is w h y w e w i l l b e m o v i n g an
I n s t r u c t i o n to the C o m m i t t e e   on the Bill that t he y have power to
c on si de r        a mendments   on      the       subje ct       of    s p e c ta t or s af et y at
d e s i g n a t e d football matches.

C ol le a g u e s are r i g h t l y c o n c e r n e d that we s h o u l d not p re -e mp t any
r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s by L o r d J u s t i c e T a y l o r .   We agree and i ntend
f u l l y to m e e t t h i s c o n c e r n .         T h at is w h y t h e G o v e r n m e n t h a s
d e ci d e d that P arliament s h o u l d have two o p p o r t u n i t i e s to d ebate
the national m e m b e r s h i p s ch em e after L o r d J u s t i c e T a yl o r ' s final
r e p o r t has been p u b l i s h e d .            The first will com e b e f o r e the
a p po in tm en t of the Football M e m b e r s h i p A u t h o r i t y {F M A ) w h i c h will
run the scheme.               The s ec on d will be to c o n f i r m m y approval of the
s c he me o n c e the FMA has d rawn it up.                  By p r o c e e d i n g with the Bill
now the f r a me wo rk for a nat io na l m e m b e r s h i p s c he m e will be in
p l a c e a n d we w i l l b e in a p o s i t i o n to g o a h e a d r a p i d l y in
i n t r o d uc in g it if P arliament agrees.

I am sure you will a gree that it w o u l d be i n t o l e r a b l e to wait a
f ur th er         twelve     m onths        before        t ak in g  any      action         against
h o o l i g a n i s m or o n f o o t b a l l spectafcoc s a f e t y m e a s u r e s .                 T he
p r o p o s a l s we have m ad e mean that we get the best of b ot h worlds.
We can act in both areas as soon as p o s s i b l e w i th ou t in any way
p r e - e m p t i n g L ord J u s t i c e T a y l o r ' s report.    In t h e s e c i r c u m s t a n c e s
I h ope v e r y much that I can count on your full support for the
Bill at its S econd Re ad in g on Tuesday.

Dear

TORN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT 1990
APPEAL BY ARSENAL FC
SITE: HIGHBURY STADIUM

I have been asked to reply to your letter of 1 January to the Prime
Minister about the above appeal.

The appeals will be heard at a Local Inquiry which will open at 10.00
am on Tuesday 4 February at the Town Hall, Upper Street, Islington.
Local residents and interested persons are welcome to attend and they
may, at the Inspectors'6 discretion, speak about the proposed
development. Written representations will also be taken into account,
provided they have been copied to the local planning authority and the
appellant. Your letter has been treated in this way.

I am sure you will appreciate that I am cannot comment on the merits
of the proposed stand but I can assure you that all the facts and
arguments put forward, both in writing and at the inquiry, will be
carefully considered by the Inspector before a decision is reached.

I have passed a copy of your letter to th6 Sports council and they
should be able to reply to your more general points] relating to policy
on football stadia.

Yours sincerely                                    j

ju d g m en t o f Butterfield J that he had proceeded on the footing that it was for
the plaintiff in the first place to show that the docum ent should be disclosed to                                                                         K M ydeen Esq     B anister.
the court u nder the ordinary rules o f discovery, and th at thereafter it was for the c
court to em bark on the exercise o f balancing the conflicting interests, namely
the need to do justice to the plaintiff and the need for p roper protection o f the
public interest, to determ ine w h eth er the docum ent should be disclosed.
   In m y ju d g m en t that, on the authorities, is the right approach to take. I am
confirm ed in th at view by the approach taken by the C o u rt o f Appeal in Kelly v d
Comr o f Police o f the Metropolis, w here Kennedy LJ considered the approach to
w hat he described as ‘the threshold test’. H e said th at the first thing to be
considered is w h eth er production is necessary for disposing fairly o f the cause or
m a tte r o r for saving costs; in o th er w ords he applied the ordinary test for ordering
production in civil proceedings. H aving passed th at test, if he does, the plaintiff
can then ask the court to carry o u t the balancing exercise. In considering the e
threshold test, the C o u rt o f Appeal considered the decision in the Wallace Smith
Trust Co Ltd case and accepted th a t it is now clear that, if production o f the
docum ents m ay be necessary for the fair disposal o f the action, the court should
exam ine them , although Kennedy LJ did add the caveat th at the possibility that
the docum ents m ay contain som ething useful m ust be real and n o t fanciful. In f
m y ju dgm ent, th at possibility exists in this case.
   As regards the approach to be taken in relation to the question o f public
interest im m unity, Kennedy LJ d rew atten tio n to the recent change in the
approach to this question o f the A ttorney G eneral w h o h ad indicated that the
governm ent w ould no t seek to w ithhold docum ents unless it was satisfied that g
disclosure w ould cause real dam age to the public interest.
    In the present case, all I have been told ab ou t these docum ents indicates that
they are routine docum ents falling w ithin a class w hich is covered by public
interest im m unity. I have no indication that their particular content m ight make
disclosure undesirable in this case, although it is right to say that M r Livesey has h
draw n m y atten tio n to certain factors w hich, as a m atter o f com m on sense, it
w ould seem appropriate for the co urt to take into consideration. H ow ever, since
I am satisfied that the plaintiff has passed th e threshold test, the right course in my
ju dgm ent in this case is for m e to inspect the docum ents so as to undertake the
balancing exercise in o rd er to determ ine w h eth er they should be disclosed or not.
                                                                                          7

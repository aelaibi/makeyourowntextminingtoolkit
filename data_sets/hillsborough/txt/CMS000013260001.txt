       HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY:     PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION

       At his morning meeting yesterday the Home Secretary asked for
       further advice on powers which might be used to secure the
       implementation of recommendations in the interim report of the
       Hillsborough inquiry and on the action to be taken to publicise
       the compliance of local authorities in the great majority of
       cases.

       Powers available to the Secretary of State

       2.    There are two separate powers under the Safety of Sports
       Grounds Act 1975 open to the Secretary of State to exercise in
       ord er   to strengthen  or supplement    the  safety  certificate
       procedures.    It must be said that neither of them provides a
       practical way of imposing interim recommendations in a short time
       scale or in respect of particular clubs.  They are:-

               (a)   the power under section 15A of the 1975 Act    to make an
               order modifying the provisions of the Act in their
               ap plic a t i o n to_ sports  grounds of   a specified  class.
               A proper use of such an order would be, for example, to
               modify ^ section 2(2) of the Act which deals with terms and
               conditions in safety certificate of, for example, football
               league grounds if they could be regarded as a "class" of
               ground.       The purpose of such an order would be to specify
               terms and conditions which should be addressed in all safety
               certificates relating to that class of ground;
i F.R.
«             (b)   a power to make regulations under section 6(2) of the
              1975 Act.   Regulations can be aimed at all sports grounds
              or, again, at a particular class of ground.  The regulations
              would apply specific safety requirements in addition to
              those imposed by safety certificates.  The regulations would
              be enforced by local authorities.

         3.    Neither of these two powers can be targeted at individual
         grounds, for example to force a particular local authority or
         club    to   comply with   a Taylor   recommendation.   Both   are
         ex erci sabl e  by   s tatutory instrument  (subject to  negative
         resolution) and only after consultation with relevant parties.
         Recent experience with the regulations on fire precautions in
         underground railway stations suggest that this process would take
         months rather than weeks.

         4.   If a section 15A order was used to specify mandatory terms
         and conditions in safety certificates, the order would need to be
         expressed in general terms capable of being applied to all
         grounds within the class to which the order applied.      The order
         could probably require all safety certificates to specify the
         maximum number of   spectators to be admitted in each    part of each
         sports ground, or   the nature of the arrangements in    each part of
         the ground for monitoring entry so that the permitted maximum
         numbers are not exceeded.     It would not however be possible to
         lay down within    the order what the maximum numbers should be.
         That depends on    the size, condition    and layout of each part of
         each ground and    the exercise of judgement. However we have no
         evidence that local    authorities are failing to specify maximum
         numbers in safety certificates; the problem is rather whether the
         methods of^ calculation are correctly applied.      While an order
         under section 15A of the 1975 Act can modify the provisions of
         the Act, what it cannot do is add to the powers available to the
         Secretary of State under the Act for example by introducing
         arrangements to supervise or verify the judgements of local
         authorities.

         5.   Regulations under section 6 could specify particular safety
         requirements for particular classes of ground.      It is unlikely
         that any useful purpose could be achieved by regulations applied
         to football league grounds, all of which (except for Torquay
         United) are designated as requiring safety certificates and there
         are no safety requirements which could be imposed by regulations
         which cannot be imposed by certificates.      The legal adviser's
         view is that regulations could not go so far as to specify the
         method of calculation of crowd capacities, so they could not be
         used as a method to secure the 15% reduction in terrace capacity.
         Moreover, since the Regulations would need to be enforced by the
         local authority, it is arguable that they would be subject to the
         same criticism as the present safety certificate procedure in the
         absence   of any   power  to  supervise   the   actions  of  local
         authorities.
The present position

6.   The Home Secretary is aware that we have been monitoring the
implementation of the Taylor interim recommendation through the
Fire Service, through the police and, more recently, through the
local authorities.    We now know the position in all but a
relatively small number of grounds.  We know that in most of them
all the recommendations have been complied with so far as
practicable.   Where we know that a recommendation has not been
complied with, we are taking it up with the local authorities or
the clubs concerned to discuss the reasons and to discover
whether any alternative solutions have been imposed to secure the
same degree of safety.    The annex to this note summarises the
grounds where there is reported to be some difficulty in
implementation (though this excludes those where recommendation 4
on agreements with the police is causing difficulty).      Only a
handful of clubs have so far not replied.      In no case is the
deviation from the interim recommendations serious.

Conclusion

7.   While there might be a case for making an order under
section 15A of the 1975 Act to specify minimum terms and
conditions in safety certificates in the light of the Taylor
final report, there is no need, neither would it be practicable
to use subordinate legislation to secure implementation of the
Taylor interim recommendations.   A revised draft letter to Mr
Carlisle is annexed, which brings out the more positive aspects
of the present position.   Also annexed is a slightly amplified
letter to Mr Edey.

John R Carlisle Esq MP



You asked me whether the Home Office was satisfied with the
response of the football clubs, local authorities and others
to the recommendations in the Interim Report of Lord Justice
Taylor's       inquiry          into the       Hillsborough tragedy.                      I should
perhaps       first of all set out what we expected people to do
or to be doing.


You     will       know       that    our     immediate           action       on     the day       of
publication of                the Interim Report on4 August was to issue a
circular        letter         with       copies    of    the    report       to    the     police,
local authorities,                  other emergency services,                  football clubs
and     to    sports          organisations          urging        them       allto       take    the
action       required          in    order    to     implement,          as    necessary,          the
Inquiry's           recommendations            without          delay.          The        circular
letter also reminded local authorities of their power under
the     Safety          of    Sports       Ground    Act      1975      (the       1975    Act)     to
prohibit or restrict the use of a ground if there is judged
to be a serious risk to spectators in any part of a sports
gro und .


Since        that       time    we    have    been       checking      the progress              made,
firstly        through         the    police       and    the     Fire    Service but             also
t h roug h      the           local       authorities           responsible           for    safety
certificates.                   The       results        we     have     had        so     far     are
encouraging.              There has been a widespread, positive response
 indicating that all or nearly all the urgent recommendations
have been implemented.                       In some cases all of the remaining
 recommendations have also been put into effect.


 That does not mean there have not been problems.                                        Some areas
 of   practical              difficulty      still       exist:        for     example       on    the
 nature       of    written          agreements          between       some    clubs        and    the
 police.           We    shall       be    issuing advice          on this          shortly.        On

Thank you for your letter of 2 5 September to the Home Secretary.


I   am    sorry       that        you    were     not     satisfied       with       my    letter     of
18 September.             You say that it is simply not good enough to place
the responsibility                for safety of spectators at football grounds
on local       authorities,             but I have to point out that that is how
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 is drafted.


The    statutory power              under section          6(2) of the         1975Act permits
the making of regulations for securing safety at sports grounds,
for    example       by     imposing       requirements       which       would      apply    to     all
sports grounds of a                 particular.class.             The regulations would be
enforced        by        the     local     authority.            This     is     in       effect an
alternative          to    the     safety    certificate procedure.                    Section      6(2)
does     not,     however,          enable        the     Secretary        of    State       to    make
regulations          which       would     add    to the    provisions          of    the Act,       for
example authorising him to oversee safety certificates.                                      That is
w h y , as I have explained,                 the Government is seeking appropriate
powers     for       the        proposed    Football        Licensing          Authority      in     its
Football Spectators Bill.


I   should      like       to    assure     you    again    about        the    Home      Secretary's
concern over safety at football grounds and the importance that
he attaches to a proper response by local authorities and clubs
for      the    recommendations              contained       in     Lord        Justice      Taylor's
Interim Report.                 That response is being carefully monitored and
in the light of it and of the final report of the Taylor inquiry,
consideration will be given to the need for any further action.

have             acted                    quickly,                   that          there have                  been     few problems           in
implementing                                the         urgent                 recommendations                     of    the Report        and
none which give us serious cause for concern.                                                                                 For our part
we            are              following                             up            any     instances                  where,     from      the
information                                obtained,                   there             is          doubt        as    to    whether      the
improved safety arrangements intended by the Interim Report
recommendations are being met in full.

When   you    spoke    to me   on    the   telephone   you   asked me     about   the
status   of    the    proposed      Football    Licensing    Authority.     Present
proposals are that the FLA will be an independent
non-departmental        public body.        Appointments     to the   FLA will be
made   by the Secretary          of State      for Environment    in consultation
with   the Home       Secretary     in respect    of those appointments which
have a bearing on the authority's safety role.

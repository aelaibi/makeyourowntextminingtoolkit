HILLSBOROUGH: LETTER FROM DEREK TWIGG MP

issue

Letter from Derek Twigg MP asking about decisions of the DPP in relation to
Hillsborough.

Timing

2.        Routine.

Recommendation

3.        A draft reply is attached.

Summary

4.     Following up the meeting which you had with Merseyside MPs, Derek Twigg
asks further questions about the role of the DPP and the decision not to bring any
criminal charges after the disaster. The points which he raises are about the
decision-making of the DPP, and are therefore not matters about which we are in a
position to express a view, except insofar as these issues were addressed by
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered in detail the
advice offered to the DPP at the time and found no reason to question it. He also
concluded that there was nothing in any of the material which had been put to him
which might cause the DPP to re-consider the decisions previously taken. When
you published Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report you made clear that the Attorney
General and the DPP accepted his conclusions. A self-explanatory draft reply is
attached.

                 DRAFT LETTER FOR SIGNATURE BY THE HOME SECRETARY


 Derek Twigg MP
 House of Commons


 Thank you for your letter of 6 March about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report on
 evidence relating to the Hillsborough disaster.


 You raised some points specifically about the role of the DPP and the decision at the
 time not to bring criminal proceedings against any person.           The DPP has the
 statutory responsibility of deciding whether criminal proceedings should be brought
 against any person, and it is not for me as Home Secretary to say whether the
 decision of the DPP in a particular case was right or wrong.


The decision not to prosecute was, however, considered on pages 9 and 10 of
 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report. He set out there the basis of the advice which
was given to the DPP at the time: essentially that the analysis of the facts contained
in the Taylor Report should be the basis on which to approach any question of
criminal liability. The DPP in taking his decision at the time had to bear in mind the
significantly different and greater degree of culpability which would be involved in
securing a conviction for a criminal offence as against the degree of negligence
             >
which would give rise to liability and compensation payments, under the civil law.


 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concluded that there was no error or omission in the facts
considered by the DPP at the time, nor any error in the consideration of the legal
position.          On page 103 of the report he summarises his conclusion that, after
considering at great length all the detailed material set out in the report, that there is
no material which might cause the DPP to re-consider the decisions which have
previously been taken. In my oral statement when I published the report, I indicated
that I, the Attorney General and the DPP accepted Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
conclusions.




f:\oppu\hou\shortsub\pp0653pd.doc
I understand why people find it difficult to appreciate why no prosecutions took
place. There is no question about responsibility for the disaster. That has been
made clear over and over again in pubic statements, and through the substantial
amounts of compensation which have been made by South Yorkshire Police,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and Sheffield City Council. The heart of the
issue is that acceptance of responsibility and liability under the civil law does not
amount to the serious degree of recklessness which would be necessary to prove a
criminal offence against any individual.


You are right that there is a lot of misunderstanding, fuelled by the media, about how
far the causes of the disaster have been established. There can be few events in
recent history which have been subject to such long and comprehensive
examination. We have to explain at every opportunity that what happened and why
was established in detail by the Taylor Inquiry and has been confirmed by
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report.

I am writing to say thank you for the time you gave to myself and the Merseyside MPs last
Wednesday evening when we discussed the Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny of Evidence
Report.

You will recall that I asked you specific questions about the role of the DPP and the lack of
prosecution of the Police Officers who have been found to be mainly responsible for the disaster
along with, of course, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

In view of the mass of evidence now available laying the main responsibility for the disaster at the
door of the Police and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, I just cannot understand why no
charges were ever brought and I was still not clear in my own mind from the answers you gave
that those questions had been adequately answered. I would like to put them to you again as
follows:        >

1.    Why did the DPP at the time, following the publication of the Taylor Report and the
      investigation by the Midlands Police, not decide to prosecute either individual Officers,
      South Yorkshire Police or Sheffield Wednesday Football Club?

2.    Given the knowledge that you now have, do you believe that the decision not to prosecute
      at that time was wrong?

3.    In view of the Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny of Evidence Report which further
       confirms the Police were mainly responsible for the disaster along with further evidence
       about the responsibility of Sheffield Wednesday Football Cub would you support, as
       Home Secretary, a referral back to the DPP to consider prosecutions - if not could you say
       why?



                            THE CONSTITUENCY OF HALTON
                            WIDNES           RUNCORN           HALE

                   Constituency Office: Tel: 0151 424 7030 Fax: 0151 495 3800
You will be aware of the strength of local feeling. I am sure you realise that most people cannot
square the circle on the basis that there is so much evidence about the responsibility for this
disaster but no prosecutions ever took place. This again, as I have said to you previously, wholly
undermines the faith of the people in the justice system.

Finally, you will see from the attached article from my local paper that there is a lot of
misunderstanding about what is known about the disaster. Although we know what happened, a
lot of people have not grasped this message. It suggests to me that we, as the Government, have
to find a way of getting the message home.

like     to    point              out    t h at      a    proffesional organisation                                 s u c h as    the A A

should        have       been          looked       into        the        route,          realising           the     traffic           going            t

Sheffield           on       t h at     particular              day,        because          as    I said           there     was        heavy

traffic        at    the          same        p o i nt    last        yea r.

Due     to    the    traffic             delays           I didn't              arrive until             2 . 15pm,that              is,      in       th

there        because          I sa w a s i g n             saying           Hillsborough                 half       a m i le ,      and      by

that     I thought                the    sign       referred               to    the       football           ground.          I parked               th

car     outside          a    factory           on a       cindered              surface          bu t    I d o n ’t k n o w           the       name

there        were    no           signs        of a n y        s u p p o r t e r s or a n y t h i n g          so     we    d i d n ’t t r y          it

left     because             we    s aw w h a t          looked          like      h al f a d o z e n          football           supporters

walking        up    the          road,        and       after        walking          about        30 yards          we    saw      tw o

Policeman           walking             towards           us    down        the      hill        so we        asked        them     to      point

out     where          the       ground        was       and    he    told        us    to       carry         on w a l k i n g        up       the

ground        on       the       otherside           of    the       park.         The       tw o     Policeman              we       spoke       to

one     of    them,          a     coloured          Policeman asked                                                    if we          were

told     h i m we           were      Liverpool            and       the     Policeman               had a short                 conversation

with     him       but       I d o n ’t k n o w           what       about.            We    all      w a l k e d at a b r i s k                 pace

because           we    didn't           know       how    far       the     ground was               and       I remember                 saying        io

my     son,                      ho w m a n y       parking          spaces        there           were        in the        side          street

and     that       n a r k e d rne b e c a u s e           we    could        have          parked         a    lot     c l oser,           infact           I

w as    going          to    stop        for    some       apples          but     I knew            time       wa s    getting             on a n d

people        about          in f a c t        I thought             everybody              was      in the          ground.

It     took       us a n o t h e r         five      minutes          at a b r i s k             walk      to     reach L e p p i n g s               Lane

there       “C a n ’t we            get    through           here"         he       said       "no my          orders       are       to       keep

 it      closed"         and        I said        "but       its      just          been       opened"          and    he       s a id,        "Yes

I l o o k e d at            my w a t c h         and    I think          it w a s        7 or 6 m i n u t e s              to    t h r e e,

I said          to ________ I ’m g o i n g                   to    the       gents       and       he    said       he w o u l d        come       with

me,      once        in the           toilets          I was       suprised             to    find       them       so     e mp t y ,      by     that.

I'm m e a n          I could             easily        find a        space         to    urinate,             but       having        said        t h at

there         were        people          urinating           against          the       wall       outside             the     toilets.              As

I went          toward          the       toilet        I said          " we v e    still          got       our    tickets"               We     come

out      of     the       toilets           and       I wanted          to    go    to       the    co r n e r ,        but     as    it w a s

rearing          kick          off       time     I only          saw    the       one       entrance             I decided           we     should

get      into        the       ground          first        and    then       sort       our       position             o u t , I d i d n 't

see      anybody            in t h a t         courtyard who                 I could ask                about       directions               to

where         I wanted              to    go     to,    so    I went          down       the       tunnel          with                         I got

to a       p oint         in the          tunnel        where        I managed               to    see       the    green        of     the? p i t c h

the      sunshine              and       the     players          in t h e i r      red a n d           their       white        and       seconds

thinking             I could             g et a       better       position             in one          of    the       corners         I told

                to     go      to     the      right,        then       I think                          st e p p e d      possibly             one

step       to    the        right         and     then       I never          saw       him       till       we    met     up a g a i n

outside          the        ground          of a b o u t      4.40       pm,       it w a s        as    I told                         to      move

t ha t     I was          hit a n d         pushed          forward          down       the       steps, I would                 describe             it

like       being          in a s u r g e          at    the H o p        but       the       force       on m y         back     was       st r o n g e r ;

I would          sa y       the       thing       dis-similar                from       the       K op was         we    didn't         come       b ac k

from       the       su r g e ,       and      th e    pressure          of    the       surge          was       the    same        all     the

s t il l      the      pressure             did       not    decrease,             at    this       time          I was       approximately

12 to         15 f e e t        from        the       perimeter          fe n c e ,      I still             kept       thinking           the

pressure             was       going        to    ease       off     but      it    didn't          it       increased           I would

describe             it     like         being        in a    vice       and       somebody             tightening              the     vice       up.

I ’d b e e n     lifted         into,       and      seeing          bodies           being        placed             in the       ambulance

and    others        being         lined       up    on       the    floor           behind        it,       then       I remember               the

ambulance         reversing              and    somebody             shouting              fo r    it       to    stop,         I heard

somebody         sh ou t ,      “ t hi s    ones         still       breathing".                   I saw a P o l i c e m a n                in P e n

3 where        I'd     been,        kneeling             down       by a b o d y a n d             shouting             to      other

Policeman         on      the      pitchside             of    the     fence,          how        do    I do          it" a n d     by      t ha t

he w a s    asking         how      to     give      the       kiss        of    life,       and also                 remember         a

Liverpool         Supporters               climbing            over        the       railings           back          into      the P e n 3,

and    a Policeman              on the         pitch          side     telling             him     to       get       back,      the

Liverpool         supporter              said       to    him       "If     your       not        going          in t h e r e      then         I am".

Liverpool           Supporters                 they       protected          the     man with             the      camera          and

bustled        him       out        onto       the    field,I          also     saw      some       stewardesses

coming        on w i t h        water,          they       had    containers             with       water        in a n d         pint       s iz e

and     picked          it    up a n d         went       and    got    some       water         myself.          After           I finished

my water           I walked              over    to       the N o r t h W e s t       corner           flag      where        there          was          a

Policeman           standing              and    1 asked          him where           I could             find a       phone,           and          he

said     “d o n ' t      ask        me    m a t e 11, I t h e n        told     him      t ha t     I'd      better         go     out,          and

he     said    “ If y o u           go    out    you       can't       get     back      in,"       and      I said         to     him,          “

I've     got       to    come        back       in as        I haven't          found         my    b o y"      I thought              to

myself        then       I can           come    back        in a n y w a y     because            I've      still         go t    my       full

ticket.When              I got           out    into       the    street        it w a s         chaotic         there        were

Police        motorbikes,                 ambulances             sirens        going,         people         shouting,             screaming

and     crying          sitting           and    lyin g         everywhere           it w a s       like        a battlefield                    but

the     contrast             wa s    others          were       quiet.         I wandered              through         the        people

looking        for       the        boys       heading          toward       the     g as     showroom           in the           hope       of

meeting        them          there        and    finding          a telephone               to     use.         Halfway           up

Leppings           Lane       I met                         md    we    just       fell       in e a c h        others        arms,          I

asked     him       if       he w a s      alright          and    if     he    had      seen       the      others         that        is

and                      and        he    said       he    hadn't,        so we       went         up to        the    gas        venue

hopefully           to m e e t           them and          to    use    the     gas      showrooms              telephone,              we

didn't        see       them        there       and       the    showroom          was      closed         we    went       over        the

road     to a b i ke            shop where                the    proprietor           had        realised         the       anxiety              of

th e    situation and                    was    well       organized           letting           people         use    the        phone,

             We     went     into an          off       licence          and      bought      some         cans of      po p a n d     I bought

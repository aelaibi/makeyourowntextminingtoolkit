                   Dear Mr Mason

                      ACCESS TO THE WEST END TERRACES, STANDS, GATES AND TURNSTILES

                      Thank you for             your letter of 19 June.

                   The reason why I am restricting physical access to the terraces, fences,
                   gates etc, is that there still has to be certain research to be under
                   taken by the Health and Safety Executive into various aspects. I have
                   been advised that any contamination from outside sources could perhaps
                   influence the results. It is appropriate, therefoe, that we preserve
                   the scene until the Health and Safety Executive have completed their
                   work. I hope that we will soon be able to return that end of the ground
                   to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club after which you will have no
                   difficulty in dealing direct with the Club Secretary, Mr Graham Mackrell*

                      I would like to stress that I do not wish to add any more to the
                      distress already suffered, but it is imperative to Lord Justice Taylor's
                      Inquiry, as well as HM Coroner* that the. best evidence is achieved.

                   I still have no objection to visits being wade to the ground, subject to
                   Mr Mackrell'$ approval, but touching any aspects of the terraces to
                   which I have just referred cannot be permitted for the time being.
                   Hopefully it will not be long before full access will be available to
                   the Club.

                   I have copied this letter to the Deputy Director of the Health and Safety
                   Executive and to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

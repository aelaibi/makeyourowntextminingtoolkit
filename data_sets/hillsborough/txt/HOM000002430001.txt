        On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty re the Semi-Final in the Incident

        Room next to Operations Room.                                                           Police Constable 1176 JONES was with me

        from 0600 hours that date and we were joined at approximately 10.00 am

        by Chief Inspector EDMJNDSON.

        Police Constable JONES was manning the radio controlling traffic mobiles

        engaged in overseeing the arrival of supporters via major roads and the

        motorways. On the instructions of Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON I was updating

        the extended incident log on the Command and Control System.

        Throughout the morning and dinner time period we had a lot of congestion

        on the roads but by approximately 1400 hours this had all but cleared and

        everything seemed to settle down and go smoothly and we had no major hold

        ups anywhere.                            I remember several mobiles asking to go into meal and this

        v.-as refused.

        Whilst engaged on our duties on channel 1 VHF we were also monitoring

        Hillsborough Ground Control on channel 25 via a repeater set.                                                                                                                      PS GODDARD

        was the main operator at the ground.                                                                         I think that it is important to

  say that this radio was not being monitored constantly' by officers in the

   Incident Room in fact most of the time it was turned down low (volume)

  as PC JONES had difficulty hearing transmissions from his mobiles if

  channel 25 was on at a normal setting..

  I could hear various transmissions on channel 25 and at approximately 2.40

  pm I heard a supervisory officer whom I did not know talking to PS GODDARD

  saying he had a large crowd outside the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

  He asked for more officers (Mounted I think) and a vehicle with a PA system

  to stop people pushing.            I believe one was directed to the scene.

  Transmissions on Channel 25 were getting more frequent from this tine and

  you could hear the sound of a large crowd noisily in the background.                               I

  heard the same supervisory officer ask several times for a gate to be

  opened at Leppings Lane.            Each time he asked he was more insistant and

  he stated finally that the gate had to be opened or else people would be

  fatally injured.        The sounds of the crowd seemed to suggest this as well.

  It was apparent that this officer was in the centre of the crowd.                           I then

  contacted ground control over Channel 25 (I think) or it m y have been

  the telephone line to their ground control office, to see if any ambulances

  were required at the scene, it was so noisy and unruly over the radio that

  injuries were a definite possibility.                     I was informed by PS GODDARD that

  ambulances were not required at this time.                          I cannot reireniber the time

  exactly but it would be about 3.00 pm.

  Various messages were being passed on channel 25 and I heard an officer

  state that numerous people were injured and a request was made for a fleet

  of ambulances. I told Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON of this, he was half

  way through the connecting door to Operations Room, and then I contacted

  ambulance control by direct line and made the same request using the same

  words.     I was informed that the usual response would be sent.                  On

  termination of that call someone at the ground requested Operation Support.

  Mr ED-MJNDSON was informed and I was then engaged in various duties in

  relation to what we thought was a crowd disorder and were directing

  officers to the ground, motorcycles to cover hospital routes etc.                      At some

  stage we knew we had fatalities, we thought in the region of single

  figures, we even commented if the game would continue.                  We spoke of this

  because if the game was cancelled we had the job of seeing to the crowds

  leaving the ground.           We were then informed the game was off and the crowd

  leaving.     PC JONES and myself then arranged traffic cars to assist in this

  task.    This we were engaged in for the rest of our tour of duty along with

  assisting in all the other arrangements.              My tour of duty ended at 7.30

  pm.     I have read a transcript which implies that PC ROOK (2554) contacted

  ambulance control. At that time             I had no knowledge of this and I also

  contacted the ambulance control specifically requesting a fleet of

  ambulances and I received a reply from the female operator, you will get

  our normal response,, one ambulance, I do not know any person by the name

  of Alf.     I am not known by this name.           At no time as far as I can recollect

  did I contact the Fire Brigade.

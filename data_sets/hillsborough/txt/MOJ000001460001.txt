                   R v SYPA ex p. CHIEF CONSTABLE



You will have seen the note of 1/4/99 from junior counsel re the form of
declaration, and Jones QC’s note of 9/4/99. I am anxious not to have to
convene a further hearing. I suggest that we make the following declaration:


       “It is declared that a police authority has the statutory power, but
       subject to ordinary public law principles, to provide financial
       assistance to police officers and former police officers in respect of
       their costs and expenses incurred in relation to private
       prosecutions brought against them and judicial review
       proceedings in which they participate.”




If you agree I would also propose to indicate that the'court is not to be taken
as entertaining any view as to the legality or otherwise of the provision of
financial assistance for a private prosecution brought by an officer.

said that we           c o u l d n ’t go    in as       it was      too     crow de d already.       We m ov ed

I then saw that           supp or te rs were star ti ng             to    come out of the L e p p i ng s

putting       them     in the ambulance.              About    four      people were        laid on the

floor     by the ambulance,               I c o u l d n ’t be s p ec if ic a bo ut      the    injured

people     due to the distance.                  I saw a m ember          of the      '■Press'      stan di ng

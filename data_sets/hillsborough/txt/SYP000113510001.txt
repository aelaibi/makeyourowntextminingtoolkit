               SUBJECT;    Incident 105; Action A627
                           Liverpool City Council Chauffeur

   In response to the above action I have made telephone           enquiries and
   spoken to Cyril DARCY, b         ] of I                           \ Liverpool
   14, a chauffeur employed by Liverpool City Council.

  On 15 April 1989 he drove the lady Chairman of the Council in official
  transport to the Seini Final at Hillsbrough.  She had her young grandson
  with her, and a footman, Hr Bert Wilson was also in attendence.

  He drove to the directors entrance and after    dropping the Chairman and
  party, parked the official car in space no      32(?) on the official car
  park. They arrived at 11.45am.     The Chairman attended the lunch given
  by the FA at 12.1Spis, and a short time later Hr Darcy and the other
  chauffeurs were given refreshments also in the same area.

  After seeing the Chairman take her place in the MIP seats, Hr Darcy and
  Mr Wilson went to soisa seats in the South Stand to the left of the
  directors' box where they remained.     Hr Darcy did not go near the
  Police Control box.

  Hr Darcy is 5'2"»         He does have an official uniform, in dark blue
  serge, like a double breasted suit.         There is a cap, in dark blue
  serge, with a liver bird cloth badge on the front.     The peak is in dark
  blue cloth , around which there is a broad gold cloth band. Hr Darcy
  says he did not, wear the cap at all while he      was inside the      ground. He
  only wears it when handing his charges out of the        car, or on other
  formal occasions, but wears it as little as        possible because being such
  a small fellow he looks foolish in it.

   On the day in question he wore no outer coat of any description.

   Mr Darcy stayed in the stand until it became clear what was happening on
   the pitch, and then left it to find the Chairman.     He and the footman
   found her under the South Stand in a distressed state, and the party
   left at about 4.30pm.

   There were a number of other chauffeurs at the ground      (about 4) but as
   far as Hr Darcy is aware they all did much as he did.      I do not know to
   whom these servants belonged.

    I have not visited Hr Darcy, and therefore have not taken any written
    statement.   There would be no difficulty in doing so, if you think it
    necessary, but it would seem from what he says that this line of enquiry
    does not assist us.

STATEMENT FROM. MR T HICKS - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 15.4.89.
Myself, my wife and 2 daughters obtained our tickets from Anfield

with the 2 girls getting standing tickets on vouchers from their

Xop Season Ticket.    My wife was allocated a seat ticket, and I

myself was given a standing ticket, - by the allocation based on

the Main Stand Season Ticket Serial Number allocation.



We travelled together in my car to Sheffield making only 1 stop at

the Woodall Services just after Junction 30 on the Ml.        We then

proceeded along the M1 ana followed the Police signs at the first

junction, asking us to proceed to the next.    We encountered a long

tailback   (1-2    miles in nearside lane)but I continued in the

’CBTrfere lane ■'"towards the front of the queue, where I was able to

leave the motorway down the dual carriageway section of the slip

road. (Time approximately 12.10 pm).    We then followed the signed

route to Hillsborough and when we got to the Ground, I travelled

along the A61 Penistone Road towards the city until I was able to

turn round and return to the car park which was being provided in

the corner of the large park between the A61 Penistone Road ana the

A616 Parkside Road.    We parked the car at approximately 12.45 pm

and we had the picnic lunch which we had brought with us.



At about 1.40 pm we left the car, walked along Parkside Road to the

Leppings Lane end and arranged to rendezvous with ray wife outside

the small t-obacconists to the left of the approach area.      In the

bridge approach area,    I would estimate perhaps     5 - 10 Police
Officers were present (no Police horses) and it was all fairly calm
with only small numbers of fans milling around.



3 =>tween the car and arrival at the turnstiles, we were asked by

about 3 people if we had any spare tickets - normal for such a big

game.



Other than in the approach area, I only remember seeing Police

Officers (2 or 3) near a snail Police kiosk on Parkside P.oad.               I

do hot remember seeing an.v mounted Police at all.



At   about 1 .53 pm, my 2 daughters and I went through the turnstiles,

-xssf.'^tickets being taken, split and the "rerain        secrion recurnea.

Upon entering the yard beyond, I remember small numbers oi people

 milling around, with 1 Policeman near our turnstile and perhaps 1 -

 2 more in the yard area.       There were about 2 - 3         stewards in tne

 general area plus 2 selling programmes to the left of the tunnel.



 The    "standing"   sign   above   the   tunnel   was   tne    only   guidance

 visible/given to us and there" was no indication that it was not tne

 only way to the terraces.      My daughters proceeded down the tunnel,

 and I bought" 2 programmes from the venders to the left or tne

 tunnel.



 I wanted a- cup of coffee and observed a rerres’
                                                nment kios.< to the

 right of the tunnel - I believe under the stairway into the sealing
area.     I queued for a few minutes and purchased my cup of coffee.

It was this act that enabled rae to see it was possible to go around

the base of the West Stand into the corner Terraces between the

West and South Stands-         This area was sparsely occupied with a wide

choice of positions, I took up a position about 2nd barrier from

the rear in front of the floodlight tcver and to the loft of the

Police box. (See exhibit A).           I stood in this position drinking my

coffee, reading the programme and listening for Team news etc on

the small transistor radio I had in my pocket.



A little before the kick-off,              (approximately 14.50 pm, I noticed

there were large numbers of people in the centre sections (I r.ow

QnaerstaffiJ tltese to be known as Pens Numbers 3 and 4).                 From my

position on the terrace, I could quite clearly see the dividing

fence and could see several people crushed against this side fence,

many clearly in some distress.              One in particular, an old man, I

believe v/earing a light grey coat or possibly suit, had his eyes

closed.    People were being pulled from the rear of the Pens up into

the     seating area    of   the West Stand.         People were    also being

pulled/assisted     over     the    dividing    fence and   some   youths    v/ere

scrambling      over,    the       pitch     side   fence   but    were     being

repelled/arrested by Police Officers on the pitch.



A senior Police Officer was standing on the landing of the Police

Box, I would estimate some 10 feet away from my position and I

called several times to him trying to attract his attention to the
crushing-     (I believe he had gold braid on the peak of his cap and
was wearing a light coloured anorak).            He ignored me completely and

continued to observe the scene for some minutes until ha walked

down the steps and round the segregation bdccier underneath the

South Stand.     (I believe he was the Officer who ran onto the pitch

and told the Referee to stop the game some few minutes later).



A television cameraman with a shoulder held video camera (I think

the one shown in Exhibit !’AM ) took up a similar position but after

man y   shouts from the crowd (ana possibly some coin throwing) he

then left the landing and went back under the South Stand.



Another Police Officer who I believe I can recognise facially (I

believe to have had black braid on the peak of his cap) took up a

similar position       on    the    steps/landing.        I again     implored him

several times that people were being crushed and couldn't he do

something to help.          He initially ignored uie and then after say 3

of 4 calls to him,          looked down at me and said "Oh,              shut your

fucking     rattle",   and     then    continued     to   look   in    ths   general

direction of Pens 3 and 4.



Both myself, -and      the    man     standing   on ray left     were     extremely

concerned as I knew this was roughly wnsrs my daughters were and

this man said he had a son in the same section.                       More and more

people were b e g i n n i n g to climb out of the section and j- oecame

increasingly concerned for my daugntecs* safety.
                                                                     ^ 1l(\
The game had just kicked off and a Police cordon of 2 - 3 men deep
were put in an arc aro««d *he 2 central Pens behind the goal and

it was obvious that their purpose was to prevent anybody climbing

over    the   barrier.   It   is nty belief that several people were

actually held back and *11 the signs were that the Police Officers

had been given instructions to contain the people within the Pen

area.    Officers along the fence appeared to be pushing people back,

whereas their colleagues standing in the arc were just standing

watching, many with their arms crossed.      I would estimat’a this took

place for some 5 - 1 0   minutes, bringing the time to approximately

15.05 - 15.10.



It was during this time that the Officer, in the light coloured

anorak ran onto the pitch a-vl spoke to the Referee, wnereupon the

game was stopped. (I know this to be 15.06).



I also noticed a large number        (10Q - 150 approximately)    Police

Officers emerged from the opposite corner and they took up lines

across the pitch at the ’’centre" and along the North Stand.



I started to move down, the terraces towards the side fence to try

to find my daughters and to render what assistance I could.

As I got approximately half way down, I saw the limp form of my

youngest daughter Victoria,        being passed over the barrier.         I

therefore      changed direction   to the pitcA access gate      i.rom   my

section (which was manned by a Policeman) and pushed my way onto
                                                                                 ^ 7 5 4


the pitch.


I came upon nty 2 daughters Victoria               Sarah, laid on the pitch

just at the touchline slightly to the right of the goal.            -Sarah was

receiving assistance     from 1 man and he, nyself            plus 2 others

started to render mouth to mouth resuscitation to both of them.

One of the men attending to Sarah called for suction (I have since

discovered that this was Dr C X Flenley), while we continued to

resuscitate my daughters I shouted my daughters names into their

ears ana called to Police/Medics several times for suction but none

was available.      We then continued taking turns at mouth to mouth

resuscitation.      One man was called away to help a friend ana it

therefore    left   myself   ana   1       other   giving   mouth   to   mouth

resuscitation on Victoria with Dr Flenley and a man in a checuerea

shirt, (who was apparently an off-duty Policeman from the crova)

rendering assistance to Sarah.         There v/as no medical equipment or

assistance available to us throughout this time.             »»e continuea to

give mouth to mouth resuscitation, taking turns for sotne TO minutes

or more, whereupon the first ambulance (the one trapped behind the

goal) tried to get past us catching my toes             I knelt and the foot

of someone else laid on the pitch.



This ambulance had taken up a ridiculous position with its movement

onto/off the ground grossly impaired.          Presumably this was to avoid

cutting up the playing surface.




                                       6
We continued to attempt to resuscitate ay daughters for a few more

minutes when'a fire?na^ came over carrying an oxygen bottle with a

face mask attached (smoke-inhalation device?) but this was no good

as we could not get the girls to breath unaided and the pressure

in the bottle/regulator was insufficient to force oxygen into their

lungs.


A second ambulance came onto the pitch area and stopped adjacent

to us.   We agreed to put Sarah and Victoria into this ambulance.

Two., of us put Victoria into this second ambulance and were about

to turn around and lift Sarah into it, when a third group of people

put in a man who had to go onto the floor.   I then was faced witn

    awful choice of leaving Sarah, who I was assured would be'

placed in the next ambulance which was apparently coming.



The ambulance started to move away so I rejoined Victoria and along

with a Pc.1926 McGuinness, continued to give mouth to mouth.



In the ambulance was the ambulance attendant, a woman, myself ana

PC McGuiness.   There was a young man in his 20's on the floor, who

did in fact have a throat tube in his mouth, but the ambulance man

said was dead    within a minute or so of us driving of;..      -the

Ambulance Attendant and the woman attended a person on the other

seat, but he was also pronounced dead by the ambulance man.     Tne

ambulance man and myself continued artificial respiration with PC

McGuinuess holding an oxygen bottle and we continued througaout the
time it took us to reach the Northern General Hospital.                           The
ambulance man was of the opinion he felt a faint pulse on a couple

of occasions during this journey.



Victoria was then taken straight into the Casualty section and

because         they       thought   there   was   possibly   some   life,   received

immediate medical attention from a team of Doctors and Nurses aided

by PC McGuinness.               I observed for scne 2 cr 3 minutes, whereupon

I was ask-ad to leave the area and was taken into a side room.

Obviously conditions were extremely hectic with people ana bodies

arriving very quickly.                The Hospital was well equipped and 1 was

given the impression that all possible care was being taken with

                    «ere believed to have a chance.



After about 10 minutes, I was informed by PC M.cGuinness that ray

daughter had been pronounced dead.                 I thanked PC McGuinness for his

assistance and also apologised for the verbal abuse I had poured

upon him as a representative of the Police throughout our time in

the ambulance and at the Hospital.                  Once I was told that Victoria

was dead, I then went around the Hospital trying to locate Sarah

on the grounds that I had been told she would be in an ambulance

following closely behind.



After some 30 minutes of futile searching,                     I was taken to the

Ph y s i o t h e r a p y   Department by a Psychiatric Nurse (Gill Bennett) who

had come on duty to help with the problems..                    I was kept in this
area for some half to three quarters of an hour and on a couple of
iot3a-stcms.~--.MisS:.,.-Benaefcfc £ri*d itnestablish whether Sarah was indeed

at this Hospital or not-         Eventually, I was taken round to the

section of the Hospital where the bodies of the deceased were being

attended to.      I gave a description of Sarah to the Police Officers

on duty     and   it appeared    that they had "a young un-identified

female" who could possibly have been the Sarah.               A Police Officer

went into the room and brought out a Swatch watch which I felt at

the time was the saiae as that of my daughter Sarah.              After about

10 or 15 minutes, I was taken across to the Hospital Mortuary to

identify who I expected to be Sarah,          It is now a matter of record

that this was indeed Victoria who somehow had become detached from

her label when I at first            identified her on admission to the

Hospital-      Despite the unnecessary distress this caused to me

personally    I   did   not   feel   bitter   towards   the    Hospital   as- I

considered they were attempting to cope with the extreme pressure
that was put upon them.



Myself, Miss Bennett and a Reverend returned to the main Hospital

building and I was retained for perhaps another half an hour or so.

Throughout this time, I was trying to establish the location of my

wife and Sarah.         I explained again that Sarah's condition was

obviously    serious when we were on the pitch and               that she way

supposedly "in the next ambulance",            I was then told that some

casulaties. had been taken to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and

that Sarah could be there (as could my wife).
Communications    were   difficult    and   everbody,    both   medical     and
administrative, -veret at full stretch and all telephone lines were

jammed.      I was told that 11      people -were dead at the Northern

General Hospital and that no ofcher females were there.               Further

discussions took place and it was agreed that I should co to the

Kallamshire Hospital and if my wife arrived at the Northern General

Hospital,    I would be contacted and she would not be told about

victoria’s death until I returned to meet her.



At about 6 o'clock, I was taken by a young female Padre (Linda

Shipton) and Miss Bennett to the Royal Haliamshire Hospital.               Upon

arrival,    I gave a full description to the staff and they then

..xircule.ted it to see whether Sarah had indeed been admitted.               I

had to wait in the general reception, area for some time, attended

initially by Miss Bennett and nurses from the Hallamshire Hospital.

At one point,    a .nan in a suit stood on a desk and called for

attention.    Ke read out a list of ,rpatients" who had been taken to

'the Northern General Hospital.      He called out Victoria's name and

as I knew she was dead, I broke down and began to cry.



A nurse took me into a side room and tried               to console   me    and

assured me they were attempting to locate Sarah and that some

people had been taken to 3arnsley Hospital.             I said I suspected

the worst because of Sarah's condition on the pitch.

A Police Officer also took full details of the location of                 mycar

and my wife and assured me he would try to locate and re-unite me
with my wife before she was advised of the death of Victoria.


At about 19.45,      I received a message to say that my wife had

arrived at the Northern General Hospital and I was then taken back

there bv a "Cruse Councillor" (Mrs Hilary Firth-omitn) in her Cdf.

At approximately 20 .00 hours, ray wife and I were re-united in the

foyer oC the Northern General Hospital, where I was appalled to

find she had been advised of the death of Victoria had been refused

cermission to see her body and had been told I was with a remade

.-it the Hallamshire Hospital whom she had assuaea was Saran.                 She

was distraucht when I was unable to confirm Sarah's whereaoouts.




I made formal protests to both Hospital aad Police Authorities and

demanded our rights to see our child.             After some 5 or 10 minutes

we were advised by the Assistant Matron that our daughter's body

w as no longer on the Hospital premises, and at police instructions,
had been taken back to the Hillsborough Ground.



 I   prote.sL-d    strongly   at .this        callous   and   unnecessary     act,

 especially as I had already identified her twice, latterly at rest

 in the hosohlal      mortuary.     My protestations were met by off­

 handedness   by    the Police    Officer       (who claimed    it was   at    tne

 Coroners instruction) and sympathetically by the Assistant Matron

 (who had _tear filled eyes).            We were advised that there were

 "several un-identified people at the ground" and we should return


                                         11
there.


Nobody advised us how many casualties/bodies we could expect        to

find, no transport was offereed and we were left to make our own

way there.



In the accompaniment of a Mr Alan Dunkley and Mrs Hillary Firth-

Smith.    Mr Alan Dunkley drove us back to Hillsborough in his car,

whereupon we arrived at the entrance to the Gyna.si.um/Temporary

Mortuary at approximately 22.00 hours.       We were refused entrance

by an extremely callous, rude ana unbelievably insensitive Police

Officer in charge on the gate.     He was a Ranking Officer (I believe

Inspector)    and regretfully..   I did not take his name.-    He was

totally callous to ><iy wife and I and this can be borne cut by the

2   independent   witnesses   aforesaid.   After considerable heated

argument with him,     I compromised,, agreed to go to the park and

collect my car, whereupon he would then allow us access upon our

return.



The 4 of us plus a Police Constable walked back along Penis tone

Road to the corner of the park where I discovered the gate was

still open and my Granada car was the only one remaining on the car

park.     We then drove back to the Ground gates and parked outside.




Further remonstrations with aforesaid Police Officer took place and


                                    12
we were again refused admission.                In addition he upset my wife

further fay saying we had no rights in the matter, that the girls •

were the property       o f.   the Coroner, and would have to undergo a Post

Mortem.        His attitude to us, and handling of us, was unbelievably

callous.       I wish to make a formal complaint about this Officer when

he can be identified.           I gave my business card to a Norwegian Press

Photographer who took photographs during my remonstratior.s with the

Police Officer.         Should I receive contact from him, then I will

make these available.            The best that tne Police Ofncer could do

was to offer for us to sit in a Police van for 30 minutes.                   ihis

I refused to do and said that I insisted that having been sent

there by the Hospital, knowing full well 1 daughter was deac and

suspecting the fate of the other, I demanded to be allowed access.

After a few minutes, two CID Officers (aged in tneir mid 30 s wi^h

one in a brown leather jacket) took charge of the situation ana

cuided ray wife, myself and our 2 Social Worser colleagues ifico ari

anteroom.        This Officer is to be commended for his handling of an

extremely difficult situation.            He did explain that the formalities

were not quite completed and he did so in a sensitive and caring

manner.


After some -10 or 15 minutes wait, we were shown into a room at the

 side     of    the   gymnasium     and   asked   to   view   some   3i   Polaroid

 photographs which were pinned to a board.                My wife saia "On, my

God, how-can there be so many dead!" he replied                 I m azraid that

 this isn't the end of it, Love".

                                           13
We quickly     identified     the photograph of our youngest daughter
victoria,     but   .itvitially   were   unable   to   see       that   of   Sarah.

Naturally, we hoped at this time she may have been a survivor and

at one of the other Hospitals.           We were asked to look again and

whereupon we found what we beleived to be the photograph of our

elder daughter (Reference Mo 04).           Again the CID Officer in the

brown jacket asked us would we please wait for a few minutes and

would we prefer our daughters bodies to be brought out together or

independently.        My wife and I requested that they bs brought out

together.      This    was   carried out with a reasonable degree                of

sensitivity and formal         identification of our         2   daughters     took

place.    During the identification, my wife cuddled both and noticed

-thst:■Sarafr'^-’irody was still warm - calling out "She's still warm -

    are you sure she's dead I”.     I consolled her but also noticed the

distinct difference between Victoria’s body and Sarah's.
c




After a few minutes to say our farewells to our 2 daughters we were

usherea to a series of tables set up at one end of the gymnasium,

whereupon we were interviewed by, I believe 2 male and                   2   female

Police Officers, and I w a s •asked to swear cut a statement.                   We

also took receipt of the personal effects of Victoria which were

in a white plastic bag from the Hospital.



At the same time, I gave a description of a brown leather jacket

(American Flyer type) that Sarah had been wearing upon entry to the

Ground but was not wearing when I last saw her on the pitch.                 After
4




    some 10      - 15 minutes delay,      (coinciding with      the time    I was

    swearing out tile statement) the jacket was retrieved and returned

    to us.    Upon examination of the pockets, all of Sarah's persoual

    effects, money, cheque book, wallet, cards, bus passed and I.D.

    appeared to be intact.        We therefore took possession of the jacket

    ana signed the necessary forms for the Police Officers.                My wife

    and I were given a cup of tea and the Social Workers escorted us

    from the Mortuary.



    We were given offers of accommodation from various Clergy and the

    2   Social    Workers   but   expressed   a   desire   to   return   home   to

    Middlesex.     A half-hearted promise of a Police driver to drive us

    back was made but I declined and preferred to drive myself.                 My

    wife and I returned home, arriving home at some 2.30 am Sunday

    morning.      Following release at luncn time of the tirst casualty

    list which contained the names of our 2 daughter.-? -vaong 14 others,

    we were inundated with telephone calls and visits from tne Press.

    It is questionable whether full address details should have been

    given in that first casualty list.



    I would summarsize my assessment of what I experienced as follows



    1    The Ground/approach areas policing/stewarding was low key -

          even casual, with little guidance and control being excerted.

    2    There' are a limited number of turnstiles through which to go.

    3    Once through the turnstiles, the only sign visible was above
                                                                                   K-57&A

4    Police/Stewards failedto notice                     the build up in thecentra^.

     . pens.
5    They did not distribute the                   fans to the side areas.

6    Senior Officer ignored                 (and many others) pleas to help those

      in the central pens.
7     It was obvious the Police totally misread evsncs - believing

      a     pitch        invasion/trouble          was    underway     and    mounted       a

      restraining rather than rescue-operation.
8     The rescue commenced some 10                   niinutes too lace end was ^o-slly

         HILLSBOROUGH
         You kindly copied to this office an initial draft of the oral statement which
         might be made by the Home Secretary about the Hillsborough case.
         I have discussed the draft with Dru Sharpling because of the CPS interest. We
         are broadly content. I would suggest an additional point being made at
         paragraph 11 and paragraph 16 onwards needs revision to take account of the
         slightly changed approach to the Terms of Reference. I should mention that
         we have informed the Home Secretary's office that the Attorney General Is
         content with the proposal contained in the Home Secretaiy’s letter of 16 June.
         The Attorney General Is not intending to respond to that letter.
         For convenience. I enclose a retyped version of paragraph 16 onwards with our
         proposed amendments in bold type.

         A copy of this letter goes to Dru Sharpling. I leave copying to Home Office
         colleagues to your discretion.

SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL SENTENCE FOR PARAGRAPH 11:


At the end add:


      "The court also expressed strong doubts as to whether a further inquest,
      if ordered, would result in anything further being learned and observed
      that the process would be a very harrowing one.”
     16. I have not so far received any evidence which would lead me to conclude
     that a new public inquiry should be established. Similarly, the Director of
     Public Prosecutions considers that none of the material which has been made
     available would justify fresh criminal investigations. The Attorney General
     takes the view on the material so far presented to him that an application
     to the High Court for a new inquest would not have any realistic prospect
        succeeding.


     17. However. I want to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked
     and that we do not come to a conclusion without a full and independent
     examination of the evidence.


     18. The Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have
     therefore agreed that there should be an independent scrutiny to ascertain
     whether there now exists any evidence which was not previously available
     relating to the disaster. We are therefore appointing Lord Justice Stuart-
     Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal for that purpose. His full
     terms of reference are:

     19. We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and
     other evidence which has been submitted. He will also consider any further
     material which interested parties wish to submit. There will be an opportunity
     for interested parties to make representations to him if he considers that
     necessary to enable him to form a view. His task will be twofold: first to
     provide me with advice on the basis of his independent consideration of the
     evidence whether any evidence not previously available is of such
     significance as to justify establishment of a further public inquiry. This
     will not itself be a Public Inquiry. However, I undertake to make public the
     advice which he gives. Secondly, he will identify for the Attorney General

  and the DPP any evidence which might be relevant to their decisions
  which has not previously been considered.

  20.      I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively that
  no material evidence has been overlooked in establishing the causes of the
^U saster.

  Mr Robert N. Wareing (Liverpool, West Derby): To ask the Secretary of State
  for the Home Department, what plans he has to reopen the inquiry into the
  Hillsborough disaster; and if he will make a statement.



  DRAFT REPLY (Mr Michael)



  My Rt Hon Friend is considering the representations which have been made calling
 for a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster. He will announce his decision as
 soon as he can.

   BACKGROUND NOTE


   My submission of today’s date (copy attached) sets out the latest position on
   Ministers' consideration of representations about the Hillsborough disaster. No date
   has yet been set for an announcement, and we have undertaken to forewarn
  interested parties before an announcement is made.

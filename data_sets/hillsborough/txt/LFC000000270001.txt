  First Aid, M edical Facilities and Ambulances
     2 29.  T he scale o f available m edical facilities has been the subject o f controversy. After Hillsborough, there
  were com plaints o f insufficient basic eq uipm ent such as stretchers. I repeat what 1 said in my Interim ReDort
  at paragraphs 298 and 2 9 9 :-

            ; *t w° uld be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium, medical facilities capable o f dealing w ith
     a m a |o rd isa stej-su ch as occurred, lo have in ad vance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers other
     eq u ipm en t and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.
                                                                                                       «—     ~~      —



      2 9 9- What is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid, for professional medical attention and for
   ^ m b u l a n c e attenaance, togeiner witn a system o r a T o n f m a t io n with the em ergency services wfrirk w ill
    t-[[in.8 *hCm t0 t!ie !^ene SWlttlY !n whatever num bers are required. What will a m l m t tn
     oasic provision tor the future e g the eq u ipm en t in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice”.

     230.    The Scottish ambulance service has developed a “major incident equipment vehicle” designed and
  equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties. It is packed with 50 stretchers, blankets, and medical supplies and is
  in effect a travelling storehouse for such equipment. A vehicle o f that type is deployed in addition to other
  ambulance attendance at matches with crowds over 25.000. This provision goes a long wav towards meeting the
  criticism raised after Hillsborough and I recommend that it be adopted elsewhere.

      2 3 1 . 1 repeat the Interim Recommendations I made under this heading subject to two variations. First, it has
  b e e n j £ n s i b l y urged that it is u n r e a s o n a b le to r e q u ir e a medical p r a c titi o n e r to be pr esent th ro u g h o u t a match
       m f Uend<5nCe 1S very smalL At such a m a tc h jt is suggested that to have a m edi ca l p r a c titi o n e r on call
  wo u ld be sufficient I agree with this and recommend that the full-time presence of a doctor should not be
  required where there is no reasonable expectation o f more than 2,000 spectators attending

     232. Secondly, so m e clubs have told me that they can secure privat e a m b u l a n c e services more
  ec o n o m ic ally tha n those from the a p p r o p r ia t e a m b u l a n c e authority. T h e y a c c o r d ingly wish to have freedom
J g _c h o o s e . J_m od iify my Interim Recommendation in deference to this argument bT req u T rin e at least oneliTilv
_equipped ambulance from, or approved by, the appropriatejjjnbulance authority should be in attendance at all
  matches with an expected crowd of 5, Ouu or m o n ^ ^ ^                                 *




 First A id , M e d ic a l F a c ilitie s and A m b u l a n c e s
   64. There should be at each sports ground at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.
 The club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

   65. There should be at each designated sports ground one or more first aid rooms. The number o f such rooms
 and the equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking
 professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of every Safety Certificate.

    66. (a) At every match where the number o f spectators is expected to exceed 2,000, the club should employ a
  medical practitioner to be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at the ground. H e should be
  trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off
  and should.remain until half an hour after the end o f the m atch. H is whereabouts should be known to those in
  the police control room and he should be immediately contactable.

         (b) At any match where the number of spectators is not expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make
  arrangements to enable a medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any medical exigency
  at the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. T he arrangements made should be
  known to those in the police control room.

   69.     A “ major incident equipment vehicle”, designed and equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties, should be
 deployed in addition to other ambulance attendance at a match where a crowd in ex cess of 25,000 is expected.

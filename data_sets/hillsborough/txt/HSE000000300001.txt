   grounds; it has been agreed that^responsibility falls to the Home
   Office and to Local Authorities who enforce the 1975 Act.




   What is HSE's primary concern at sports grounds?




   In practice HSE is concerned primarily with the health and safety
   of employees at a sports ground (eg players, ground staff,
   contractors), uaing oootion 2 of -
                                    the IIGW Act. From 1 April 1990,
   Local Authorities will be responsible for enforcing HSW
   legislation at sports grounds.
What has been HSE's involvement with the Taylor Inquiry?




Initially, HSE was asked to provide technical assistance to
Professor Maunder, the Technical Assessor to the Taylor Inquiry.
HSE's scientists and engineers considered the following areas:
turnstiles; gates; barriers; signs; walls; crowd densities and
their measurement; noise levels in the stadium and other more
esoteric aspects such as crowd-flow dynamics.



Following on from the initial stage of the Inquiry, HSE provided a
representative (Dr C Nicholson, Deputy Director RLSD Safety
Engineering Laboratory) on Lord Justice Taylor's technical working
party which reviewed technical aspects of the "Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds" ("the Green Guide"). This has now reported.
HSE will continue to work with the Home Office on the revision of
the "Green Guide".




Will HSE be taking any prosecutions?




No. However, the West Midlands Police Force is considering taking
a prosecution in the light of their investigation into the
Hillsborough tragedy, and will be involving HSE in any discussions
arising.   HSE might also be asked to give technical evidence.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



Did HSE enforce the HSW Act to secure the safety of spectators at
Hillsborough?




The HSW Act covered Hillsborough stadium and could have been used
to set standards for public safety. However, the Health and
Safety Commission and Executive have as a matter of principle
decided that, where specific legislation exists, that legislation
should be enforced in preference to the more general requirements
of the HSW Act. For spectator safety specific legislation exists
in the form of the Safety in Sportsgrounds Act 1975. This sets
detailed standards for the safety of spectators at sport grounds,
and gives Local Authority inspectors powers very similar to those
an HSE inspector would have under the HSW Act. HSE does not,
therefore, generally attempt to enforce the general requirements
under the HSW Act to secure the safety of spectators at sports
grounds; it has been agreed that responsibility falls to the Home
Office and to Local Authorities who enforce the 1975 Act.




What is HSE's primary concern at sports grounds?




In practice HSE is concerned primarily with the health and safety
of employees at a sports ground (eg players, ground staff,
contractors) using section 2 of the HSW Act. From 1 April 1990,
Local Authorities will be responsible for enforcing HSW
legislation at sports grounds.
What has been HSE's involvement with the Taylor Inquiry?




Initially, HSE was asked to provide technical assistance to
Professor Maunder, the Technical Assessor to the Taylor Inquiry.
HSE's scientists and engineers considered the following areas:
turnstiles; gates; barriers; signs; walls; crowd densities and
their measurement; noise levels in the stadium and other more
esoteric aspects such as crowd-flow dynamics.

the "Green Guide".

No. However, the West Midlands Police Force is considering taking

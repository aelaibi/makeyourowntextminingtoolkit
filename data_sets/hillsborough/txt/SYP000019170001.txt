     As o Council Member present ot the gome I om hoppy to submit o personal statement
     os requested by you in your letter of 21st April 1989.  However, 1 con odd little
     to whot is now accepted wisdom.

     I attended with o friend ond initially drove past the Stadium ot 11.45am an my
     way in to drop my wife in the city centre and hove o meal.  I returned to Hillsbarou
     via o service bus (having parked in the centre) arriving ot the ground around 2 . lOp
     I observed no problems nor excessive queues but did not go near the problem end at
     the ground.

     We took our seots in the Directors Box about 20 minutes before kick off and being
     ot the side furthefcst from the Liverpool end merely observed the mare crowded
     terrace thon that nearest us.   From the distance we were awoy our initial
     reaction to the crowd encroachment was one of o problem of possible h o o l i g o m s m .

     My only additional observation would be thot the potential f o r * real affrays in
     the crowd remained for some time after the immediate stoppage because o complete
     lock of goad communication left the majority of the crowd uncertain of the real
     problem ond therefore always likely to blome persons on the pitch (and the latter
     to respond emotionally ond justifiably).  Sensible wards on the tonnay would really
      have helped.

      Beyond this I can make little comment except to say the true nature of the disoster
      was still really unknown to me when I left the ground around 4.40 pm to walk bock
      into Sheffield.

     Dear Mr Kelly,


                                  Re - Hillsborough Disoster of 15th April



     As o Council Member present at the gome I om hoppy to submit a personal statement
     as requested by you in your letter of 21st April 1989.  However, I con add little
     to what is now accepted wisdom.

     1 attended with a friend ond initially drove past the Stadium at ll,45om on my
     way in to drop my wife in the city centre and have a meal.  I returned to Hillsboroi.
     via o service bus (having parked in the centre) arriving at the ground around 2. 10p>-
     I observed no problems nor excessive queues but did not go near the pro blem end of
     the ground.

     We took our seots in the Directors Box about 20 minutes before kick off and being
     at the side furthefcst from the Liverpool end merely observed the mare crowded
     terrace than that neorest us.   From the distance we were away our initial
     reaction to the crowd encroachment was one of a problem of possible hooliganism.

     My only additional observation would be that the potential f O f ^ real affrays in
     the crowd remained far some time after the immediate stoppage because o complete
     lock of Qaad communication left the majority of the crowd uncertain of the real
     problem and therefore always likely to blame persons on the pitch (and the lotter
     to respond emotionally ond justifiably).  Sensible wards on the tannoy would really
     hove helped.

     Beyond this I con make little comment except to say the true nature of the disoster
     was still really unknown to me when I left the ground around 4.40 pm to walk bock
     into Sheffield.

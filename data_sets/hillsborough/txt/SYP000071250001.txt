the    area around                 the    g oal       looked        like      a battlefield,                   there      were

bodies       and        injured          people        on     stretchers.               I was        in a       state       of    shock,

and    could        not       stop       crying.            I j ust         wandered about                not      knowing        what

to    do.      I joined             up w i t h        my    friends          a n d we    walked           over     and      sat    on

the    w all    by       the       players          tunnel.            I could       see      stretchers              being       carried

past    us.         At    about          half       past      four      we    left      the       ground and made                 our

way    home.

On    the    following              Thursday           I returned             to   the       ground        to      pay m y       respects

and    I then           noticed          that       the     floor       slopes       steeply            downwards           in the

tunnel,        <=ind t h a t        a fence           comes       to    the    top      of    the       terraces          halfway

across/ttm^ tunnel.                       It w a s         not    possible         to    see       this        on the       day    due    to
                    \

the    Ammountj of             people          at     the     end      of    the   tunnel.

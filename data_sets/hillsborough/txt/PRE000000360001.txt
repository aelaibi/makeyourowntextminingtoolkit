         Dearcfemas
         I HAVE never seen
         my husband cry. I
         sometimes wonder if
         h e has any em otions
         at ail.
            O ften h e doesn’t seem
         able to te ll ' m e w hen
       ; som ething is w rong and
         som etim es h e can ’t be
         bothered to. I ’m sure
       : th a t it’s n o t good for
         him and it annoys me.

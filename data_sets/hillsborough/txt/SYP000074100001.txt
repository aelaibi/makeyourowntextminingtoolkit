      to be a serious               crush on the            outside      of the     g a t e s / t u r n s t i l e s at that

      end.        The     s i t u a t i o n was    obviousj^r^serious as             I heard him          call    for    the

      dates       to be opened           on thrj^          occasions and he said words                   to the effect

      that     there was a           risk     of     people      being    crushed to death              if they were

      not    opened.           There was          I noticed an u r g e n cy         in his voice.            At this

      point,       as     I was    the      only one with a radio,                 I went      to my officers and

      explained           to them what was             happening.          Due     to the still          large    crowds       I

      deci d e d     that      there was          no way we       could    leave     our       positions and take

     meal      break at 3.0 0            pm       (1500)    as    inst r u c t e d and so we        remained.           Due

      to the       large       crowds and some hot heads amongst, them,                            I made      sure     that

     all     my officers were                 in twos and         in sight        of one another.            I just      had

a feeling            that    trouble was            brewing      e s p ec i al l y with the     problems at

L ep p i n g s   Ln an d due          to the fact          I was     s a t i s fi e d that man y Liverpool

su p p o r t e r s    had got        into    the Hop where           the N o t t i n g h a m Forest     supporters

were.

At 3 . 2 0 pm        (1520)       s up po rt er s     we re shout i ng to us whether             the mat ^h was

a r r iv i ng     into      the    car    gslfrk via P e ni st on e Rd N o r t h .           My officers were

e n ga ge d w it h esforfr^ng a mb ul a nc e s                 from this       point     on until     well     before

     00pm     (1600)        in and       out of the        car    park.

At     this      time we were            c on st an tl y   pestered by some s upporters want in g                       to

know what was               going     off,     some were t hr e at e ni n g           in their manner and               I

de te c te d an a tt it u de             of h os t il i ty towards           the Police,        so much so that

I did s o me th in g          that       1 h a v e n ’t done      before at a football             match,

I s ta r te d to            look for a s ui table              place w here I        could wit h my officers

make     a stand            if some       of the     crowd turned        their       hos ti li ty against          us

into     violence.

Some     of the        comments          from supp or te rs         that     I received amazed me,             I

shall       never      forget        them and are as f ol l ow s s-

1)       "Are        they    dead then?"

2)       "Where        do we get          our fucking          refund f r o m ? ’

3)       "No     cunts       dead,       t h e y ’re saying       that     to get us out".

I was       of the o p in io n whilst                things were         hap pe ni ng    that   there was a

problem wit h            radio       c o mm un ic at io ns as mine went              quite for a time and                   I

was      unable        to get t h ro u gh on it.                 In the      end    I gave   it up as    a bad job

a nd     c ontinued          doing what         I have        des cr ib ed    in the     previous pages.

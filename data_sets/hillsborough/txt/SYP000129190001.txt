and form part of the briefing by police officers before a football
rnatch.    (Paragraph 3-9) ■



2.        The local authority team responsible for issuing safety
certificates in respect of designated grounds should, as heretofore,
include police officers.       (Paragraph 3-15)



Certificating authorities and chief officers of police will be
invited to act upon these recommendations (see also Recommendation 10).




RECOMMENDATIONS


6.    Those managing sports grounds not governed by safety certificates
should give serious consideration, with the assistance of fire authorities,
to the presence in a ground of suitable fire fighting equipment.
(Paragraph 3.5*0


7-        Stewards at all sports grounds should be trained in fire fighting.
(Paragraph 3.55)


8-        In designated grounds it should be a term of the safety certificate
that an adequate first-aid room should be provided.     (Paragraph 3.99)
 10.     Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
 precautions and fire-fighting (see Recommendation 7 above) but should
 also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation.
 (Paragraph 3-10*0


 1*1-   Suitable and adequate exits should be provided in all sports
grounds.   (Paragraph 3.138)

^ •     No smoking should take place in combustible stands, that this

should be prominently displayed, and this should be a condition of
entry to the ground.   (Paragraph 3--!*’
                                       >--)


The relevant sports authorities will be invited to draw the attention
of sports grounds managers to these recommendations, and certificating
authorities will be asked to consider reflecting the recommendations
in new or amended safety certificates as appropriate in the case of
designated grounds.    The fire and police services will be asked to stand
ready to advise on equipment and assist with training as appropriate.




RECOMMENDATION


9.      There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety
Executive and, the fire authorities and local authorities as to how best
to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.
(Paragraph 3-95)


The HSE has appointed a member of its Executive to review liaison
arrangements between its inspectors and the fire authorities.    He will
consult Government Departments and others in this review, the results of
which will be made public.




RECOMMENDATION


16 ■    Fire Authoriti.es should identify and visit all sports stadia in their
areas and should prohibit or restrict the use of any stands which, in their
view, constitute a risk co spectators because of the inadequacy of the fire
precautions. (Paragraph 3.142)
GREEN GUIDE


RECOMMENDATIONS


4.    The Green Guide should be amended to include in Paragraph 11 a
provision that, wherever practicable, roads within a quarter of a
mile of a sports ground should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles.
(Paragraph 3-35)


11.   Paragraph 6.14.6 of the     Green Guide should be amended to read:
"All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used
by the public and be capable of being opened immediately from inside
by anyone in an emergency."     (Paragraph 3.H1)


12.   The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision,
in relation to stewards,


       (i)        that they should be trained and instructed to
       deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
       (see also Recommendations 7 and 10);


       (ii)    that they should be.given written instructions
      about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;


       (iii)      that, they should receive practical instruction
      and training appropriate to their responsibility;


       (iv)    that no one should be employed as a steward
      unless they have been so instructed and trained; and


       (v)        that they should be adequate in number, physically
      and mentally capable of performing their duties, effectively
      deployed, effectively supervised and readily identifiable.
      (Paragraph 3-117)


19.   The next edition of the Green Guide should make it clear
that it applies to all sports grounds.     (Paragraph 3-154)
  Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales were invited by the Home Secretary
  on 16 May to inspect all sports grounds and were reminded of the powers
 available to them to take emergency action if, in their view, fire hazards
 constituting a risk to spectators are revealed.      The Secretary of State
 for Scotland similarly asked Firemasters to inspect sports grounds in Scotland.
 .Reports received show that fire brigades have not hesitated to recommend
 emergency action where necessary, including in a number of cases a prohibition
 on the use of stands or a restrict ion on the number of spectators allowed
 into them.




 R5COMMENDATION


 If -   In order to ensure a complete record of sports grounds a
 local registration system ~houlu be set up.      (Paragraph 3.150)


Consultation will take place with the local authority associations to
establish how such records may best be compiled and maintained.          The
recent visits of the. fire brigades 'see Recommendation 16) should have
in practice marshalled much of the relevant data already.




STRUCTURES


RECOMMENDATION


        Building of r.e-,; permanent stands of oozrroustible materials
should be prohibited as a general rule.      (Paragraph 3.132)


Thj.3 recommendation wil i be given soeedy and urgent consideration
by the departments who are responsible for building regulations.




                                   3
being considered in a Football' League working group: that group's
attention will therefore be drawn to the Inquiry's Recommendation 20.
The governing bodies5 attention will also be d r a w n to Recommendation 23
which might be influenced by decisions upon Recommendation 20.




RECOMMENDATION


21.    Closed circuit television should be introduced at League football
grounds in England and Wales and in the Preenis;: Division in Scotland.
(Paragraph 6.5*0


The Football Trust has allocated £500,000 for the provision of CCTV equipment
in League grounds during the 1935-86 season,      The Trust's attention, and
that of the Football Associations and the Football Leagues, will be drawn
to this recommendation.




MISCELLANEOUS


RECOMMENDATIONS


3-     Early attention should be given by the Home Office Directorate
of Teiecomrnuni.cations to consider the p>-oc: icallt.y o p producing a more
suitable personal radio for the police.     (Ps-agraeh 3-33)


18.    Consideration should be given as how best bo deal with temporary
stands and marquees    (Paragraph 3•151)


24.    Consideration should_be given to the design o f a standard,
efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits,      yParagraph   6.63)


Each of these will be studied as the Inquiry advises.      Recommendations
18 and 24 may best be taken forward in the context of the Inquiry's next
stage and when it turns to examine the Green Guide as a whole.
 These points will be noted fcr inclusion in the next edition of the Green
Guide which will be needed after the Inquiry’s final report is received.
Action will not however depend upon the availability of a fresh edition and
certificating authorities and chief officers of police (Recommendation 4)
will be invited to take such steps as are open to them now.




CROWD MANAGEMENT


RECOMMENDATIONS


5.     Consideration should be given to making it a criminal offence
in England and Wales to have a smoke bomb or similar device at sports
grounds.   (Paragraph 3-42)


22.    There should be a specific offence of throwing a missile at
sports grounds. (Paragraph 6.57)


The case for inviting Parliament to create new criminal offences on
these lines will be studied urgently in connection with the Government's
intention of introducing legislation in the next session of Parliament
following its review of the law relating to public order.




RECOMMENDATIONS


20.    Urgent consideration should be given by football clubs in
England and Wales to introducing membership system so as to exclude
visiting fans.    (Paragraph 6.48)


23-    Football clubs should review their arrangements for entry and
the organisation of their turnstiles.   (Paragraph 6.62)


Both these recommendations are for football authorities and clubs, but the
Government hopes that they will be given serious consideration.    The
Government has been encouraging the Football Association and the Football
League to introduce a scheme of membership cards and the options are currently
PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS


(To be reviewed in the Final Report)


1.      I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should
be given the unfettered right of search before entry to football grounds by
s t a t u t e (Paragraph 3-41)


2.     I am minded      to recommend that Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971
should be amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other
than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional     (Paragraph 3-61)


3-     Linked with the above, I am     minded to recommend that consideration
should be given to introducing legislation giving powers for the Fire Authority
to apply to the High Court,for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for
an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
(Paragraph 3.61)


4.      I am minded     to recommend that Section 10 of the Safety at Sports Grounds
Act 1975 should be amended in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions
Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations 2 and 3) and an application to the
High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for an interdict in
Scotland) should be an alternative remedy.     (Paragraph 3-76)


5.      I am minded to recommend that the Secretary of State should exercise his
powers to designate all sports grounds, whatever their size to include indoor
as well as outdoor activities.     (Paragraph 3.145)


6.     I am minded to recommend immediate designation of any ground
capable of holding over 5,000 spectators, to cover all sports grounds,
not merely football grounds.      (Paragraph 3.146)


7.     I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
providing the police with additional powers of arrest under the
Public Order Act, 1936.     (Paragraph 6.66)


8.     I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse
at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)


These are noted and the Government will stand by to assist the
Inquiry in its further consideration of the matters.

   Dear Sir


   HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 54/1987
   THE SPORTS GROUNDS AND SPORTING EVENTS (DESIGNATION)          (AMENDMENT)
   ORDER 1987


   This circular concerns the Sports Grounds and Sporting Events
   (Designation) (Amendment) Order 1987 which comes into force on
   30 September 1987.  A copy of the Order (SI 1987 No 1520) is
   enclosed.  The Order extends to England and Wales only.

   2.    The Sports Grounds and  Sporting Events  (Designation)Order
   1985 (SI 1985 No 1151) set out those matches designated for the
   purposes of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act
   1985.   Home Office Circular No 59/1985 refers.   Paragraph 3 of
   Part I of Schedule 2 to that Order incompletely describes two of
   the three international competitions as the "European Cup" and
   the "Cup Winners' Cup".    The full formal titles of these
   competitions are the "European Champion Clubs' Cup" and the
   "European Cup Winners' Cup".    The full titles were included in
   Article 3 of the recent Public Order (Football Ewiusion) Order
   1987 (SI 1987 No 853).

   3.   The Sports Grounds and  Sporting events (Designation)
   (Amendment) Order 1987 corrects the titles in the earlier order
   to ensure that confusion does not arise over the same matches
   being described in different terms under different legislation.
   The amendment is solely one of terminology and will have no
   effect on the operation of the legislation.
4.    Any enquiries about this circular should be addressed to

        IMPLEMENTATION OF PART II (SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS)         SECTION 25

        INSPECTIONS UNDER SECTION 10B OF THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT
        1975



        Introduction

        Further to HOC/71/87 giving advice about the effects of changes
        brought about by implementation of Part II of the Fire Safety and
        Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act) this circular
        introduces Statutory Guidance given by the Secretary of State on
        inspections of designated sports grounds under section 10B of the
        Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) as inserted by
        section 25 of the 1987 Act.
        General
        The Statutory Guidance, drawn up following consultation with the
        local authority associations, has effect in respect of any
        inspection carried out under section 10B of the 1975 Act after 1
        January 1988 when, by virtue of the Commencement Number 1 order,
        Part II of the 1987 Act comes into effect.
        Local authorities should bear in mind the mandatory nature of the
        Statutory Guidance on inspections carried out under section 10B
        of the 1975 Act whereas the supplementary, explanatory memorandum
        enclosed with the Statutory Guidance is not binding.
Resource Implications

Whilst it is not intended to restrict the time local authorities
may feel should be devoted to this task, inspections under
section 10B (when taken with existing commitments to inspect
designated sports grounds) should not result in significant
resource implications. The scope of inspections under paragraphs
3 and 4 of the Statutory Guidance, together with associated
report work, are not intended to be as detailed or extensive as
that often required of the holder of a safety certificate, or
that which may sometimes be necessary prior to the issue of a
safety certificate. In general, inspections are not expected to
take more than about 2 man days per ground on average.
To assist local authorities prepare a report and record of
inspections a suggested basic format which can be adapted
according to preference is enclosed at Annex A.
Supplementary
Any enquiries about th^g           ^     a+»+"pory Guidance
should be directed to
                                        Yours faithfully

STATUTORY GUIDANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES ON INSPECTIONS TO BE
CARRIED OUT UNDER SECTION 10B OF THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT
1975


The following guidance is given by the Secretary of State in
pursuance of section 10B(2) of the Safety of Sports Ground Act
1975 (as inserted by section 25(1) of the Fire Safety and Safety
of Places of Sport Act 1987).


General
1.   The local authority should be satisfied that inspections
under this guidance are carried out by a person or persons
qualified for that purpose.
Scope of inspection
2.    Inspection of the ground should, where practicable, include
inspection of the following certificates of testing and records
as required under the terns and conditions of the safety
certificate to be kept by the holder and/or submitted to the
local authority.
(a)   any certificate covering testing of
(i) strength/loading tests carried out on crush barriers, guard
rails, hand rails, balustrading, walls or fences;
(ii) strength, stability of buildings or other structures;
(iii) inspections and condition of electrical installations.

(b)   records of the following:-
(i)   spectator attendances;
(ii) accidents involving spectators;

(iii) maintenance and other inspections of buildings, components
     and installations, together with identified deficiencies and
     recorded remedial measures taken;
(iv) tests and checks on emergency lighting, public address
     system, fire fighting equipment, fire warning system (if
     installed);
(v)   emergency evacuation procedures and steward training
      sessions.
3.   The inspection of the ground should normally include
inspection of the following items:-
(a) any part of the ground where an accident or incident
resulting in serious injury to spectators has occurred since the
last inspection;

(b) any recorded defect or deficiency which has arisen since the
last inspection and which, in the opinion of the inspecting
officer would be likely to lead to an accident which could result
in serious injury to spectators;
(c) major remedial work carried out since the date of the last
inspection to ascertain that it has been satisfactorily carried
out;
(d) all public stairways for their general condition, slip
resistance, condition of hand-rails (see also (j) below), trip
hazards especially at the head of stairways, adequacy of lighting
and structural fire separation;
(e) all egress routes used by the public, including emergency
exit routes, for obstructions, operation of exit gates, adequacy
of sign-posting and lighting, presence of any uncleared litter;
(f) fire fighting equipment and fire warning system (if
installed);
(g)   for the presence of any accumulation of litter,
(h) the emergency lighting system including any generator or
batteries
(i)   first-aid facilities and equipment;
(j) 10% of any crush barriers, balustrading and hand-rails for
overt signs of weakness which might signal the need for further
testing, remedial action or (additional) restriction on the
number of spectators allowed to occupy that part of the ground;
(k) 10% of the terraces or viewing slopes for general surface
condition, even-ness and slip resistance;
(1)   anchorage and fastening of 10% of any fixed seating.

(m)   any provision for the disabled.
Where the inspection of a sample as in paragraphs (j), (k) and
(1) reveals matters giving rise to serious concern for the safety
of spectators, the authority should go on to inspect all the
crush barriers etc, terracing or seating in that part of the
ground where the sample indicated that there were deficiencies.

Testing of equipment
4.   Tests should if possible be carried out to confirm that the
following is in working order:-
(a)   lighting, particularly on stairways and exit routes;
(b)   emergency lighting;

(c) public address system, including the proper functioning of
zoning where this facility is part of the requirements of the
safety certificate;
(d)   fire warning system (if installed);

(e) 10% of any metering system for recording the admission of
spectators to parts of the ground.




Home Office
25 November 1987
Supplementary advica and explanatory notes to the Statutory
Guidance to local authorities given by the Secretary of State
under section 10B(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Introduction
1.   The following advice does not form part of the Statutory
Guidance given under section 10B of the 1975 Act. The following
advice is given in good faith but it should be remembered that
only the courts can rule authoritatively on interpretation of
points of law.
Objective of Inspections
2.   The object of the inspections is to monitor the suitability
of the terms and conditions of the safety certificate (where
issued) in the light of any change in the condition of the ground
and secondly, to assist local authorities in enforcing compliance
with the terms and conditions of the safety certificate or other
notice served on the ground occupier.
3.   Local authorities may wish to note that the inspection is
not intended to shift responsibility for spectator safety away
from the holder of any safety certificate or ground occupier, but
rather to help see that he succeeds in achieving (and
maintaining) the safety standards intended to be set by any
certificate for the number of spectators authorised to enter the
ground for a specified activity.

General
4.   As the size, age, configuration, condition and usage of
designated sports grounds as well as the attitude of management
can give rise to different inspection needs, the discretion of
local authorities to carry out more frequent or more extensive
inspections than is laid down by section 10B of the 1975 Act is
not restricted. The requirements of the Statutory Guidance have
been set at what is seen as the desired minimum likely to achieve
the objective described above leaving authorities free to add to
the content of the inspections or increase their frequency
according to locally determined needs. In this context local
authorities may wish to bear in mind that inspections carried out
under section 10B of the 1975 Act are in addition to, not a
substitute for those required to be carried out under the terms
and conditions of the safety certificate by or on behalf of the
holder.
Inspection frequency
5.   As section 10B(3) of the 1975 Act stipulates that an
inspection should take place of a "designated" ground at least
once every twelve months, this frequency must be observed even if
the issue of a safety certificate is delayed. Where a safety
certificate has not been issued, the inspections carried out
prior to its preparation and issue should be such as to fulfil
the requirements of the Statutory Guidance. Once a safety
certificate has been issued at least one further inspection of
the ground should be carried out either:-
within a year of its issue, or

within a year of the last inspection, whichever is the earlier.
Thereafter, inspections should take place at least annually from
the date of the last inspection.

Where an inspection of a sports ground takes place at the
discretion of the local authority for some other reason, for
example as a result of proposed alterations or an application for
amendment to the safety certificate, that inspection can be
regarded as an inspection carried out under section 10B of the
1975 Act provided the criteria of the Statutory Guidance are met.
Inspection Team
6.   The Statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
section 10B of the 1975 Act and does not stipulate that they
should be carried out by a particular professional discipline.
As it is nonetheless important that inspecting officers are
qualified for that purpose, the guidance places an onus on the
local authority to be satisfied on this account.  (The Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (paragraph 36) envisages that
inspections arranged by ground management will be carried out by
someone who is professionally qualified. Local authorities may
wish to consider whether inspecting officers should also be
professionally qualified.)
7.   Local authorities are also asked to bear in mind the
potential advantages of a team approach to inspections under the
Statutory Guidance and the role of the fire authority, building
authority and the police. Local authorities in London and
metropolitan counties may therefore wish to arrange at least one
inspection per year to be carried out with a representative of
the fire authority in attendance. Elsewhere, local authorities
will no doubt wish to consider inclusion of a member of the fire
service as well as a representative of the building authority.
Local authorities may also wish to consult the Chief Officer of
Police so that the opportunity can be given for a police officer
to attend at least one inspection each year.  (It is not intended
that these considerations should interfere with any internal or
locally agreed arrangements between the local authority, fire
authority, building authority, police and any other agency with
an interest in safety at the ground.)
Scope of Inspections
8.   Where possible all the items listed in paragraphs 3 and 4
of the Statutory Guidance should be inspected and tested. It is
recognised however that there may be occasions when one or more
of these elements cannot, for some reason, be inspected. For
this reason there is a degree of discretion within paragraphs 2 -
 4 of the Statutory Guidance. In this way it is hoped to avoid
the situation where the local authority has to pay repeated
visits to a ground in order to comply with the Statutory
Guidance.

9.   The Statutory Guidance does not require that an inspection
should take place at any particular time so the local authority's
discretion to carry out an inspection whilst the ground is in use
is not restricted. An "in-use" or "during performance"
inspection could therefore constitute part of the inspection
required by section 10B of the Act even though it might not be
sufficient (having regard to the requirements of the Statutory
Guidance) to be an inspection itself.
Records
10. Local authorities will doubtless need to keep a record of
all inspections carried out under the Statutory Guidance and may
wish to consider whether a copy of any report/record should be
sent to the holder of the safety certificate. Local authorities
are also asked to consider affording a reasonable opportunity for
any such report to be made available for inspection, if so
requested, by members of the public.

       Dear Sir,
       HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 71/1987
       FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987:-
       IMPLEMENTATION OF PART II (SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS)
        Introduction
        1.    As foreshadowed by HOC No 42/1987 the Secretary of State has
        now made a commencement order under section 50(2) of the Fire
        Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act)
        bringing in Part II of the 1987 Act with effect from 1 January
        1988.
        2.   This circular, together with Annex A, introduces the
        provisions of Part II of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the
        effects and operation of them. Advice on those provisions of
        Part I of the 1987 Act (fire safety) which are to be brought into
        force by the first commencement order is the subject of Fire
        Precautions Act Circular, 14/1987.
                                    *


        Implementation of Part II (Safety of Sports Grounds)
        3.   Part II of the 1987 Act, consisting of sections 19 - 25,
        amends the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) in
        line with the Government's proposals contained in the
        Consultative Document published in June 1986 in response to the
        safety recommendations of the Popplewell Inquiry set up following
        the fire tragedy at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985. The main
        changes effected by Part II are as follows.-
        Section 19:- removes the distinction between sports Mground" and
        sports "stadium" with consequential modifications to section 2(2)
        of the 1975 Act dealing with the contents of safety certificates.

        Section 20:- empowers the Secretary of State to vary the
        designation threshold of 10,000 under section 1 of the 1975 Act.
Section 21:- precludes conditions in safety certificates
relating to police presence unless the extent of the presence is
reserved for the Chief Officer of Police.

Section 22:-   directs appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act to
the courts.
Sections 23 and 24:- replaces the existing emergency procedure
under section 10 by introducing prohibition notices in the case
of serious risks to spectators; and provision to appeal against
them.
Section 25:- places a duty on local authorities to enforce the
1975 Act and to arrange for annual inspections of designated
sports grounds in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of
State.
4.   Annexes A and B to Home Office circular Ho 7/1986 which
gives advice on the 1975 Act should be noted as necessary and
cross referenced to this circular. Particular attention is drawn
to the latest guidance on the new procedure for the issue of
prohibition notices to deal with serious risks to spectators.
Local authorities are asked to copy all such notices to the Home
Office for information until further notice. To assist local
authorities to draw up a prohibition notice a suggested format is
reproduced at Annex B to this circular.
Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1997
5.   A copy of the revised regulations is also enclosed with this
circular. The regulations reflect the changes brought about by
sections 22 and 24 of the 1987 Act and lay down time limits for
appeals. Provisions on procedures for applications for safety
certificates, their issue, amendment, transfer and replacement
are incorporated in the regulations which also authorise the
determination of fees to be charged in respect of applications
for the issue, amendment, transfer and replacement of safety
certificates.

Transitional
6.   Under the provisions of Schedule 5 of the 1987 Act any
existing court order made under section 10 of the 1975 Act
remains in force. Similarly any appeal lodged prior to 1 January
1988 and still extant on that date will remain subject to the
appeal procedures of the Safety of SportR Grounds Regulations
1976 (SI 1976/1263).

Resource and manpower implications
7.   The contents of this circular do not result in any cost or
manpower implications other than those arising from the
inspections to be carried out on designated sports grounds under
section 10B(1) as introduced by section 25 of the 1987 Act.
Circulation of Statutory Guidance under section 10B(2) of the
1975 Act on these inspections together with any supplementary
advice is being done separately and will cover, as necessary, any
resource implications arising therefrom.


Supplementary
8.   The information and advice in this circular and in Annex A
on the 1987 Act are given in good faith but it should be
understood that ultimately only the courts can rule
authoritatively on points of law.
9.   Any enquiries about the contents of this circular should be
directed to Mr

                                          Yours faithfully

ANNEX A TO HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 71/1987
FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987
Advice note by the Home Office on Part II of The Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (The 1987 Act) amending The
Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 (The 1975 Act)
Introduction
1.   The general background to the 1975 Act together with a
summary of local authority powers and functions under that Act,
and procedures for the issue of safety certificates is set out in
Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986 issued 7 February
1986 (taken from earlier Home Office circulars 150/1975, 130/1976
and 187/1976). This guidance should therefore be read in
conjunction with Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986
which will need to be cross-referenced.
2.   The Popplewell Inquiry set up after the fire tragedy at
Valley Parade concluded that the 1975 Act had worked
satisfactorily at designated grounds but recommended changes to
improve its operation. The Government's response was contained
in a consultative document published in June 1986. Parts II and
III of the 1987 Act implement these proposals and introduction of
Part II as from 1 January 1988 is the first phase of this
implementation.
3.   The main mechanism for securing safety at sports grounds
remains the safety certificate. Guidance on safety standards is
contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The Green
Guide) revised in October 1986. Local authorities are reminded
of the advice contained in paragraph 5 of Annex B to Home Office
Circular 7/1986 highlighting the need to maintain flexibility in
order to take account of the different circumstances at
individual grounds.
SUBSTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS EFFECTED BY PART II OF THE 1987 ACT
Section 19: Application of the 1975 Act to all sports grounds
4.   Section 19, together with the textual amendments of Schedule
2 to the 1987 Act removes the distinction in the 1975 Act between
a sports "ground" and a sports "stadium". As amended the
provisions of the 1975 Act apply to all sports grounds as defined
in section 17(1) of that Act. The Secretary of State may thus
designate any category of sports groind without first having to
make an order extending the provisions of the Act to that
particular class of ground.
5.   In consequence of this wider power, section 2 of the 1975
Act (originally formulated with "stadia" in mind, particularly
football stadia) has also had to be amended, by section 19 (2) of
the 1987 Act, so that safety certificates are no longer required
to contain certain obligatory terms and conditions. The
Secretary of State is however empowered to stipulate by order the
contents of a safety certificate for any class of sports ground.
In this way those grounds of a particular type, or grounds used
for a particular sport need not be subject to requirements which
would be inappropriate to them.
6.    As there are no present plans to extend designation to other
classes of sports ground it is not envisaged that an order under
this new power will be necessary. The discretion given to local
authorities under section 2(1) of the 1975 Act means that with
the possible exception of clauses in safety certificates relating
to police presence (see paragraph 9 below) the contents of safety
certificates will not automatically require amendment as a result
of the removal of the obligatory terms of section 2 of the 1975
Act. Safety certificates should continue to specify maximum
spectators; include terms and conditions as to size, situation
of entrances/exits to and from the ground and parts of it
 (including means of escape in the case of fire or other
emergency) plus means of access to any such entrances and exits;
terms and conditions should continue to require those entrances,
exits and means of access to be properly maintained and kept free
from obstruction; and terms and conditions should continue to
deal with the number, strength and situation of any crush
barriers.
7.   Section 19(2) also widens the regulation powers given to
the Secretary of State by insertion of a new subsection (1A) to
section 18 of the 1975 Act thereby enabling regulations to make
different provision for different classes of sports grounds.
Section 20:   Designation of grounds - variation in qualifying
              spectator capacity
8.   Section 20 inserts subsections (1A) and (IB) in section 1 of
the 1975 Act to give the Secretary of State power to vary by
order the numerical threshold above which grounds may be
designated as requiring a safety certificate. The threshold is
at present set at 10,000 by the Act.

Section 21;   Safety certificates - police presence
9.    Section 21 adds subsection (2A) to section 2 of the 1975
Act.   Where the local authorityincludes in a safety certificate
a provision which requires the presence of the police, the
subsection requires that determination of their number is to be
left to the Chief Officer of Police. This is already the usual
if not invariable practice and this provision does no more than
give statutory force to existing arrangements. Safety
certificate conditions which do noc comply with this provision
will however be void and local authorities are advised to ensure
that any such conditions comply with the new provisions.

Section 22:   Safety certificates - appeals
10.   Section 22 of the 1987 Act directs appeals under section 5
of the 1975 Act to the courts instead of to the Secretary of
State as hitherto. Such an appeal is to the Magistrates Court by
way of making a complaint (new subsection (3A) v* section 5).
There is also provision for an appeal to the CroT' Court against
an order made by a Magistrates Court on determining a complaint.
Such an appeal may be made by the local authority or by any
"interested party" as defined in section 5 of the 1975 Act.
11. Subsections (4), (6), (7) and (8) of section 5 are repealed
in consequence of the removal of the Secretary of State's
functions in respect of appeals. However the Secretary of State
is given the power to prescribe by regulation the time within
which appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act are to be brought.
These regulations will also come into effect as from 1 January
1988. There is however transitional provision contained in
paragraph 6 of Schedule 5 to the 1987 Act to preserve the
existing appeal procedures/powers in respect of appeals made to
the Secretary of State before 1 January 1988 and which are still
extant on that date.
12. Section 22(8) of the 1987 Act makes a number of
consequential amendments to section 7 of the 1975 Act
(determinations and appeals/supplementary). Subsection (8)(a)
amends section 7(1) of the 1975 Act so that it provides for an
application to be deemed to be withdrawn if the local authority
serve a notice under section 5(1) that an applicant is not
qualified for the issue of a certificate, once the time limit for
an appeal has expired. It also removes from the 1975 Act section
7(1)(b) which misleadingly implies that the local authority can
determine without an application having been made that an
existing holder of a safety certificate no longer qualifies to
hold it.   Subsection (8)(b) amends section 7(2) to make
provision to suspend the effect of the local authority decision
that an applicant is not a qualified person if an appeal is made
in the prescribed time limits. This suspension has effect until
the appeal is either withdrawn or determined by the court in
favour of the authority. Subsection 8(c) amends section 7(3) of
the 1975 Act and subsection (8)(d) repeals the provision in
section 7 of the 1975 Act by which a court could, on the
application of the local authority, give immediate effect to a
term or condition of a safety certificate which had been
suspended as a result of an appeal.
Section 23: Special procedure in case of serious risk -
prohibition notices: and
Section 24: Prohibition Notices: appeals
13. Section 23 of the 1987 Act replaces the existing section 10
of the 1975 Act with provision for a system of prohibition
notices. Section 24 of the 1987 Act provides for appeals against
a prohibition notice.
14. A prohibition notice may be served in respect of any sports
ground as defined in section 17(1) of the 1975 Act or part of
such a sports ground. The criteria for issuing a prohibition
notice are set out in the new section 10(1) and local authorities
should not feel inhibited from using the new powers when
necessary. These powers are nonetheless potentially far reaching
(see also paragraph 20 below) and local authorities are therefore
asked to ensure that they are used with due discretion. In
practice, the considerations leading to the issuing of a
prohibition notice are likely to be comparable to those which now
an order made by a Magistrates Court on determining a complaint.
Such an appeal may be made by the local authority or by any
"interested party" as defined in section 5 of the 1975 Act.
11. Subsections (4), (6), (7) and (8) of section 5 are repealed
in consequence of the removal of the Secretary of State's
functions in respect of appeals. However the Secretary of State
is given the power to prescribe by regulation the time within
which appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act are to be brought.
These regulations will also come into effect as from 1 January
1988. There is however transitional provision contained in
paragraph 6 of Schedule 5 to the 1987 Act to preserve the
existing appeal procedures/powers in respect of appeals made to
the Secretary of State before 1 January 1988 and which are still
extant on that date.
12. Section 22(8) of the 1987 Act makes a number of
consequential amendments to section 7 of the 1975 Act
(determinations and appeals/supplementary). Subsection (8)(a)
amends section 7(1) of the 1975 Act so that it provides for an
application to be deemed to be withdrawn if the local authority
serve a notice under section 5(1) that an applicant is not
qualified for the issue of a certificate, once the time limit for
an appeal has expired. It also removes from the 1975 Act section
7(1)(b) which misleadingly implies that the local authority can
determine without an application having been made that an
existing holder of a safety certificate no longer qualifies to
hold it.   Subsection (8)(b) amends section 7(2) to make
provision to suspend the effect of the local authority decision
that an applicant is not a qualified person if an appeal is made
in the prescribed time limits. This suspension has effect until
the appeal is either withdrawn or determined by the court in
favour of the authority. Subsection 8(c) amends section 7(3) of
the 1975 Act and subsection (8)(d) repeals the provision in
section 7 of the 1975 Act by which a court could, on the
application of the local authority, give immediate effect to a
term or condition of a safety certificate which had been
suspended as a result of an appeal.
Section 23: Special procedure in case of serious risk -
prohibition notices: and
Section 24: Prohibition Notices: appeals
13. Section 23 of the 1987 Act replaces the existing section 10
of the 1975 Act with provision for a system of prohibition
notices. Section 24 of the 1987 Act provides for appeals against
a prohibition notice.
14. A prohibition notice may be served in respect of any sports
ground as defined in section 17(1) of the 1975 Act or part of
such a sports ground. The criteria for issuing a prohibition
notice are set out in the new section 10(1) and local authorities
should not feel inhibited from using the new powers when
necessary. These powers are nonetheless potentially far reaching
(see also paragraph 20 below) and local authorities are therefore
asked to ensure that they are used with due discretion. In
practice, the considerations leading to the issuing of a
prohibition notice are likely to be comparable to those which now
suspend the operation of the notice or of any amendment to it
(section 10A(6)) so, particularly if the notice is to apply to a
'•one-off11 fixture, it is important that it is served, wherever
possible, well in advance so as to enable the recipient to
exercise effectively his right of appeal. The appeal procedure
is by way of complaint to a Magistrates Court. On appeal the
court may cancel the notice or affirm the notice, either in its
original form or as amended, or with such modifications as the
court thinks fit. There is provision for a further right of
appeal to the Crown Court against the decision of the Magistrates
Court. Persons entitled to make such an appeal are listed in new
section 10A(7). "An aggrieved person" referred to in sub-section
(7)(a) is defined in sub-section (9).

Section 25:   Enforcement : Inspections and offence of obstruction
21. Section 25(1) of the 1987 Act adds a new section 10B to the
1975 Act which provides for local authorities to enforce the
Act's provisions and, for that purpose, to arrange for the
inspection of designated grounds at least once every twelve
months in accordance with any guidance from the Secretary of
State.

22. Section 25(2) updates section 12(6)(d) of the 1975 Act by
amending the term "wilfully" to "intentionally".

NOTES
Offences

1.    Contravention of any prohibition notice or restriction
imposed by a prohibition notice is an offence provided by section
12(1)(e) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act)
as amended by the Fire safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987 (the 1987 Act) and renders the offender liable, on summary
conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum
(currently £2,000) or, on conviction on indictment, to an
unlimited fine, or imprisonment for not more than two years, or
both.
2.   Where any person is charged with an offence under section
12(1)(e) of the 1975 Act it shall be a defence to prove
(a)     that the admission of spectators in contravention of the
        notice was without his consent; and
(b)     that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all
        due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence by
        himself or any other person under his control.
3.   Section 12(7) of the 1975 Act provides that where an offence
under that Act which has been committed by a body corporate is
proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of,
or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, a director,
manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body
corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such
capacity, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be guilty of
that offence and be liable to be proceeded against and punished
accordingly.
4.   Where the affairs of a body corporate are managed by its
members, section 12(7) of the 1975 Act shall apply in relation to
the acts, and defaults of a member in connection with his
functions of management as if he were a director of the body
corporate.
5.   The validity of a prohibition notice served on any person
shall not be affected by a failure to serve another person
required to be served with such a notice.


Appeals
6.    Your attention is drawn to the provision for appeal to a
magistrates' court against this notice in section 10A of the 1975
Act as inserted by the 1987 Act.
Regulations made under section 10A(1) of the 1975 Act stipulate
that a person on whom a prohibition notice is served may appeal
to the court within 21 days after the day on which the notice is
served on him.
Where an appeal is brought under this section against a
prohibition notice or an amendment of it, the bringing of the
appeal does not have the effect of suspending the operation of
the notice.

Dear Sir

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 37/1985
FOOTBALL SAFETY AND CROWD CONTROL



Following the events at Bradford and Birmingham on Saturday 11 May
the Home Secretary made a statement to the House of Commons on

announced that he was asking Chief Fire Officers to visit uncertificated

 SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS : REVISED EDITION OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY AT
                            SPORTS GROUNDS

 Introduction

 1.   This circular introduces the revised edition of the Guide to Safety at Sports
 Grounds (the "Green Guide") a copy of which is enclosed for all recipients.

 2.   As stated in paragraph 9 of Home Office circular 5/1986 the revised edition
 of the Green Guide has been drawn up primarily in the light of both the Interim and
 Final Reports of the Popplewell Inquiry, although, where practicable additions have
 been made to take account of comments from elsewhere. The Guide remains a voluntary
 code and is intended to be applied flexibly to take account of the individual
 circumstances and needs of particular grounds.

 Content and Main Changes of the Guide

 3.   Although the format and structure of the new Guide have been changed in an
 attempt to facilitate reading, this revised edition continues to rely heavily on the
 technical material of the previous Guide, the substantive advice of which was
 acknowledged by the Popplewell Inquiry to have stood up well to detailed scrutiny.
 The new Guide is therefore still orientated towards 'football-type' stadia but,
 unlike its predecessor, it is made clear that it also applies to sports grounds used
 for other sports.

  4.   The main changes in the new Guide are that greater emphasis is placed throughout
  the latest edition on management responsibility to which a new chapter is devoted
  (Chapter 2) and there is a further additional chapter on stewarding (Chapter 13)•
  The advice on fire safety has been expanded and amendments made to chapter 14 on
  crowd control. General advice on temporary stands is offered in Chapter 10.

  Distribution

  5.    The Guide has been issued to the main representative sporting organisations and
  to all sports grounds designated under Section 1 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
  1975-
E.R.


 Supplementary

 6.   An additional copy of this circular and Green Guide are enclosed, where
 appropriate, for the Chief Fire Officer.

 7.   Further copies of the Guide axe available from HMSO, HMSO Bookshops and HMSO
 Accredited Agents as from 31 October 1986.

 8.    Any enquiries about the contents of this circular should be directed to:

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 7/1986

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975:                 LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 1985

Introduction

1.  HOC 54/85 and 5/1986 were copied to Chief Executives of
Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
forthcoming transfer to them of responsibility in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London for the administration of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA).  The purpose of this circular is to
advise successor authorities of the changes to the SSGA brought
about by the Local Government Act 1985 (LGA) and to give guidance
on discharging these responsibilities.  It is not intended to affect
any internal or locally agreed arrangements which may be in train to
ensure that all those who have an interest in securing safety at
sports grounds are fully consulted.

SSGA      1975

2.  The SSGA gave effect to the main recommendations contained in
the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which
was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious accident at
Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971.

3.      The main provisions of the Act are:

        a.  A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to
        designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
        10,000 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will require
        a safety certificate from the local authority.

        b.  An obligation on the local authority to issue such
        certificates.
E.R
             c.  A discretion for the local authority to set terras
             and conditions under the certificate with the object
             of securing a reasonable degree of safety for spectators.
             Safety certificates are of 2 kinds - firstly, the general
             safety certificate (the main form of control) and,
             secondly, the special safety certificate (for occasions
             or activities not covered by the general Certificate).

             d.  A right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in
             relation to the issue of safety certificates and their
             contents, the procedure for which is set out in
             regulations made under s .6(1) of the Act.

             e.  Rights of various interested bodies (police, building
             authorities or, in the Metropolitan county areas after
             "abolition", fire authorities) to consultation, access to
             grounds and information and to the appeals procedure.

             f.  An emergency procedure for   restricting the admission
             of spectators to a wider range   of sports grounds than
             those to which the designation   provisions apply, if the
             risk to spectators is seen (by   the courts) as justifying
             this.

             g.  Powers of entry and inspection to sports grounds;
             and prescribed penalties for offences under the Act.

      A sports ground is, broadly speaking, any place where sports or
      other competitive activities take place in the open air and where
      accommodation has been provided for spectators.     A sports stadium is
      a sports ground where   accommodation for spectators wholly or
      substantially surrounds the area used for the activities taking
      place therein.

      LGA 1985

      4.  The combined effect of s . 16 and Schedule 8 paragraph 7 of the
      LGA is to transfer to Metropolitan District Councils and London
      Boroughs the functions, duties and powers as the local authority
      responsible for administering the SSGA in place of the Metropolitan
      County Councils and Greater London Council.    A summary check list of
      these responsibilities is contained at Annex A for ease of reference.

      5.  Paragraph 7(3) of   Schedule 8 of the LGA redefines "local
      authority" in England   and Wales for the purposes of the SSGA as
      meaning:

             a.  in Greater London, the London Borough Council or
             the Common Council of the City of London;

             b.  in England, in the Metropolitan counties,   the
             district council;

             c.  in England outside Greater London and the
             Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the county council

      6.  In order to avoid any anomaly or duplication arising out of the
      Metropolitan District Councils' and London Boroughs' responsibilities
E.k.
   as "Building Authority", paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 8 of the LGA
   redefines, for the purposes of the SSGA, "building authority" in
   England and Wales as meaning:

             a.  in England, outside Greater London, and the
             Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the district
             council.

   The effect of this, together with amendments to Sections 3(3), 4(7)
   and (8), 5(5), 10(4) and 11 of the SSGA resulting from paragraph 7(1)
   of Schedule 8 of the LGA, is that in Metropolitan counties and
   Greater London, where the "building authority" and "local authority"
   are synonymous, the local authority is not required to refer safety
   certificate applications to the building authority or consult it
   about the terms and conditions of a certificate.  Similarly the
   building authority in these areas does not have the status of
   "interested party" and has no need of the right to authorise entry
   and inspection of a sports ground because these powers are vested in
   it as the local authority.

   7.  An additional change brought about by paragraph 7(1) affects the
   role and status of the Fire Authority in Greater London and the
   Metropolitan counties.  The converse of paragraph 6 applies in
   respect of the Fire Authority which, from 1 April 1986, has the status
   of "interested party" in Metropolitan counties and Greater London.
   In these areas the local authority is required to refer safety
   certificate applications to the Fire Authority and consult it about
   the terms and conditions of a safety certificate; and the Fire
   Authority will have the right to authorise entry and inspection of
   a sports ground.  The reason for these changes is that the newly
   constituted fire authorities will not (as in the past) be the same
   as the local authority.

       Transitional Arrangements

   8.   Under article 2 of the Local Government Reorganisation (Transitiona'
   Provisions) Order 1985 (SI 1985 No 1781), London Borough Councils and
   Metropolitan District Councils will acquire certain anticipatory powers
   including powers in respect of safety certificates for sports grounds.
   The provisions of SI 1985/1781 were explained in DOE circular LGA(L)
   (DOE) 13/LGA(MC)(DOE)16 of 26 November 1985.   The Secretary of State
   takes the view that Metropolitan County Councils and the GLC are not
   empowered to issue new safety certificates or amend existing safety
   certificates to take effect on or after 1 April 1986: SI 1985/1 78 1
   therefore allows successor authorities to consider, before 1 April,
   applications for certificates to come into effect on or after 1 April.
   Successor authorities will therefore wish to ensure that they are kept
   informed of the progress of safety certificate applications or amend­
   ments to existing certificates now under consideration by the Metro­
   politan County Councils or GLC. Much of this information will auto­
   matically have come to successor authorities in their present role as
   building authorities but they may nonetheless wish to establish
   early contact with the current 'certificating' authority to ensure a
   smooth transfer of responsibility from 1 April 1986 without impairing
   the safety cover afforded by the certification process. In this
   context successor authorities will no doubt wish to bear in mind
   that applications for special safety certificates for events on or
   after 1 April 1986 may require advance consideration if a certificate
   is to be issued in time. Similarly, successor authorities will doubtless
   wish to be acquainted with any other action or initiatives currently
   in hand by the present certificating authority in respect of sports
   grounds m   their area.
Guidance to the SSGA procedures

9.  A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument
1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular.   A detailed description
of the Act and its provisions is contained at Annex B.  The Regu­
lations set out the procedures and time limits associated with
safety certificate applications and appeals.   These same regulations
also empower local authorities to determine fees in respect of
applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates. A
guide to the procedure for the issue of a general safety certificate
is at Annex C.  Similarly, the procedure for the issue of a special
safety certificate is at Annex D.

10.  The following points are highlighted as being of particular
potential interest to local authorities:

    a.  Procedure under s . 10. Paragraph 21 of Annex B refers.
    Authorities may wish to note that this procedure can be
    applied to all sports grounds within the meaning of the Act,
    not just to stadia.   It is hoped that authorities will not
    feel inhibited from invoking the procedure, as necessary,
    where they perceive the risks to be such that urgent action
    is required to provide reasonable safety for spectators.

    b.  The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (The
    Green Guide).  Attention is drawn to paragraphs 5 and 6 of
    Annex B and paragraph 3 of Annex C.  Authorities will no
    doubt bear in mind the contents of paragraph 4 of HOC 54/1985
    dealing with action on the Interim Report of the Inquiry
    contains additional recommendations on the content and
    structuring of the Green Guide which will be revised as soon
    as possible.  In the meantime the existing guide, a copy of
    which is enclosed, may be used until such time as the revised
    version is available.

Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds

11.  The Final Report of Mr Justice Popplewell's Committee of Inquiry
into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds was published on
16 January 1986 (Command 9710).  A separate Home Office circular,
number 5/1986, was sent to local authorities - including Metropolitan
District Councils and London Borough Councils - on 20 January 1986,
giving details of the Government's response to the safety recommend­
ations contained in the Report, and next steps.

Other

12.  A list of designated stadia for England and Wales is attached at
Annex E.  Management of those stadia in Metropolitan counties and
Greater London have been informed of the change in responsibility for
administration of the SSGA and have been advised to copy applications
for special safety certificates or amendments to existing general
certificates to successor authorities (see Annex F).

13. This circular is copied to Chief Executives of County Councils,
 Secretaries of the successor authority coordinating committees, and
 to Chief Fire Officers for information.  Paragraph 10 is of
 particular relevance.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Background

Wheatley Report

1.   The terms of the Inquiry extended to sports grounds generally but because the
immediate concern at the time related to soccer grounds, its Report concentrated
on crowd safety in such grounds, and included Rugby Union and Rugby League grounds.
Lord Wheatley had no doubt, that the then existing controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate.    He found that the voluntary system of certifi­
cation of grounds introduced by the Football Association some years previously laid
down no requirements as to the competence of persons who carried out the annual
inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines to assist those persons in
their assessment of safety standards.    Moreover, a review of the statutory provisions
relevant to the safety of spectators at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley
that the law also fell short of providing proper and effective control over
football grounds as a whole.     The building regulations, for example, provide for
the basic structural safety of new buildings within a football ground but they do
                                                                not apply to existing
buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor do they apply to a
ground as a whole.   In any case, most football grounds were built before national
building regulations were introduced.


2.   Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme could
ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests of safety and he
recommended a statutory licensing system.    He proposed that these controls should
be introduced by stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly speaking,
being dealt with first.   Lord Wheatley also recommended that there should be a
right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision of the licensing
authority.   The Report showed Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile
the paramount aim of ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonable
and practicable for the clubs.


3-   Lord Wheatley also provided, as a technical appendix to his report, guidelines
to safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the local authorities
in their task of enforcement.




                                     i
      *


* Consultations on the Report

 4.       When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including the
 local authority associations and the football authorities, were consulted about
 Lord Wheatley's proposals.      The football authorities made it clear that they were
apprehensive at the financial implications for the clubs, but there was general
agreement with the proposals themselves.       Detailed consultations were held on the
guidelines contained in the technical appendix to the Report and these, duly
amended, were finally published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a
 special booklet, "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".      It was revised in 1975
 in the light of practical experience of its application and specifically targeted
 on football grounds-


 Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)

 5.       The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.   Its primary
 purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local authorities will
 no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.      The Guide therefore deals
 with matters such as the provision of adequate entrances and exits, means of
 escape, the slope of terracing, the strength and siting of crush barriers, the
 construction of staircases, and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators
 both under normal and emergency conditions.      The Guide is not a set of requirements
 to be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances.      As Lord Wheatley
 recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum flexibility in any system of
 control so as to take account of the differing circumstances at individual grounds:
 factors such as age, size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to
 ground.


 6.       While the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to all sports
 stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports other than football are
 involved.


 General Approach to the Act

 7.       The main instrument of control under the Act is the safety certificate issued by
 the local authority.      A safety certificate is needed in respect of every stadium
 which is the subject of a designation order, made by the Secretary of State.         The
 certificate enables the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as
 are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the stadium in question.




                                        ii
8.    The approach to designation was based on a phased programme so that the more
important grounds regularly attracting the largest attendances were dealt with
first.     The international stadia at which soccer and Rugby Union were played plus
stadia used by soccer clubs in Division 1 of the Football League were designated
in 1976.     This was followed in 1979 by designation of stadia of clubs in
Division 2 of the League and thereafter on promotion of a club to Division 2.
Following the    fire    at Bradford City FC in May 1985 all the remaining stadia
liable to designation used by clubs in Divisions 3 and 4 of the Football League,
and qualifying stadia of clubs in Division 1 and 2 of the Rugby League were
designated.


Substance of the Act

9.    The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under the Act, that
is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local authority for the area in
which the stadium is situated, which is required for every sports stadium desig­
nated for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.


10.   Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate any sports
stadium having accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators as requiring a
safety certificate.     Safety certificates are of two kinds, general and special.
A general safety certificate is the main continuing form of control and is issued
for an indefinite period in respect of a specified activity or activities
regularly taking place at the stadium.     A special safety certificate may be issued
at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other circumstances
not covered by the general safety certificate.     Such an event might be an evangel­
istic rally which might call for special arrangements if, for example, seating were
provided for the congregation on the playing area.     A special safety certificate
can be issued only in respect of a sports stadium for which a general safety
certificate is already in force.


11.   The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2 .   The local
authority is empowered to include in the certificate such terms and conditions as
are necessary to secure, at the stadium in question, a reasonable degree of safety.
Without prejudice to this general power, the section requires certificates to contain
terms and conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means of
escape in emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush barriers, and the
maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.
To remove any possibility of doubt, sub-section (3) makes it clear that a certificate
may include a condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and
the maintenance of safety.
12.   An earlier Bill, introduced in 1973, limited the terms and conditions
imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary to secure a reasonable
degree for'feembers of the public." There was some difficulty over this term
because it might have excluded, for example, members of supporters' clubs.        This
particular problem was by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is,
any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.      On the other hand,
it seemed    right that all the peole present on the occasion of a match or other
activity for which a ground has a certificate should be taken into account for the
purpose of the safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or
other facilities at the ground.     Accordingly, the general power of the local
authority under section 2(1) to include in a safety certificate such terms or
conditions as are necessary omits any reference to people and speaks only of
securing "reasonable safety at the stadium", (although the terms "safety", as
defined in section 17, does not include danger arising from participation in a
 port).     Certain provisions must, however, be specifically linked with spectators
(who are, after all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will
be greatly in the majority).     Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate to state
the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted.




^3*   Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to be followed when a local authority
receives an application for a safety certificate.      It requires them to determine
whether an applicant is, in their opinion, a qualified person, ie a person likely
to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions imposed
in the certificate.      If so, they are then under a duty to issue a general safety
'■'.ertificate to him.   In this respect, the general safety certificate is different
I'rom the fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971-     the latter
is issued only after necessary safety works have been completed, whilst the
safety certificate under this Act can be issued almost from the outset, and is an
instrument of continuing control.      The issue of a special safety certificate,
however, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already explained,
because only they can judge whether it is appropriate to issue it for the special
occasion in question.


14.   In Metropolitan Counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required to send a copy of any application for a certificate to the
police and the Fire Authority, and must consult them about the terms and conditions
to be included in the certificate.        Elsewhere a copy must be sent to, and
consultation take place with, the police and the Building Authority.         The need
for such consultation is self-evident:         there must be close co-ordination of the
interests of the different authorities directly concerned with different aspects
of safety at football grounds.


15.   Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer, surrender and
cancellation of safety certificates.         It is of primary importance that a local
authority should have power to amend a safety certificate where it appears
appropriate for them to do so, for example, if they find in the course of a
routine inspection that a part of a ground has become so dangerous as to demand an
immediate restriction on its use or some other necessary safeguard.         Again, they
must have power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements
have been carried out to make this possible.


      Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against decisions or
requirements of the local authority in connection with safety certificates.            Appeals
lie to the Secretary of State, who has power to set up a formal inquiry.


17.   Section 6(2) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to
the safety of spectators at sports grounds.         This is in the nature of a reserve
power which could be used, for example, to give backing to requirements of the
local authorities which in the light of experience had been shown to be essential.
This section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for various
other purposes connected with the Act.         To date no regulations have been made
under this sub-section.


      Section 7 provides for some supplementary matters on determinations and
appeals. Sub-sections (1) and    (2 )   provide for the deemed withdrawal of an applica­
tion for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate when a local authority
determines that a person is not, or has ceased to be, qualified to hold it.        The
section also provides for the suspension of a condition in a certificate pending
determination of an appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a
court, on the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition
remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.




                                         v
19.   The holder of a general safety certificate is required by section 8 to
notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or extension of a stadium.
The purpose of the clause is to guard against any alterations being made, without
the local authority’s knowledge, which might affect the safety of spectators.


20.   Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other legislation
which may affect sports stadia.


21.   Section 10 is an important power which authorities should not feel inhibited
from using where the danger to spectators are such that use of the ground, or part
of it, should be prohibited or restricted.         Should a magistrates’ court, on the
application of a local authority, consider that the risk to spectators at any
sports ground is so great that their admission should be prohibited or restricted
until remedial action has been taken, the court may make an order accordingly.
This power applies to any sports stadium or ground, whether or not it is designated
as requiring a safety certificate.     Where a general or special safety certificate
is in force, local authorities may prefer to remedy an unsatisfactory situation
by amending the certificate, in cases where there is sufficient time to do so.
In respect of sports grounds and the smaller stadia, consultations between the
local authority and the club would usually be expected to secure, on a voluntary
basis, a reasonable standard of safety; however, where management appears to be
unwilling to undertake the necessary measures or is slow to act on advice, this
additional power can be used.


22.   Section 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons appointed by the
local authority and others involved in the task of ensuring crowd safety at sports
grounds.   Section 12 deals with offences and penalties.


23-   Section 13 deals mainly with civil liability.        Its purpose is to make clear
that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of action in respect of a
contravention of regulations or of conditions in a safety certificate, the existing
rights of a spectator injured at a football stadium to bring an action for negli­
gence against the occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.


24.   The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to classes of
sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the Act as are not
already expressed to apply to them.         For example, it enables the Secretary of
State by order to extend the safety certificate procedure to such places as




                                      vj.
race-courses. Only a class of sports ground may be the subject of an extension
order under this clause:   an individual sports ground (other than a stadium)
cannot be designated until section 1 of the Act has been applied by an order
under section 15 to the class of sports ground to   whichitbelongs.    Todate,
the powers under this section have not been used.


25.   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications, to the
Crown.   Section 17 deals with interpretation.


26.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations, exceptcommencement   orders,
made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution procedure.    It also
imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before making any orders or regulations,
except commencement orders or orders relating to the Isles of Scilly, to consult
with such persons as appear to him requisite.
                                                                   ANNEX C


SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 provide that any application
for a safety certificate shall be made in the form contained in the Schedule to
the Regulations or a form to the like effect.      An application should be accompanied
by detailed information as to the structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, includ­
ing plans of the stadium, certificates relating to the testing of crush barriers
and evidence of the applicant's status.      It is, however, open to a local authority,
under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, such further
information of this kind as it may consider necessary to enable it to determine
the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.


2.   On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and con­
ditions to be imposed in the certificate.       If it considers him to be such a person
the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.
In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general
safety certificate would be made by an unqualified person.       There is, however, a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is
not a qualified person (see paragraph 10).


3.   In Metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of any appli­
cation for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
Officer of Police and the fire authority, and must consult them about the terms
and conditions to be included in the certificate.       Elsewhere in England and Wales
the local authority must send a copy to and consult with the Chief Officer of
Police and the building authority.       In framing such conditions, local authorities
will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in the
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.       In this connection local authorities are
reminded that, this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be
rigidly applied regardless of individual circumstances.       The maximum flexibility
should be maintained to take account of the different circumstances of individual
grounds deriving from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of con­
struction.   In this regard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that the




                                     i
terms and conditions should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reason­
able safety" and it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek
the absolute safety of everyone attending the sports stadium.


4.   It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the
local authority and the stadium representatives in the process of drawing up the
certificate conditions.    In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is
rarely filled to capacity, the local authority may consider it proper to base its
requirements on actual levels of attendance over a given period rather than on
maximum capacity.    On the rare occasions on which a capacity crowd could be
expected, separate provision might be made for this contingency on the lines
indicated in paragraph 7 below.    Again, if a stand were found to be structurally
weak, the local authority might, in consultation with the stadium representatives,
offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works carried out or of restrict­
ing admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.


5.   As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the indivi­
dual case.    Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.
It must however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including,
in particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have annexed
to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be
framed.    The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which
can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate.     The local
authority may find it convenient to list, in a covering letter to the certificate,
such modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the form of a state­
ment of the increased spectator capacities'   to be allowed for the separate sections
of the ground when the various stages of any future .works programme

agreed with the stadium authorities are completed.     This arrangement, by
excluding from the certificate itself proposed conditions which would
apply only to future works, should serve to obviate confusion.     At the same time,
however, care must be taken not to exclude from the certificate any restriction
germane to current conditions, since section 5(3) of the Act provides for an
interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State against the inclusion of
anything     in, or the omission of anything from, a safety certificate, and these
rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form of the
certificate.
6.   As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the
Act provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different
activities.    Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­
ball ground, in cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other
events it would be desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special
safety certificates, if the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were
to be included in the general certificate.    It is suggested that any such events
for which it is considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into
2 classes:-


     1.   those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
     stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;


     2.   those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
     concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given
     over to   spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and conditions
     will have to be devised.    It is not, of course, necessary to provide for
     these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium
     authorities.


7.   There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected       attract signi­
ficantly more than the usual attendance.     In the case especially of cup replays
these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would
not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to
the grant of a special safety certificate.     In order to overcome this difficulty,
it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek
to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which
might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers to
certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their
incorporation in the general safety certificate.


8.   Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­
tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­
ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of
the certificate or of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and will
presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the
      ♦

      original certificate.    It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities
      and clubs/stadium authorities for a close liaison to be maintained after the
      issue of the certificate and certainly while any further works of safety measures
      are being carried out.   It is likely to be in the stadium operators' financial
      interest to get the safety certificate amended as soon as possible after work
      has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure that the local authority
      is kept informed of progress.   For    its part the local authority will no doubt
      wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion of the
      work, the certificate can be amended without delay.


      9.    After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
      transfer of the certificate to another person.     Similarly, while a local
      authority is considering an application for a certificate and before the certifi-
the   cate has been granted, it may be asked to substitute some person other than the
      original applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.      These
      are, however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certifi­
      cates, where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club or a stadium
      organisation by an authorised official of the club or representative of the
      organisation.   However, if it does happen, the local authority will be required in
      both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified person.
      Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations to
      giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply together with
      any necessary appeals procedure.      In the second case, there is no reason why the
      local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new applica­
      tion in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had already
      reached.
 T-

      10.   In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
      certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see
      paragraph 2 above), which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed
      transfer of a certificate, the Act provides a further right of. appeal to any
      "interested party" (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)
      against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
      certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.      The
      regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of
      any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of
      the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,
      the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating
      in the locality.



                                            iv
                                                                           ANNEX D




SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
like effect.     Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in the
case of applications for special safety certificates.     In any case where an
application for a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the
general safety certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the appli­
cant's status.     Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seating
arrangements for spectators should be provided, together with such further
information in support of the application as is considered necessary to enable
the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act.     However, it is
open to a local authority, under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice
in writing, any further information of this kind which they may think it
necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions to be
included in the special safety certificate.


2.   A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates
is that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a quali­
fied person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory,
whereas the issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion.
But an applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a
refusal (see following paragraphs for details).


3.   An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made at
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied
that the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period,
eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.     On receipt of an
application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be
in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed
in the certificate.     The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make
this determination within 14 days of receiving the application.     There is a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant
is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5, the
applicant must be furnished with the reasons for such a determination.



                                     i
4.   It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.     This
decision must, in accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the
receipt of the application, not only in cases where the local authority has
determined that the applicant is a qualified person but also in those where
it has determined that he is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to
be considered.    There is also a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds
other than a determination that the applicant is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 9).    In the event of such a refusal, therefore, the local authority is
again required, under regulation 6, to give the applicant the reasons for its
decision.


5.   When the first 2 stages have been completed, should it have been decided
that a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority in
metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) is required, by
section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the Chief Officer
of Police and to the fire authority and to consult them about the terms and
conditions to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere in England and Wales
the local authority must send a copy to, and consult with, the Chief Officer of
Police and the building authority.     The special safety certificate must, in
accordance with regulation 6(2), then be issued not less than 28 days before
the proposed event is due to take place.


6.
 The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely         to vary
according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
certificate would not be appropriate.     (In suitable cases, however, regard may
be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of the paper relating to the
"Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates".)      Any
special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms
and conditions imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in
section 2(2) of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where
appropriate by reference to the plan attached to the general safety cartificate.


7.     Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the deter­
mination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be     varied only by formal
amendment of the certificate.     This may be on the application of the holder of
the certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2)
of the Act).     This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificate, otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has
been issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.     Any such amend­
ment must, however, be publicised as in paragraph 10 below.


8.    Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
to another person an equally unlikely contingency.     Any possible difficulties
in this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the
general safety certificate applies for the special certificate.     Nevertheless,
should an application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide
within 14 days if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it
decides to the contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating
to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will
the appropriate appeals procedure, should the need arise.     In the case of an
application for transfer before a special safety certificate has actually been
issued, there is no reason why the local authority should not treat the applica­
tion in all respects as a new application in the terms of the original and pro­
cess it from the point already reached.


9.    Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a deter­
mination that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against
the refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4).     In addition the
Act provides (in section 5(3))a right of appeal to any "interested party"
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.
The regulations provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, notice
of any such appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice
of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not
notified, the publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper
circulating in the locality.


10.   As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so
to amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also
to advertise its action in the press.     A similar obligation falls on an appellant
(under regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wish­
ing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section
5(4) of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.
(The reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the
paper relating to the 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety
Certificates'.)


                                        iii
11.   Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of ap pea l, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.   It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation
8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.   With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to
state whether it wishes a hearing under section 5(4) of the Act.   (The pro­
cedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 10.)


12.   It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary,
to order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any
appeal.   In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in
regulation 12.


13-   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
practice of copying to the Home Office any special safety certificates issued.

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION

1.   The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the effects on the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) of Local Government reorganisation in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London brought about by the Local Government Act 1985.

2.   With effect from 1 April 1986 responsibility for administering the SSGA 1975 will,
in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London, transfer to the appropriate
Metropolitan District Council (MDC) or London Borough (the "successor" authorities).
They will be responsible for, among other things, the issue of and amendments to safety
certificates.  A consequential effect of Local Government reorganisation is that the
current certificating authorities in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London are
not in the meantime empowered to issue or amend safety certificates for any period
commencing on or after 1 April 1986. Such certificates or amendments will fall to be
issued by the successor authorities. It is therefore in the interests of applicants
in these areas to ensure that applications for special safety certificates, or amendmen-
to existing certificates, which are to come into effect on or after 1 April 1986 are
copied to the appropriate successor authority who should be kept informed of developmen-
and progress so as to be in a position to assume responsibility for the case in questioi
with the minimum of delay and inconvenience.

                                                                  Yours faithfully

Dear Sir

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 5/1986

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS: COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY
AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS: FINAL REPORT (CMND   9710   )

The Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry set up by the Home
Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland following the
events of 11 May 1985 at Bradford City FC and Birmingham City FC
has now been published.           The purpose of this circular is, first,
to inform recipients of the recommendations contained in the Final
Report and the G o v e r n m e n t ’s response to them; and, secondly, to
seek the assistance and cooperation of local authorities and chief
fire officers with a view to introducing new safety measures in line
with the Report's recommendations.

Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry

2.  The Final Report amends and expands upon the recommendations
contained in the Inquiry's Interim Report (Cmnd 9585) published last
July.  It stresses the need for improved safety to be effected
urgently and draws attention to the additional hazards posed by
crowd violence at some sporting events.  These questions are subject
to separate consideration: this circular is concerned however with
safety matters only.
3.  Attached at   Annex A is a list of the recommendations of the
Final Report.   They supplement those contained in the Interim
Report and supercede the provisional recommendations it contained.
At Annex D is a copy of the Home Secretary's oral statement to
Parliament responding to the Final Report.

4.  Of the 9 recommendations on safety (recommendation 6 refers to
Scotland only) recommendations 1, 7, 8 and 9 are longer term
proposals to amend either the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(SSGA) or the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (FPA).   The latter,
recipients will know, is already the subject of an uncompleted
review contained in the consultative document issued in July 1985
and upon which comments were invited by 31 December 1985.    The
Government accepts the aims behind the Inquiry's approach to both
Acts and proposes to issue as soon as possible a consultation
document as to the best means of achieving them.   This document will
outline solutions inter alia by taking account both of the further
factual information sought at paragraphs 10 and 11 below which was
not available to the Inquiry and of the comments made on the proposals
on the FPA in the July consultative document.  The upshot therefore
will be integrated proposals for the most effective form of safety
provision in accordance with the principles recommended by the
Inquiry.

5.  The objective behind Recommendation 4 is also accepted and con­
sultations will be undertaken with HSE and DOE with the aim of
clarifying the interface between the responsibilities of the authorities
concerned.   Recommendation 10 (building regulations) is being
considered by the Department of the Environment (DOE).

SSGA:   extension of   designation

6.  As a result of the Government's acceptance of Recommendation 2 of
the Final Report, the Home Secretary now proposes generally to extend
designation under the SSGA 1975 to stadia and grounds with accommod­
ation for over 10,000 spectators at which soccer or rugby union or
rugby league or cricket is played.  Consultation letters have been
sent to the sporting bodies concerned seeking comments and information
on the venues liable to be affected. Details of these, as known to
the Home Office, are contained at Annex B.  With the exception of
rugby union the information is based on responses received to HM
Chief Inspector of Fire Services' letter to chief fire officers of
21 August 1985 (No 11/1985).  The information for rugby union includes
data provided by the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union.
Where information differs from that given by chief fire officers, the
larger figure for spectator capacity has been used.

7.  It is hoped that consultation with the sporting authorities will
help resolve any points which might arise about the grounds and stadia
affected. Local authorities to whom this circular is addressed are
asked to check if there are any sports stadia or sports grounds in
their area with accommodation for over 10,000 spectators at which rugby
union or rugby league or soccer or cricket is played but which have
been omitted from Annex B. Details of any such stadia or grounds
should be passed to the Home Office as soon as possible, giving the
full name and address of the stadium or ground in question, name and
address of the principal occupier, approximate spectator capacity and
the use to which the venue is put. This information can be passed by
telephone on 01 213 5566 if this is more convenient.
E.R
 Timing

 8.  Timing of the further designations as mentioned in paragraphs 6
 and 7 above under the SSGA is subject to the consultation process which
 will include views expressed by the local authority associations.
 A phased programme may be necessary but it is intended to complete
 designation by the summer of 1986.

 Guide to Safety   at Sports Grounds   (Football)   (the "Green Gu i d e ” )

 9.  The Green Guide is being revised along the lines recommended by
 the Inquiry and it is hoped, after consultation with interested bodies,
 to have a new edition of the Guide published before the 1986/87 seasons.
 Until then the advice in the existing Guide can continue to be followed
 as appropriate for all spectator sports.  It is not intended to change
 the present status of the Green Guide.

  Further controls over safety in   sports premises

 10.  The Government has also accepted the need for some further safety
 controls to be applied to other sports stadia and grounds    with stands
 holding over 500; and to indoor sports premises when    they are used   to
 accommodate more than 500 spectators (Final Report recommendations 3
 and 5).  As a first step to considering how best to proceed, further
 information is required to permit evaluation of the nature and number
 of the premises involved.  Some information has already been provided
 (or may be available) as a result of the surveys carried out in response
 to DC0 letter 11/1985 (seeking information on sports stadia with an
 overall capacity of over 5,000; sports grounds with constructed accom­
 modation for more than 5,000; and indoor arenas with a spectator
 capacity of over 1,000).  The information now sought overlaps with
 but is not identical to that previously given, so in an attempt to
 ease the administrative burden and to ensure consistency of response,
 those to whom this circular is addressed are asked to provide the
 information on the proforma at Annex C.   Chief executives will no doubt
 wish to discuss with chief fire officers who is best placed to carry
 out this work.

  11.  For the purpose of this exercise indoor sports premises included
  in the return should be confined to those premises ^he^a^ygither on
  a regular or infrequent basis, sports events or otner/activities take
  place for which accommodation is provided for more than 500 spectators.


  12.  To ensure that there is no short term gap in safety cover chief
  fire officers and, where appropriate, other members of the local
  authority safety team are asked to inspect those outdoor sports
  venues coming within the scope of recommendation 3 which were not
  inspected  as part  of the earlier  exercise, and those indoor sports
  premises coming within the  scope  of recommendation  5 which have not
E.R.
   been inspected in the last twelve months whether or not they are
   subject to entertainments licensing legislation.  The purpose of
   these inspections would be to advise management on additional
   measures necessary to secure satisfactory standards of safety, and
   to consider emergency action where necessary under section 10 of
   either the SSGA or FPA as appropriate.  Similarly, chief executives
   and chief fire officers are asked to keep under review the other
   outdoor premises previously inspected with the object of maintaining
   safety standards at those venues, even though they are not being
   designated under the SSGA.

   13.  Finally, it would be appreciated if the returns (Annex C) could
   be sent in as soon as possible and in any event not later than
   21 February 1986 so that preparatory work can begin. The returns
   should be addressed to


             Fire and Emergency Planning Department
             Home Office
             50 Queen Anne's Gate
             London SW1H 9AT

   14.  The Home Secretary recognises the efforts already made by both
   chief fire officers and local authorities generally to improve safety
   at sports grounds and is deeply grateful for all that has been done.
   It is appreciated that these latest tasks will be an additional but
   not, it is hoped, a substantial burden given the work already under­
   taken in many areas to improve spectator safety at sporting venues.

   15.  An additional copy of this circular is enclosed for the chief
   fire officer.  In view of  local government
     reorganisation    copies have also been sent to the chief executives
   of Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs, and to the
   Joint Fire and Civil Defence Authorities.   In addition, copies of
   this circular have also been sent to non-Metropolitan District
   Councils because of their responsibility for licensing some events
   in indoor sports premises under the Local Government (Miscellaneous
   Provisions ) Act 1982.

       16.    Any enquiries should be directed to:



                                        (proforma,    Annex D only)

       Dear Sir
       HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 96/1988
       FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT : PART III - SPORTS
       GROUNDS - CERTIFICATION OF STANDS AND THE SAFETY OF PLACES OF
       SPORT REGULATIONS 1988
       Introduction
       1.   This circular, together with annexes A - D, introduces the
       provisions of Part III of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of
       Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act) and the Safety of Places of Sport
       Regulations 1988, which come into force on 1 January 1989. A
       copy of the Commencement No 4 Order, under which Part III comes
       into force, is enclosed.
       Implementation
       2.   Part III is the final phase of implementation of those parts
       of the 1987 Act dealing with spectator safety at places of sport
       in line with the Government's proposals contained in the
       Consultative Document published in 1986. It brings into effect a
       system of safety certification and subsequent inspection of
       stands able to accommodate under cover at least 500 spectators
       ("regulated stands") at sports grounds not designated as
       requiring a safety certificate under section 1 of the Safety of
       Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA). Detailed advice on Part III,
       section by section, is contained in Annex A. A suggested format
       for a notice of determination that a stand is a regulated stand
       is at Annex D.
        3.   Action taken by local authorities in response to HOC 5/1986
        to identify stands able to accommodate at least 500 spectators
        should mean that most, if not all, such stands have already been
identified. However, in determining regulated stand status under
Part III of the 1987 Act local authorities are required to act in
accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary of State under ^
section 26(8). This guidance is being issued, together with
guidance on inspections under section 34 of the 1987 Act, under
separate cover.
Regulations
4.   A copy of the 1988 regulations is enclosed with this
circular. The regulations lay down the procedure for
applications for safety certificates, their issue, transfer,
amendment, replacement and cancellation. The regulations further
authorise local authorities to determine charges in respect of
applications for the issue etc of safety certificates. Time
limits for all appeals to the courts are also prescribed. More
detailed guidance to the regulations is contained in Annex B.
Safety Certification

5.   Supplementary advice on the application of the Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (Green Guide) and on the certification
of stands is offered in Annex C.
Resource and Manpower Implications
6.   The potential variation in regulated stands is such that an
accurate estimate of the average number of man-days for
certification is not possible, but reasonable costs can be

PART III OF THE FIRE SAFETY & SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987:
SAFETY CERTIFICATION FOR REGULATED STANDS AT SPORTS GROUNDS
Introduction
1.   The provisions of Part III of the Fire Safety & Safety of
Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act) supplement the provisions
of the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 (SSGA) with the aim of
improving the safety of spectators in stands at sports grounds
which are not designated as requiring a safety certificate under
the SSGA. They follow closely the Government's proposals
contained in the Consultative Document published by the Home
Office/Scottish Office in June 1986 in response to the Final
Report of the Popplewell Inquiry. Part III is brought into force
from 1 January 1989. It is the final stage of implementation of
the 1987 Act's provisions on spectator safety at sports grounds
and provides for a system of safety certification for stands
determined by the local authority as able to hold 500 or more
spectators under cover ("regulated stands").
2.   Part III provides a regime of safety certification similar
to that under the SSGA but applies only to covered stands which,
in general, were seen by the Popplewell Inquiry as most likely to
pose risks from fire or structural deficiency (or both). The
provisions of Part III apply to all types of sports ground as
defined in section 41 of the 1987 Act and section 17 of the SSGA.
General approach

3.   The safety certificate forms the main instrument of control
under Part III of the 1987 Act. There are two sorts of safety
certificate, general and special. The general certificate is the
main mechanism and is to be issued for an indefinite period for
specified activities taking place at the sports ground. A
special safety certificate may be issued for a specified event or
events not covered by the general certificate. A safety
certificate is required for each regulated stand that is to be
used by spectators for viewing activities at the sports ground.
It is the local authority who determine, subject to a right of
appeal to the courts, whether a stand is a regulated stand and
issue a safety certificate. The stand in question remains a
regulated stand unless the local authority subsequently determine
otherwise. Supplementary advice on safety certification is
contained in Annex C.
4.   In determining whether a stand is a regulated stand (ie able
to accommodate 500 or more spectators under cover) local
authorities are required to act in accordance with any guidance
issued by the Secretary of State under section 26(8). Such
guidance has been issued under cover of Home Office Circular 97/
1988. Local authorities are also required, under section 34, to
arrange for the periodic inspections of sports grounds which
contain regulated stands in accordance with guidance from the
Secretary of State. Such guidance has also been issued under
cover of Home Office Circular 97/1988.
SUBSTANCE OF PART III OF THE 1987 ACT
Section 26 : Safety   certificates for standsat sports grounds
5.   Section 26 provides for the new systemof safety
certificates for stands at sports grounds. Under subsection (l)
Part III is applied to all sports grounds which
     a.    provide covered accommodation in stands for spectators,
     and
     b.    are not designated under section 1 of the SSGA.
Under subsection (2) a safety certificate is required in respect
of the use of each stand which provides covered accommodation for
500 or more spectators to view activities at the around (known as
a "regulated stand" under subsection (5)). Where more than one
regulated stand exists at a sports ground the local authority may
issue one certificate to cover all such stands. The figure of
500 can be varied by the Secretary of State by Order subject to
negative resolution procedure of Parliament (subsections (3) and
 (4)). There are no plans at the present time to obtain such an
Order.
6.   Local authorities may care to note that it is only when a
stand is used for the purpose of viewing activities at the ground
that a safety certificate is required. The use of a stand for
some other purpose, such as an internal activity (eg an
exhibition) would not require a safety certificate under Part
III.
7.   Subsection (6) places the function of determining whether a
stand is a regulated stand and the issue of a safety certificate
on the local authority who, under subsection (7), may apply any
appropriate criteria but who, under subsection (8), must act in
accordance with any guidance from the Secretary of State. This
guidance has been issued under the cover of Home Office Circular
97/1988. Under subsection (9) the final determination of the
local authority, subject only to an appeal to the courts (see
paragraphs 19-20 below) concludes the question of whether a stand
is a regulated stand. This mechanism, together with service of
notice of the determination under section 28(2) on the
"responsible person" (see paragraphs 11-14 below) ensures that a
safety certificate must be applied for if the stand is to be used
by spectators for viewing activities at the ground.
8.   Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (10) describe
respectively "general" and "special" safety certificates as
defined in subsection (11). Here again local authorities may
wish to note that a safety certificate for a stand relates to the
use of the stand for viewing an activity or activities.
Subsection (11) provides self-explanatory definitions. "Stand"
includes the uncovered portion of the structure for certification
purposes. It will be noted that by use of the phrase "(not
merely temporary)" the definition of "stand" excludes from
certification temporary stands.
Section 27 : Contents of safety certificates for stands
9.   Subsection (1) requires a safety certificate to contain such
terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
expedient to secure reasonable safety in the stand and which may
involve alterations or additions to it or any installations in or
serving it (for example cables, ducts, plant equipment). There
are no obligatory terms and conditions. However, under
subsection (2) safety certificates must include terms and
conditions required by an Order made under section 39 which
enables the Secretary of State to make an Order modifying the
provisions of Part III as they apply to any particular class of
stand. No Order has been made under this section and there are
no current plans to do so. (see paragraph 33 below)
10. Subsection (3) precludes conditions in safety certificates
relating to police presence unless the extent of the presence is
reserved for determination by the chief officer of police.
Subsection (4) provides that a certificate may include a
condition on the keeping of records relating to attendance (in
practice this would apply only where access to the stand is
controlled, see Annex C) and the maintenance of safety in the
stand. Subsection (5) requires a general safety certificate to
include a plan of the stand or stands to which it applies and the
area in the immediate vicinity of it/them. Terms and conditions
in any safety certificate should be framed where appropriate by
reference to that plan. Subsection (6) allows for different
terms and conditions to be included in the safety certificate for
different activities taking place at the ground. Subsection (7)
ensures that safety certificates do not derogate from any
requirements imposed by any regulations made under section 6(2)
of the SSGA. No regulations have been made under that section
and there are no current plans to do so.

Section 28 : Issue of certificates
11. This section identifies to whom safety certificates should
be issued, lays down procedures for determining whether a stand
is a regulated stand, and for the issue of certificates.
Subsection (1) sets out who qualifies for a safety certificate.
In the case of a general safety certificate this is the ground
management; for a special safety certificate it is the person
organising the activity at the ground in question. In many
cases, of course, the holder of the general safety certificate
will also qualify to hold the special safety certificate.

12. Under subsection (2), where it appears to the local
authority that a stand at a sports ground in their area is a
regulated stand, they have to make a preliminary determination on
whether or not the stand is a regulated stand. If the local
authority determine that it is, they must then issue a notice of
determination and the effect of it on the person who appears to
qualify for the general safety certificate (ie the person who
appears to qualify under subsection (1)(a)). A suggested draft
notice of determination is attached at Appendix D.
13. Subsection (3) provides that the preliminary determination
becomes a final determination after two months. Subsection (4)
allows for revocation of that determination at any time before it
becomes final or on consideration of an application for a safety
certificate. These two subsections allow ground management an
opportunity to discuss and review with the local authority any
information or proposals which might cause the local authority to
revise their determination and save recourse to the appeal
procedure. Subsection (5) allows the local authority to withdraw
(rather than revoke) the notice of determination before it
becomes final and serve it on a different person - for example
where information has come to light meantime indicating that
there has been a change in the management of the ground. When a
fresh notice is served the two month period under subsection (2)
begins again.
14. Subsection (6) lays a duty on the local authority to make
certain determinations on applications for general safety
certificates.   (Subsection (10) (see below) imposes certain
procedural requirements on the local authority on receipt of such
an application.) Subsection (6)(a) provides for applications for
general safety certificates which are made otherwise than in
response to a notice served by the local authority under
subsection (2); such applications would be made where the
applicant is of the opinion that the stand in question is a
regulated stand. Under subsection (6)(a) the local authority
must determine whether the stand in question is a regulated stand
and, if it is, whether the applicant qualifies for the general
safety certificate. A determination under (6)(a) that a stand is
a regulated stand is immediately a final determination.
Subsection (6)(b) concerns an application for a general safety
certificate in response to a notice served by the local authority
under subsection (2). Provided that the local authority do not
then decide to revoke their preliminary determination that the
stand is a regulated stand (in the light of further information)
they must determine whether the applicant is qualified to hold a
general safety certificate. Once these issues have been resolved
a general safety certificate must, under subsection (7), be
 issued to a qualified applicant unless such a certificate is
already in operation in which case an application should be made
under section 29(5) for the transfer of the certificate.
15. Subsection (8) concerns the issue of a special safety
certificate. Such a certificate is only issued if there is
already a general safety certificate in operation. The local
authority have a discretion as to whether or not to issue a
special safety certificate.
16. In all cases where a local authority determine that an
applicant for a safety certificate does not qualify for one they
must serve on him notice under subsection (9) stating their
determination.
17. Subsection (10) requires the local authority to send a copy
of an application for a safety certificate to the chief officer
of police and, where the local authority is in Greater London or
a metropolitan county, to the fire authority; elsewhere, a copy
must be sent to the building authority. The local authority must
also consult these authorities about the terms and conditions to
be included in the certificate.
18. Subsection (11) enables the local authority to serve a
notice on an applicant requiring such information or plans etc as
they consider necessary to issue a safety certificate. The plan
could be for an area larger than the stands. Subsection (12)
provides that if an applicant fails to comply with the
requirement for information or plans within any time specified in
the notice or as extended by the local authority his application
will be deemed to have been withdrawn. Thereafter, if a fresh
application is not made and spectators are admitted to a
regulated stand an offence will be committed under section 36.

Section 29:   Amendment, cancellation etc of certificates
19. Subsection (1)(a) provides for the cancellation of a safety
certificate where it appears to the local authority who have
issued it that the stand in question is not or has ceased to be a
regulated stand - for example if the original determination was
mistaken or if the covered accommodation is reduced to below 500.
In these circumstances subsection (1)(a) requires the local
authority to revoke the determination and, by notice to the
holder, cancel the safety certificate. Subsection (1)(b) enables
the local authority to amend the terms and conditions of the
safety certificate by notice to the holder, and subsection (1)(c)
enables them to replace the safety certificate. Subsection (2)
enables the powers under subsection (1)(a) - (c) to be exercised
without an application from the holder (see also paragraph 21
below). Subsection (3) applies the provisions of section 27 to
an amended or replacement safety certificate. When the local
authority amend a certificate under subsection (1)(b), the notice
must, under subsection (4), specify the operative date of the
amendment which can be later than the date of the notice. This
enables the local authority to anticipate completion of any
remedial work or delay operation of a condition to allow for
changes to be made.
20. Subsection (5) concerns the transfer of safety certificates.
It places a duty on the local authority to determine whether a
person is qualified to have a safety certificate issued to him on
transfer from the holder (see paragraph 11 above) and notify him
of the determination. If the person is qualified the safety
certificate may be transferred to him. Application for transfer
may be made by the holder or by the person to whom transfer is
proposed (subsection (6)).
21. Copies of the application must be sent by the local
authority to the chief officer of police and, where the local
authority is in Greater London or a metropolitan county, to the
fire authority, and elsewhere to the building authority
(subsection 7). These authorities must also be consulted on any
proposal to amend, replace or transfer the safety certificate
(subsection (8)).
22. Subsection (9) provides for the surrender of a safety
certificate whereupon it ceases to have effect. Subsection (10)
gives a local authority discretion to cancel a safety certificate
if the holder dies or, if a body corporate, is dissolved.

Section 30 :   Appeals
23. All appeals under Part III are to the courts. Subsection
(1) gives a right of appeal against a final determination that a
stand is a regulated stand. Subsection (2) provides a right of
appeal against a determination that an applicant is not qualified
(or would not qualify in the case of transfer) for the issue of a
safety certificate. Subsection (3) confers a right of appeal
against a refusal by the local authority to issue a special
safety certificate (other than on grounds of qualification).
Subsection (4) gives "interested parties", who are defined in
subsection (8), the right of appeal against
     a.   inclusion of anything in or omission of anything from a
     safety certificate;
     b.   refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.
All appeals have to be brought within the period prescribed by
Regulations made under section 31, in England and Wales by way of
complaint for an order to a Magistrates Court (subsections (5)
and (6)).

24. Under subsection (9) where a local authority have served
notice on an applicant of their determination that he does not
qualify for the issue of a safety certificate he is, unless he
appeals, deemed to have withdrawn his application once the appeal
period has expired (see also paragraph 26 below on offences under
section 36) . Subsection (10). identifies the deemed date of
withdrawal of an application in the case of an appeal which is
not upheld by the court or is withdrawn by the applicant.
Subsection (11) suspends the operation of any term or condition
in a safety certificate pending an appeal, and subsection (12)
prescribes who, in addition to the local authority, may appeal to
the Crown Court against an Order by the Magistrates Court.

Section 31:    Regulations
25. Under this section the Secretary of State is empowered to
make regulations prescribing the procedures and application
particulars for the issue etc of safety certificates, authorising
local authorities to determine fees in connection with such
applications and prescribing the time limits for appeals. The
regulations may also contain such incidental and supplementary
provisions as the Secretary of State thinks expedient.
Regulations under section 31 have been made and come into effect
from 1 January 1989 (see Annex B for further details).
Section 32:    Alterations and Extensions
26. Subsection (1) requires the holder of a general safety
certificate to notify the local authority of any proposed
alteration or extension to a regulated stand or its installations
which is likely to affect the safety of people in the stand
before he begins to carry out the proposals. Subsection (2)
emphasises the need for such a notice in relation to entrances
and exits and means of access and escape. The purpose of this
section is to guard against any alterations being made without
the local authority's knowledge and which might affect the safety
of spectators. Failure to give notice is made an offence by
section 36(7)(b).

Section 33:   Exclusion of other statutory requirements
27. Subsection (1) harmonizes Part III with other legislation by
disapplying provisions of several Acts whilst a general safety
certificate for a regulated stand is in force. Subsection (2)
suspends the operation of any term or condition in a licence
relating to a matter which is also covered by the safety
certificate for as long as the certificate is in operation.
Subsection (3) ensures that a person failing to meet a
requirement of a local Act will not commit an offence under that
Act if meeting the requirement would involve a contravention of
the terms or conditions of a safety certificate.

Section 34:   Enforcement
28. Subsection (1) provides for local authorities to enforce the
provisions of Part III and to arrange for periodical inspections
of sports grounds at which there are regulated stands. Such
inspections shall (by virtue of subsection (2)) be in accordance
with any guidance by the Secretary of State. This guidance has
been issued under cover of Home Office Circular 97/1988.

Section 35:   Powers of entry and inspection
29. This section confers for the purposes of Part III a right of
entry to a sports ground at any reasonable time on persons
authorised by the local authority, chief officer of police, in
London or a metropolitan county the fire authority, elsewhere the
building authority, to inspect the stands and make any necessary
enquiries. Authorised persons may be required to produce their
authority and may examine and copy records relating to regulated
stands. The powers under this section apply to all sports
grounds and are in addition to powers under section 11 of the
SSGA.

Section 36:   Offences
30. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) create an offence
if spectators are admitted to a regulated stand on an occasion
when no safety certificate covering their use of the stand is in
operation (see paragraphs 5, 6, and 8 above); or if any term or
condition in a safety certificate is contravened. The offence is
committed by the "responsible person" as defined in subsection
(3) and, if the safety certificate is in operation, the holder of
it. No offence is committed if the local authority have not made
a final determination or if application for a safety certificate
has been made and it has not been withdrawn or deemed to have
been withdrawn (subsection (2)). Subsection (4) provides for
penalties on conviction and subsection (5) provides a defence on
the grounds of proof that spectators were admitted or the
contravention took place without the defendants consent and that
he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all "due
diligence" to avoid commission of the offence by himself or any
person under his control. Subsection (6) provides a defence for
a responsible person on the grounds of proof that he did not know
the stand was a regulated stand (for example if notice had not
been served on the right person). Subsection (7) creates
offences in connection with the provision of information under
sections 28(11) and 32(1) or obstruction under section 35.
Subsections (8) and (9) apply the offence provisions to a body
corporate its officers and members.

Section 37:   Civil and other liability
31. This section limits the effects of the provisions of Part
III in civil proceedings, and on requirements in public, local or
private Acts or in rights of action to those provided expressly
in Part III.

Section 38:   Service of documents
32. This section makes provisions for the service of notices or
other documents required or authorised under Part III.
Subsection (1) makes general provision for such service,
subsection (2) deals with service on corporations or partnerships
and subsection (3) identifies the address to which notices or
documents are to be sent.

Section 39:   Power to modify Part for classes of stand
33. Subsection (1) enables the Secretary of State to modify the
provisions of Part III in the way they should be applied to any
specified class of stand. The power is exercised by Order
subject to negative resolution (subsection (3)) and after
consultation (subsection (4)). Under subsection (2) different
modifications can be made for different activities at a sports
ground and may include such supplementary or transitional
provision as considered expedient. Section 39, together with
section 27(2), would enable the Secretary of State to stipulate
that terms and conditions of a safety certificate should take
account of different ways in which stands are used by spectators
(see paragraph 9 above). It is an important reserve power which
is unlikely to be necessary provided terms and conditions of
safety certificates are framed to take account of the differences
experienced and observed within the stands at different sorts of
sports grounds (see also Annex C).
Section 40:   Application to Crown

34. Subsection (1) applies sections 26 to 29 to premises
occupied by the Crown but substituting for the reference to a
local authority a reference to the Secretary of State who will
therefore be responsible for the certification of such premises.
Subsection (2) provides that nothing within Part III authorises
entry of premises occupied by the Crown.

Section 41:   Interpretation

35. This section provides self-explanatory definitions of words
used in Part III.

PART III OF THE FIRE SAFETY & SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987:
THE SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT REGULATIONS 1988

General
1.   The Safety of Places of Sport Regulations 1988 (1988
Regulations) under section 31(1) and (2) of the Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (1987 Act) have been made and
come into force on 1 January 1989. The 1988 Regulations are
similar to, but distinct from, the Safety of Sports Grounds
Regulations 1987 (S.I.1987/1941). Terms and expressions used in
the 1988 Regulations, eg safety certificate, therefore have the
same meaning as under section 41 of the 1987 Act and refer to
Part III of that Act, not the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
They prescribe the form and procedures for applications for
safety certificates under Part III, provide for the issue of
notices of certain decisions and authorise local authorities to
charge fees for work done by them or on their behalf in
connection with applications for issue etc of safety
certificates. The Regulations also prescribe the time limits for
appeals against local authority decisions taken under Part III.

Substance of Regulations

2.   Regulations 1 and 2 concern citation and interpretation.
Regulation 3 deals with applications. Paragraph m    of
Regulation 3 and the Schedule to the Regulations prescribe the
form in which applications for the issue of a safety certificate,
either a general or special certificate, are to be made. For a
general safety certificate the application form envisages that it
will be accompanied by details of the stand including the plans
where available. For a special safety certificate details of the
stand will already be known from the general safety certificate
application but additional information about the activities and
any changes proposed as a result of those activities may be
required by the local authority. Applications for both general
and special safety certificates are directed at providing
information about the stand when it is used by spectators for
viewing activities at the ground (not when it is used for some
other purpose such as an exhibition or conference for which a
safety certificate is not needed). Applications should also
provide details of the status of the applicant to enable the
local authority to determine whether he qualifies to hold a
certificate. Paragraph 12) lays down that applications for
cancellation, amendment, replacement or transfer of a safety
certificate have to be made in writing and, except for
cancellation, details must be given by the applicant of anyone
who is believed to be concerned with ensuring compliance with
terms and conditions of the safety certificate.
3.   Regulation 4 deals with notices of decisions taken by the
local authority. Notices issued under Regulation 4 are in
addition to those issued under the 1987 Act itself by the local
authority. Under paragraph (11 of Regulation 4 the decisions
described in (a) - (c) must be notified by notice in writing to
the interested parties (as set out in paragraph (8)). The notice
must also include details of when and where a copy of the safety
certificate and a copy of the relevant application may be
inspected (paragraph (6)). In the case of a refusal decision
under (c) the reasons for the refusal should be included in the
notice.
4.   Paragraph (2) requires the local authority to issue notice
on an applicant who has been refused a special safety certificate
other than on the grounds that he is not a qualified person. The
notice should include reasons for the decision.
5.   Paragraph (3) is concerned with the transfer of certificates
and requires the local authority to serve on the holder of a
safety certificate a copy of any notice issued under section
29(5) of the 1987 Act.  (This ensures that both the holder and
the would-be holder of the safety certificate are aware of the
adverse decision.) Similarly, where it is decided that the
applicant is qualified to hold a certificate but it is decided
not to transfer it, that decision must be notified to both the
applicant and the holder giving reasons for the decision.
6.   Paragraph (4) requires the local authority to serve notice
on an applicant of any decision to refuse an application for the
cancellation of a safety certificate under section 29(1)(a) of
the 1987 Act and giving reasons for the decision; and paragraph
(5) requires the local authority to serve a copy of the notice of
the decision on the other interested parties as soon as
practicable thereafter. Paragraph (6) provides that the notice
should include the information of when and where a copy of the
safety certificate and any application may be inspected.
7.   Paragraph (7) requires local authorities to publish a notice
in a local newspaper setting out the decision taken under
paragraph 1 above. The publication should include the
information of when and where a copy of the safety certificate
and any relevant application may be inspected (as in
paragraph (6)). Paragraph (8\ defines "interested parties".

8.   Regulation 5 lays down the time limits for appeals under
section 30 of the 1987 Act. Paragraph (11 lays down the time
limit of 28 days in the case of an appeal against a determination
that a stand is a regulated stand. This period is calculated
from the date when any preliminary determination becomes a final
determination under section 28(3) of the Act (paragraph (l)(a))
or in the case of a final determination under section 28(6) the
date of the receipt of the notice of that determination
(paragraph (1)(b)).
9.   Other appeals under the 1987 Act must under paragraph (2\ of
Regulation 5 be brought within 28 days in the case of a general
safety certificate and 7 days in the case of a special safety
certificate from the "relevant date". Paragraph (3\ of
Regulation 5 sets down what is meant by the "relevant date".

10. Regulation 6 deals with fees. Paragraph (1) of Regulation 6
enables local authorities to determine the fee to be charged in
respect of an application (whether or not successful) for the
issue, amendment, replacement or transfer of a safety certificate
or in respect of an application for the cancellation of such a
certificate for a stand which has ceased to be a regulated stand.
Paragraph (2) provides that any fee must not exceed an amount
commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done by or on
behalf of the local authority.

HOC 96 /1988 ANNEX C


PART III OF THE FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT
1987 : ISSUE AND CONTENT OF SAFETY CERTIFICATES

Introduction
1.   This Annex provides some additional advice on the issue and
content of safety certificates which local authorities may care
to take into consideration when drawing up safety certificates
for regulated stands under Part III of the Fire Safety and Safety
of Places of Sport Act (the 1987 Act). Although directed at
certification under Part III, the underlying principles of the
advice in this Annex may also assist local authorities when
reviewing terms and conditions to be contained in safety
certificates for sports grounds designated under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA). Local authorities may find it
useful to cross-reference this Annex with Annex A to Home Office
Circular 71/1987 and Annexes C and D to Home Office Circular No
7/1986 - some of the advice of which is reproduced below.
2.   The following advice is given in good faith but it should be
remembered that only the courts can interpret on points of law.

Reasonable Safety
3.   Part III of the 1987 Act, like the SSGA, provides that terms
and conditions within safety certificates should be such as are
considered necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety.
It would probably be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,
to seek the absolute safety of everyone occupying a stand at a
sports ground. The courts might also be sympathetic to an appeal
against a term or condition which entailed expenditure on
measures to combat a risk which was seen to be remote or did not
arise at all at the particular ground or stand. Local
authorities should therefore consider operating on the principle
that the addition to safety which any particular measure will
produce needs to be balanced against its cost. In some cases
certain measures may have to be taken whatever the cost,
irrespective of the size or profitability of the undertaking.
But where the difficulty and cost of the remedy are high, and
careful assessment shows the risk is not significant, it may not
be necessary to insist on action; if the risk is significant it
may be possible to opt for a solution which will reduce it to an
acceptable level at modest cost.


General
4.   An application for a general safety certificate under Part
III should normally be accompanied by information about the
stand, a proper plan of the stand and its installations. In
practice, not all the information necessary to draw up a safety
certificate will always be provided at the time of the initial
application. However, local authorities are able to require, by
notice, under section 28(11) further details to enable them to
consider the application. For an application for a special
safety certificate under Part III much information would already
be available from the general safety certificate application?
but additional information may be required if, for example, the
activities which are to take place at the sports ground for which
a special safety certificate is needed are such that the
spectator accommodation in the stand is altered or affected.
5.   A special safety certificate under Part III is issued at the
discretion of the local authority (subject to a right of appeal).
There is no time limit in which a safety certificate, whether
general or special, has to be issued. However, a special safety
certificate will need to be issued before the event, allowing
time for any appeal. Local authorities may therefore wish to
give ground management advice on the likely time scale which will
be needed and to remind them that a last minute application might
constitute sufficient grounds for refusal. In general an
application lodged 3 months before an event should give
sufficient time for the procedures (including an appeal) to be
carried out. Local authorities may nonetheless feel able to
agree to a shorter period where they are satisfied that the
application can be finalised within the lesser period of time
given.

Consultation
6.   It is envisaged that consultation between the local
authority and ground management will take place in drawing up the
terms and conditions to be contained within any safety
certificate issued under Part III. In this way much valuable
information can be obtained in order to apply the principles of
the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) so as to
meet the safety needs of the particular stand(s) at the ground in
question (see also paras 9-15 below). Local authorities will be
aware of the statutory requirement to consult the police and, in
London and metropolitan counties, the fire authority, elsewhere,
the building authority, and are reminded of the potential
advantages of a safety team approach as a way of ensuring that
the professional knowledge and skills of the various disciplines
can be brought to bear on drawing up a safety certificate.

Scope and content of safety certificates
7.   Provision is made in section 27(6) for different terms and
conditions to be included in a general safety certificate for a
stand for different activities at the ground. Where a ground is
used for several activities local authorities may therefore wish
to include, as far as possible, all the activities within the
general safety certificate, reserving the need to issue a special
safety certificate for a "one off" event when the viewing
arrangements are likely to be affected in such a way as to
require additional considerations and safeguards which cannot be
included in the general safety certificate. Section 27 does not
have to vary to meet different needs, but as a general rule local
authorities may wish to consider inclusion of terms and
conditions which address
     a.   structural stability where elements of the stand are
     judged, from preliminary inspections, as likely to be
     inadequate for their intended function.
     b.   the maximum number of spectators who should be admitted
     to the stand(s) and different parts of it (them) bearing in
     mind the considerations set out in paragraphs 10 - 13 below;
     c.   the number, size and situation of entrances to and
     exits from the stand(s) or any part of it (them) including
     means of escape in case of fire or other emergency; and the
     means of access to any such entrances and exits;
     d.    requirements for entrances and exits and means of
     access to be properly maintained and kept free of
     obstruction;
     e.   other fire precaution measures;
     f.   the provision for crush barriers, if any, their number,
     strength and location;
     g.   provision for stewards, steward training, fire drill
     procedures, first aid.
     h.   need for records of maintenance, inspections and/or
     tests and training.
8.   If it is evident that a stand is rarely filled to capacity
the local authority may consider it proper to base the safety
requirements on the actual levels of attendance. In such
circumstances the terms and conditions of the general safety
certificate may not be sufficient for a particularly attractive
event or fixture when a larger than normal crowd can be expected
to attend. As some such fixtures could arise at relatively short
notice, local authorities may wish to work out in advance, the
modifications and/or additional controls to the normal terms and
conditions of the general safety certificate which would enable
an increase in the number of spectators to be accommodated; for
example, an increase in the limit might be conditional upon the
employment of additional stewards, or more sophisticated fire
fighting equipment with trained stewards to operate it.
9.   When drawing up terms and conditions in any safety
certificate local authorities will doubtless keep in mind the
advice of the Green Guide (see paragraphs 10 and 11 below) and
the "reasonableness" of the requirements (see paragraph 3 above).
The quality or standard of measures should be stated so that the
holder knows what is required under what conditions, and does not
have to rely on carrying out work "to the satisfaction of" or "as
may be required by" the authority. Terms and conditions
specifying work needed should include details of the increase in
the permitted spectator limit or, if there is no increase, the
restrictions on the capacity or operation if the work is not
done. The following are two examples of the sort of detail that
might, with adaptation to suit individual circumstances, be
included in a term or condition.

Example A.  (Where it is a condition that attendance records are
kept to a standard required by the authority).
"[Except as mentioned below] the holder shall keep a record [in
the form contained in Appendix   of this certificate] for [each]
[the] regulated stand to which this certificate applies of the
number of spectators admitted on each occasion when the stand[s]
is [are] used for the purpose of viewing the [specified]
activities at the ground [specified below] ...".
If a record is not required for low attendances an additional
clause might be added:-
"The number of spectators admitted on any occasion need not be
entered in the record described in paragraph   above where on any
occasion the total admission to the ground is certified by the
holder [in the record] as not having exceeded "x" by entering the
words [quote] which should be signed and dated by [the holder]."

Example B (where emergency lighting is the requirement)
"Emergency lighting for use in the event of failure of the
general lighting shall be provided on [exit] route(s) marked [
] on plan [   ] and shall include illuminated exit signs at exits
marked [   ] on plan [   ].

Emergency lighting provided under paragraph   above shall be
installed in accordance with paragraphs 166 to 169 of the Guide
to Safety at Sports Ground [except that .... ].
On completion of the installation a certificate of completion [in
the form specified in Appendix [ ] of this certificate] shall be
obtained from a [specify] and that certificate shall [be retained
by the holder] [sent within [x days] to the authority].
Until installation as required in paragraph    above is carried
out and a certificate obtained as in paragraph    above [exit
route/s marked [   ] on plan [   ] is/are not to be used by
spectators] [the number of spectators who are to be admitted to
the stand is restricted to [   ]] [and areas marked [    ] on plan
[   ] are not to be occupied].
On completion of installation and on obtaining a certificate of
satisfaction required in paragraphs [   ] above exit routes
marked [   ] on plan [   ] may be used and the number of
spectators who may be admitted to the stand is increased to [   ]
[and the area(s) marked [   ] on plan [   ] may be used by
spectators.]"
Application of the Green Guide
10.   The Guide is not a statutory code providing a set of rigid
requirements to be applied in all cases irrespective of the
individual circumstances. The diversity of regulated stands is
likely to be considerable, varying from basic, covered terracing
at, say, non-league football or rugby grounds to large, complex
buildings offering a variety of facilities to many thousands of
spectators. The advice in the Guide has therefore to be applied
to the situation that is seen to exist at a particular ground
having taken account of such factors as location, size,
construction, condition, together with the activities undertaken
at the ground, the numbers and density of spectators who occupy
the stand or stands and their movement patterns. The following
examples may help to illustrate how the Guide might be
interpreted without jeopardising reasonable safety.
     i.   Where it is known that the safe limit of the stand will
     not be exceeded (eg because total attendances are within
     that limit) there may be no necessity to regulate the
     admission or, in the case of standing accommodation, to
     require internal division in order to control the dispersal
     of spectators. In such circumstances, the number, strength
     and layout of barriers (if any) for standing areas need only
     reflect the number and density of the spectators to be
     accommodated.
     ii. A partly roofed, open sided, terrace allowing quick
     movement away from the covered area may not need fire-
     warning/detection systems.
     iii. The strength requirements for protective guard-rails on
     stairs, gangways or exit routes and balustrading in front of
     a row of seats may well vary. The last;of these is not, for
     example, usually subjected to high pressures. Similarly,
     side or end rails to seating rows will need to be designed
     to accommodate the forces to which they may be subjected.
     These may also vary and account should be taken of
     individual circumstances.
     iv. Where it is known that spectators vacate an area of a
     stand more quickly than envisaged by using the Guide's
     (notional) calculations, that knowledge may be taken into
     account when assessing requirements for safe egress from a
     stand.

Horseracing/greyhound racing
11.   Unlike crowds at some other sports where spectators are
essentially static for the duration of the event, there is a
common requirement for greyhound and horseracing spectators to be
mobile, with free movement to various internal parts of the stand
or racecourse to which they are admitted. Local authorities may
find that this mobility requirement regulates the density at
which the spectators congregate on terraced areas to below the
maximum of 54 persons per 10 square metres (paragraph 222 of the
Guide) for "static spectator sports". Even at well attended
meetings, where crowd densities are liable to be high (perhaps
approaching the maximum of 54 per 10 square metres) "surging" is
not generally experienced. Spectators will probably be static
for only a few minutes before moving off to other parts of the
stand or ground. This aspect of spectator behaviour should be
taken into account when considering the safety requirements of
the stand. For example, where barriers are judged to be
necessary at all, their function is most likely to be to channel
or direct safely the movement of spectators on the terrace, and
to mitigate against any "waterfall" effect of someone stumbling
at a critical moment, whilst simultaneously allowing the free
movement desired by spectators in between races. In such
circumstances, continuous barriers (see paragraph 113 of the
Guide) will probably not be the most suitable arrangement, and a
series of staggered short lengths may be appropriate; the
horizontal spacing between barriers should be commensurate with
the forces likely to be generated on the terraced areas.

12. In the case of horseracing, access and egress can often be
gained to and from a stand from the front where it discharges on
to an open "enclosure" area. Except for those parts of the stand
to which entry is gained by additional payment, eg reserved
seating or boxes spectator movement within this enclosure area
(including the stand) is not controlled. As a general rule
therefore it will not be appropriate, or possible, to include
terms and conditions in a safety certificate specifying the
maximum total number of spectators to be admitted to the stand or
requiring records of the total number of spectators so admitted.
This ought not to create undue difficulty especially when the
crowd density on standing areas of the stand is low and such
areas are occupied for relatively short periods of time. It
follows however that in setting terms and conditions geared to
the normal use of the stand the local authority will have to take
account of the possibility that everyone admitted to the
enclosure area may use the stand, - although at any given time
only a proportion of spectators will do so and even then will be
dispersed within it. These considerations may also apply to some
stands at greyhound racing courses.
13. Discussions with local management together with observation
and information about the numbers admitted to the particular
racecourse enclosure or stand at a greyhound racing stadium
should help to form a considered view on the level of use and
dispersal of spectators on which to base the terms and conditions
of the safety certificate. Where a racecourse or greyhound
stadium is occasionally used for a particularly attractive event
the local authority may wish to build into the safety certificate
additional terms and conditions to deal with that occasion as in
paragraph 8 above provided that they are satisfied that such
measures are sufficient to effect reasonable safety for the
number of spectators who are expected to attend.

       Dear Sir

       HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 97/1988
       FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987:
       PART III - SAFETY OF STANDS AT SPORTS GROUNDS

                  a.   STATUTORY GUIDANCE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE
                       UNDER SECTION 26(8)
                  b.   STATUTORY GUIDANCE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE
                       UNDER SECTION 34(2)

       Introduction
       1.   This circular introduces (a) Statutory Guidance under
       section 26(8) of the 1987 Act to local authorities in discharging
       their function of determining whether a stand at a sports ground
       is a "regulated" stand; and (b) Statutory Guidance under Section
       34(2) on inspections of sports grounds containing regulated
       stands.

       2.   Local authorities may find it useful to cross reference this
       circular with Home Office Circular No 96/1988 giving general
       guidance on the operation of Part III of the 1987 Act and also
       with Home Office Circular 72/1987 which covers Statutory Guidance
       under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 on inspections, of
       designated sports grounds.

       General

       3.         Both sets of Statutory Guidance are accompanied by
explanatory notes and commentaries. Local authorities are
reminded that whereas these supplementary commentaries are not
binding the Statutory Guidance under sections 26(8) and 34(2) is
mandatory.

Resource implications
4.   No resource implications result directly from the Statutory
Guidance under section 26(8) which provides no more than a basis
for determining whether, in borderline cases, a stand is a
regulated stand.
5.   Inspections of sports grounds containing regulated stands
under the Statutory Guidance made under Section 34(2) are not
expected to give rise to significant resource implications.
These inspections are not intended to be as detailed or the same
as those carried out by the local authority when drawing up, or
amending, a safety certificate; nor is it intended that they
should duplicate those required to be carried out by or on behalf
of the holder under the terms and conditions of the safety
certificate. Subject to the size, condition of a particular
sports ground and the stand or stands to be inspected, it is not
expected that inspections should take more than 2 man days per
ground on average and in some cases it may be less.

Supp1ementary
6.   Any enquiries about this circular or the Statutory Guidance
should be directed to
                                           Yours faitftfully

STATUTORY GUIDANCE UNDER SECTION 26(8) TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR
THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR FUNCTION UNDER SECTION 26(6) OF THE FIRE
SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987

The following guidance is given by the Secretary of State in
pursuance of section 26(8) of the Fire Safety and Safety of
Places of Sport Act 1987.

Purpose and Scope

1.   Local authorities are required by section 26(6) of the Fire
Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act) to
determine whether any and, if so, which of the sports grounds in
their areas provide covered accommodation in a stand for 500 or
more spectators to view activities at the ground. A certificate
under Part III of the 1987 Act is required for such a stand
(which expression is defined by section 26(11) of that Act).
This guidance provides criteria for the purpose of calculating
the number of spectators for whom such accommodation is provided.

Calculation of the capacity of the accommodation to view the
activities
2.   Both seated and standing accommodation to view the
activities at the ground should be taken into account and
aggregated as necessary.

3.   Where the accommodation consists of fixed seating for
spectators the capacity of that accommodation should be
determined as follows

     i.   where individual seats are provided, by counting the
     number of seats;

     ii.   where bench seating.is provided and

           a.   it consists of marked places, and

           b.   the result of dividing the length of the bench by
          the number of marked places is that no such place
          exceeds 550mm in length,

     by counting the number of places;".

     iii. for bench style seating where (ii) above does not
     apply by calculating on the basis that one person occupies
     each 530mm of benching and disregarding any portion of a
     bench of less than 530mm which remains after that
     calculation.

4.   Where the accommodation consists of a terraced or sloped
viewing area for standing spectators the capacity should be
determined by dividing the net standing area of the accommodation
in question excluding any gangways, stairways, landings by the
factor of 2.7 persons to 1 square metre.   (1 person to .37 square
metres)


5.   Where the accommodation (whether at ground level or above)
consists of a flat area without fixed seating, its capacity
should be determined by using the calculation of paragraph 4
above to a depth of up to 2 metres from the front of that part of
the accommodation in question from which the activities at the
ground can be viewed. Any area behind the 2 metres referred to
should be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the number
of spectators.

Supplementary advice and explanatory notes to the Statutory
Guidance to Local Authorities given by the Secretary of State
under section 26(8) of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of
Sport Act 1987


Introduction

1.   This advice supplements and comments on the Statutory
Guidance issued under section 26(8) of the 1987 Act. It does not
form part of the Statutory Guidance itself. The advice contained
in the following paragraphs is not binding on local authorities
and although it is given in good faith it should be remembered
that only the courts can rule authoritatively on the
interpretation of points of law.

Objectives of the Statutory Guidance
2.   The objective is to achieve a measure of consistency by
local authorities when they determine under section 26(6) whether
a stand is a regulated stand if there is doubt, or dispute as to
the stand capacity. The Statutory Guidance is not intended for
use for any other purpose. In most cases the capacity of the
accommodation will be manifestly above or below the 500 level.
Calculation
3.   The figures used in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Statutory
Guidance are notional. They are solely for the purpose mentioned
above and are only in respect of the covered areas of the stand
(which must be an artificial structure) used by spectators for
viewing activities at the ground. For bench seating consisting
of marked places paragraph 4 of the Statutory Guidance allows up
to the maximum width recommended in the Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds (the Green Guide). Otherwise, for example where such
seating does not have places marked, the notional figure of 530mm
is used instead. The figure of 2.7 persons per square metre for
standing spectators is in line with paragraph 222(b) of 'the
Green Guide'. It not only allows for potentially different crowd
densities and mobility requirements which, in practice, may apply
to different sports but also produces an area of similar size to
that for seated spectators (using the notional "unit width" and
allowing 610 mm to 760 mm for seat depth).
4.   Once the local authority have determined that a stand is a
regulated stand, the actual capacity permitted by any safety
certificate will where appropriate be determined by the safety
requirements for the stand. That figure may be less than 500
unless required remedial work is carried out on the stand.
5.   Local authorities may wish to bear in mind that in
calculating the capacity for standing accommodation the Statutory
Guidance refers to the net area, ie it excludes existing
gangways, landings, etc.

6.   Paragraph 6 of the Statutory Guidance applies to both ground
level and raised areas of a stand such as executive boxes,
balconies, together with bars, restaurants etc which are also
used for viewing. Although more people may be accommodated in
such areas, it is assumed that spectators are unlikely, in
general, to be able to view an event beyond a depth of 2 metres
from the limit of the viewing area. Local authorities will note
the discretion given by use of "up to" so that a iower figure can
be adopted, for example if the sight line is obscured for some
reason. Stands which contain multi facilities are liable to hold
well over 500 spectators so calculations under paragraph 6 of the
Statutory Guidance may not, in practice, prove necessary in such
cases.

STATUTORY GUIDANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES ON INSPECTIONS TO BE
CARRIED OUT UNDER SECTION 34 OF THE FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF
PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987 ON SPORTS GROUNDS CONTAINING REGULATED
STANDS

The following guidance is given by the Secretary of State in
pursuance of section 34(2) of the Fire Safety and Safety of
Places of Sport Act 1987.



General


1.   For the purpose of this guidance "regulated stand" has the
meaning given by section 26(5) of the Fire Safety and Safety of
Places of Sport Act 1987 and includes any installations in or
serving the stand which are the subject of terms and conditions
in the safety certificate.

2.   Each regulated stand at a sports ground in respect of which
a safety certificate under Part III of the 1987 Act has been
issued is to be inspected in accordance with this guidance.

3.   The local authority should be satisfied that inspections
under this guidance are carried out by a person or persons
qualified for that purpose.

Frequency of Inspections

4.   Where a sports ground has a regulated stand which is the
subject of a safety certificate and which, in the opinion of the
local authority, contains accommodation under cover for over
2,000 spectators to view activities at the ground an inspection
under this guidance of all the regulated stands at that sports
ground should be carried out in the calendar year following the
date of issue of the last safety certificate. Thereafter, an
inspection of the regulated stands under this guidance should be
carried out at least once in every calendar year following the
date of the last inspection.
5.   In any other case of a sports ground containing a regulated
stand or stands which is/are the subject of a safety
certificate(s) at least one inspection under this guidance of the
regulated stands at that sports ground should be carried out
within two years from the date of issue of the last safety
certificate. Thereafter, an inspection should be carried out at
least once in every alternate calendar year following the date of
the last inspection.

6.   Inspection should, where possible, include inspection of the
following certificates of testing and records as may be required
under the terms and conditions of the safety certificate to be
kept by the holder and/or submitted to the local authority in
respect of the regulated stands:

     a.   any certificate covering the testing of:-

          i.   strength/loading capacity of guard rails, hand
          rails, balustrading and any crush barriers

          ii.   condition, stability of the stand

          iii. inspections and condition of electrical
          installations.

     b.   any records of the following:-

          i.    spectator attendances where appropriate;

          ii.   accidents involving spectators;

          iii. maintenance and other inspections of components
          and installations together with identified deficiencies
          and recorded remedial measures taken;
          iv. tests and checks on emergency lighting, public
          address system, fire fighting equipment, fire warning
          system (if installed);

          v.   emergency evacuation procedures and any steward
          training sessions.

7.   Inspection under this paragraph relates to the regulated
stands only and should normally include inspection of the
following items:-

     a.   any part of the stand or stands where an accident or
     incident resulting in serious injury to spectators has
     occurred since the last inspection;

      b.   any recorded defect or deficiency which has arisen
     since the last inspection and which, in the opinion of the
     inspecting officer, would be likely to lead to an accident
     which could result in serious injury to spectators;

     c.   major remedial work carried out since the date of the
     last inspection;

     d.   all public stairways for their general condition, slip
     resistance; condition of hand rails for overt signs of
     weakness (see also (j) below), trip hazards especially at
     the head of stairways, adequacy of lighting and structural
     fire separation;

     e.   all egress routes used by the public, including
     emergency exit routes, for obstructions, operation of exit
     gates and/or doors, adequacy of sign-posting and lighting;

     f.   fire fighting equipment and fire warning system (if
     installed);

     g.   generally for the presence of any accumulation of
     litter;
    h.   any emergency lighting system including any generator
    or batteries;

    i.    any first-aid facilities and equipment;

    j.   10% of any crush barriers and other protective
    barriers on gangways, stairways, exit routes for overt signs
    of weakness which might signal the need for further testing,
    remedial action or (additional) restriction on the number of
    spectators allowed to occupy that part of the stand or
    stands;

    k.   10% of the terraces or viewing slopes for general
    surface condition, evenness and slip resistance;

     1.   anchorage and fastening of 10% of any fixedseating;

    m.    any provision for disabled people.

Where the inspection of a sample in paragraphs (j), (k) and (1)
reveals matters giving rise to serious concern for the safety of
spectators, all the items in that part of the stand(s) where the
sample indicated that there were deficiencies should be
inspected.



Testing of Equipment

8.   For each of the regulated stands at the sports ground the
following tests should, wherever possible, be carried out to
confirm that the following are in working order:

     a.   lighting, particularly on stairways and exit routes;

     b.   emergency lighting;

     c.   public address system, (including the proper
     functioning of zoning where this facility is part of the
     requirements of the safety certificate);
    d.   fire warning system (if installed);

     e.  10% of any metering system for recording the admission
     of spectators to parts of the stand or stands.

SUPPLEMENTARY ADVICE AND EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE STATUTORY
GUIDANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES GIVEN BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE
UNDER SECTION 34(2) OF THE FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF
SPORT ACT 1987

Introduction
1.   The following advice does not form part of the Statutory
Guidance given under section 34 of the Fire Safety and Safety of
Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act). The following advice is
given in good faith but it should be remembered that only the
courts can rule authoritatively on interpretation of points of
law.
General

2.   The Statutory Guidance follows similar lines to that which
accompanied Home Office Circular 72/1987 in respect of designated
sports grounds except that the Statutory Guidance under section
34(2) is limited to inspections of the regulated stands for which
a safety certificate is likely to have been issued.

3.   As the size, age, condition, type of seating (if any) and
use of the regulated stands, as well as the attitude or ability
of management, can vary considerably, the discretion of local
authorities to carry out more frequent and/or more extensive
inspections than those under the Statutory Guidance is not
restricted. The frequency and extent of the inspections under
the Statutory Guidance have been set at what is seen as a minimum
likely to achieve the objectives described below. It leaves
authorities with discretion to add to the inspections and
increase their frequency according to locally determined needs.
The Statutory Guidance also concentrates on certificated stands -
i.e. those which will be occupied by spectators. However, the
duty of section 34(1) of the Act applies to the whole of a sports
ground which contains a regulated stand irrespective of whether
or not a safety certificate has been issued. It will be for each
local authority to decide, in the light of local knowledge, the
extent of inspection of other parts of a sports ground which
contains a certificated stand, and the inspection requirement for
a sports ground containing an uncertificated stand. Local
authorities may wish to note that someadditional flexibility on
inspection frequency is built into theStatutory Guidance by the
use of the term "calendar year" rather than "12 months".
4.   Local authorities are reminded that inspections under
section 34 are in addition to, not a substitute for, those which
may be required to be carried out under the terms and conditions
of the safety certificate by or on behalf of the holder.
Objectives

5.   The object of inspection under the Statutory Guidance is
primarily to monitor the suitability of the terms and conditions
of the safety certificate in the light of any change in
conditions of the regulated stand and to help ensure that the
stand is maintained and occupied in compliance with these terms
and conditions.
6.   Inspections under the Statutory Guidance are not intended to
shift responsibility for safety away from the holder of the
safety certificate or ground occupier; rather they are to help
him succeed in achieving (and maintaining) safety standards
intended to be set by the certificate for the numbers of
spectators who are to be accommodated within the regulated
stands.
Inspection Team

7.   The Statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
section 34. Local authorities are however reminded of the advice
contained in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the supplementary notes and
guidance accompanying the Statutory Guidance issued with Home
Office Circular 72/1987.
Scope of Inspections
8.   Where a regulated stand or stands is the subject of a safety
certificate all the items listed in paragraphs 6 - 8 of the
Statutory Guidance should wherever possible be inspected and
tested. It is recognised however that there may be occasions
where one or more of these elements cannot, for some reason, be
inspected or tested at the same time. For this reason there is a
degree of discretion within paragraphs 6 - 8 of the Statutory
Guidance. In this way it is hoped to avoid the situation where
the local authority have to pay unnecessary repeated visits to a
ground in order to comply with the Statutory Guidance.
9.   The Statutory Guidance does not require that an inspection
should take place at any particular time so the local authority's
discretion to carry out an inspection whilst the ground is in use
is not restricted. An "in-use” or "during performance"
inspection could therefore constitute part of the inspection
required by section 34 even though it might not be sufficient
(having regard to the requirements of the Statutory Guidance) to
be an inspection itself.

Records
10. Local authorities will doubtless need to keep a record of
all inspections carried out under the Statutory Guidance and may
wish to consider whether a copy of any report/record could be
sent to the holder of the safety certificate.

             HOOLIGANISM


             We are directed by the Secretary of State to say that
             he is concerned that adequate arrangements should be
             made to prosecute swiftly defendants accused of
             committing offences in the course of sudden outbreaks
             of hooliganism such as have become the subject of
             considerable concern in recent months.

             2.  For swift action to be possible there need to be
             agreed arrangements at local level between the parts of
             the criminal justice system directly involved.  These
             arrangements should be such that they can be invoked
             and put into action at short notice.

             3.  The Home Office has consulted the Crown Prosecution
             Service, the Association of Chief Police Officers and
             the Justices' Clerks' Society about such arrangements
             and the points which they should cover.  The Appendix
             to this circular contains guidance based on those
             discussions.  Chief Constables, Chief Crown Prosecutors
             and Justices' Clerks are asked together to take the
             necessary steps to draw up plans for their areas in
             accordance with it.

              DISORDER:   CONTINGENCY PLANS



1.     INTRODUCTION

1.01   Outbreaks of hooliganism and disorder call for
rapid action both to deter further outbreaks and to
demonstrate the determination of the agencies involved
to act firmly against them.    Local contingency plans
should therefore be drawn up to provide an accelerated
procedure for bringing people quickly before the court
when the situation demands it.    This note, which has
been drawn up in consultation with the Crown
Prosecution Service, the Association of Chief Police
Officers and the Justices' Clerks' Society provides
guidance and a general framework for the development of
such plans.


1.02   Contingency plans will have many common
features, but there will also be differences according
to the nature of the areas involved.    Plans must match
local resoures and the circumstances in which they are
most likely to be put into operation.


1.03   If plans are to be effective they will require
the close co-operation of all parts of the system.
Local plans should therefore be drawn up jointly by the
police, the justices' clerk in consultation with his
justices, the CPS, the probation service, local defence
solicitors and others who may need to be involved.
Discussions should take place locally as soon as
possible. Court user groups where they exist may
provide a suitable forum.     The plan should be drawn up
in writing and copies should be made available to all
who may need it.


2.     CRITERIA POR IMPLEMENTING THE CONTINGENCY PLAN


2.01   There should be agreement between the justices'
clerk, the police and the CPS about the kind of
incident which should lead to the local contingency
                               2.


plan being used.      In some areas, or on some occasions,
it may need to be used when relatively few people have
been involved.      Elsewhere the situation will be such
that only incidents on a relatively large scale will
require the plan to be put into operation.       In centres
where courts are already being used to capacity in the
normal course of events care will be needed to ensure
that the implementation of a contingency plan does not
cause unacceptable disruption to existing
arrangements.       Even so the need to bring people accused
of involvement in incidents of disorder before the
courts quickly may mean that other cases suffer some
delay.     (See also paragraph 6 below).


2.02      In general, an accelerated procedure is not
likely    to be appropriate for serious charges which
will,    rightly,   raise questions such as advance
disclosure and mode of trial.       These questions will
need a    longer period to resolve.


3.        NEED FOR CONTIWOITY OF PERSONNEL


3.01     Contingency plans are likely to be activated at
relatively short notice, and possibly in circumstances
of some confusion.       Those responsible for putting them
into operation in each service should be identified in
advance and known to the other services.       It is
recommended therefore that each agency should nominate
a person at an appropriate level to take on this role.


4   .     ELEMENTS OF CONTINGENCY PLANS


4.01      The contingency plan should provide that where
the police judge that a situation meets the locally
agreed criteria, they should contact the clerk to the
justices and the CPS to notify them that people have
                                  3.

been arrested who should be brought to court under the
special procedures.      The clerk to the justices should
then make arrangements for a court to be ready to hear
the cases.     The CPS will need arrangements with the
police to have all witness statements submitted so that
an urgent review of the cases can be undertaken.         The
plan should provide for the police and the CPS to
consult at an early stage over the nature of changes to
be brought.


4.02    The contingency plan should place responsibility
on the police or the clerk to the justices for
notifying the various persons or agencies who will be
involved of the time and place of the hearing, and the
reason for the hearing.          In particular it is suggested
that the contingency plan should provide:-


       (i)   for the police to notify:-


             (a)    the probation service/social services?
             and


             (b)    the press,


       (ii) for the clerk to the justices or his deputy
             to notify:-


             (a)    the magistrates who will be
                    sitting;


              (b)   the CPS


              (c)   court staff, and


              (d)   the duty solicitor or other solicitors.
4.03    It may be helpful if the contingency plan
incorporates a check list, so that the various steps
that need to be taken are achieved in the right order
and at sufficient intervals to allow all the parties to
play their proper part.   The following factors should
be considered:-


(a)    Magistrates


       The clerk to the justices or his deputy, after
       consulting the chairman of the bench, will arrange
       for the attendance of a sufficient number of
       suitably experienced magistrates.    It will be a
       matter for local decision whether a standby rota
       of magistrates should be drawn up.    Continuity is
       important and as far as possible magistrates
       should be available to sit for as long as they are
       likely to be needed.


(b)    Police


       The police should ensure that witness statements
       are prepared and submitted to the CPS.    They
       should also ensure that arrangements are made for
       the warning of witnesses as soon as the hearing
       dates and venues are known.


(c)    Probation Service/Social Services


       The plan should identify the names and telephone
       numbers of senior probation officers and social
       workers who are to be contacted.     The involvement
       of social workers will normally only arise where
       persons under the age of 17 are to appear in
       court.
                              5.



(d)   Court Staff


      Court staff, including court clerks, ushers,
      administrative staff and building staff who are on
      standby should be notified of the time of the
      hearing if their services are required.   The
      number of staff to be brought in will depend on
      the number and nature of the cases falling to be
      dealt with.   Where the police do not undertake the
      task, sufficient staff must be on duty to maintain
      security and order within the court building.     If
      the number of persons arrested is too great for
      one court house to deal with, the contingency plan
      should provide for the clerks to the justices in
      the area to co-ordinate in the provision of
      sufficient resources.


(e)   Duty Solicitor


      Where a duty solicitor scheme is in existence, the
      contingency plan should make provision for
      sufficient numbers of duty solicitors to attend
      the court.


(f)   Other Solicitors


      If there is no duty solicitor scheme or the scheme
      is not geared to providing representation in these
      circumstances, the contingency plan should make
      provision for the clerk to the justices to contact
      the representative of the local law society who
      can then, in turn, notify other solicitors so that
      sufficient solicitors are available to represent
      those in custody.


(g)   Press


      The contingency plan should identify the press
                               6

       and other news media to be notified.      The
       situation should be explained fully to them.
       Proceedings should be conducted openly and should
       give no grounds for criticism of "secret justice*.


5.       THE COURT SITTIHG


5.01     It is suggested that magistrates and justices'
clerks should pay particular attention to the          following
points j -


(a)      The accused person's basic rights must        not be
overlooked.      Notwithstanding the pressures there may be
on the court to deal with a large number of persons,
the magistrates and the court clerk should be at pains
to ensure and to demonstrate that everyone who appears
before the court is being fairly treated and according
to the high standards demanded by the rules of natural
justice.


(b)     The magistrates should be aware before the
proceedings of their powers to deal with any disorder
or disruption of the court proceedings.


(c)     The number of persons brought before the court at
any one time should be kept as small as possible.           It
is often difficult to deal calmly and fairly with a
large number of people together, and experience has
shown that dealing with groups of people together
encourages disorder within the court room.


(d)     Courts should not sit for long periods without a
break.       A period of two-and-a-half to three hours
should not be exceeded without a break of at least one
hour.     Special sittings should be avoided wherever
possible.       Justice cannot be administered
satisfactorily at night when most of the people
involved are likely to be tired after a normal day's
work.
(e)   Care should be taken that cases are not called on
before the court until the persons charged have had a
sufficient opportunity, if they wish, of consulting a
solicitor.    The clerk to the justices, in making
arrangements for the court sitting, will need to
balance the need for an early court appearance with the
rights of the accused to see a solicitor and give him
instructions.     In particular, unrepresented defendants
who appear before the court should be asked:


      (i)    whether they are ready for the case to
             proceed, and


      (ii) whether they have had an opportunity to see
             a solicitor, or a friend or relative.


(f)   To ensure that cases brought on speedily under the
special arrangements proceed properly to final disposal
particular attention will need to be given to
maintaining control over adjournments.     There may be a
need for a senior justice and the justices' clerk to
maintain an overview of the progress of cases.        Where a
court has decided to proceed to deal with a case to
final disposal, the court must observe the requirements
of s.20(A) of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973
and s.2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 to obtain
social enquiry reports.


(g)   In this context it may be right to consider
whether the same bench(es) should hear all the cases
concerned.     While the magistrates may sometimes have to
impose similar orders in respect of a number of
defendants, they will need to consider each case
separately.     By the same token, the practices of the
court clerk should avoid giving the impression that any
particular order is likely to be made before it is
announced.
€.     ACTING STIPENDIARY MAGISTRATE


6.01   In the unlikely event of prolonged incidents, or
where there are cases which by their number or
complexity will take up a lot of court time
consideration should be given to making application to
the Lord Chancellor for the appointment of an acting
stipendiary magistrate, under s.15 of the Justices of
the Peace Act 1979, in order to avoid delays in the
hearing of cases.   If it becomes apparent that delays
are occurring the assistance of an acting stipendiary
magistrate should be sought before a large backlog of
cases has accumulated.   The appointment of an acting
stipendiary magistrate is a temporary one, and casts no
reflection on the justices' own ability to deal with
the number of cases coming before their court.
Nevertheless, exceptional circumstances may require
that special steps be taken in order to ensure that
justice is administered without delay.


6.02   Where such a situation arises, the clerk to the
justices should, after consulation with the chairman of
the justices and the secretary of the Lord Chancellor's
Advisory Committee, apply to the Lord Chancellor for
the appointment of an acting stipendiary magistrate.


6.03   The contingency plan should, if possible, make
provision for a court room, a court clerk and court
usher to be set aside in the event of an acting
stipendiary magistrate being appointed.
7.     SECURITY


7.01   Special arrangements may need to be made to
maintain security, both in and around the court
building.     Additional police may be required to assist
in the maintenance of order within the court room       and
in the court foyer.     Other courtstaff   such as ushers
and caretakers may also need to be employed to assist
in this respect.     Court ushers need to be properly
instructed and know when to call for assistance from
the police.


8.     PRESS


8.01   There will sometimes be a need for the court
to have a press spokesman.     Generally it is more
desirable for the clerk to the justices, to assume this
role than for it to be performed by a magistrate.
Subject to consultation with the bench chairman, the
contingency plea should provide that the clerk to the
justices, or his deputy, will act as press spokesman.


9.     ENFORCEMENT OF PENALTIES


9.01   When cases which are brought to court under
special procedures result in fines being imposed, it is
clearly important that penalties should be enforced if
the deterrent and declaratory effect of speedy disposal
is not to be lost.     Contingency plans should include
arrangements for the prompt follow up and firm
enforcement of fines.

      IMPLEMENTATION OF PART IV:     INDOOR SPORTS LICENCES


      The Secretary of State has now made a commencement order under
      section 50(2) of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport
      Act    ('the 1987 Act') bringing into force Part IV and such parts
      of Part V and the Schedules to the Act as depend on Part IV, with
      effect from 1 June 1988.      This is in accordance with the
      provisional timetable for implementation of the Act outlined in
      HOC/42/1987.     The Order is the Fire Safety and Safety of Places
      of Sport Act 1987    (Commencement No.   2) Order 1988.


      2      This circular introduces the provisions of Part IV.        The
      Annex puts these changes into context and gives advice on their
      operation and intended effects.      Fire Precautions Act 1971
      Circular No. 14 and Home Office Circular No 71/1987 give guidance
      on the provisions of Parts I and II of the 1987 Act which were
      given effect by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
      1987    (Commencement No.l) Order 1987   (SI 1987 No 1762).


      Implementation


      3      Sections 42 and 43 of Part IV of the Act amend Schedule 12 to
      the London Government Act 1963     ('the 1963 Act') and Schedule 1 to
      the Local Government    (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982       ('the
      1982 Act')    respectively.   (Sections 44, also in Part IV, amends
      parallel legislation in Scotland but will be the subject of a
      separate order,    introduced by the Secretary of State for
      Scotland,    also with the commencement date of 1 June 1988.)
4   Section 42 inserts three new paragraphs in Schedule 12 to tl
1963 Act, and section 43 substitutes a new paragraph for
paragraph 2 in Schedule 1 to the 1982 Act,             to require the
licensing of premises in which certain indoor sports events are
held.   Hitherto,   the only sports subject to licensing under the
1963 and 1982 Acts have been public boxing and wrestling
entertainments in London, and entertainments consisting of or
including indoor boxing, wrestling,             judo, karate or any similar
sport in areas of England and Wales outside London.


5   The licensing requirement is, however, limited to indoor
sports entertainments to which the public are invited as
spectators, where, with one exception,             the entertainment is the
principal purpose for which the premises are being used at the
time.   The exception is for a sports complex:            any such sports
entertainment,   even if it is not the principal purpose for which
the complex is being used on that occasion, will require the
premises to be licensed.


6   The provisions     in the existing licensing regime, contained in
the 1963 and the 1982 Acts as amended, are broadly preserved by
the 1987 Act.    These provisions include powers for the grant,
renewal,   transfer,   transmission,       variation and cancellation of
licences and for the prescription and enforcement of terms,
conditions and restrictions,      subject to which a licence is
issued, and provision for rights of appeal against decisions of
the licensing authority.       It is thought,        therefore,   that the
coming into force of the 1987 Act will not require a significant
change in the way in which local authorities administer the
licensing regime,      though it will undoubtedly increase the volume
of work to be done.


Supplementary


7   The information and advice in this circular and its Annex
explain the effect of the new legislation, but it should be added
that the Secretary of State has no power to determine a question
of law which ultimately is a matter for the courts.

ANNEX TO HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR                       19 /1988

FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987

Advice note by the Home Office on Part IV of the Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 ('the 1987 Act').


Introduction


The Popplewell Inquiry set up after the fire tragedy at Valley
Parade, Bradford,      recommended that indoor sporting events should
be subject to licensing.         The Government's response was contained
in a consultative document published in June 1986.                 Part IV of
the 1987 Act, which comes into force on 1 April 1988,                implements
these proposals.


2      Local authorities in England and Wales are already the
licensing authority for public entertainments              (including public
dancing or music or public contests or displays of boxing and
wrestling)    under powers conferred by the London Government Act
1963    ('the 1963 Act') and the Local Government            (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1982       ('the 1982 Act').       The 1987 Act, by amending
Schedule 12 to the 1963 Act and Schedule 1 to the 1982 Act,
requires that premises are not used for sports entertainments
except under and in accordance with the terms of a licence
granted by the Council of a London Borough,              the Common Council of
the City of London,      the Council of a district outside London or
the Council of the Isles of Scilly           ('the authority').


3      Schedule 3 to the 1987 Act amends Section 12 to the 1963 Act
in order to accommodate the new licensing provisions and to limit
the scope of the existing provisions relating to boxing and
wrestling licences.


S u b s t a n c e of the new regime for l i c e n s i n g indoor sports
entertainments


4      With one qualification,      the amendments to the 1963 and the
1982 Acts introduced by the 1987 Act require the licensing of
premises for any entertainment which consists of any indoor
sporting event to which the public are invited as spectators.
'Invite' has its ordinary everyday meaning:                     it implies that the
public are informed               (perhaps by word of mouth,       through the media
or by a notice at the door) that a sports entertainment will take
place at a particular time.                   The provision of a spectator area
for the public does not in itself constitute an invitation.                           A
'sporting event'               is defined in the 1987 Act as any contest,
exhibition or display of any sport, and                     'sport',   in its turn,       is
defined as including any game in which physical skill is the
predominant factor and any form of physical recreation which is
also engaged in for purposes of competition or display, except
dancing in any form.                   'Premises'   are defined as any building and
any tent or inflatable structure and part of a sports complex
(see paragraph 7 below).                   There is no lower limit to spectator
numbers below which the premises do not require to be licensed.
The licensing requirement applies equally to council-owned as to
any other premises.


P r i n ci pa l p ur p o s e    rule


5     The qualification is that a licence is only required for an
occasion where the sports entertainment is the principal purpose
for which the premises are being used on that occasion,                       though
this does not apply to a sports complex                     (see paragraph 7 below).
The intention is, for example,                     that a darts competition in a
public house should not require to be licensed but premises hired
for the specific purpose of, say holding a darts competition
would require to be licensed.                      The introduction of the 'principal
purpose rule' may result in some deregulation of indoor boxing,
wrestling,        judo, karate etc. entertainments.


S ports complexes


6      If any part of a sports complex is being used for a sports
entertainment,           that entertainment must be licensed even if it is
not the principal purpose for which the complex is being used on
that occasion.             A sports complex is defined as a building which
provides accommodation and facilities for both those engaging in
sport and spectators,                  and the parts of which are so arranged that


                                               -    2   -
one or more sports can be engaged in simultaneously in different
parts of the building.            The intention here is to overcome the
problem of deciding whether,              in a building in which several
sporting events may be proceeding simultaneously,                 any one is the
principal purpose for which the premises are being used.


The p ow er s of the l ic e n s i n g a u t h or i ty


7    The new powers of the licensing authority and duties and
rights of (prospective) applicants in respect of licences for
indoor sports are exactly as they were for public boxing and
wrestling entertainments in London and entertainments consisting
of, or including indoor boxing, wrestling,                 judo, karate or any
similar sport in areas of England and Wales outside London.


8     The powers of the authority may be described briefly as the
power to impose general terms, conditions and restrictions when
granting,     renewing or transferring licences;             to vary those terms
conditions and restrictions;              to cancel a licence on request from
the licence -h old er ; to revoke a licence when the licence-holder
is convicted of an offence under the relevant licensing
provisions;      to grant licences provisionally; and to charge a
reasonable fee for the grant,              renewal,     transfer or variation of
licence.      The 1987       Act now provides for the payment of a
reasonable fee for           the variation of a licence in England and
Wales,    thus bringing it in line with the position in London.
This does not apply to            an application made before 1 January 1988
when Section 46 of           the 1987 Act came into force.


Peri od of v a l i di ty of licences


9     The authority may issue a licence either for a set period of
not more than a year - and it will remain in force for that
period unless it is cancelled or revoked - or for one or more
occasions specified in the licence.


G i v i n g of notice


10     In L o nd on , the applicant for the grant,            renewal or transfer
of a licence for a set period must give the licensing authority
                                            - 3 -
(the Council),   the Commissioner of Police for the area in whicl
the relevant premises are situated, and the fire authority at
least 21 d a y s ' notice of his intention to make an application;      if
he is applying for an occasional sports licence (ie for one or
more specified occasions) he must give the Council and the fire
authority   (but not the commissioner of police) 14 d a y s ' notice.


11   In England and Wales outside London,     the applicant for the
grant,   renewal or transfer of an entertainments licence, whether
it is for a set period or for particular occasions, must give the
district council or the council of the Isles of Scilly,       the chief
officer of police for the area in which the relevant premises are
situated, and the fire authority at least 28     d a y s ' notice of his
intention to make an application.


Loss of exemptions for indoor boxing and wrestling entertainments
in London


12   Hitherto, boxing and wrestling entertainments provided by
travelling showmen at a pleasure fair, by members of the Boy
Scouts' Association or any organisation consituted by the Boy
Scouts' Association in pursuance of their charter, by any school
or by a bona fide association,    club, hospital or society have not
been subject to licensing under the      1963 Act as amended, but
these exemptions are removed by the      1963 Act as amended by the
1987 Act if the events take place indoors:      (Entertainments by
travelling showmen continue to be subject to licensing under the
Public Health Act 1961).


Outdoor boxing and wrestling entertainments


13   In London, boxing and wrestling entertainments which are
held wholly or mainly in the open air will continue to be subject
to licensing under the 1963 Act as amended unless they are
provided by a travelling showman at a pleasue fair, by members of
the Boy Scouts' Association or of any organisation constituted by
the Boy Scouts' Association in pursuance of their charter, by any
school or by a bona fide association,     club, hospital or society
not carried on for profit.     In England and Wales outside London
outdoor boxing and wrestling entertainments will, as before,         not
require to be licensed under the 1982 Act.

     First Aid


     14       Concern was expressed in Parliament during and after the
     passage of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987
     about the provision of first aid at indoor sports
     entertainments.                It is, of course,                  for the licensing authority to
     set the terms, conditions and restrictions under which a licence
     is issued for indoor sports entertainments,                                 but they will no
     doubt remember that they have the power to require the provision
     of first aid staff and facilities and in appropriate cases make
     that provision a condition under which a licence is issued.


     T r a n s i t i o n a l p ro v i s i o n s


     15       Boxing and wrestling licences,                             granted before 1 June 1988
     for indoor premises in London under paragraph 4 of Schedule 12 to
     the 1963 Act, will be treated as though they had been granted
     under the new paragraph 3A Schedule 12 of the 1963 Act inserted
     by the 1987 Act               (see paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to the 1987 Act).


     16       Where an application has been made before 1 June 1988 and
     not withdrawn,              for the use of premises for an indoor sports
     entertainment which will be licensable under the 1963 Act or the
     1982 Act by virtue of Section 42                              or Section 43of the 1987 Act,
     the use of the premises for that                              purpose will continue to be
     lawful until the disposal of the                              application.       (See paragraph 8
     of Schedule 5 to the 1987 Act.)

 WAS HANDLED AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?



 IMO




FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A S T E W AR D , WAS THERE ANYTHING

SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS MATCH WHICH YOUR OPINION

MADE IT DIFFERENT FROM SIMILAR PREVIOUS MATCHES?



Yes

At 1 -30pm the West Stand was virtually empty.         This was unusual

f o r a s em i- f i na 1.

Also   I have never experienced so many late arrivals as on that

day.



IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO

THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY ?



I believe that this was a mass         protest by Liverpool   fans

who were upset by the ticket allocation and the layout of

Hillsborough ground i.e. their insistance that they should have

had Kop e n d „     I believe   that all those fans without tickets

came determined to get into the ground by any means

wh a tsoever„

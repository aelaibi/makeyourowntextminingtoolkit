        CHAPTER FIVE

A TRAGEDY QCJT OF A DISASTER




            219
     Introduction

     At     the       outset of this Project there was               no    intention           to

     develop          the research around the Disaster itself.                    While        it

     was     considered          important        to    evaluate    and    critique           the

     Inquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor, the events leading up

     to the Disaster and the causes/reasons for the Disaster were

     outside          the     remit     of the Project.      Further,        it   was         not

     considered             necessary     to     interview   bereaved        families          or

     survivors in order to develop a post-Hillsborough                            analysis.

     On     this basis families were not approached.                      However,~ the

^    Project          was contacted at its inception by the Secretary                         of

     the     Hillsborough         .Families Support Group and             all      families

     were    circulated with information on the Project's work                                and

     invited to contact researchers if they wanted to contribute.

     Also,        a    written account of the Project and                 it©     terms        of

     reference         was      published in Interlink, the journal                of         the

    . Hillsborough: Survivors' Group.



     In     the       early days of the Project it soon              became        apparent

     that     the       circumstances of the immediate aftermath                    of        the

     Disaster, through the evening and into the night of the 15th

     April, constituted a major problem for many of the                            families

     interviewed.             Their      concerns focused on the           location           and

     operation of the various sites established to respond to the

     Disaster,          the adequacy of the Hillsborough gymnasium                       as     a

     temporary              mortuary,      the     procedures      adopted        for         the

     identification             of the dead, information and              communications



                                                  220
concerning missing relatives, the taking of statements after

identification           and the role and function of the              police      as

the     co-ordinating agency-           As L^rd Justice Taylor            excluded

these issues from the remit of his Inquiry and as there                           was

no     other public investigation or assessment of the                     adopted

procedures and their impact on families, it was decided that

such an investigation would form part of the Project's First

Report.



Statements were taken from and interviews held with m a n y ^ f

the    bereaved      families who frankly,           and     often     painfully,

shared     their     personal experiences           with     the     researchers.

Interviews were requested with senior officers of the                        South

Yorkshire     Police,        the South        Yorkshire     Ambulance      Service

(SYMAS),      the        Medico-Legal     Centre,     the     Hospitals           and

Sheffield Social Services.              These were granted, at the               most

senior     level,        with the exception of Social           Services         [1].

Each of the personnel interviewed not only held high                        office

but also had been on duty in a major decision-making role on

the    day.      Finally, interviews were held also                with     people

directly involved with the help and counselling of                        families

throughout         the    night   of     the    Disaster.      The        shortest

interviews       took two hours with several lasting as                   long     as

five    hours.      Where possible, and with the agreement of                     the

interviewees,        interviews     were taped.           Otherwise     verbatim

notes were taken.



This    chapter is divided into three main sections.                       Section


                                        221
•
          One    deals with the setting-up, operation and                   co-ordination

          of the main sites employed in the immediate aftermath of the

          Disaster.       These were: the Hillsborough gymnasium, its                         use

          as the 'emergency area' and as a temporary mortuary; the two

          hospitals handling accidents and emergencies; the                        Hammerton

          Road    Boys' Club, as the 'holding centre' for those                      seeking

          information      on    missing relatives or friends;               the     Medico-

          Legal    Centre,       incorporating the city         mortuary,          pathology

          unit    and coroner's court; the co-ordination and control                           of

          the operation; the organisation of counselling.                     The        second

          section deals with the personal experiences of the families,

          and     those   responding        to   their    needs,      as    they         sought

          information,       access       and help to find      the    whereabouts             of

          their    missing       relative's.     Of central importance             here       are

          their     experiences of the identification procedures and                          the

          taking     of   statements.        Finally, the third            section       is    an

          evaluation of the adequacy, effectiveness and impact of                             ths

          entire operation.


          Section O n e : Accommodating a Disaster

    1.    The Hillsborough Gymnasium

    1.1   The gymnasium at the Hillsborough ground was being used as a

          rest     and    eating        room for the     police when        the     Disaster

          occurred.       It was cleared of tables and chairs in order                         to

          use it to accommodate the injured and dead.                      This was not an

           'on    the     spot' decision. The gymnasium was                designated          an

          emergency       area     in    1986 when     senior   police,           fire        and



                                                 222
•
          ambulance officers liaised with Sheffield Wednesday Football

          Club     in    establishing           the    Major     Incident     Plan         for    the

          Hillsborough ground.                Coincidentally, the ambulance                  officer

          who had initiated the plan was present at the ground on                                 the

          day    and     he        was the first       ambulance       officer       to      respond

          formally to the Disaster.                   In evidence he stated:


                        We knew the ground pretty well, the
                        Police, the Fire and ourselves and
                        it was obvious from the onset of the
                        meeting that the only access to the
                        ground   was   via   the   gymnasium
                        entrance. [2 ]                                                 -

^ 1.2     This    officer           witnessed the scenes on the pitch                  after      the

          game had been stopped and he agreed with a colleague that he

          would return to the duty ambulance, radio control and                                begin

          to prepare the gymnasium area.                     In effect he operationalised

          the Major Incident Plan.                At that time, however, his request

          was     limited to the second standby vehicle and                       he       informed

          control       that he was dealing with a ■'minor incident” at                           the

          ground.


    1.3   During the first, chaotic moments of the Disaster, effective

          communication             and     co-ordination was lacking.              The      Deputy

          Chief     Ambulance Officer, also at the ground,                       received         the

          dead    and         injured       as they were evacuated           from      the     pitch

          directing           them to the gymnasium or to the ambulances as                       he

          considered          appropriate [3 ].         The police       controlled          public

          access        to        the     gymnasium although      it    is    the      considered

          judgement           of many witnesses that there was               no      officer-in-

          charge.            On     the    pitch, behind Leppihgs Lane              and      at   the


                                                       223
1.4   gymnasium       there was no clear leadership or direction.                      The

      Inquiry      evidence      of Deputy     Chief    Metropolitan        Ambulance

      Officer      Hopkins      was that on his arrival at          the     gymnasium

      there was no sign-of a senior police presence:


                   Q.    So you had been there twenty
                         five minutes anyway before you
                         saw a police officer?

                   A.    Well, he was the only ons I
                         recognised I hadn't seen anybody
                         els© I recognised.  C43


l.5   As the full realisation of the extent of the Disaster became

      apparent the Head of South Yorkshire C.I.D. Detective                        Chief

      Superintendent Addis, took overall charge of the                    operation.

      He stated that the use of the gymnasium, "was quite right in

      the    circumstances as there was nowhere else with the                      room"

      [5].      He      travelled to the ground and        briefed        the    police

      officers present at the gymnasium as to their roles and ,the

      procedures        which    would   be    adopted.      This   was         done     in

      accordance        with the Association of Chief          Police       Officers ^

      (ACPO) nationally agreed plan.                He stated emphatically             that

      it     was his decision to use the gymnasium as               the     temporary

      mortuary       and to carry out the identification of the                   bodies

      at the gymnasium.          He stated:

                     I saw it as an ideal situation, if
                     you don't mind me saying, to put all
                     the eggs in one basket.  [6 ]


1.6   This    is     disputed, however, by the Deputy          Chief       Ambulance

      Officer who also was present at the gymnasium.                  According to



                                              224
      him,     Detective Chief Superintendent Addis arranged to                         have

      the     dead    bodies       transported from        the    gymnasium        to    the

      Medico-Legal        Centre before 6 p.m. on the Saturday                    evening.

      Accordingly, ambulance workers were sent to the Medico-Legal

      Centre to assist in the operation and twelve ambulances were

      deployed at the ground to transport the bodies.                       The initial

      plan was that two ambulances each would take three bodies to

      the Medico-Legal Centre at fifteen minute intervals in order

      to facilitate staggered arrivals.                  It was projected that alt"

      bodies would have been transported by 7 p.m. [7].



1.7   The    Medico-Legal          Centre   received a phone         call        from    the

      police     early     on    which explained that            there     had    been     a

      disaster and that the Medico-Legal Centre should be prepared

      to receive bodies.           The manager of the Centre stated that it

      was difficult to establish whether identification would take

      place at a temporary mortuary or at the Medico-Legal Centre.

      The    Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer stated that                     the    agreed

      plan     was altered on the arrival of the Coroner,                    Dr    Stefan

      Popper,        at    the     gymnasium.      The    Coroner,       under      whose

      jurisdiction        the bodies were held, was of the opinion                      that

      all    bodies       should     be identified       at   the    gymnasium          [8 ].

      Ambulances      were       dispatched to collect those             dead     at     the

      hospitals       and transport the bodies back to               the     gymnasium.

      The     Coroner      has stated that the use of the                gymnasium      was

      never     in question as it was already accommodating the                         dead

      and     therefore      was     operational as       a   temporary         mortuary.

      Further, he stated that the decision to return bodies to the


                                             225
           gymnasium       "was my decision" [9].               He agreed with          Mr     Addis

           that     it was imperative to hold all bodies at                      one        location

           and    to have moved bodies to the Medico-Legal                       Centre        would

           have caused further delays to the identification                            procedure.

           Dr Popper concluded:


                      We   weren't going to break     our
                      procedure, we would have been in a
                      worse mess than we were already.
                       CIO]

    l #g    The extent to which the Coroner's decision was influenced by

           the    Home Office pathologist, Professor Usher, has been                             the
t
           subject    of      speculation.          Dr Popper stated that              he     worked

           closely    with      Professor Usher and it has been                   stated        with

           reference to Professor Usher's authority that "His word                               was

           law” [11]. As the temporary mortuary became                      operational the

           police consolidated their co-ordinating, communications                               and

           organisational roles as central to the procedure.                            A     social

           worker present in the gymnasium stated:


                      Information towards the later part
                      of the evening was starting     to                               ■■~
                      become more heavily controlled -
                      about who it went to. [123


    1.9    The    gymnasium was segregated into three areas.                           The     first

           area   housed       the     dead,       the      second   accommodated             police

           officers     on     standby        to deal with the         bodies         and     handle

           identification            and     the    third     was    set   up     to         provide

           counselling        for and to take statements from                   the    bereaved.

           Sheets    were     hung         from the      gymnasium's       nets        to     ensure

           screening.        Detective Superintendent Addis stated:


                                                      226
                      It would have been too traumatic for
                      relatives to be expected to walk
                      along rows and rows of bodies.  [13]


1.10   For continuity,a police officer was assigned to each body

       and then remained with that body until eventually it was

       handed over at the Medico-Legal Centre after identification.



1.11   Mr    Addis stated that he sought the approval of the              Coroner

       for     what     he considered was the appropriate        procedure * for

       identification.          It was agreed that the facial area of           each

       victim     would be photographed using a Polaroid camera.                 The

       photographs       were    given    a    number,   corresponding     to    the

       bodies, and were displayed on boards in the entrance area to

       the     gymnasium.       Before being photographed      each      face    was

       washed by police officers who were provided with buckets                   of

       water and sponges [14].           The bodies were laid out in rows on

       the floor.



1.12   Those    waiting to identify bodies had to wait outside,                 some

       sitting        on buses, for a considerable length of time.              Once

       inside the entrance area relatives were shown the full range

       of photographs.        On recognising a face, the number was noted

       by a police officer and the appropriate body was lifted onto

       a     trolley    and wheeled through the gymnasium        to    the      main

       entrance.        The   body bags were slightly       unzipped     and     the

       bodies    were covered with sheets [15].           On viewing the        body

       the     sheet was removed.        Once a positive identification          was

              made    detectives       took     full     statements.        Detective          Chief

              Superintendent         Addis     stated     that     "detectives         were     also

              counsellors at this stage" [1 6 ].             Social workers, clergy and

              members    of voluntary agencies were on hand to                     counsel          the

              bereaved         and      provide         pr&ctical         assistance.               On

              identification, bodies were transported by ambulance to                               the

              Medico-Legal        Centre.      By 4.30 a.m. Sunday morning,                  seventy

              four    bodies     had    been identified          and     transported          and     a

              decision     was       taken    to halt     proceedings.           The    remaining

    *         unidentified bodies were taken                 the Medico-Legal Centre.

        2.    The Hospitals

        2.1   The    two hospitals used in theemergency response                       were         the

              Northern     General       and    the Royal        Hallamshire.          The     Major

              Incident     Plan       for the Hillsborough ground            specified          that

              casualties should be taken to the Northern General with                               the

              Royal Hallamshire in reserve.               Evidence given to the Inquiry

              verified this arrangement:


                         Q.      I think the arrangement as per
                                 the   plan was    that   initial
                                 casualties would be taken to the '
                                 Northern General? - A. Yes.

                         Q.      With the Hallamshire             as       the
                                 reserve? - A. Yes.               [17]


        2.2   Although the Plan was operational on the day of the Disaster

               it    is important to note that Senior Administrators at                         both

               hospitals were unaware of the designated order of                        priority.

               According       to     their    statements        the     hospitals      work         in


                                                       228
          conjunction with each other and alternate responsibility for

          Accident    and       Emergency       admissions.        Therefore         any    plan

          ideally should have allowed for this standard arrangement.



    2.3   The   hospitals           responded    swiftly      to   the    Disaster           and

          accommodated         large numbers of injured and              those       searching

          for   relatives or friends.             In the first hour following                the

          Disaster the Northern General admitted eighty-eight patients

          injured    at     the Hillsborough ground.               Eleven   people          were

          admitted dead or they died in the accident department .‘"■•Two

1         people died in the hospital.               Some of the dead were taken to

          the   hospital        mortuary for a short time.            While      there       was

          considerable space available in the hospital mortuaries, the

          pathologist          at      the   Royal    Hallamshire        considered            it

          appropriate          to return bodies to Hillsborough and all                     those

          certified       as    dead     at the hospital were         returned         to     the

          gymnasium for identification.


    2.4   The following table illustrates the numbers of patients who

          attended or were admitted to the two hospitals [18]:

    3.    Hammer ton Road Bovs' Club

    3.1   a     disused boys* club was the focal point for people                             trying

          to          locate         family     and        friends.         Detective          Chief

          Superintendent Addis described it as being a                         holding             area

          for       relatives         [19].    The intention was that              people      would

(         wait      at    the boys' club before being taken                   to     the      nearby

          Hammerton         Road       Police Station where they gave                details          of

          those        missing.        Having given the relevant information                       they

          returned         to the boys' club, registered as they entered                             and

          then waited for information.                     If descriptions given            matched

          those        of bodies in the gymnasium they were                    transported             to

              the   gymnasium         in   order      to    await     identification.                The

              facilities at the boys' club were poor ( e . g . one                       telephone)
                                 i

              and   the    condition          of the building was           bleak.       Mr    Addis

              confirmed     that       the    boys' club was          used    because         of     its

              proximity to the Police Station.                     He considered that it was

              as, “adequate as it could be in the circumstances...”                                [2 0 ].

              A Roman Catholic priest who assisted the bereaved                            described

              it as, "...like a waiting room for the police station                                [2 1 ].



    3.2       Although      it       is not clear who took overall control                    at      the

              boys'      club, it is clear that the actions of those                        involved

              in    helping      in     the club were guided           by    what     the      police



                                                       230
               wanted.      The Director of Sheffield Social Services stated:



                            The boys' club was no; ideal                   for
                            receiving   people     but it                  was
                            important that it was close to                 the
                            police station.   [2 2 ]


         3.3   At     the   boys'     club a disparate group              of    social workers,

               voluntary       agency staff, clergy and volunteers were on                        hand

               to give comfort and support to people as they waited.



     jr 4 .    The. Medico-Legal Centre
     1   4.1   The     Medico-Legal Centre in Sheffield incorporates the                          city

               mortuary, the pathology department and the Coroner's                          Court.

               The mortuary is used to store the bodies of people who                             have

               died suddenly or in            suspicious circumstances and also               those

               who    have died from          particular diseases.             Onthe day of        the

               Hillsborough         Disaster there was one mortuary technician                      on

               duty     and one on call.        On notification of the              Disaster        by

               the police a further seven technicians were called in.                              The

               police indicated that bodies would be sent to the                       mortuary.
*'                                                               -    -                      -


               The Centre manager, however, had difficulty in                       establishing

               whether      it was intended to establish a                temporary     mortuary

               for     identification purposes.            Fans began to arrive          at        the

               Centre at 4 p.m. following instructions that the dead                             would

               be     transported      from    the   ground.         As    discussed         above,

               however,     a decision was taken            at the ground to deploy                the

               gymnasium       as      a       temporary mortuary          until after             the

               identification of the dead.            Consequently the first body did

               not    arrive    at     the Medico-Legal Centre             until     10.06        p.m.

•
              (Saturday evening).            The last body was received at 6.05 a.m.

              (Sunday       morning).        While the plan was to have                all        bodies

              identified at the gyranasium, the last fifteen bodies arrived

              at the Centre still unidentified.



        4.2   The bodies of the dead were transported by ambulance,                                three

              at     a time, from the gymnasium to the                 Medico-Legal          Centre.

              The reception procedure adopted at the Centre was to undress

              the    dead,     record       valuables in       their       possession        and     to

    {         identify       each body with a number.               The weight and        size       of
I

              the    body     also was recorded.            The police assisted              in    this

              procedure       following a request for help from the manager                          of

              the Centre.



        4.3   Prior to the Disaster the most bodies to be admitted in                               one

              day    was     three.     Although there was            accommodation           in    the

              refrigerators for 8 ixty-five bodies, there were only                           forty-

              five     trays until twenty more were sent for two days                         later.

              The      remaining        bodies    were       laid    out    on     the        floor.

              Fortunately,         only a week earlier the Centre                had     installed

              chiller      units which were operationalised over                   the       weekend

              and    which     allowed temperatures to be dropped to                     keep       the

              bodies       cool.    The post-mortems began on the Sunday                     morning

              and     were     completed         by   Monday        lunch-time.        Teams         of

              pathologists         worked    alongside each other to              complete          the

              post-mortems.

  5 .i   Although        the     gymnasium        was the         designated       area        for    an

         emergency at the Hillsborough ground, on the 15th April                                     the

         pitch     itself        and the area behind the Leppings                       Lane     stand

         became     'emergency           areas'.          This    was    due    primarily             to

         evacuation of the dead and injured from the terraces through

         the     tunnel or onto the pitch through the pen gates.                               It     is

         important        to     consider the co-ordination of                  the       emergency

         services in these areas.

         concerning        the circumstances of the Disaster including                               the

         events     on     the pitch.       There is no intention                  to     reiterate

         that     evidence        but there are several issues                  emphasised            in

         people's     accounts to the Project.                    Many fans        escaped       onto

         the pitch and most of the injured and dead were carried onto

         the     pitch.         The    police      compilation          of -video         evidence

         submitted        to     the     Taylor         Inquiry    and    other     documentary

         material        £231    clearly         demonstrates        that      there      was         no

         organised or prepared response by the police when they                                  were

         first      confronted           with     the     Disaster.         They        failed        to

         recognise        the problem in the crowd and reacted                       to     initial

         attempts     to        escape     the     crush     by     preventing          supporters

         gaining     access           to the pitch.        Before the        game       kicked-off

         fans pleaded with police to open the gates in the                               perimeter

         fencing.     One man, Eddie Spearritt, whose fourteen year                                  old

         son had fainted, shouted at a policeman, who was facing                                     him


                                                 23 3
              and    who was less than six feet away, to open the gate                 near

              to    him.   The policeman ignored his shouts,        'he just      stared

              at    me" [243.    In desperation the man pulled and punched               at

              the fence.      He stated:

                           I was trying to knock the fence down
                           with my hands when I realised he
                           wasn*t go ing to open the gate.   My
                           hands were full of cuts and holes.
                           [25]



        6.2   Eventually he passed out, but survived.          His son died.            His
    (
(             anger    and    frustration   remains   clear    in    the     following

              statement:


                           The Perimeter fences have got to go.
                           I know that when our Adam    fainted
                           I could have thrown him over the
                           wall.   He might have had a
                           arm or leg but he'd be alive. [26 j


        6.3   Further,       a number of fans were returned to the         pens    after

              they    had climbed the fences.      One man managed to         help      his

              sons    climb     over   the fence and onto     the   pitch.        He    was

              relieved       that they were safe despite his        own    predicament.

              Relief, however, was short-lived.        He stated:



                           I saw the gate between the railings
                           of the two sections being opened but
                           could not believe my eyes when a
                           policewoman    grabbed   my    small
                           thirteen year old son and pushed him
                           through the gate back onto        the
                           terraces.   She began to scream
                           shout at people to clear the
                           and became almost hysterical.   [27]



                                             234
    6.4   A     father   whose     son    died    and     who   was   himself       injured

          described       how      he    perceived       the    situation      from     his
          disadvantaged position:



                      I could see that there' was a narrow
                      gate onto the pitch several yards to
                      my right. People were screaming at
                      a policeman walking past in front of
                      us to open it but he was oblivious
                      to    the    request... I    saw   a
                      photographer   taking pictures    of
                      us... [283


/ 6.5     The    pitch   became     an     area     of   confusion    with     no     clear
(
          organisation or anyone prepared to take charge.                    A nurse who

          attended the injured on the pitch stated:

                      The   scene  around   me   remained
                      completely chaotic with    everyone
                      trying to do their own thing, fans
                      and police all mingling together.
                      [293


    6.6   Crucially      it   is   clear     from    video      footage,     spectators'

          evidence and interviews with senior ambulance officers                       that

          many fans used their initiative                in responding to the         needs

          of the dying and injured.           The same, however, cannot be said

          of the police.        As one supporter recalled:



                      The control by the police during the
                      operation was absolutely negative.
                      No-one seemed to be in charge at
                      all, and it was the Liverpool fans
                      who took the initiative in dealing
                      with the emergency situation. [303


    6.7   The fans were the first to tear down the advertising                      boards

          and    put them to use as makeshift stretchers.                   They    pulled


                                            235
people from the pens, administered first-aid and transported

the     injured        and    dead to the Penistone    Road      end    of     the

ground.        His praise was unrestrained:



               Supporters were wondeTful        carrying
               bodies. There were twenty        vehicles
               at Penistone Road but they       couldn't
               get in. [313


Ambulances        could      not gain access to the pitch        because        of

structural alterations at the ground (a wheelchair ramp                        had

been     built but SYMAS had not been informed).               The      initial

police     response          at a senior level to the Disaster         was      to

send     for     reinforcements and dogs to deal          with      what      they

wrongly perceived to be crowd disorder.               On the pitch police

officers        appeared      to be without direction,     mingling           with

angry     and     frustrated supporters but not equipped               to     deal

with the injured and the dying.             This was in marked contrast

to     their emphatic response to an order to place a                  line- -of

officers across the pitch to prevent Liverpool fans who were

not dead or injured approaching the Nottingham Forest                        fans.

A    supporter         in the stands whose son died on        the      terraces

described        the    reaction     around him to this    scene        on     the

pitch:



           To say there was a coldness, a fear
           about the place - it was something
           I'd never experienced or ever want
           to again. People were absolutely
           shell shocked. You were standing
           there watching people collapse and
           people   who   were dead    on   the
           pitch...people being carried off on
                      boards every minute...people running
                      across the pitch - supporters -
                      carrying     boards with arms   just
                      flopping down and bodies lying there
                      motionless...and right in front of
                      your eyes you had about one hundred
                      and fifty coppers lined across the
                      pitch  in front of the North Stand
                      doing absolutely nothing...and that
                      generated a lot of hatred within the
                      stand. [ 3 2 ]


6.9     The     Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer described the               scene     ai
        the     ground    as one of chaos.        He responded by        ordering    an

        ambulance to be driven onto the pitch.                He stated:



                      My immediate reaction was to get an
                      ambulance onto the p i t c h  to bring
                      home    to    them   (the    Nottingham
                      supporters)     that   something    had
                      happened at     the other end of the
                      ground.    [33]


6.10   While this action could have been interpreted as a waste                     of

        a valuable resource,      this officer stated that he feared that

        the     failure    to communicate the serious          situation     to     the

       Nottingham Forest fans was potentially dangerous.



7.     A-t the Back of the Lepplngs Lane Stand

7.1    Again,    what     occurred behind the Leppings          Lane     Stand    was

       considered at length by the Taylor Inquiry.                 Certain    issues

       remain     unresolved     and     were     raised   again    in    interviews

       conducted for the Project.              The issue of control at Leppings

       Lane     remains contentious.           There is no evidence to       suggest

       that     any    senior   police     officer     took    charge,      although

       officers       retrieved both dead and injured from the             terraces



                                         237
            and     placed them behind the stand.           Evidence concerning           the

            administering of triage was, and remains, contradictory.



    7.2     SYMAS evidence to the Taylor Inquiry indicated that                       Leading

           Ambulanceman          Litster took control at the back          of     Leppings

           Lane.         Other evidence denies that this was the            case.         The

           ambulance which transported Ambulanceman Litster arrived                          at

           Leppings        Lane at 3.35 p.m., took on board         several           injured

           people        and    went to hospital.    Ambulanceman       Yoxall        stated

           that     he     went to hospital^with      Ambulanceman        Litster.           If

J         Litster     assumed        control, then, it was only for        a     limited

           time     following         his return from the hospital.        If    he     took

           control        prior to going to hospital it remains           questionable

           why     he did not stay at the ground to organise the                 Leppings
           Lane area.



    7.3   The     issue    was confused further by      another        ambulanceman's

           evidence       to     Taylor.    He stated that    he    saw    Litster        at

           Leppings       Lane       just after 4 p.m., yet he     claimed       that     he

           looked     for       someone in charge and could      not     find     anyone.

          This suggests that while Mr Litster had assumed control this

          assumption           had   not been conveyed to    colleagues         who     were
           looking for direction.



    7.4   Medical personnel involved in the emergency response                    remain

          adamant that there was no clear leadership at Leppings Lane.

          Dr John Ashton, a Liverpool supporter present at                  the       game

          gave evidence to the Taylor Inquiry which indicated that                       he


                                             238
      took    medical control at the back of Leppings Lane.          He    has

      remained      emphatic     that    triage   was   not   employed      in
      prioritising transport to hospital.         He stated



                 They weren't putting people in any
                 order. They weren't discriminating.
                 [34]


7.5   A    nurse present at the game submitted a statement         to     Lord

      Justice Taylor's Inquiry in which she stated her involvement

      at    Leppings Lane.     She criticised the lack of direction         or

      leadership    and also the delay in the arrival         of   emergency

      services in Leppings Lane.         She stated:



                 ...it was becoming more and more
                 apparent that firstly nobody among
                 the police or stewards had taken
                 charge of the situation, secondly
                 the   emergency services had   not
                 arrived.  [35]


7.6   This statement supported Dr Ashton's assertion that he              took

      medical control at the back of Leppings Lane:



                 ...the dead had already been moved
                 to this area by the police, having
                 been directed to do so by a man I
                 took to be a doctor...He was telling
                 the     police that he wanted        the
                 injured to be placed in categories,
                 the badly injured to go in the first
                 ambulances and not the ones with
                 m inor, injuries _which at first seemed
                 is be the ..case ■ I was later to
                 discover, the following        morning,
                 that     the doctor     (John   Ashton)
                 concerned was a fellow fan who had
                 arrived on the scene a lot earlier
                 than I, had summed up the total lack


                                   239
                       of leadership and had taken              over
                       himself. [emphasis added: 36]


    7.7    Another doctor involved stated:


                       Like Dr Ashton I found no one in
                       charge and spent the major amount of
                       my time trying to ‘sort out the
                       seriously hurt from those already
                       dead, or those with minor injuries.
                       [37]


    7.8     Evidence      from   a    police officer confirms       that     Dr    Ashton

           assumed     control       and   that no senior     police   officer       took
i          charge of the situation:



                     The - Dr [Ashton] was good      too,
                     examining   and placing    them   in
                     priority for ambulances, in fairness
                     his   comments regarding    officers
                     organising the casualties was partly
                     justified.    Certainly no    senior
                     officers were in attendance at this
                     time. [38]


    7.9    An   ambulance    worker        offered evidence    which      appeared     to

           discredit the evidence of Dr Ashton.             In answer to questions

           from   counsel    he refuted Dr Ashton's           allegations    when     he
           stated:



                     We had transported a number     of
                     casualties   before   that  doctor
                     arrived on the scene.  [39]


    7.10   However   by     the time Dr Ashton was at          Leppings     Lane     this

           ambulanceman,     according       to his own evidence,      was    in     the
           gymnasium area.

    8.     The Gymnasium an a Tem porary Mortimny

    8 -1   As     noted        in     the      previous    section      the gymnasium                at

            Hillsborough was the reception area for the dead and injured

            carried from the pitch.               Once the injured had been taken                    to

           hospital it housed the dead and some time elapsed before                                  it

           was    designated           a temporary mortuary          reorganised             for    the

           primary        purpose       of     receiving       relatives       and     friends       to

           identify        their dead.         For people arriving in Sheffield                     via

           the hospitals and the boys' club this spartan and                            makeshift

‘          facility       has       become      the    focal    point     of    the     pain         of

           bereavement.             For the agency representatives concerned                       with

           administering            the processes of           identification,         statement-

           taking and counselling it was their workplace and has left a

           lasting        impression          on all involved      with      these      difficult

           processes.            As     its    designated       title     suggests          it     was

           'temporary'          and     the    workers had to        'make      do'     with       the

           facilities          available.        As Detective       Chief      Superintendent
           Addis commented it was:


                         ...as adequate as it could be in the
                         circumstances.    If you are given
                         notice of circumstances you can make
                         arrangements.   If there is no such
                         notice you have to make the best
                         arrangements possible.   [40]


    8.2    Unlike        all    that had gone before there was one                    person       who

           assumed responsibility for the operation, entrusted with the

           task     of    establishing a "semblance of               order"          [41].       That

           person    was       Mr     Addis.      It was his firm       opinion        that        the

           gymnasium       "was       ideal"     in the    circumstances.              In        this


                                                 241
t
        location he set about "instilling some discipline" [42] into

        the proceedings.          Between approximately 5 p.m. and 9.15 p.m.

        he   organised      the temporary mortuary ready to                   receive      the
        first relatives.


                   I have always taken the view that in
                   a major incident, whether it is one
                   or many deaths, you can only have
                   one   person in charge.      Divided
                   responsibility leads to confusion
                   and disagreements.  [43]


(8.3   The   police take charge in such circumstances                    because         such

        deaths are under the jurisdiction of the Coroner.                          Accepted

        practice     is    that the agency best equipped                 to    assist      the

       Coroner     is the police and therefore at Hillsborough it                          was

        inevitable     that       the    police     fulfilled      their       duties       in

       consultation        with     the Coroner, Dr Popper.              The       following

       discussion,        based on a range of accounts taken from                      agency

       officials      and the families, centres on both aspects of                         the

       use   of the gymnasium: as a reception area for the dead                            and

        injured and as a temporary mortuary.



 8.4   Those people involved at the gymnasium immediately after the

       Disaster provide clear evidence that the chaos on the                             pitch

       was   mirrored       at the gymnasium.             Nurses   and    doctors         have

       expressed      their    serious concern over the              absence        of     co­

       ordination or direction during the early stages.                         Bodies had

       been laid out randomly and the medics were forced to                            search

       for   people       thought       still     to be    alive   and        in   need    of

       treatment.         Although        Lord    Justice     Taylor          denied      the


                                           24 2
           allegation       that there was a lack of equipment,          nurses    who

           administered        to the dead and injured disagree.          They    have

           stated their frustration at the lack of basic equipment.                  A

           nurse     who was in the gymnasium, for-example, reported              that

           she     could not find scissors to cut an injured man's              jumper

           in order to carry out a tracheotomy.               She was given a    blunt

           knife     by a policeman.       A nurse manager, frustrated      by     the

           lack of equipment on the pitch, found a similar situation in

           the gymnasium.       It was:
 (
r

                       ...another scene of chaos...I began
                       to work with the injured in the
                       gymnasium at around 15.55 hours.   I
                       was   conscious of    around   three
                       doctors in attendance, but when I
                       arrived there was still no medical
                       equipment of any sort. [443


     8.5   A     doctor who responded to the public appeal for           assistance

           described the scene in the gymnasium as follows:


                       There    were bodies everywhere.          Who
                      was      alive      and     who   was    dead?
                      ...Bodies lying higgledly-piggledy
                      just inside the door, the       line
                      stretching over to the far wall.
                      ...Who was going to tell me what &&
                      dfi?
                      Without directions I ran along the
                      lines of crumpled bodies.  fEmphasis
                      added: 451


     8.6   The initial positioning of the injured inside the              gymnasium

           was    unfortunate.     They were placed beyond the dead         and    in

           order to transport them to ambulances they had to be carried

           through the dead bodies.         Once the injured were removed         the



                                            243
•
           dead remained and a short time later a decision was taken to

           designate           the        gymnasium the official              temporary          mortuary.

           The     wisdom           of this decision has been                 questioned          by     many

           people        involved,             including       the     Deputy       Chief        Ambulance

           Officer.            In        his professional opinion                 the    gymnasium        was

           entirely            inappropriate            as     a     temporary          mortuary.          He

           considered           that “it would have been better to                          identify       in

           the     Medico-Legal Centre where there are better                                  facilities"

           [463.        For:
    (
^                         At the mortuary they would've been
                          washed, stripped, hair fixed and
                          presented    in    a    humanitarian
                          way...not with all their clothes on
                          in a chuffin' green body bag...There
                          is no dignity in death and it is our
                          duty to bring dignity to death. [47]


    8 .7   Many     people          who were at the match went                    to     the     gymnasium

           early        on     to        seek information           about     missing          friends     or

           relatives.           However,          they       did     not     gain       entry     to     make

           identification                 of    bodies       until        after     midnight.             The

           experience          of Barry Devonside is one such example.                            He      was

           at     the        match and witnessed the Disaster.                      On     leaving        the

           stand        he was informed that his son, Christopher, had                                  died.

           Cn the direction of a police officer he went directly to the

           gymnasium.               Once       there,     he       gave     the    police         a      full

           description              of    Christopher emphasising that                   probably         the

           most     obvious indication of identification would be a                                     Welsh

           International                 Rugby Shirt, which bore the Welsh                      crest     and

           motif.        He explained:




                                                    244
                          I said to him I don't think any-ne
                          else in the ground will be wearing
                          them today...He left me standing for
                          about ten minutes - it seemed like a
                          lifetime.    He came out and very
                          positively said 'he's not there
                          there's nobody of that description
                          there*.   [48]


        8.8   It     was after midnight before he identified                     Christopher            in

              the     gymnasium and Christopher was still wearing                      his        Welsh

              International       rugby shirt.           According to the police              no-one

              admitted     to the gymnasium dead had left the location                            until
    (
f             they were transferred to the Medico-Legal Centre.                         The       most

              likely      conclusion       to    be      drawn,     therefore,         was         that

              Christopher       was there when Barry inquired.                   Throughout            the

              intervening       period he held out real hope that his                       son    was

              alive.      The    intervening          period      was     described     by     Barry

              Devonside as the worst in his life.                  He went back and               forth

              between     the    hospitals,        the    boys'         club   and    the     ground

              searching     for Christopher.            Of further concern is the                  fact

              that     Christopher's       friend gave his name and address                       to     a

              policeman in the gymnasium and informed him that his                            father

              was     present at the game and would be looking for                      him.            If

              this     information   was received it was                 never    disseminated.

              Even those people who had been in the gymnasium with a                              dead

              relative     or friend were subjected to hours of                      waiting       and

              being     moved    on before they were allowed to make                    a     formal

              identification.       A man who found his dead wife on the                       pitch

              and     accompanied    her        to the    gymnasium        went      through           the

              procedure of being taken to the boys' club and waiting hours



                                                  245
      before        he    was       transported back to the              gymnasium       and     at

      approximately             10.30 p.m. he identified her body and made                           a

      statement.



8.9   As     discussed          previously         the    delay    was       caused     by     the

      reorganisation               of     the gymnasium into three areas                and    the

      establishment             of the procedures concerning                  identification.

      Polaroid       photographs were taken of the dead because it                             was

      considered, "too traumatic for relatives to walk along

      of     bodies" [493.               The photographs were displayed on               boards

      in      the        entrance           area     and    the        person    making        the

      identification               was     asked     to    look    throughthe          numbered

      photographs             to make an initial identification.                   While       the

      intention          of    using photographs was              to    minimise       people's

      suffering          the       impact of this procedure             was     considerable.

      The photographs were poor quality and some features appeared

      distorted.           Some         people     looked through the           full    set     of

      photographs several times before recognising their                               relative

      or     friend.          As    one father said, “I saw              faces    that        were

      unrecognisable in any shape                    or form”[503.           Even the man who

      had accompanied his dead wife to the gymnasium was asked                                  to

      look     through         the photographs and state the number                     of     the

      photograph which he recognised.                      So poor was the quality              of

      the    photograph that he failed to recognise her                          photograph.

      Another       man, looking for his son, stated that he could                             not

      decide    between            two     of the photographs           on    display.         The

      impact    of       this procedure on the bereaved was                     immense,        as

      Barry Devonside stated:


                                              246
                       It was so hard to look at the
                       photographs because you were looking
                       at faces praying to God that Chris
                       [his son] wasn't there...We got to
                       the end and I said 'he's not here
                       he's got to be injured...I went past
                       him   completely. I was starting   to
                       get   excited...Odd that it sounds I
                       had   a feeling of guilt that I was
                       pleased •because I was looking at
                       photographs    of   dead people   and
                       feeling happy because I       thought
                       Chris wasn't one of them.   [50]


    8.10   Christopher's photograph was there and a relative pointed it

           out      to Barry who, after hours of searching, now                   knew     that

           his worst fears were realised.

    8.11   During     the   preparation       of the gymnasium      as        a    temporary

           mortuary       police officers were instructed to wash the                     faces

           of the dead using sponges and buckets.               Despite this some of

           the    faces     were dirty.     One woman attempted          to       clean    her

           ^on's face with a paper tissue she had In her hand:


                       And so I got my handkerchief out and                                4 -
                       of course I wiped the blood from his
                       nostrils, I licked the handkerchief
                       to take the dust away from his face.
                       [523

    8.12   Also, a Roman Catholic priest involved in administering                         the

           last     rites to victims stated his distress at              seeing          faces

           covered     in dirt and vomit.         Evidence from the       Medico-Legal

           Centre indicates         clearly    that    the     bodies    were       cleaned

           properly only after they had been admitted and most had been

           identified.        Normal practice is that bodies are cleaned                   and

           'presented'        to   the   bereaved     in   a   private    and        caring



                                            247
                environment.           Close relatives usually are allowed to                          spend

                ~ome     time    with the body as part of the               accepted             grieving

               process.         This     is   necessary      particularly             in    cases         of

               unexpected         or    sudden      deaths    in     tragic       circumstances.

               Experiences       at     the   gymnasium       show     that      the        procedures

               adopted exacerbated their suffering.



        8.13   Following the initial identification of a photograph                                   people

               were     taken to the inner door into the gymnasium and                                waited

               while     the    body     which corresponded to the               number           on* *the
    i

f              photograph was placed on a trolley and wheeled the length of

               the     gymnasium.        The treatment of relatives by                     the     police

               created      resentment        and    anger,     as    illustrated                in     the
               following comment:


                           They virtually manhandled us.  They
                           grabbed our shoulders, grabbed our
                           arms and said, "Stay there; Don't'
                           move!" [53]


        8.14   Other      families       report     that     they    were     held           back        or

               restrained, that their crucial moment of grief was almost                                  a

               public spectacle and that they felt that everything operated

               around     administrative convenience at the direction                            of     the

               police     rather       than the needs of families.               As        the    bodies

               were     in body bags they were presented on a trolley                            with     a

               sheet     over the bag and face.            People's accounts state                     that

               the     body bags were opened in their presence to                      reveal           the
               face of the dead person:


                          They brought Chris on a trolley.                  He


                                                  248
             was in a bag.    I walked through.
             They unzipped the bag and said,
             "would you just look down?" [54]


It    is    clear that the main objective of the police                  was    to

process each identification as quickly as possible.                      Outside

the gymnasium families were waiting on buaea and in the car­

park.       It    was       late evening and    chilly.      Many   of    those

waiting      were wrapped in blankets.           The procedure      dictated,

however, that identification could take place only one at                        a

time and this lengthened delays.               Mr Addis stated:
                        I


             In these circumstances time was an
             unknown quantity. You cannot say to
             people how long they'll have to wait
             as you have to be guided by the
             circumstances.   I took steps     to
             ensure   that a    Chief   Inspector
             addressed all people on the buses in
             terms of procedures.     They   were
             certainly put in the picture as to
             expectations. It was impossible to
             say how long it would take. [55]


The     numbers    of       people waiting outside            gymnasium         in

wholly      inadequate        conditions put a heavy pressure        on        the

identification          procedure.    With only one family at        a     time

being      admitted to the gymnasium, each stage of the              process

(initial identification from photographs; fetching the body;

formal      identification) had to be completed before the                 next

in    line could enter.          Consequently the police attempted             to

administer the formal identification with some speed:


            I was asked by a policeman, “Is this
            your son?" and I said, "Yes.“ I was
            led away to a table. [56]

            The    police didn't want me         to   stay
                       there a second         longer    than     was
                       necessary. [57]


8.17    While      Detective Chief Superintendent Addis               commented      that

            we   bent over backwards to accommodate families" [58]                   this

        claim was refuted in interviews with social workers,                      clergy

        and      senior ambulance officers.'       One social worker           who    had

        been      in    attendance    at the gymnasium         from    early in       the

        procedure       stated that there was a continual              struggle      with

        senior police officers to persuade them of the needs of                       the

        bereaved rather than the needs of the adopted procedure.                      He

       considered        that   the procedure became           "evidential"     rather

       than       "identificatory"       meaning       that     the process           of

       identification        was     subordinated to the process          of    taking

       statements and gathering evidence.               Clearly the speed of*the

       identification process led to problems for the bereaved:



                    We   had difficulties      with  some
                    relatives.   One lady came in to
                    identify     her       son.     After^
                    identification the husband went to
                    move on. The wife said, "where the
                    hell are you going?" She refused to
                    move and we had to abide by that
                    situation.   We moved them behind a
                    partition for a while.    [59]


8.18   Mr    Addis continued that this created a hold-up and                   meeting

       the needs of one person meant that others were having                      their

       needs     deprived.      Many families, however, stated           that     they

       were deeply saddened that they had no time with their                      loved
       ones.

                    One woman threw herself on       the
                    trolley and wouldn't be moved.   Her
                    screams    echoed all    around  the
                    gymnasium.    The screams were more
                    than a human could stand.   C60]


8.19   Mrs Delaney who, along with her husband, i--entified her           son

       told   her    story   publicly     on   the   Channel   4   discussion

       programme After Dark.


                A Social Worker took ua to the
                ground where our son was killed, and
                for my husband and I it was a
                terrible thing that we were taken
                where James was killed. As far as
                we're concerned we feel they d i d n H
                give, not only our son, but the
                other ninety-four poor people who
                were killed, they didn't give them
                any dignity... surely they could have
                taken    all    those  poor     people
                including     our son either to      a
                church, to a school...covered them,
                even if it was only a white paper
                sheet...When we got to the ground we
                had to look at these photographs to
                try and identify our son. We looked
                and looked, we couldn't recognise
                our son...eventually we did see our
                son...So we were led into the sports
                hall and wheflTWe walked in o u r son
                was lying on a trolley, inside this
                green zipped-up bag, number thirty-
                three, so his Dad and I bent down to
                kiss and to talk to James, and as we
                stood up, there was a policeman who
                came from behind me and was trying
                to usher myself and my husband out,
                straight out of the hall. The total
                attitude     was, you've    identified
                number thirty-three, so go!         So
                unfortunately...I went hysterical,
                I'm afraid to say, I had to ask if I
                could take our son away from the
                public's eye, again there was poor
                people,    unfortunate people     like
                ourselves being ushered into the
                hall and our James was there, in the
                public's eye, people looking down at
                his poor face. I also had to scream
                at these police officers and ask

                          them please to allow us privacy for
                          the    three     of    us    to     be
                          together... thankfully the policer.^n
                         pulled James over to another part of
                         the hall...I started to examine my
                         son s body, he had blood in hi*
                         nostrils, blood in his teeth, his
                         poor face was hardened with blood on
                         the side of his cheek. His face was
                         dirty, his hair was very dirty and
                         dusty...And in the meantime I was
                         examining our son...My husband was
                         ushered to a table to be asked
                         questions. At which again I started
                         to scream...I know these questions
                        have got to be asked but as far as I
                        was concerned there is a time and a
                        place for everything... I thought it
                        was only right th^t his Dad should
                        be with him - we went’ together - to                         ~
 i                      look for our son James, and that was
1                       time that was owed to us, because at
                        the end of the day, when you carry a
                        child for nine months, and you bring
                        them into the world, it is your
                        right to be with your child.         We
                        asked if we could possibly - we
                        wanted to stay with James - we were
                        told 'no' that we couldn't.       So .t
                        asked if we could be allowed to come
                        back to see James - we were told
                        'no'    it was for      identification
                        only—     [61]


     8.20   Another experience of the identification procedure which was

            shared     by    some families concerned positive           indicators        of

            identity        either   in   documents      on   the    deceased    or       in

            descriptions of clothing, etc.            For example, after        midnight

            when Barry Devonside identified his son he was still wearing

            the   Welsh       International      Rugby   shirt      which   Barry        had

            described to the police at the gymnasium before 5 p.m.                    Bill

            Pemberton       also   had given details of his son, Roy,           to       the

            police.     He had informed them that he was             wearing     'Lotto'

           diabetes,      he        was     carrying        identification.             Like         Barry

           Devonside, Bill Pemberton had travelled between the                                  several

           sites in search of Roy.               When finally he was admitted to the

           gymnasium          he         was asked    to      look       through        all      of     the

           photographs            to make an initial identification.                      On     making

           the formal identification Bill Pemberton noted that Roy                                     was

           still     wearing             the Lotto boots          [62]. Another           father was

           instructed         to     look through           the   photographs even thoughhis

           son     was   carrying a bus pass which included                        his     name         and

           photograph.              Mr      Addi©     stated      that _ possessions                  were

■          discounted         as reliable indicators to establishing                            identity

           because       it was common knowledge that                    football        supporters,

           particularly            Liverpool supporters, "swapped"                  documentation

           and     tickets         [63].     It was not clearfrom            this        statement

           whether       or       not Mr Addis was employing a metaphor                         in     this

           instance.          ~


    8.21   Following a positive identification relatives were                                  escorted

           to    a   table at which they were interviewed                          by     two        C.I.D.

           officers.          Assuming        that     they       were     simply       providing         a

           statement          of identification many relatives                     have       expressed

           anger     that the line of questioning was                       more        interrogatory

           then      expected         and,   therefore, geared to the                   gathering        of

           evidence.              Bereaved    families        were       concerned        that         many

           questions          unrelated       directly to the             person's        death        were

           asked      of them.           This included details of their own                      journey

           to     Sheffield, whether they had attended the match, if                                   they

           had consumed alcohol, etc.                      A bereaved parent challenged the

            relevance     of these questions and the context in which             they

           were     asked.    He was informed that the police were,         '’trying

           to     build up a complete picture of the day"         [54].     Another

           bereaved      father    who   was at the    match   claimed    that     the

           officers a3ked him to recall the events of the day.             He told

           his    story and they listened.      They asked him to repeat           the

           story and they wrote down his statement.            He stated that       he

           was    prompted from time to time.         When he read   through      his

           statement     all,     "critical statements about the     police       had

    8.22   A social worker who had assisted in the organisation of                the

           gymnasium     as     a temporary mortuary stated that     the    police
           priority was information gathering:


                       They   wanted to     take    statements.
                       That   was their     primary    concern.

    8.23   Detective     Chief Superintendent Addis stated, however,             that

           his intention was simply to gain a short statement from               the
           bereaved:



                       It is normal procedure to ask for
                       information concerning the medical
                       history   of   the   deceased.     I
                       instructed that this should be the
                       case as pathologists need all of the
                       relevant medical information     and
                       that concerning alcohol.    Some of
                       the people who axed did not die from
                       crush injuries...This had to be done
                       immediately because the post-mortems
                       started the next morning.    If you
                       allowed people to go home how long
                       would it take to gain the urgent

                          reinforce that at this stage       I
                          wasn't aware of any      allegations
                          concerning excess alcohol...I was
                          there trying to do a job to the best
                          of my ability.  [67]


8.24        Apart    from       the serious problems            encountered      by     families

            concerning       the    procedures adopted at               the    gymnasium,    the

            physical       environment,        with       its   three     sections       loosely

            segregated      by     sheets      draped       from   nets,       heightened    the

            distress felt by families and workers.                      Police officers      had
t
^           been    on duty for hours and needed to eat and drink.                         Their

            designated area was between the 'counselling and                          statement-

            taking' area and the area in which the bodies were laid out.


                          At five o'clock in the gymnasium
                          there was row after row of bodies
                          and all around the walls there were
                          police officers sitting down eating
                          chicken legs. [68]


    8.2 5   The tension concerning priorities for handling the                          bereaved

            emerged when tea and coffee, requested by social workers for

            distribution to those waiting outside the gymnasium, arrived

            and     a notice was chalked up stating "For police use                       only".

            A social worker who intervened was assured that this                          notice

            did     not    relate        to   the    situation     and        it was      removed

             immediately         [69].    There were problems reported                 concerning

            telephone       access        at the gymnasium, over the             long     delays,

            over     lack of information and over the 'pressure' of                        police

             control      and     regulation.         These     substantive      and     repeated

             criticisms from the bereaved families were endorsed by other

             agency representatives in attendance [70]:

                        information,  they were   preoccupied
                        with dotting   'i*3‘ and     crossing

                        We had to stand for five hours and
                        listen to the identification      of

    8.2 6   Detective     Chief     Superintendent       Addis was   faced   with    an

            unprecedented set of circumstances and agreed that “mistakes

            were     made".     Overall, however, he was satisfied       that    "the

            procedures were the right procedures", that "there should be

            no     deviation"    and that the “procedures worked        very    well"

            [71].     He concluded:



                        There was very good co-operation
                        from the Ambulance Service and they
                        transferred    the bodies   to   the
                        Medico-Legal Centre. By 4.30 a.m.
                        74   of the 94 bodies had       been
                        positively identified.    This   was
                        first-class. ..The remaining bodies
                        were transferred to the Medico-Legal
                        Centre.    Further    identification
                        could take place there.     By 5.30
                        a.m. all bodies had been transferred.
                        [72]


    8.2 7 In this statement Mr Addis attached a high priority to                 what

            he      considered     to   be         a   major   organisational       and

           social        workers    and    clergy, however, did          not     share        this

           satisfaction arguing that the gymnasium should not have been

           used     a     temporary      mortuary.     A     senior   ambulance        officer
           reflected:


                         It   was totally unnecessary   for
                         people to go through that torment.

    9.1   The     overwhelming response to the medical care and                    personal

          attention        given to the injured and their families by                    staff

          at    both main hospitals was positive.                Again, in       the     first

          hours     of a Disaster the size of Hillsborough the                    scene        at

          the hospitals was chaotic.                Many off-duty staff attended the

          hospitals        and     the    medical     care    offered    was      excellent

          especially given the circumstances.                  Yet there were problems

          encountered        by    families     and    friends.       Inevitably,             the

          hospitals        were    the obvious places for people to               visit        in

          their search of missing friends and relatives.                       Consequently

          a large number of people arrived requiring information.                              At

          the Northern General all visitors were directed to a canteen

          and     asked     to wait.      A social worker, who          responded        to    a

          public        appeal for assistance, recalled how he went                 to        the

          Northern General, was taken to the canteen, given a                       sticker

          marked 'social worker' and was told to "do your stuff" [74].


                                             257
9.2   He described the scene in the canteen:


                     It was filled with people in various
                     states of distress... some    people
                     were sitting at tables, some were
                     standing up, some were banging the
                     walls, others were just numb.  [75]


      Barry     Devonside was one of the people in the               canteen.      He
      commented:


                    There must have been a couple of
                    hundred people ther- ..people were
                    very distressed, some were fainting,
                    people    were    absolutely    shell
                    shocked...they were just sat there
                    dumbfounded...The Assistant Hospital
                    Administrator came in and stood on a
                    table     and     started     reading
                    descriptions    out of people in the
                    mortuary.  [76]


9.4   A     social    worker    stated   that    this    man   was    a   hospital

      administrator.       Each time he went into the canteen there was

      a     silence throughout the canteen and as           people     recognised

      descriptions       they   were directed to police         officers.         The
      social worker commented:


                    He     started    to    reel      off
                    information...as he did people were
                    collapsing like dominoes...  [77]


9.5   The     social worker was critical of the procedure.                First    it

      appeared       insensitive   and public for people        to     hear     this

      information       announced from a table.         Second, he     considered

      the    role     of the police to be       inappropriate    arguing        that

      people were in need of personal support and privacy.


                                     258
A     senior social worker arrived late in the evening                          at    the

canteen and witnessed a mother and daughter giving the                               name

of      a person to a member of staff at the registration                           desk.

Another        person,       approaching   *the    desk    from       a     distance

informed        them     that     the   person    was    dead.        The       mother

collapsed           and was carried to a side room to            be       comforted.

The     social worker asked, "why couldn't she have been                            taken

into the side room in the first place?”'[78].                                   -           -



A further issue concerning the hospital was the role                            played

by     the     police.        The Detective      Chief    Superintendent              co­

ordinating the emergency response stated that he,                          "arranged

for teams of police officers to attend all hospitals in                               the

area"        [79].    He stated that the police were able                  to       "tell

you          if a    person     was in hospital but at        that        point      we

couldn't say if someone was dead" [80].



Once     again       there     are   disconcerting       reports      of        police

insensitivity          at     the hospitals.      Jenny and      Trevor         Hicks,

whose     two daughters died at Hillsborough, asked to see                           the

body         of one of their daughters.           This request        was       turned

down         by a police officer.        Jenny Hicks insisted and               became

angry     with       the officer who replied that the             body      was       no

longer their concern as it was the "property of the Coroner"

[81].        When they persisted with the request they were                         told

that the bodies of their daughters were not at the hospital,
       although        Trevor had travelled from the ground with              one    of

       his     daughters in an ambulance.         Clearly this denial led            to

       confusion        and no information was presented to           clarify       the

       situation.         What had happened was that both          daughters        had

       been returned to the gymnasium.



10.    Hammcrton Road-Boya' Club

10.1   The    chaos at the Hillsborough ground followed the                  bereaved

       to     the     boys*   club.   A priest who      assisted     the     bereaved

       stated:



                      We got to Hammerton Road and things
                      just went from bad to worse... I just
                      could not believe Hammerton Road - a
                      disused   boys'   club   with     one
                      telephone. [823


10.2   A     social    worker who responded to a television           appeal       for

       assistance        described the scene at the boys'club as             chaotic

       and confusing.         He stated:-


                      It didn't seem to me that it was
                      under the control of a        clearly
                      functioning management group.   [833


10.3   The     system     of registering at the boys' club           added    to    the

       confusion:


                      You   had to register     when   you
                      arrived, then you had to go over to
                      the   police station to     make   a
                      statement, then you had to come back
                      to the boys' club and re-register.
                      [84]


10.4   Re-registration,        however,      depended   on   proof    of     initial


                                       260
       registration.      Obviously     as more people      arrived     and     the

       numbers    inside the club increased the inefficiency             of     the

       procedure grew steadily worse.



10.5   A     social worker who travelled from Liverpool         to     Sheffield

       raised    the   problem     of communication   and     the     giving     of

       information to those waiting:


                  Some people in the boys' club were
                  kept waiting even though people in
                  charge knew their relative or friend
                  was dead. [85] •


10.6   Detective Chief Superintendent Addis gave a clear               assurance

       that people at the boys' club were not informed of the death

       of a friend or relative.        This is denied by one account of a

       man    being informed by a policewoman that his son was                dead.

       This occurred while he sat at a table in the waiting area.



10.7   A further problem concerning information was that it was not

       necessarily     accurate.      Two people who were      searching        for

       their friend and his son were present in the boys' club when

       the son's name was read out as being alive and well:


                   A policeman in uniform stood on a
                   chair   in   the   boys'    club...He
                   announced that the only list they
                   had was one of people who had— been
                   reported missing at Hammer.fc.an— Road
                   Police Station and were known, ta— bfi.
                   safe and well. There were about
                   eight to ten names on the list and
                   Adam Spearritt was included.    [86]


10.8   The    friends then telephoned the boy's mother to inform               her


                                      261
•
           that     he     was on a 'safe and well' list.                        They went              to     the

           police station as requested but there was no information                                             on

           Adam      nor     of     the     list    on    which    his             name             appeared.

           Additionally,           the    co-ordination       of         information                   between

           Sheffield       and      Liverpool resulted            in         false       expectations.

           Hilda     and    Philip Hammond were visited by                         a     policeman              at

           their    home      in Liverpool and asked to                      telephone             a    number

           regarding their son, Philip.                  He said to them 'No, he's                             not

           dead'.        Incredibly, this comment was made three hours                                   after
                                          i- .                         i'fHr.-            t-   ■



           Mr     Hammond's       brother had formally             identified                  Philip          and

           after     another brother had been informed of Philip's                                      death.

           People     have spoken of the frustration of being                                  denied          any

           information        and of having to wait for long periods of                                       time

           not     knowing       what was happening or what                      plana         were      being

           made.



    10.9   A Social worker's impression on walking into the boy®'                                            club

           was     that,     “it     was hard to say who was                     in    charge"               [87].

           According to Detective Chief Superintendent Addis the                                         boys'

           club     was the designated "holding area to                           house            relatives

           [88].     Social workers became involved at the club, but their

           primary role, according to the Director of Sheffield                                          Social

           Services,        was     to "support" the police [89].                         Although              he

           acknowledged           that the boys' club was not ideal he                                 defended

           the decision to use it:


                          I am sure it was the right decision.
                          [88]

    11.    The Medico-Legal Centra

    11.1   The    manager    of    the Medico-Legal Centre     stated   that     the

           Centre ignored police requests by allowing families who were

           identifying       or visiting the dead, to stay with them for          as

           long    as they required.       He stated that the police       position

           was that if bodies had been identified formally, it was               not

           necessary        for    them   to   be   viewed   again.       Families

           experiences       at    the Medico-Legal Centre,    however,     contest

           this official version of events.           Janet Spearritt, mother of

(          Adam, identified him at the Medico-Legal Centre because               she
f
           had been informed during Saturday evening that he was alive,

           safe and well.         Her suffering was exacerbated by being        told

           that she could view his body only through a glass divide:


                       I wanted to hold him, hug him for
                       the last time, to put my arms around
                       him and they wouldn't let me.      I
                       cried, and I begged and I pleaded.
                       C913


    11.2   She was told:

                       "When      you get him home you can    hold
                       him."      [923


    11.3   Mrs    Delaney,     who had struggled to be with her son        at    the

           gymnasium found similar barriers existed at the Medico-Legal

           Centre.

                       We went home to see our      other
                       children.  James* sister Catherine
                       wanted to come back to see her
                       brother.  We went to this medical
                       centre we had to sit over three


                                           263
                          hours...When we finally got to see
                          our son James we weren't allowed any
                          privacy.   James was behind a glass
                          3creen - we weren't allowed to touch
                          or kiss James, and when I mertioned
                          to   the doctor, why weren't      we
                          allowed to touch and kiss our own
                          son and the reply was, when the
                          autopsy's done you can touch and
                          kiss your son as much as you like.
                          We    weren't   asked   about    the
                          autopsy...we were told.  [933


        11.4   It    was not until her son was brought home that      she    could

               finally hold him.      Although the condition of her son's        body

    <          caused great distress:
(
                          At the end of the day when we
                          eventually got our son home on the
                          Wednesday...we brought James home to
                          the warmth of hie own house, before
                          that we weren't even allowed to
                          visit our son...if we were allocated
                          half an hour each day it would have
                          been some consolation to us.      We
                          were sitting in Ellesmere Port, our
                          son was down in Hillsborough - our
                          hearts were eaten away for the fact
                          that he was lying there on his own.
                          When we got our son home, our son
                          was   completely stripped of     his
                          dignity. Our son's head had a hole
                          in the back of his skull, his top
                          teeth were taken away from him, his
                          chest was completely padded.       I
                          examined my son like I did when I
                          went to see him the first time.
                          That again is a mother's or father's
                          right to do so.  [943


        11.5   The    justification    for this imposition was     that   the     room

               available for viewing was next to the main storage area             for

               bodies.      Consequently, during the initial period the          staff

               considered     it   inappropriate   for people to   have     to   pass

               bodies which were stored on the floor.       Even on the     Monday,



                                            264
         when     Eddie    Spearritt, Adam's father,             visited        the     Centre

         restrictions on access were still imposed.




  12 .   rongluaion: A Tragftdv QUt Of a P lBafltftE



                     It was a complete carnival.       I
                     didn't see anyone who was drunk ...
                     I saw people out for a bloody good
                     day. [95]

r 12.1   For many people who went to Sheffield and contributed to the

         carnival atmosphere the day ended with them identifying dead

         relatives        or    friends.     Throughout the       intervening           period

         they spent tortuous hours searching for their loved ones                             or

         seeking     information.          The frustration and        suffering          which

         they experienced are well-documented in the previous section

         of this chapter.          These experiences, together with those                     of

         the     professional and voluntary workers, are typical of                          the

         mass      of     research       material     gathered    for    this          Report.

          Inevitably       the    discussion has focused          critically           on rthe

          response of the agencies involved, particularly the                          police.

          There     is    no     doubt     that    many   individuals      involved            in

          responding       to     the    n e e d s of people during      and     after       the

          Disaster        demonstrated            considerable     courage,           personal

          strength        and    warmth.     Further, it is recognised                that    the

          harrowing        experiences       endured      by   workers     on     that       day,
          regardless        of their professional role or status, will                       3tay
          with     them for ever and will continue to present                     them       with


                                              265
       deep emotional problems.



12.2   A '/“search project, however, ha3 to move beyond the personal

       and develop its analysis of the broader structural                       contexts

       and social arrangements which prevailed on the day and                         into

       the     night.        It     is only by a    critical     appraisal       of     the

       context and the procedures adopted that it becomes                       possible

       to    make     sense       of personal     experiences,     to       endorse     the

       legitimacy       of        feelings of injustice and       to    validate        the

       range     of     criticisms levelled by the bereaved                 towards     the

       appropriate        authorities.          The debates over        liability       and

       responsibility             for the Disaster have    been    well-publicised

       and     Lord Justice Taylor's findings connecting cause                       (over­

       crowding)        to reason (policing) are firmly            established          but

       not uncontested.             Certainly the proposition that policing at

       such venues remains dominated by an ideology of control                          and

       containment rather than by a priority of care and safety was

       well-illustrated by the police response to the early moments

       of the Disaster. They failed to recognise the warning signs,

       misinterpreted             the   actions    of dying fans       and    were      ill-

       equipped        to react quickly to the demands of the                  situation.

       Not     only     was this apparent in the actions of                  officers     in

       direct control at the Leppings Lane Terrace but also in                           the

       initial reaction of their controlling officer in calling for

       reinforcements and dog-handlers.                Despite the large          numbers

       of    police present on the pitch it was left                   to     lay-people,

       the     fans,     to respond by administering           first-aid,         placing

           people        in the recovery position, attempting to            resuscitate

           or     carrying bodies on makeshift stretchers.               Vick:     footage

           shows several officers responding in this way but most stood

           by     apparently frozen by the seriousne33 of            the     situation.

           This     raises serious questions not about the            characters             or

           attitudes of individuals but about the adequacy and emphasis

           of their training.



    12.3   A     strong    argument has been put forth that         many         who     died

           would     not have been saved by access to better equipment at
                                         1^
(          the     scene. However, people were resuscitated, some after
l
           they had been taken to the gymnasium, thus it is                  reasonable

           to     assume that others could have been saved.              Whatever         the

           parameters       of      the debate, however, an     emergency         response

           should not operate on principles of pessimism and should                          be

           provided       with the support of the best available             equipment.

           Further, written statements from nurses and doctors recorded

           their     frustration at being given empty oxygen cylinder®                       in

           response to their urgent request for oxygen.              However,            Lord

           Justice Taylor accepted the position submitted l>y SYMAS:



                          It would have been professionally
                          irresponsible to have taken them
                          (defibrillators) on the pitch. [96]


    12.4   Had     the     police    who    formed   a   line   across     the         pitch,

           ostensibly to prevent possible crowd trouble, been                     deployed

           to     form a circle to cordon off an area, then the use                     of    a

           defibrillator            might   not   have   been   problematic.             This



                                              267
           argument       has been supported by the Medics               at    Hillsborough

           Working Party (MAHWP) who argued that if a casualty clearing

           area had been established on the pitch, "it would then                            have

           been     possible      to have used a defibrillator                safely”       197 ].
           Also it would have made it possible:


                         ... to have drawn on the skills of
                         more of the 33 South      Yorkshire
                         Paramedics who were available for
                         disasters than the few who were
                         actually used. [98]


    12.5   As    has     been    noted, the Major         Accident     Vehicle       was      not -

*          summoned until 3.29pm.          It arrived at 3.45pm.              The    fact that

           such    vehicles       are equipped to deal          with     major       incidents

           suggests that its deployment should have been a priority.



    12.6   The    lack of any co-ordinated response behind                    the     Leppings

           Lane        stand     clearly        created     difficulties            concerning

           treatment,          triage and evacuation of the dead              and     injured.

           There were "no police officers in attendance" [99] and there

           remains       confusion    as    to who        co-ordinated       the     Ambulance

           Service       operation.    The ambulance worker designated                  as     in

           control        left the scene and despite his role was not                   called

           to     give evidence to the Taylor Inquiry.                 Medical       personnel

           who arrived from within the crowd presented severe                         accounts

           of     the    organisation      of     the     medical    operation        and     the

           availability          of resources and equipment.            Dr    John     Ashton,

           whose        evidence was discredited by Lord Justice Taylor,                      has

           received considerable support from ■~hers involved including

           a police officer.          Clearly this accumulation of inter-agency


                                                268
           evidence      cannot       be ignored and it is          apparent         that        Lord

           Justice      Taylor       was unduly severe in his criticism                    of     the

           evidence      presented by the doctors and nurses                   who        attended

           the dead and injured.



    12.7   The    initial       period in which the gymnasium was               used        as     a

           clearing-area            inevitably    was   chaotic.          Confusion              and

           spontaneity,            however,    cannot   be    used        to     rationalise

1          inadequate         resourcing      or lack of     co-ordination.               That     a

           major public event at an established venue could take                            place

           without      even basic first-aid equipment being to hand is                           an

           indictment         of    the licensing authority, the           Club       and        the

           event's organisers.             Clearly the gymnasium was            ill-equipped

           to deal with even a limited incident.                   Once the injured              had

           been     taken to hospital and the gymnasium had                    been       cleared

           the bodies of the dead had their possessions removed by                               the

           police       and    were put into body bags by            ambulance        workers.

           This     process took one hour and twenty minutes.                        By    4.30pm

           those     bodies behind Leppings Lane had been                  transferred             to

           the gymnasium and by 5.00pm police officers were sitting                                in

           the     gymnasium        eating chicken legs.        Da’ Ashton           criticised

            further      the speed of this operation.              Certainly it           was      in

           marked       contrast      to    the slowness      of    the    procedure             that

           followed.


    12.8   The use of the gymnasium as a temporary mortuary remains one

           of     the    most controversial issues in the aftermath                        of     the

            isaster.          Certainly       it exacerbated the suffering                        of     the

           bereaved      and, as discussed earlier, it has been                                criticised

           by workers, from all the caring agencies, who were                                    involved

           directly.          The     transfer           of   bodies       back        from      hospital

           mortuaries, the decision not to use the Medico-Legal                                    Centre

           and    the    makeshift          arrangements           at     the      gymnasium           were

           decisions apparently geared to professional convenience than

           to    the    consideration          of the bereaved.                   They    were         clear

           examples      of     how easily              professional        Judgement           overrides

           personal       need3.            Further,          there       is      no      satisfactory
f
           explanation          as     to    why         it   took       over     four         hours      to

           operationalise            the    gymnasium         as     a    'working'            temporary

           mortuary.      Time was          of the essence and many of the                      bereaved

           were forced to wait              over seven horn^s before they could                        make

           even an initial identification.                      For them this was the first

           concrete information they received.



    12.9   The    process       of     identification,               especially          the    use      of

           Polaroid      photographs          .and the lack of^fcime                or    privacy        on

           identification,            the    presentation             of the       bodies        and     the

           taking of statements exacerbated the pain and                                 suffering        of

           the    bereaved.          Given the professional and                    human        resources

           available          each of these elements could have been                            resolved,

           as    far    as     possible, to 'normalise'                    the     procedure.           The

           failure       to    categorise photographs by                       gender,     and,       where

           possible,          age-range added further to the                      suffering.           This

           was    inexplicable in those cases where relatives or                                  friends

           had    been        with    the dead person earlier.                     Clearly        it    was


                                                    270
                unnecessary           to    remain     rigidly committed           to     the     adopted

                procedure in these cases.                  The denial of time and privacy                  -

                an initial grieving period - was a serious oversight in                                 the

                procedure        which       has     had long-term      implications            for     the

                bereaved.             Without       that    time   available        there       was      no

                opportunity for people to come to terms with their                              emotions

                and     in the same moment they had to answer questions                              which,

                to      them,     sounded          interrogatory      rather       than     simply        a

                statement of particulars.                  Their lasting impression was that

                this was the first stage of the police investigation of                                 tK#
(               Disaster and not, as it should have been, the last stage                                 of

                the process of identification.



    12   . 10   Both    major hospitals responded swiftly and                      efficiently           to

                the     Disaster.          Unlike most other disasters there were                     many

                relatives and friends to be accommodated at the same time as

                the     injured.        They arrived at the hospitals within                     minutes

                of     the ambulances.            All accounts stated that the              treatment

                of     the injured was thorough, considerate and                        caring.        The.

                kindness        and     personal support by the             hospital       staff       was

                experienced        by      visiting families as well as by                 those       who

                were    admitted.           The     major    problem    encountered             at     the

                hospitals        related      to the dissemination of              information          to

                those    waiting in the out-patients at the Royal                         Hallamshire

                and,    especially,           in the canteen at the           Northern          General.

                The     public        announcement,         shouted    by     an        administrator

                standing on a table, was both insensitive and inappropriate.



                                                      271
    12.11   There     was     some confusion as to who was                   co-ordinating             the

            reception       areas      especially        given         the   police           presence.

            Again, the role of the police was not clear - especially                                    in

            their     dealings       with families who had been                    bereaved.          The

            denial     of access and insensitive remarks made to Jenny                                and

            Trevor     Hicks      were      callous.       As      a     direct      response           to

            Hillsborough the hospitals have revised their disaster                                   plan

            acknowledging           that    mistakes were made.               At     the       Northern

            General this not only includes a more integrated use of                                   the

            key     hospital        areas    but    also     the       use    of    high        quality

f           photographs        to     ease the problem of identification                        of    the

            injured.


    12.12   As    a   'holding        area' for      people        seeking         information          or

            searching       for      relatives the         boys'club         was     ill-equipped,

            spartan     and       unwelcoming.           Chosen        for   convenience,              the

            priorities of good communications, sound information and co­

            ordinated responses were neglected.                         Father Towey, a              Roman

            Catholic        priest, stated that, "any kind of                      emergency          plan

            which      could        have    maximised       communication               would        have

            minimised        the confusion” C100].              He saw portable phones                  in

            use at midnight but those were only used by the police.                                    The

            information        provided was not always accurate,                        occasionally

            with      tragic      consequences.          There has been            no        explanation

            offered      as    to how false information came to                         be    given     to

            families.


    12.13   Throughout         the    period of the Disaster                 and    its        immediate


                                                   272
            aftermath         the     inter-related     issues       of        co-ordination,

            communication           and information supply gave rise toserious

            problems.     Clearly it is accepted that the very nature of                         a

            disaster     means       that     its sudden     and    specific        impact      is

            unexpected.        In hours, sometimes minutes, emergency services

            and     back-up     agencies are compelled to respond to                  a    whole

            range     of unpredictable and volatile contingencies.                        It    is

            essential that clear co-ordination, unambiguous                        information

            and      effective        communication evolvesquickly tomeet                   both

            pragmatic     and       personal     demands.     Just       as lack      of *co- -*r-

/           ordination        creates       serious   problems      so    does      direction

            without     sensitive       consultation.        Just        as   misinformation

            contributes        to the confusion, so does lack                 of   information

            add to people's worry and pain.                It has become clear that in

            the management of the crowd, the setting-up of the gymnasium

            as a temporary mortuary and the initiation and operation                           of

            the process of identification the police assumed control.



    12.14   In terms of arrangements at the temporary mortuary Detective

            Chief     Superintendent          Addis was in no doubt that            after      he

            arrived he was the person in charge.                   He stated:


                        I*t is the coroner's jurisdiction and
                        he    is in charge and in       every
                        incident       he    delegates----the
                        responsibility to the police. [101]


    12.15   As    the procedures for the identification of the                     dead,       the

            process of accounting for 'missing persons' and the task                           of

            'keeping     order' are the responsibilities of the                    police       it


                                                273
            was accepted operational policy that they would take overall

            control.        Consequently, while the responsibilities            of     the

            emergency       services, the hospitals and the Coroner are               laid

            down     in law or in codes of practice, the          co-ordination         of

            ail agencies, the- accommodation of bereaved families and the

            dissemination of information were left to the discretion                    of

            the police.       It was concerning these broader functions               that

            criticisms began to emerge.



    12.16   The    previous discussion of events on the pitch, behind                  the

*           Leppings Lane stand and at the gymnasium focused on people's

            accounts        of the early chaos and confusion. It        was      clear

            that     while     there   were    many     individual      acts      which

            demonstrated      personal courage and initiative there            was      an

            absence    of     leadership   and   a    failure   to    take     control.

            Clearly      the agreed emergency plan did not           function.        The

            Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer, for example, stated, "I went

            to the agreed rendevous point but I was the only one                 there"

            [102].     His counterparts from the other services either were

            unaware of the rendevous point or failed to meet as                 agreed.

            Once     the initial stage of the Disaster had passed              and     the

            injured      had been   taken to     hospital   the      procedures        for

            administering       the temporary mortuary, organising the               large

            number of people searching for missing relatives of                 friends

            and    gathering and disseminating information fell under                  the

            co-ordination       of Detective Chief Superintendent Addi3.               Cn

            taking charge he set up an incident room, activated the Home



                                           274
         tjx^J-ce Inquiry System, appointed an office manager to direct

         communications, set up the casualty bureau,                liaised with the

         Coroner and "briefed officers on the basic set ?f procedures

         -c    be adhered to .        With a police presence         established       =t

        each ;f the venues ar.d with communication between the police

        straightforward           their    co-ordinating     role      was        readily

        apparent.



                    The people who had control of the
                    situation were the people who had
                    the communications. The people with
                    radios were the police.   It was as
                    straightforward as that. £104]


12.17   Clearly,     as       the statement from the Sheffield         Director       of

        Social     Services       indicated,    the role     perceived       by    other

        agencies        was    that   of supporting the      police.     This       fait

        accompli        was not shared by all grass-roots workers             and     it

        was     clear     in    interviewing    social    workers,     clergy        and

        ambulance officers that their experience was that all                      other

        needs,     personal and professional, were subordinated to                   the

        police     function.      Social workers, praised by,Mr Addis,               who

        had     been involved from 4pm onwards stated that              there       were

        real     problems       in negotiating with senior      police       officers
        over matters of professional dispute.



                   How can a basic grade social worker
                   with less than a year's experience
                   argue with a senior police officer
                   who's in control? [105]


12.18   While     the     police did liaise with         representatives      of     the



                                          275
            other        agencies it was clear that their               adopted      procedures

            and their priorities would not be changed.                      This high degree

            of organisation and control at the gymnasium was not matched

            by an equivalent provision of information to those waiting.



    12.19   In     theory the purpose of opening up the boys' club                     was     to

            provide a holding-area for people waiting to be                       transported

            to     the     temporary mortuary.            In   practice     people     received

            little        information of note and, as one person stated,                     "no-

            one seemed to know what was happening ... there'was tea                           and
(
:           biscuits       but     no     information"         [1063.     Consequently       many

            people       decided        to travel to the hospitals or back              to    the

            gymnasium           in an attempt to find more information.                In    many

            minds        the     boys' club has remained a potent symbol                of    the

            feelings           of frustration and neglect felt by families.                   The

            denial       of information contributed to the                 misunderstandings

            and      to        extended    periods       of    disillusionment       with     the

            procedures.


    12.20   This     was compounded by the next stage of the                   process:       the

            transporting           of     people   on     double-decker      buses     to     the

            gymnasium           where the waiting continued.            In replying to        the

            question as to why many people waited outside the                         gymnasium

            in the cold Detective Chief Superintendent Addis stated:


                           They didn't have to wait outside -
                           they were asked to sit on the bus
                           and wait until called, but they
                           didn't do that. [107]




                                                   276
Those     waiting on the buses claimed that there there was                       nc

apparent        logic       or        rationale     to   the     sequence         of

identification.         Two people who had to wait at the gymnasium
have described their experience:



            We have to say that these two hours
            were disgraceful and that people -
            some old, some young - were left to
            fend for themselves and      shuffle
            about in damp, noisy, cold and dark
            conditions. [108]

A social worker at the gymnasium stated:
                        *        --      -


           There was this horrible period when
           people were simply being stacked
           outside in this yard. At times you
           felt like an apologist for what was
           going on ... . It was very difficult
           to bring a sense of purpose to what
           the proceedings were. [109]


The social worker, involved at the gymnasium throughout                          the

evening, stated that there was a number of changes to                          plans

during the evening and less information was forthcoming from

the    police    as     the hours passed.           He   stated:       "We'd     ask

questions and we'd get stonewalled" [110].                  During the early

stages    he    was     consulted by the police           over     a    range     of

matters but increasingly he and his colleagues felt excluded

from     important decisions concerned with the care                    and . help

offered to the bereaved.               He stated:



           The point at which people were to be
           allowed into the room was exclusive
           to the police. [Ill]

Clearly    there was equivocation over the plan to                     deal    with
             the dead bodies and the procedure for identification.                       Early

             in     tr.    afternoon     nstructions were conveyed to the             Medico-

             Legal        Centre     concerning the imminent      arrival        of   bodies.

             This     plan     was     verified    by   the   Deputy     Chief    Ambulance
             Officer:


                            It was agreed to start moving the
                            bodies to the Medico-Legal Centre.
                            I instructed 12 ambulances into the
                            Directors'     car      park        (at
                            Hillsborough)    ... my concern was
                            for the staff and I briefed them as
                            to what would happen.     They would
                            set off at 15 minute intervals in
                            batches of two with~tt!*ee tjodies"* in
 (                          each ambulance. We'd have done the
*                           job by 7pm —        but the Coroner
                            intervened. [112]



     12.25   Finally, there are questions concerning the co-ordination of

             the social services input at Hillsborough and at the various

             locations.            Appeals were made via the broadcast           media     for

             social workers to attend the ground or the hospitals.                       Teams

             arrived        from areas outside Sheffield, including              Liverpool,

             but the initial work was done on an ad hoc basis by a                       range

             of   people       who     helped with the      bereaved     and    distressed.

             Local        social     workers   worked    alongside      voluntary       agency

             workers,        the     clergy, nurses and others who        offered        their

             services.        A social worker who went to the Northern                General

             found        himself moving bodies at        the mortuary.        He was     then

             advised       by the police to go to the ground and he was                  taken

             there        in an ambulance which was returning three bodies.                  A

             relatively            inexperienced   social     worker,    he     set     about

             establishing           arrangements and facilities for families.              He


                                                278
        reported        no co-ordination of the caring agencies' work                     and

        no     direction from senior officers.               The Assistant         Director

        of Sheffield's Social Services visited the gymnasium but did

        net adopt a decision-making role.                Consequently the           workers

        from     the     'caring       agencies', all     volunteers         on    the    day

        despite        their professional status, were under                 the    overall

        co-ordination of the police.                For some this relationship was

        difficult        as    broad    decisions, with       which     they       did    not

        concur, were taken and the consequences on the bereaved were

        difficult for the counsellors to defend.



12.26   Because the Director of Social Services stated publicly that

        he considered the primary role of social workers to be                           that

        of     supporting the police [113] and because                 social       workers

        and     other     agencies involved reported           problems       with       this

        position,        the Research Project requested an interview                     with

        the     Director       or his senior colleagues.          Sheffield          Social

        Services,        unlike all the other agencies, refused to                   comply

        with     the     request until they liaised with              the    police       and

        other        agencies involved and secured their agreement                   [114].

        This response is unusual in that it appears to sacrifice the

        professional          autonomy vested in the local authority                 agency

        and     allow other agencies to dictate its              policy.           Further,

        the     Director       of    Social Services     stated       soon    after      the

        Disaster       that, "the lessons from the disaster would be                     put

        down     on paper" [115].            The decision was that a full            report

        on     the    events    of     the     forty-eight    hours    following          the



                                              279
                Disaster       would be compiled.   In March 1990, a   year     later,

                this     report was not completed nor had the Sheffield         social

                workers involved been interviewed [116].



        12.27   There     are many issues to be considered in the wake         of    the

                Hillsborough      Disaster.    An observation, made prior      to    the

                Disaster, raises the issue of broader strategies:



                           At the moment the U.K. seems to have
                           no co-ordinated strategy for coping
                           with major disasters. Each health
    <                      authority    works    under    broad
                           guidelines, but very much on its own
                           ... The picture is a very disjointed
                           one with no central control. [117] •


        12.28   A   starting-point would be to ensure that the basic           medical

                facilities/resources including full emergency service cover,

                should    be    compulsory at all organised sports     and     leisure

                events.    Clearly there is required regular and       co-ordinated

                working practices between the agencies as a foundation              upon

                which      larger-scale       responses   can   be     built         and

                institutionalised.      The Medics At Hillsborough Working Party

                stated:



                           A first step to ensuring an adequate
                           emergency response in the event of a
                           disaster is to have an effective
                           system    with    clearly    defined
                           responsibilities in place to cope
                           with   more likely smaller     scale
                           problems ... It is important to give
                           consideration as to how a local
                           domestic emergency response might be
                           co-ordinated with a large      scale
                           disaster response. [118]

12.2 9   Certainly       the issues of planning and co-ordination are         not

         new.         Following the Bradford Fire Disaster SYMAS        attempted

         to     take the initiative over the grounds in its           area.   Yet

         its approaches were met with complacency and indifference by

         the    Clubs.     Other agencies did not appear prepared for          the

         Disaster       and the police priorities and decisions         dominated

         the events through the night of the 15th April.              Mike Walsh,

         in     his     work   on   disasters,   had    established    the    main

         priorities when he stated the obvious:



                       There must be adequate preparation
                       and   planning    between   all  the
                       services involved, and the results
                       of such work must be known to all
                       grades   of staff.     Training  and
                       communication are the two words that
                       matter here.   [119]


12.30    Yet    it     was precisely the lack of       planning,   training   and

         communication between and within agencies which              contributed

         to     the     deaths of ninety-five people      at   Hillsborough    and

         added to the distress of the injured and the bereaved.

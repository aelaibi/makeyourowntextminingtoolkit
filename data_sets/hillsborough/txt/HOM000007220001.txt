INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


Thank you for your letter of 28 April.

In writing as I did in my letter of 26 April, I was basing myself on the arrangements
made for the Cleveland Public Inquiry, where the costs of witnesses were met by the
DHSS.

Having now seen a copy of Sandiford's letter of 26 April, and having spoken to my
Finance Division, I can now confirm that this Department will be responsible for the
fees of Counsel to the Inquiry, its own costs in relation to the Inquiry, and the
expenses of witnesses in attending the Inquiry. All other expenses (including the costs
of any experts instructed on behalf of the Inquiry) will fall to the Home Office.

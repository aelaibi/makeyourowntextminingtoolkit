                  I am a Liverpool                supporter;    on Saturday    ISth^^pril   1989 (150489)               I

                  went to Hillsborough Football Stadium with my ma



                  I had a £6 ticket for the Leppings O n e                     End.   We travelled by car and

                  arrived in S h e f f i e l < a t 2.13pm          (1415).     W ^ t o o k a taxi to the ground

                  eventually arriving at the^j^ound entrance 31*2.43pm                         (1445).              There

                  was a solid mass of people                   infront of the turnstiles and also outside

                  the fwtrimeter gates.



                  I saw po 1iceN^fficers on horses trying to push people over to one

                  side.           There wa s'''vjTfst so many people about that it was taking ages to

I        1_.      get       in.     It was not a full scale          crush where      I was standing but it was

                  getting tight.                 I could see that    it was a crush at the front by the

              I heard someone shout          ’There's a gate o p e n ’ and a policeman on a horse

              said "Go around the side".


   C/yT       OpVTE-'c'            Kj O    I
              I followed the crowd in througfa^he gatV^and no one took my ticket,                          I

 Q /y~-p      got carried through         the tunnel , I^'c^l dn ’t control           what I was d o i n g .

              I remember noticing         the players     legs on the pitch,          then we went bang

Ia /£S \              the backs of people already in the Pensl^'NJ! went down to the

              right    into Pen 3 then turned to the left.              I couldn ’t control where I

              was going.         When I came to a standstill         I c o uldn ’t move.      I was aware

              of a gate slightly to my right leading onto the pitch.                        I tried to

              make for the gate but c o ul dn’t move.

           P-Qjr\
              I was trying to breati"Nartd my left arm was stuck behind me at an angle

              - the only thing I could move was my head.                 My right arm was

               infront of me - wedged against the chest of a man facing me.                         The man

              was drowsy - then he closed his eyes,                he was plumpish,        round face,

              fairish hair well built, wearing something green about 3 0 ’ish.



              I c o u l d n ’t moveS^way from him.         Afte~r a while everyone started swaying

              and just fell to theVground.



              I fell on top of a lad who had been towards my le f t .                    I saw bodies

              underneath him.

                                                                           f   oA

              ar,d tried to pull at the roeVtu             I was helped over onto the pitch by a

              policeman.         He appeared to be of a senior         rank.        There were bodies

              everywhere on the pitch.

  DRAFT SPEAKING NOTE FOR DAVID MELLOR'S LUNCH WITH THE FOOTBALL
  WRITERS ON 4 JUNE 1992


  In recent months there has been considerable speculation about
  the future of our policy requiring Football League clubs to go
  all-seated as recommended by Lord Justice Taylor in his Final
  Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.                                               This speculation
  now needs to be ended so that all concerned can concentrate on
  providing the best possible standards of safety and comfort for
  the spectators.


  The Government's concern has always been to ensure that those who
  wish          to      watch           football         matches      may    do    so        in   conditions               of
    reasonable safety.                             To that end,       the policy on the safety of
    sports grounds is kept under continual scrutiny.


    Since           the        Taylor             Report       was   published           in       January         1990,
    significant                 improvements             in both safety and comfort have been
    achieved, often as a direct result of the implementation of its
    recommendations.                         A revised edition of the Home Office Guide to
    Safety           of      Sports            Grounds,        incorporating           all    the      appropriate
    safety           recommendations,                    was    published         in     November          1990       and
    circulated to all local authorities responsible for the issue of
    safety certificates.


    It     also         seems          that         continuing       improvements            in   crowd        control
    measures,              together with a change in the attitudes of football
    spectators, have contributed to a decline in football hooliganism
    (although not, regrettably its complete elimination).


    Naturally,               the Government are not complacent and recognise that
    many clubs still have a long way to go to bring their grounds up
    to a satisfactory standard.                                Indeed there are still some people
    in football who are reluctant to make any changes, convinced that
    a disaster will never happen at their ground.                                                 By and large,
    however,               considerable                  progress      has        been        made       since         the
    Hillsborough disaster.
It is against the background of these changed circumstances, and
in view of the representations received against introducing all­
seating for smaller clubs, that I have decided that the time is
right to review the all-seater policy.                      I emphasise,          however,
that the Government remains firmly committed to the principles
of spectator safety and comfort set out in the Taylor Report.


X have      decided        that   it would     be wrong     to    review      either       the
principle      or    the    timetable       for all-seating at First              Division
Grounds in the Football League (the new Premier League).                                 It is
essential      that our       top clubs meet         the standards necessary                to
compete in Europe and make full use of the resources available
to them to provide grounds of which we can all be proud.                                   The
Government also remains firmly committed to the principle of all­
seating for the great majority of Second Division clubs.


The   review        will    therefore       concentrate     on    whether      there       are
circumstances in which standing accommodation can be retained at
Third and Fourth Division Football League grounds.


I am aware that there are some Second Division clubs with very
low average attendances.               We also need to consider the position
at such clubs, although the primary consideration must always be
the safety of the spectators.


Representations are being invited from a number of interested
organisations to assist me in finalising my re-examination of
these    and    related           issues.      I   intend        to    make   a     further
announcement as soon as possible.


For   the    time     being,       however,    all    Second,         Third   and    Fourth
Division     clubs     should       continue    to plan on        the basis         of    all­
seating being a requirement by the stated dates.


The Secretary of State for Scotland will be making a seperate
statement about the position in Scotland.


In recognising the debt owed to Lord Justice Taylor, who has done
so much to bring about the change in conditions at our football

         POSSIBLE QUESTIONS ON THE ALL-SEATER REVIEW



          <i)     Surely this will cause confusion and some ill-feeling among
         Second Division clubs if a minority do not have to comply fully
         with Taylor?


         It should be             borne      in mind       that Lord Justice                     Taylor made                  76
         recommendations               in    his       Final   Report,            only   4       of     which            were
         concerned with all-seating.                      The Government remains committed to
         ensuring          the     safety         of    spectators           at     sports        grounds,                   and
         continues to support the principles of improved spectator safety
         and comfort contained in the Report.


         On      the      all-seater              question,        if    I        decide         that      standing
         accommodation may be retained at all grounds in Divisions Three
         and Four I will aim to ensure that as few anomalies as possible
         are created.            I recognise that some Second Division clubs attract
         very low average attendances - attendances which are below the
         average        achieved by a few clubs                    in Divisions Three and Four.
         There may therefore be a case for allowing some clubs in Division
         Two to retain some standing accommodation.                                  This is a matter for
          the review.            I emphasise, however,                  that the Government remains
          firmly committed to the principle of all-seating for the great
         majority of Second Division clubs.



          (ii)     How can you ask Second, Third and Fourth Division clubs to
         continue to plan on the basis of all-seating being a requirement
         by the stated dates when a review may change their position?


         I have merely said that I intend to review the current policy,
          I do not intend to speculate about the outcome of that review.


         The all-seater deadlines recommended by Lord Justice Taylor were
         accepted by the Government immediately after the publication of
         his Final          Report in January 1990.                      All clubs have been aware
         since then that they are expected to meet the deadlines, and they

                                                               1
                                                                                                      u? 1

              should continue to plan accordingly unless informed otherwise.


             Any delay in the redevelopment work at a particular ground over
              the next few weeks may hinder that club's chances of meeting the
              appropriate deadline should I decide that the policy is to remain
             unchanged.



              (ill)           How can the Secretary of State guarantee safety at any
             ground whesre restrictions are relaxed when those clubs may be
              involved in cup matches with top clubs?


             The responsibility for ensuring the safety of spectators at a
              sports ground rests with the ground management.                                              The role of
             Government is to provide the legislative framework within which
              safety           may        be       achieved,          and       to   issue    guidance       to    ground
             operators.                 Of course, absolute safety can never be guaranteed -
              the      aim       of      the       legislation          is      to   help    to   ensure     reasonable
              safety.


              Should          I decide              to relax         the all-seater requirement                  for some
             clubs there may be a case for giving the Authority more powers
              to improve the standard of terracing at Football League grounds.
             This is a matter which will be covered in the policy review.
              [At grounds which are not designated under the Safety of Sports
             Grounds Act 1975 (eg Torquay), but which have stands capable of
             holding              more          than           500   spectators        under      cover,     a     safety
             certificate (issued by the local authority) is required under the
             Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.]


             When a big club is drawn to play at a small ground                                               in a cup
             competition the match is often moved to another ground on the
             advice of the police or the wishes of the clubs concerned.                                             I see
             no reason why this practice should not continue.

   (iv)   Isn't this an admission that Taylor and the government were
  wrong to press all clubs into all-seater requirements at great
  cost to hard up clubs?


  Since Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report was published in January
   1990, significant improvements in both safety and comfort have
  been achieved,     often as a direct result of the implementationb
  of its recommendations.             It would also appear that continuing
   improvements in crowd control measures , together with a change
  in the attitudes of football spectators have contributed to a
  decline in football hooliganism (although not,                  regrettably its
  complete elimination).             It is against the background of these
  changed    circumstances,          and   in   view   of   the   representations
  received against introducing all-seating for smaller clubs, that
  I have decided on a review.

           •In his budget of 1990, the Chancellor made available £100 million
            to the football industry over a five year period.                                               This was in
            recognition of the expense of the work that needs to be carried
            out at many grounds.                              The Football Trust was selected by the
            Government to be the vehicle for channeling this grant aid to all
            Football League clubs, and in many cases grants have been made
            towards the cost of installing seating.



             (v)       How long will representations take?


            My      officials               have        today      written      to     a   number      of    interested
            organisations requesting their representations by 3 July.                                            I will
            announce              the        outcome          of    the       review       as   soon    as     possible
            afterwards.



             (vi)         If a club from the current Second Division is promoted to
             the Premier Division after the August 1994 deadline and they are
            not at that stage all-seater,                                 how long will they be given to
             comply with the requirements?


            They will be given 3 seasons to convert their ground                                                to all-
             seater.           This is currently the arrangement for clubs in the Third
            Division who are promoted to the Second Division after the 1994
            deadline has passed.



             (vii)          If we want to provide grounds that we can all be proud of
            as we enter the 21st Century, why restrict these requirements to
            a minority of clubs?


            The Government recognises that there may be a case for reviewing
             the all-seater policy so that it targets more effectively those
            clubs where the risk is greatest.                                 It would seem appropriate that
            clubs in the top two divisions should lead the way in terms of
             facilities for the safety and comfort of spectators. It is also


                                                                          4

         essential          that our top clubs meet                     the standards necessary          to
         compete in Europe.



         (viii)        Who will be consulted in the review?


         My officials have written to the following organisations:


         The Football Association
         The Football League
         The Premier League
         The Football Association of Wales
         The Professional Footballers Association
         The Football Licensing Authority
         The Football Trust
         The Football Stadia Advisory Design Council
         The Association of Chief Police Officers
         The National Federation of Football Supporters Clubs
         The Football Supporters Association


         I have also received a detailed submission on all-seated stadia
         and the Taylor Report from the Parliamentary All-Party Football
         Committee, the recommendations of which will also be considered
         in the course of the review.



          (ix)     Will arrangements be put into place to compensate clubs who
         may have gone to enormous expense to put into place statutory
         requirements which may now be withdrawn?

    over         a     five        yeay         period.         Much    of   the work      that      clubs         have
    already carried out has been undertaken with financial assistance
     from the Football                           Trust/      the body responsible           for allocating
    these monies.                      There will be no compensation for clubs who have
     already carried out any such redevelopment work.



     (x)       Does the fixed capacity threshold mean that clubs would only
     be allowed a maximum                                (1 0 ,0 0 0 ) capacity    even    for one off cup
     games?            Would the FLA have authority to set different capacities
     for these games?


     Should I decide that grounds which have capacities below a fixed
     threshold                (for        example          10,000),      were   allowed     to      retain          some
     standing accommodation then the capacity of that ground would
     have to remain below that figure for all games, even if they were
     to draw a big team at home in a cup competetion.



      (xi)           Are there already any Third and Fourth Division clubs who
     have over 10,000 seats.                                If so this announcement will be of no
     value to them.                        An anomaly?


     Any work already undertaken which improves the safety and comfort
     of      spectators                 will        ultimately      be    to the benefit            of   the         club
     concerned.



      (xii)          What about the anomalies that will arise between clubs in
     Divisions One and Two and those in Divisions Three and Four?                                                         For
     example,              there were four clubs in last seasons Division Three
     where the average attendances were higher than those of Wimbledon
      in Division One.


      It is unlikely that a solution can be found where there are no
     anomalies, but I aim to ensure that as few as possible escape the


                                                                    6
F I RE S E R V I C E S I N S P E C T O R A T E / F E U                                      U71

    review.              There will always be some clubs in the lower divisions
    that attract higher average attendances than some in the higher
    divisions.                  This would be the case wherever a cut off point was
    established.



    (xiii)            How can you justify a match such as Wimbledon v Sheffield
    Wednesday which attracted 3,121 spectators in Division One last
    season having to be played at an all-seated ground, whereas one
    such as Birmingham v West Brora which attracted 27,508 in Division
    Three will still take place in a ground where there are terraces?


    It is unlikely that a solution can be found where there are no
    anomalies, but I aim to ensure that as few as possible escape the
    review.             There will always be some matches in the lower divisions
     that attract more spectators than those in the higher divisions
    because of local rivalries and other factors.                                       This would be the
     case wherever a cut off point was established.



     (xiv)           If the all-seater requirement is relaxed for some clubs,
     will these clubs still have access                                    to the Pools Betting Duty
     monies to assist them in carrying out other safety work?


     It would be wrong to speculate on this until I have reached a
     decision on the future of the all-seater policy.



     (xv)            Has the Government backed down under pressure from the
     football               industry              and    therefore       failed   in    their     to   duty   to
     prevent another Hillsborough disaster from happening?


     No.        Lord Justice Taylor’s Pinal Report made 76 recommendations
     designed to increase the safety of spectators at sports grounds.
     The       vast         majority              of     these were      immediately      accepted      by    the
     Government                 and all             relevant organisations             have been urged         to
     implement                them.             The      Home   Office    Guide   to     Safety    at   Sports
Grounds, known as.the Green Guide, was also revised to take into
account the appropriate recommendations of the Taylor Report.                                  In
addition the decline in hooliganism in recent years has helped
to make our football grounds safer places than they were.


The    Government          remains       committed       to     ensuring      the    safety    of
spectators          at    sports    grounds,       and     continues         to    support    the
principles of improved spectator safety and comfort which were
set    out    by     Lord    Justice      Taylor     in       his    Final    Report    on    the
Hillsborough             Stadium disaster.          My     announcement           today merely
demonstrates our recognition                  that we may need to target more
effectively those club where the risk is greatest.



How can you justify ignoring the advice of the Parliamentary All-
Party Football Committee?


I   have      not    ignored       the    advice    of     the      Committee.          On    the
contrary, I am grateful for the considered way in which they have
put forward their arguments.


Among other          things,       the Committee has             recommended        that clubs
which are willing             to admit no more             than      10,000       spectators to
their        grounds       should    be     allowed        to       retain    some     standing
accommodation.             The question whether there is a threshold below
which standing accommodation should be permitted is one on which
I     have     sought       representations          and        which    I    will     consider
carefully.


I have       written        to Tom Pendry      MP,       the Committee            Chairman/    to
inform him that the recommendations contained in their detailed
submission will be considered in the course of the review.
Do    you    still      consider    there    to    be    a     role   for   the   Football
Licensing Authority (FLA)?


Yes.        The    Government    have decided           that    it would be wrong       to
reconsider either the principle or the timetable for all-seating
at First Division grounds in the Football League (the new Premier
League).          The Government also remains committed to the principle
of all-seating for the great majority of Second Division clubs.
The Football Licensing Authority will continue to exercise their
functions under the Football Spectators Act 1989 to ensure that
clubs in these Divisions are all-seated by the 1994 deadline.


The    Football        Spectators    Act    1989    also       empowers     the   Football
Licensing Authority to oversee the discharge by local authorities
of their safety certification functions under the 1975 Act in
relation          to   sports   grounds     at    which      designated     matches    are
played.


In exercising these powers the FLA may require the inclusion of
any terms or conditions              in a safety certificate,                issued by a
local authority           for a particular ground,               that they think fit.
This function of the FLA is invaluable in ensuring that a minimum
standard of safety exists at all Football League grounds.


Should      I decide      to relax    the all-seater requirement                  for some
clubs there may be a case for giving the Authority more powers
to improve the standard of terracing at Football League grounds.
This is a matter which will be covered in the policy review.

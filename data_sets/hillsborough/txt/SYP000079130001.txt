w a l k e d towards        the    ground.           On the way          I saw about 40 fans           drinking

from    cans    in the street.



Between      the     police       social       club a nd the gr ou nd                I did not    receive       or see

drunkeness.

There was       no o r d e r Ijf queues,             just a mass          of about 5 0QQ         people.        By now

did not           see an yo ne     drinking alcohol               in the ground.



    I have    i n dicated on an a t t a ch e d grid where my first m at ch viewing

    p o s i t i o n was and where          I ended up after              the events        that    led to the

disaster.

speckled,         sports       jacket.        He     looked    very     pale and he was          crying        for

help.         People a ro u nd me were               telling me to help him but                 I was     unable

to move my arms.                 I felt       that my breath was going and he started to

s lip down onto            the ground.              As   he slid down          I grabbed his        jacket      but      I

w as    unable        to hold on.         I could feel             my se lf    being dragged        down.       I was

f o r c e d to    let    go.      I never saw him again.



I cannot         remember ma ki ng my way across                     tjye penx^but,/the next             thing       I

knew     I was        up agai ns t     the     railings       dividi;               4 and 5,        someone

h e l p e d me over and           I left       thro ug h one j A        the escape         gates,      onto the

pitch.
p:             I lay down for a while and                     Jfhen I went to the fences                 and

t ried to help           pull     people       over.        I went     to one       policeman and         said that

the     fencing        had to be       pulled down,           he said         they c o u l d n ’t do     it,   I went

to another            one an d    r ec ei ve d a similar            reply.


  O n                                                               -n / C ^ L
I just went            to the fence 'and start                     pulling it, a group of               police and

fans     joined        in and eventual ly Jthe fencing                    panels      gave way.         I went

to     lie down.         1 was     totally"exhausted.                  I also      remember walking            round

in a daze.             I met     up witft my friend                              at about 3 . 4 5       prn

(1545).          We    c o u l d n ’t see any of our friends and we made                        our way back

to the        police     club at 4.30           pm       (1630).     S h o r t l y after    I realised we

were all         ok apart        from An dr ew DEVINE.                                        laid he had

been s er i ou s ly        injured,



I have        k nown A nd r ew D E V I N E since Octo be r              1987 an d      I have    seen him once

every few months               since    that date.            I cannot        remember what A nd re w was

w e ar i ng    that     day a l t h o u g h    he    left a dark        pullover       in my    car,     on the

way    to the match.

C A T     /    I think          the   police were       slow to realise what was             happening and when

               they     did grasp the           s i t u a t io n tJaffTy did not appear      to know what      to do

              Consequently             they seemed>tfo be s ta nding a r ou n d doing             very    little.



               I feel         that    the   ticket   a l l o c a t i o n for the m a tc h was wrong as Liverpool

              FC    have a far higher a ve r ag e a t t en d en c e              than N o t ti n gh a m Forest.       I

               feel     that      there were      far     too few        pol ic em en outside   the   turns ti le s       to

               o rg a n i s e    eff ec ti ve   queues.

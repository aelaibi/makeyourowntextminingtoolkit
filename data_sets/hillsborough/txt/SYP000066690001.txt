                On S a t u r d a y   15 April        1989   I was    detailed for duty at H i l l s b o r o u g h

The    turnstiles        serial      18 were       responsible          for gate access           to the           seat

in the West Stand only.                   The way the ground              is set out        is that          on the

street        side of the t urnst iles             is an enclosure w hich gives access                             only

to these        turnstiles and the turnstiles                     for the seating           in the North

E>t a n d .

To the        left    of turnstile         16 is a solid metal             barrier        some    12 feet

s eparating          the t u rnstiles          for the seats       from the tu-fnst i 1 es for the

standing        on the Leppings           Lane terraces.            There are        10 foot high

wrought        iron gates       giving access            to this    enclosure and some 50 feet

from the turnstiles.

turnstiles           15 and   16 and P C ’s 513 Francis and 7Q6 H e m s w o r T h were

i mmediately          to my   right working          turnstiles          11 and     12.

I s u b s e qu e n tl y found that turnstiles                   9 and    10 were     giving access                 to

the N orth S tand and a row of t e mporary 3 foot metal                               barriers          had been

erected        between turnstiles               10 and    11.

Initially there were               very few fans want i n g              to go through           the

turnstiles.            There were a considerable                  number willing about                 in

Leppi n g s Ln but they were                   reluctant    to go       iv&a   the ground.         By       1 pm

still      very few people had                 passed through t \he turnstiles we were

s u p e r vising and between             1 pm and 2pm             f e was a very gradual                increase

in the        people    usimg    the turnstile            but still       there     had not been many

people        througfythe       turnst iles        c o n s i d e r i n g the size    of the       crowd

expected.

S h o r t l y after 2 , 3 0 p m the amount           qj/ ’people wanting            to use the          turnstil

increased        considerably and orderly queues                        began to form at           each

turnstile.            We were    still         carrying    out duties          checking     tickets and
                                                                                                       PAGE         3
                                                                                                       S "1095

searching           people    prior    to them going            thro u g h the turnstile       but     it

became      obvious about         the time that to search everyone wait i n g would

cause     unacceptable          c o ngestion therefore we were searching                      only

selected        people       in order      to speed access           into the ground.

At   this     time a problem became                 evident with the tickets              in that

a l t ho ug h the tickets         had been          colour      coded?    red for West S tand seats,

brown for North Stand                 seats    and purple         for L e p p i n g s J U n terrace

standing        the holders       of these          tickets      did not se^m to be aware              of the

significance of these colours.

There were          no signs     telling       peopie     to whi cfs turnst i 1 es to go to for

their     colour       of ticket and a l t h o u g h the turnstiles were                    lettered these

letters       could not be seen through the ever growing                            crowd.     This meant

that     people getting          into      the wrong      enclosure        had to go back onto              the

street      before they         could get to the               correct    turnstiles.        Alsoyflespite

ticket      checking         by police       officers     to ensure        people got t h ^ c o r r e c t

turnstiJfe the volume             of the       crowd waiting          to get      in was /uch by 2.40

that J \ 1     tickets        could not be checked and some                     people yfit.h the wrong

t i c k e ts were getting         into       the m o u t h of the wrong           turVstile and having

to be turned back              from there.          This was       causing       even further

conge s t i o n      in extracting         them from the          turnstiles       before others        could

pass    through.

At about 2. 4 5 p m          I became aware          of people      sitting and standing              on top

of the afore m en ti o n e d           12 foot metal           barrier     to my    left.     They were

getting       onto     the barrier         from the opposite             side    to myself    but were        not

a t t e m pt in g   to get over        it.     A l t h ou gh    I could not see what was

ha ppening at the other                side    of the      barrier       I formed the       impression

that     the weight          of the    crowd at the other             side of the barrier was                such

that     people were          climbing       onto    it to escape         being    crushed.

By 2. 4 5 p m the numbers             of   people waiting          to get       through   turnstiles was

such that           it was    impractical        to search anyone.               People were    still
                                                                                                                 P AGb.          4
                                                                                                                 SI 093

waiting       in queues         for    the turnstiles             but were       very tightly             packed and

by 2 . 50pm the numbers                of    people       in the enclosure             had       increased to such

n umbers      that      the queues          had d e g e n erated to a crush.

I could not see over                  the    crowd but          it was     obvious      that the          large

•amount of people              trying       to gain access          to the turnstiles                   from the

street was            causing    people       to    crush forward           towards      the turnstiles.                    By

this     time        I was    standing at          the side of PC Alexander.                      We were

standing with our backs                     to a 20 foot          brick wall with turnstiles                      either

side of us.             Several       times       the    crowd    pushed forwards                crushing    us

against       thexwall         and the       numbers       of    peopleywas          such that          it was

impossibles to supervise                    them from the          posrition we were               in.     I could

see    t h a / people were            climbing          from the/metal          barrier to my             left    onto

the wail at my back and gaining access to the ground over the top of
                                          jo u & n s
the turnstiles.  There was also a n | / n s p e c t o r on the top of the wall

s uperv i s i n g      them doing       so.        Not many       people       got    in this way.

At this       time      I became afraid             that    if I stayed where                I   was,     I was

likely to/get               injured    in the       crush,       therefore,          PC A l exander and myself

made     oiyr way to the             rear of the          crowd at       the    entrance          to the enclosure

w h i l s / we were          still    able    to do so.

At it/ne afore m e n t i o n e d wr ought                iron gates        to tbfe enclosure              I saw PC

H o r s f i e 1d .     I assisted       him       in a ttempting         to /hut this gate to                prevent

further       people entering               the    enclosure       in ojrcier that           people       could ease

back     from the turnstiles.

We m a n a g e d to keep this               gate    shut     for \ / o r    3 m i n u t e s w hich seemed              to

be helping            the    people     inside          then the gate was            forced open by other

people wanting               to get    in and we had to a llow them to do so.                               At this

time many            people were       rushing about             pushing       others ana seemed             to be

panicking,            not due to        any fear          ofinjury but         panic because             they

thought       they may miss             the kick          off of the football match.

L e p pings Ln         itself was       totally blocked w ith                  people.           When    X saw    it

        By 3     10pm the         crush had begun tfr/ease in L e p pings Ln ary f in front                             of

        the turnstiles             to the West Stand.                  At this time we ware             joined by PS

        M o r g a n and as he joined us we heard over                              his     per^o/val   radio that

        a s s i s t an c e was     required         inside the ground as the                    pitch had been

        invaded.

        We gained access                to the      ground via a turnstile and followed PS Mo r g a n

        along     the back of the West Stand,                         round the back            of the Police Control

        Box and         into the S outh S t and              lower      seating.          Whilst walking     down the

        aisle     towards         the      pitch    I noticed that              there were a considerable

        number         of    people     on the      pitch but there was                   no fighting and the       reason

        for the         pitch invasion was a crush of people                              on the Leppings Ln

        terraces.             I looked onto the terraces                     to the        right of the goal at

        Leppings            Ln and a l t h o u g h they were           full       there still      seemed to be

        plenty of            room for further              people.         When    I got onto the        pitch   I saw

        the    central          pen of the L e p pings Ln terraces was                        very full.     People      had

        been     crushed against              the    perimeter          fencing       and bodies were       piled

        on top of one another and a p p e a r e d dead or badly                                 injured.

        Police         officers       had the gates               to all    the    pens     open and were atte m p t i n g

        to free         the trapped          people and via the gates,                      and over the    perimeter

        fence.          I am a trained First Aider.                         I therefore         stayed on the     pitch

        intiailly treating                  the    injured as they were                   taken from the terraces.

        Once     the main bulk of the                  injured and dead had been moved onto                       the

        pitch and were              beginning        to be tr a n s p o r t e d to the back of the               police
                                                                                                     P AGE    6
                                                                                                     Si 095

             room.      I went      to this    location and a s sisted     in treating     the    .injured

             until     the   last    person had been taken to hospital.

             From there       I again met up with my section and we were stood down from

             the ground.

             In my opinion the main             cause    of the origianl    crush outside        the ground

             was Live rpool         supporters     turning     up at the ground from 2.5 0 onwards

             and not allowing          t h emselves     sufficient   time to get     into the ground

             before the kick off.              Also many     people were turning     up at the ground

             who    had o b viously     been drinking        espec i a l l y the ones who turned up

             late.      This was also         born out whe n     I jfegan to treat   injured      people on

             the    pitch.     I was    obliged to get m u/h c

                                                             cl.oser

             that many of them smelled s t r o n g l y of d r 1nk

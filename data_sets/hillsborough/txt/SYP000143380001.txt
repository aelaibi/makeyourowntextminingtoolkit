       SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHICH YOU THINK IS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR

       TO THIS DISASTER?   (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



 YES - I THINK THE SUPPORTERS WERE EARLIER     IN ARRIVING AT THE GROUND

LAST YEAR.   I WAS SURPRISED TOO AT THE NUMBERS OF FANS MILLING AROUND
                                                                          PAGE

    RECALL. SUCH NUMBERS LAST YEAR

     NO I HAVE MADE MY OBSERVATION ABOUT THE APPARENT OVER POPULATION         OF

    THE CENTRE AREA



    Q 3 7 . DO YOU HAVE. ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

            FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?


                                                                   y
     I THINK THE BIGGEST WEAKNESS WAS THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION BY WAY OF

    PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM TO SUPPORTERS AND THEN THE f Opf^QUALITY O F

    TRANSMISSION WHEN IT HAPPENED.     I KNOW THAT A DOCTOR            -ROM BURTON

    - JOYCE AND ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES OFFERED THERE S E R V ICES AND WERE

    TURNED DOWN BY POLICE AS WAS MY OFFER TO FIND PEOPLE TRAINED IN FIRST

    AID. THE BIG FAILING    HOWEVER WAS COMMUNICATION.   IT WAS JUST CHAOS ON

    THE PITCH AND PLAYING AREA

    G38.   IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

           TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



     THAT THE CRY THROUGHOUT MY SUPPORTING STAFF     IS LACK OF INFORMATION

    FROM PUBLIC ADDRESS ON THE GROUND.

    THE BOASTING OF LIVERPOOL FANS TO US THAT THEY COULD GET INTO ANY

    GROUND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAD TICKETS OR NOT.

      As you know , I have been considering the representations which nave been <=*<=
      m ade about the Hillsborough Stadium disaster on 1 5 April 1 9 8 9 . The d i s a s t e r
      w as of course fully investigated by the late Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor, but
      concern has been raised about a number of features of the case and material ~j~v\ t^>               ,
      considered by som e to represent new evidence has been brought to our                 ^.ob>KAjuMU 3u_
      attention. These and related m atters w ere raised in the Granada Televisions^!? •
      docum entary dram a "Hillsborough" last Decem ber.                                n ^ s r f^ fi^

      M y officials have thoroughly examined the alleged n ew evidence and the                                                                    O*.
      allegations m ade in the Granada television program m e and have concluded th at                                                                  (c . /<=>
      there are no grounds for establishing a new public enquiry. The material has
      also been considered by the A tto rn ey General's O ffice and the DPP's O ffice.
      None of those w ho have exam ined the material consider th at there is evidence
      to ju stify a n ew public enquiry, a re-opening of the inquest, or the prosecution of
      individuals. But I am certain th a t continuing public concern will not be allayed
      w ith a reassurance from the H om e O ffice th a t there is no new evidence. I
      therefore propose th a t there should be an independent examination of the
      alleged n ew evidence by a senior legal figure - a respected judge (serving or
      recently retired), or perhaps a senior Counsel. It will be im portant to ensure th at
      w h o ever undertakes the task is sufficiently senior and respected to com m and
      public confidence. M y personal preference would be for a judge. The proposed
      term s of reference are:
"To carry out an independent exam ination and advise w h eth er there is new
evidence relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 1 5 April 1 9 8 9
w hich provides sufficient grounds for:

       i.     the Secretary of State for the Home D epartm ent to establish a
               further public inquiry;

       ii.    the Attorney-General to consider applying to the High Court under
               Section 13 of the Coroners A ct 1 9 8 8 for another inquest;

       iii.   The Director of Public Prosecutions to consider bringing criminal
               charges a g a in s t^ n y person;

       iv.    The relevant Chief Police O fficer to consider taking disciplinary
               action against any police officer.

Or w h e th e r there is any other action w hich should be taken in the public
interest."

There will need to be a public announcem ent of the establishm ent of the
independent exam ination. This will require careful handling. I am sure that the
announcem ent will have to be m ade in the House. But I shall w a n t to m ake sure
that the ground is properly prepared before the announcem ent is m ade w ith
those outside G overnm ent w ith a close interest in the Hillsborough disaster
including the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

I should be grateful for the Lord Chancellor's advice on a suitable figure to lead
the independent exam ination, and for your com m ents and those of copy
recipients on the proposed term s of reference by 1 2 June.

Copies of this letter go to the Prime Minister, the D eputy Prime Minister, the
Lord Chancellor, the President of the Council, the M inister W ith o u t Portfolio, the
Secretary of S tate for National Heritage, the Director of Public Prosecutions and
Sir Robin Butler.

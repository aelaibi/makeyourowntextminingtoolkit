 I THINK THAT THE ORGANISATION                VERY POOR    IN COMPARISON TO THE SAME FIXTURE

 LAST YEAR.       THERE SHOULD HAVE B E E N M CORDON AROUND THE GROUND SO THAT TICKETS

 AFTER MEETING FRIENDS OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LANE END, WHICH WAS ABOUT 2.45 PM

 (1445),    WE ENTERED THE MAIN GATES,       AT LEPPINGS LANE WHICH PUT US THE AREA

 IMMEDIATELY INFRONT OF TURNSTILES A~G.            POLICE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED THE MAIN

 ENTRANCE GATE TO STOP ANY OTHER SUPPORTERS COMING THROUGH.                 THAT LEFT STILL

 A VERY LARGE NO. OF SUPPORTERS STILL OUTSIDE THE MAIN ENTRANCE GATES.                   THE

 VOLUME OF PEOPLE INSIDE THE MAIN GATES AND THE TURNSTILE AREA WAS STILL GREAT

 IN NUMBERS,     TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE CROWDS SURGED BACK AND FORWARDS-                  AT

 THIS POINT I DECIDED TO GET OUT OF THIS AREA BY CLIMBING A SMALL CHAIN LINK

 FENCE WHICH GAVE ME ACCESS DIRECTLY TO THE RIVER BANK.                 I STAYED THERE UNTIL
                                                                                      page:

 SUCH TIME THE NUMBERS DISAPPEARED WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 3.05 PM <1505)               IN

 MY ESTIMATION.    THEY DISAPPEARED THROUGH A GATE AT THE SIDE OF TURNSTILES A~G

 (WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE KNOWN AS GATE C)

 I GOULDNT SEE WHO OPENED THE GATE.

 ALTHOUGH I C O U L D N ’T GIVE A PRECISE N U M B E R , I WOULD SAY THAT HUNDREDS ENTERED

 THROUGH THIS GATE AT THIS TIME.      CcUwH C   &j                                       (L

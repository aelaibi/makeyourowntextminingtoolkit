                fire      stations         but for    the    past 5 years         I have been based at Darnall                        Rd,

club and J>4Tnow the                 area around           the ground       very well. I made       very

q u i c^rt ime arriving              at the ground and            I think     the time       we a rr i ve d    at

ine ground was 3.25                  pm (1525 hrs)           at the P e n n is o n Rd end.

Just as we arrived,                  we were      re-directed to Leppings              Ln    by someone        at

control.         As we a r ri ve d there,                 we were    told by a Senior Officer,                Mr

S W A I N who    told us to grab the oxygen eqiupment and first aid w hich we

did.     We all        then went          into the ground and as               I. went    in,   I went

through one           of the main g a t e s , either B or C .                   Due to the       fact    that       I

had been driving,               I f ol lo wed         shortly behind the others,                and as we      went

into    the tunnel          I didn't           see    or notice any bodies            on the g r o u n d .     When

I went      into     the    pens 3 & 4 I saw that the m at ch barrier                           had been

ripped d o w n .        I climbed over                the JrtfSl 1 wall and through             the m atch

barriers        onto the        p     i    t     c    I       saw first      of all                          who

was giving mouth                                to a y o u m K w h i t e    male who was on the

ground.         As         was       cjarrying out the inputh to m outh                  I started the

heart massage,             but af ter a few                minutes    it was    obvious      that he wasn't

going    to     recover so           I covered him withy a jacket w hich                    I thought

belonged        to him.         I d i d n ’t take any notice                of what    clothes     he was

wearing       or what      he       1 ookWi     like,      t>ris was due to the fact that               people

were    pulling at me and                 shouting         for help.        Fro m there     I w o rk e d my way

across      the face of the goal m outh towards                            the N orth stand.        How m an y          I

saw then I just             c a n ’t remember,             there were       people    lying on the ground

dead,    injured or           in a state             of shock and what assi st an ce            I could

give,    I gave to them.                  E ve nt u al l y    I found myself at the goal m ou th at

the S pion Hop end.                  At that         end there was         several    casualties,       but    by

that    time     several        doctors         had a r ri ve d to wit h St Johns A mb ulance

people and a mb ulance                crews.

At   that     time,     somebody a sked me                 if I had any oxygen           left   in the
                                                                                                      P AGE      3

c y 1 i nder that         I was   carrying.      I had so they a sked me to go to the

g y m n a s i u m area where       they were     in urgent      need of oxygen.             I went

d ir e c t l y there and upon arrival               I gave assis ta nc e       to a lad who was

age d about        twenty to thirty.           The    lad was having          d if fi cu lt y    in

breathing,         so I gave him oxygen and                I stopped with him u n t i 1 a doctor

tended to him.              Whe n the doctor        carried out a brief           ex am in at io n of

him,     I was advi se d to stay with him and to                     render    oxygen as and when

he needed        it.       This   I did,    ujWlrtT~a n o t h e r doctor arri ve d and deci de d to

a d m i n i s t e r a |dr i p into/fThe     lads a r m .     I stayed with him holding                  the

bottle        until VorjieHCSody a r r i ve d with a stretcher and he was taken                         into

the a m b u l a n c e .

Wh i l s t    I was at the Kop end and just                 befo re I went       to the gym a group

 f Policemen           came onto the        pitch with dogs and they              paced themselves

a long       the touchline        facing    towards    the Kop,       how many there were               I just

d o n ’t know.         There was a Po 1 i ceman who was              brought     into     the gym a s I

was    giving      oxygen to the/ lad we            Lalst mentioned.          The P o l i c e ma n was

brought        in by othe r of f a ce r s / a n d     from the       c on ve rsation w h ic h         I partly

over heard       it seemed that        he had a head          injury.      A lt ho u gh    I couldn't

see any        injury,      he was   very    red in the face and was              in a state           of

shock.

After        the a m bulance      had gone with the          l a d , I returned to the gym and

began to        collect my equi pment whi ch was               the oxygen b o t t 1e and first

a id kit.        The re I saw anothe r group of fire me n and we briefly

dis c u s s e d what       had h ap pe ne d and we all        then    returned after            being

i nst ructed to do so to the                pump.

We then        left the ground,        a rr iv in g back at Darnall            at approx 5 . 5 5            pm

(1755 h r s ).

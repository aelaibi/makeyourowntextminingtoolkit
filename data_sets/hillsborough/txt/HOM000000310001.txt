                   fans were           s e a rched        two or three times at the early part of the day.

                   I -had been on duty                    last year,            9th A p r i 1 1988,              on the Leppings                    Lane

                   turnstiles w h e n the same two teams met at the same ground                                                            in the FA

                   Cup Semi           Final     and knew that things w o u l d get more hectic as the kick

                   off approached.                  I knew that as the day wore on we should have                                                     to be

                  more selective                in w h o m we searched.                         However        last year             the Liverpool

                   fans who wer e              in that part of the ground arrived more spaced out                                                         in

                                                                                       R243

the hours     leading up to the m at c h and we had no problems                  of the crusl:

outside    the gates.        I do not    think that more came this year but              that

they c aittc in a shorter         space of tiroe, due      to different     travel

arrangements      perhaps.
The fans were ver y good natured             in the whole and there was much good

humou red banter about         the searching      etc.     In this early phase none of

the fans could be des c r i b e d as drunk.           The day was bright and

pleasant    and the duty was quite enjoyable.

The   influx of fans        remained    fairly steady until about         2.30pm.      I had

been busy s e arching a s teady stream of fans who w ere now arriving anc

had had    little; time      to look through the         turnstiles to see what was

h a ppening outside.        The    fans had o b viously been queueing            for a while

but   now the moo d of them changed dramatically.                .Some had clearly

arrived    without       tickets and had tried various          ruses with the

turnstile operators.           Some    tried protesting: thatthei: man: who? had

entered -before them had given the operator                 two:tickets one of which

had been for      them a n d.o thers     tried more s t r aightforward bribery.

with- foiir or ^five wh o had tried this and the operator had been- honest

enough to alert us to what had happened.                   It was by this time too

crowded outside          the turnstiles     for person^- without t i c k e t s to reverse

and then ejected.           The t e mptation on the t u r n s t i l e •operator must have

been great     to accept at least some of this bribery and it may be that

 some were admit t e d without         tickets by this means.         We- had already ;

decid ed that     if it was busy w h e n we had to eject persons they would

not be taken to the police room but                ejected via the nearest gate.              Tc

adhere    to formal       procedures w ou l d have greatly depleted the numbers

 of police at the turnstiles wh i l s t           two escorted each ejectee          to the

far corner     of the ground along wit h the possibility of the ejectee

                                                                                                  R243

b eing freed from ones grasp en route.                     This has the unfortunate

effect of reducing           the statistics a v ailable              on such measures but           is

the     only way to act e xp e d i t i o u s l y when     things      are busy.       The

Inspector was aware and in approval                  of   this.

At    the m at c h   last year    some fans      rushed     the turnstiles and came over

the heads of their           fellow supporters         and over the turnstile               since

there are no bars above waist height.                      I did not see this happen at

all    this year.       The crush outside p r o b a b l y prevented them getting

enough of a run at the turnstiles                 to do this.           The s u p p o r t e r ’s mood

last year,        on the whole,     remained pleasant            till    the end and did not

exhibit     the same d r a mati c change as this year.

It became obvious           to me some    time past        2 . 30pm that      there was a great

crush outsidsu - Oiir searching had d r o p p e d to about                   one   in three and :

we were h a v i n g to become more selective.                   The police outside,           when I

could     see   them   through the turnstiles, -had abandoned any searching

a n d were p r e s s e d u p against     the t u r n s t i l e s .   At. times. I could see a

m ou nt ed officer      in a white shirt         in the     throng trying to break, up the

^row®^-         did not     recognise him as a S a u t h Y o r k s h i re~ mounted; and took

him     to be a fore i g n force Inspector.

The     mood of the fans had c o n tinued            to deteriorate. T hey            were now

v ery aggressive,         no doubt due      to having been pushed towards                   the

turh^ti l«s 'by t h e a t e r © © of the ' crowd . c:Many. \£ana iwe^^de«varndtrn.gi that c

we did something about            the s i t uation outside and h u r 1 ing a lot of

abuse at us as they came            through.        Some fans even got hold of some of

us and m a n ha nd le d us as they made           their point.           It almost got to the

point     of scuffles breaking out            in our area with enraged fans blaming

us for the crush.            People wit h young c h i ldren were carrying them on

their shoulders         to avoid the crush and several                  children were passed

through the turnstiles            ahead of their          fathers      in order     to avoid

injury.         There was    then the added p r o b l e m of some families being
                                                                                              PAGE

split up in the crowd and getting panicky.

The    turnstiles           themselves are rather antiquated and are arranged                   in

pairs with a             woo d e n par t i t i o n between the two turnstiles.          This

p ar ti t i o n has     large blocks       of wood on       it in order    to prevent more

than one person squ e e z i n g through whe n the turnstile                   is in the open

position.         The       rotating part of the        turnstile only extends       from about

the height        of an adults knees to a few inches below his waist                         thus

enabling people              to climb over      the top very easily.        In fact on this

day a Police           officer       from outside climbed over         the turnstile where              I

was    to escape        the crush.

There     is a small b lock of metal               fastened    to the outer edge of the

rotating part           on m a ny of the turnstiles.           I cannot say why this is

there but        it    is about       the size and shape of a brake block from a p e d a .

cycle.         Several       times    I saw this getting stuck in the trousers                fly

opening of fans who were pressed by the crowd up against                          the

turnstile.            All    those    I saw stuck    in this manner wer.e wearing d enim

jeans and were              in a turnstile w hi c h rotated c.l.ookwise. w hen viewed

mo v i ng b a ckwards         the fraction of an inch n e c essary to free           the

material        of their       trousers and a l t hough       the turnstile operator

released        the         turnstile pedal      it w ou l d not rotate due    to being held on

::the person ’s             trousers .    The   turnstile was rthusr. blocked--and: t h i s -               :c

e nr a g e d   the people        trying   to get    in even more.       A couple of times           I

was able        to force       the person back enough to free his trousers but on

one occasion           it was     impossible and the man was stuck for several                      -

minutes.         PC Grant,        from our serial,       offered to cut the material

holdin g       this man wit h his pocket knife              in order    to free him,     a

s u ggestion      that was not well             received.

The    ratchet m e c h a n i s m at times became            jammed due to the force of the

crowd on the. t u rnstile and the operator appeared unable to depress
                                                                                                                  PAGE

        the foot pedal              to a llow the                turnstile         to rotate.

        The pair of turnstiles next                              to the single one at the end neares            the

        river,       I believe           this       is E and F, was under               so much pressure        that

        several       times       the central                par t i t i o n was pushed out of line.            This had

        the effect of b l o c k i n g one or the other                              of the turnstiles and not

        al l owing      it to rotate.                      It was then n e c essary       to go    into the

        turnstile and force                    the outer end of the partition back                       into

        alignment.            I did this a number of times and it required considerable

        force to move             the stout                timbers,    an example of the immense pressure

        exerted by the crowd w hic h was pushing                                   on the partition      in a

        hap h a z a r d manner w h e n I was                     pushing on itdirectly and in the

        particular d i r ec ti on needed                         to r e position it.

        By this      time we had been forced to aban d o n all s e arching and

        concent rate on keeping                       the turnstiles w o r k i n g and eject persons who

        had entered w it h o u t               tickets.           They      then started to climb over          the

        wall   in w h i c h the            turnstiles are built and as they climbed down we

        ejected      them.

:r r    The y were no doubt cl i/mb i n g e i t h e r                       to .enter without a:ticket or                if   -

        they had tickets                 to escape the crush outside.:                     The tempers of        the

        fans had d et er io ra te d further                       and I am certain from then on some fans

        came   in the worse                for drink.            . These escaped being arrested             since we <

        things       moving.            Iwas not            in a p o s i t i o n   to refer     to my   watch and

        became       unaware of the exact                       time but about         ten minutes before kick

       - off time the* ;gatje£nea[res4£*to the river,: gate;: C , was opened; and                                 fans        v

        allo w e d    to pour          in.        This a p p eared          to have been organised from

        outside,        whe n the gates opened I was a few feet away and I saw the

        Inspector who had been w ith                            the outside         serials at the gate.        The

        horses       and officers outside had formed a cordon across the lane                                       to

        funne!                                                ound.

   I was caught       in a surge of fans who rushed through pushing with no

   concer n for safety as soon as the gates were opened.                      About a dozen

   people were pushed          to the ground by       impatient mar a u d i n g fans and

   police and fans and myself pulled                these   to their feet and tried to

   slow down the sudden          influx.       I saw one or two fans,       who had,     like

   us,   sensed     the danger       of this headlong charge,       hand out some summary

   justice       to their    fellow supporters      in a     creditable attempt      to stem

   the   tide.

   As soon as the pressure             eased on the outside the gates were again

   closed and the fan3 entered               in the normal manner.       The crush

   ob v i o u s l y built up again because a few minutes            later   the same gate

   was opened again          to let    in another   batch of supporters.         These came

   in a little better orde r e d            than the first    rush but were still

   impatient and anno y e d at having had            to wait.

   In both the       influxes of fans through the gates there: were some who

  wa n t e d    to shelter    away    from the general      rush.   They were clearly

   terrified by what          they    had a lr e a d y experienced outside and what           they

  were     seeing.

   The fans       seemed    to be streaming down the tunnel under             the stand which

   leads       into the central       section of the terracing.        This    tunnel    is

  m a r k ed with sector       letters painted on the: wall a.nd-^there are other

   areas of the       terrace.        The general   flow was down this        tunnel and       it

  does s eem more          obvious    and   logical to head    in this dir e c t i o n rather

ivo.than; r ound -the/vends of        the   stand. \ However,’ if the fans, had been less

  h a s t y and those w i th tickets had taken the time to consult                 the

  m a r k in gs on them and followed          the d i rections there would have been a

  better d i s t r i bu ti on of fans.

  The crowd was so           large and      its rush so mindless with the only

   intention of getting          into the gr o u n d that there was no p o s s i b i l i t y of
                                                                                                   PAGE

 a few stewards        or police being able             to divert them to other areas of

 the ground.        Even     if the danger       had b een perceived             in advance at

 ground    level    it. w ou ld have been         impossible        to divert       this sudden

 influx whatever        the manpower         available.

 I have seen more m a n p o w e r d e p l o y e d      in that area before,             but however

 m a n y serials    there were       inside w o u l d not have prevented                 the problems

 outside w hi c h were       the cause of the gates being opened.                         If moie

 manpower was needed anywhere                it was     outside        the turnstiles          to break

 up the body of the supp orters                into smaller         more manageable            groups

 whilst    they w a i te d    for the turnstiles.

 Our second b r i e f i n g had taken place on the terrace and we were aware

 that there were           railings      from the front          of the stand down to the

 p e r i m e t e r fence at 'the rear of the goal .                There .w*s,.,only one         tra n s f e r -

 gate   in each of         these railings,          a n a r r o w gate at the rear of the

 terrace     in each       case.     PC W as h i n g t o n and    PC   M acmanus were deputed to

 make   their way to these gates               in the case of an evacuation                    to try and

 assist people       through them.           From the          tone of the Inspector at the

■ brief ing he a p p re ci at ed that          in the event        of t h i s :.being necessary, it

 w ould be a very       ’’tall o r d e r ” .

 A l t h o u g h I could see that        the m a j o r i t y     of f a n s were m a k i n g   their way

u into" th e ’ A n t r a l =sectiott and I kne w that sideways movement would be

 very   s low ;due    t-o the small       transfer gates, t never made -t:he connection'

 between the two facts.               I did not       envisage problems on the scale that

 were    to follow.

 W h e r e I was   inaide     t M    turnstiles       I was completely u n a w a r e of: the , ;

 start of the match.               We were     fairly confident           that    the start would be

 delayed     in order      to a l l o w the     latecoming        fans extra time to find

  their w a y   into the ground.             This    I found out later was not                 the case.

  I heard two a n n o u n c e me n t s   on the g r o u n d ' s public address system

 whilst     I was still       at the turnstiles.                The first I believe was asking
                                                                                                  PAGE

 fans coming                into the ground         to slow down and not push,          the second      I

heard was asking                   Liverpool       fans    to leave    the playing area.       I assumed

 that              there had been a pitch           invasion from the latter.

Supporters were                   still   arriving and ma k i n g       there way into     the ground

when I was                told    that we were needed on the pitch.                Although    I did not

have a personal                   radio   I assumed        that   this message had come       to our

serial               sergeant who did have one and then was spread to us all by

wo r d of mouth.

As a serial we made our way around                             the end of the stand and behind

the police control                    room through a transfer gate and down a passage                       in

 the stand o c c u p i e d            by N o t t i n g h a m fans.    We turned   left down another

p assage               in this stand and made our w a y out onto the pitch.

On a r r i v i n g          onto the pitch I still did not appreciate                  that   there had

been any play.                    I was under       the    impression that I was going to stem a

 pitch              invasion at the Leppings Lane end and my attention .was focussed

 there,               I did not     see any players          leaving    the pitch.     There was a

 growing group of people behind                           the goal    and we made straight across.

           :p it c h ’towards ithem^;         As    I ran over       to the ;petrinvet:er fence   the

 fans were pour i n g over                  the top and one of the gates             into the central

 south section had been opened.

 It Was              immediately obvious           that this was not a straightforward pitch

 were standing                 in a group and not running across                the pitch as w ould be

 expected.

&S         soon as I a rr i v e d at the fence               I could see      the real re a s o n for    the

 fans climbing out.                    The fans at the front were pushed up against                     the

 railings wit h                incredible force.            The stout mesh between        the posts was

 bowed out behind                  the goal and the blue paint was being rubbed off

 onto p e o p l e s ’ clothing.                I saw a few people who were being held on

 the fence w ith such force that                          the m e s h was   leaving its pattern on
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                              R243

 their    faces.          I am of the opinion           that several were already dead at

 that stage,         they had a charact e r i s t i c         grey mottled appearance                         to

 their    skin that         to me suggested mor e            than mere unconsciousness.                            I sa^

 a young girl uncons c i o u s wit h her head pushed back at such an

unnatural          angle    that    I thought    it p r o bable       that her neck was broken.

M a n y obviously were             u nc onscious and the whole mass of people at the

front of the terrace were c o m p l e t e l y                immobile.        I had the sickening

re a l i s a t i o n at that point       that people were dying m e r e l y                        inches away

from me and the feeling of o v e r w h e l m i n g helplessnes when I realised

how powerless             in real    terms we were         to quickly get            to them or take th<

p r e ssu re off them.                                                                 >

P u l l i n g at    the fences was       futile since wit h the               immense pressure

being applied             from the other side they were not about                            to give way

with     the me a g r e     force we could muster.               For a few. moments                     I stood on

top of the          low    wall     in front of the fence of the central                               section     and

shouted       to the       fans    to. move back.         I soon r e a l i s e d     that with the

noise     that      they w ere m a k i n g themselves           shouting      in terror and some in

agony any volume             I could make wa3           lost.      We wer e power less                   to              ^

c ommun i c a t e w i t h those at the back,              who    I think were still pushing

forward,       to make       them move     fast enough.            The ones further back- did '

•not a pp r e c i a t e    the p ro b l e m in front of them and did not- realise                              the

reason for          the    police action.                     - - ;             n-         w j   .::

Whilst      I was d oi n g     this I made eye contact with a man who was about a

third of the wa y back up the terrace.                          In front of him was a small

£ r e a- w h e r ej-t h e 7pr e s s u r e off people    se e m e d s l a c k e r h e       was- shouting to

me that      there was a man dead             in front of him on the floor.                               He was

obv i o u s l y beside himself and was                 totally exasperated wit h me for

being unable          to get up to him to help or to remove                        the crowd.                 I

wanted to tell             him that    there more people dead or dying at the front

and that I c o u l d n ’t free them but                 there wasn't        the time.                  I later
                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                  R243

  realised      that he must have been near where                      the crush barrier had

  collapsed.

  From shouting and s ignalling                 to move back I turned my efforts                  to what

  I hoped w ou l d y ield better           results.           I went    to the gate which was

  open and tried          to help get people            out.       There were already about six

  o fficers     there at this gate,             one of w h i c h I recognised as Sergeant

  Swift,     who were p ul l i n g at people            to get       them through the gate.          Some

  of these people wer e alre a d y uncons c i o u s                 and some were not but the

  pressure on this nar r o w gate was such that                        it was    like a log jam.       So

 m a n y people were pres s e d          into the area around the gate that                  it took

  he r c u l e a n efforts    to get     just one out.             One man we tried to pull          out

 was u n concious        and was wear i n g a m a r o o n          jumper.      About   six men were

 p u ll in g on him to pull            him through       the gate,       out of the mass      inside.

 We must have         injured people        in our haste            to get them out and relieve

  the pressure on the rest.

 Progress at that gate was so p a in fu l l y slow and there were many other

 p olice around        it so I turned m y a t t e n t i o n s         to a gate     into the south

 enclosure          The people here had room to m ove around and I' reasoned                               •

 that     if we remo v e d plenty of people               from here through the gate and

 m oved    the rest over            to the edge    then those         from the central       south

 section where all           the c a sualties          lay,   could climb over          the dividing

, fence and ease ^the p,fieas ure .in the central                     south ‘a-reav^Tfri^' iiatT

 alre a d y started       to happen n at ur a l l y and I tried to speed up this

 process and once           the crush s u b sided went              into the e n c losure    to move

 the people a b o u t .

 There was every emotion present                   in those people.             A lot of anger and

 abuse was d ir e c t e d      towards us as we           fought      to help    their   fellow

 supporters,       we were,         I suppose     the nearest         target for    their

 u nd er s t a n d a b l e anger.     Man y were so shocked as to be almost                 immobile

 and some wer e        just standi ng weeping.                As    the pressure eased near me a

  large number         of people climbed over the dividing                 fence,    where I now

  w a s , and as      they did we could see more and more bodies                    lying on the

  concrete       where all        these people had been standing.

  The mass       of bodies        was near     the front     fence and appeared       to be        three

 or four deep all along                 the front       of the central    south section.           There

 were more bo d i e s          further back up the terrace but more spaced out and

 not    in such great           concentration.

 I was working w i t h a number                of fans and a few people         in this area

 ferrying       the    injured      from this section,         lifting them over       the

 dividing       fence and passing          them one by one to people on the pitch via

 one of the gates.               The injured seemed endless,           most w ere unconscious

 the others had           injuries      to limbs and diff i c u l t y breathing.            We

 c on c e n t r a t e d our   initial    efforts        on removing those w ith most chance

 of survival.          Those      obv i o u s l y dead were    left   in situ until        later    to

h asten those a l i v e          to a m bulances and the doctors,          I h o p e d , were      now

 on hand.        I h a v e ; n o possible way of remembering             the d e s c riptions      of

any of those I removed.

During      this    time I was       totally pr e o c c u p i e d with what    I was doing,"!' -

have no r ec ol le ct io n of what was going on in the immediate distance

from me or         indeed who I was working with.                 I had felt so helpless

b efore and now I was at last                  in a p o s ition   to do something positive,

There was still           a lot of abuse and a g g r e s s i o n directed tovfards us but

I totally d i sr eg ar de d         this and I am sure         I pushed aside,       rather

r o u g h l y , anyone who       impeded me.

I stayed on the terrace and continued                       removing people.        When    the    live

had been carried              out we m o ved    the dead and only when they wer e all

m o v e d out onto      the p itch did         I want     to p ause and look around.             It was

then that I saw the crush barrier                       that had given way bent out of all

shape.      Tljese b a r r i e r s appeared so stout and solid it was                 incredible

   that     the pressure           of people had bent         it and forced       it over.    It was

   then that         I made      the c onnection between            the man who had been shouting

   to me at        the beg i n n i n g and        the collapse of the barrier.          I feel

   certain that           the deaths he had been trying to tell me about                     had been

   caused by the p r e s s u r e prior              to the collapse.

   I left      the    terrace and went             onto   the pitch    to see    if I could help

   carry any c a sualties                over    to the ambulances.       I picked up an

   a d v e r t i s i n g h o a r di ng   to use as a stretcher but most of the people had

  a lre a d y been moved.                I felt suddenly surplus         to requirements.        All

   the casualties had been m ov e d but we were now surrounded by a lot of

   angry     and a g g r e s s i v e     fans.     I sensed   that    if their anger and. brief

   turned      towards       the N ot ti ng ha m supporters we would have some serious

   problems on our hands.

   It was      then that I notice d               that police had already set up a cordon

   acrons      the pitch and since there was                  little else for me to do I went

   and    joined that at the end where                    it met    the stand close    to the

   directors box.

   wa n t e d nipping         in the bud.          Two police escorted him from the pitch or

   at    least behind          the cordon and the rest of us stayed: to try and

   defuse      the situation.

      I then saw the rest                of my serial     standing    in a group near the goal

   m o u t h and mad e m y wa y over              to them.    We stood for some time until             the

   a nnouncement          came that         the m a t c h had been abandoned.        As the fans

      tarted     leaving       the ground we went as a serial              out    into Leppings    Lane
 and escorted        the fans up towards             their   transport.      The a g gression

 seemed    to be d r a i n i n g out of them leaving those we were walking with

 v er y quiet and subdued.

 Outside     the Leppings        Lane turnstiles         I noticed a g a lvanised

 c o rrugated metal         par t i t i o n between    the turnstiles        1 to 16 and A to

 G.    This was dis t o r t e d and showed much evidence of the pressure which

 must have been exerted on it by the crowd.

 We halted at the roundabout at the junction with Leppings                               Lane and

 Penistone Road until            we received a call           that there was fighting               in

 the park.      We m ade      our way back down Penistone Road                     towards   the

ground and shor t l y after arriving                  there were     instructed to sit             in the

 stand nearest         to the gym to await            further deployment.            After we had

been add r e s s e d   I went with another            officer     to fetch some         "max pax"

drinks    for our serial          since none of us had eaten since about                     10.30am

and were at         least    in need of a drink.

We hung around d r i n k i n g       "max pax"       and talking.        There were several

officers young         in service on our         serial,       in particular         two young

women,    one just out: of. her p r obation and the other wit h about one

year's experience.             They had only worked            so far on town centre             foot pai


and as far as I k n ow           had not been to a serious                  road a c c i d e n t .They

they must be feeling             an awful    lot worse.

Inspector Barker         came out of the gym w hi ch was being used as the

m o r tu ar y and   took about      four of our serial           to move boards with

exclusion orders         on before      relatives wer e allowed             in to the gym.

We than k f u l l y were     told that we could stand down and went                     to try and

 locate our van w h i c h we had travelled                  in but which was being used for

 other    things.          We were unable        to find    it and walked up to Claywheels

 Lane h oping      co arrange         some   transport      from there.

At Clayw h e e l s     lane we spoke         to some Barnsley division motor c y c l i s t s

who had been         involved       in ambulance escorts.           They pointed us in the

d i r e c t i o n of the mo b i l e    canteen and a few of us were hun g r y enough

 to eat.      I went        looking for somewhere           to wash since I had been          in

 contact w i t h mor e vomit,            spit,    blood and urine      than I wa n t e d to think

about.       I failed        to find a free sink and had to be content wit h a

wipe down before having something                     to eat.

 E vent u a l l y we w e r e a l loc ated       transport back to Barnsley and arrived

 there at about            8pm.   Once    there we made       it a priority to check with

our families that             they had been informed that we were all safe only

 to find that        they were        c o mpletely    in the dark.      My wife had

r e p e a t e d l y rung    the police station and t h e emergency number given out

 on the tele v i s i o n without          any success.

The w hole serial            then a d journed      to the bar to take some solace             in

 In c o n clusion      I m u s t say     that    the fans arrived      in great numbers        in a

 last year whe n           the same m a t c h was played and I was on the same duty.

 However     if the fans had been better behaved and exercised more

-patience the t i c k e t         holders would have all got           in safely.. . Even if

 they had mis s e d         some of the start of the game they should resolve

 that next m a t c h and they should aim to be there                    in good time.         As   it

 was   they pushed w i t h such force and without                  thinking of their      fellow

 me n until     the gates had to be opened                 to avoid da n g e r outside.

 Instead of then being satisfied                   that    they were   in the ground and

   finding a place      to stand,     they then dem o n s t r a t e d   the same m i n dless

   impatience w it h o u t any thought         for their   fellows and they caused          the

  deaths    of m a n y p e o pl e who had plan n e d ahead and arrived          in good    time

  They may have bee n given         insufficient       tickets but many had travelled

  without    tickets hoping      some h o w to get     in and    if the pushing outside

  the turnstiles was a ploy          to secure      their admission it certainly

  worked.     There m a y be fewer      turnstiles at H i l l s borough than other

  grounds    but   its p o s i t io n hemmed   in by houses on one side and a river

  on the other does not help           in the p r o v i s i o n of more unless     the

  layout of the ground         is re-arranged.

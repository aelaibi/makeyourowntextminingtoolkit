            the Blackburn Rovers supporter and the Manchester United fan!


           Tnat is why our election m May was so significant, it broke with
           the past.

           failed.         The O ne Nation politics of Tony Biair and New Labour
                     triumphed,



           The British people - and the people here in the North West -
           w anted a new start,, a new direction, a new government.

               i am convinced that Hillsborough proved that the inquest system
               in its present                    fo rm   js unsuitable as a means of dealing with
               disasters of this kind.

                W hen - within weeks of the election - 1 asked Lord justice Stuart

           But - and f am sorry to say this - a new enquiry would serve no

           purpose. It is simply not in anyone's power - nine years iater - to
       m ake retrospective changes in the police discipline system, or in
       the system of iocjuests.


       And, as for w ho was to blam e and why the disaster happened, we
           know that already. Lord Taylor told us that the main cause was
       the failure o f police control, and Lord justice Stuart Smith
       c o n firm e d it.

           Indeed, it w ould play tricks with their emotions, raising their
           hopes in a way in w hichjcouid never be fulfiiied.


           I set up the scrutiny because I thought it w a s the right and just

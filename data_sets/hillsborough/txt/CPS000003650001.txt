 Deai: Sir,

H illsboro ugh

Further^to previous correspondence, we have been given to understand
by the Health & Safety Executive, who presently have custody of the
broken.barrier 124ft, that no access to the harrier and, in
particular, no taking of samples is to be permitted and that anv
enquiries in this connection are to bo referred ho yourself,

As you _know, wa are acting for die Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire in-the civil proceedinefs and one of the issues in the
case Is whether the barrier failed whilst' under a load less t h a n ■
the load which it ought to have safely carried,

<WhJjst our Engineer can make coioi estimator about thiv on the basis
of a physical j.its pec t ion of the bartieio which he has carried out:/
    final. report oan.be prepared tor uao in the civil proceedings
witnout some samples boing taken and. reota'llnrcical!y to sted.

As you may be aware, there is a pro-trial review in the civil
actions at'Manchester high Court on Thursday, P6th October before
Mr, Justj.cti Rose,  At that « t a g o r we may bo callo.il upon to indicate
wj161' we anticipate having expert evidence available and, indeed,
vnon wo arc able to consider n number of other points which depend
upon the availability of that evidence.,




                                                                                                                                 contd.

                                        r
       2,   if n o t , can any prospective date be given wh*n
            such samples might b* available?

  Dear Sirs

  HILLSBOROUGH

  Your faxed letter dated 20 October 1989 addressed to the
  Director of Public Prosecutions has been passed to me for
  reply.

  With regard to the question of possible prejudice and the
  D.P.R. Futures case, it is our view that, on balance, no
  application to stay civil proceedings needs to be made.
  However, the Director would be grateful to receive an
  undertaking that the Judge dealing with interlocutory matters
  at any stage be referred to the DPR case so that he may be
  alerted to the problem if necessary making orders restricting
  publication of sensitive or potentially prejudicial matters.
  The same would apply if the civil trial itself were to precede
  the Director's final decision.
  With regard to the request made to the West Midlands Police
  for samples to be taken from barrier 124A for metallurgical
  testing. There is no objection to such samples being taken
  providing the following undertakings are first given in
  writing by each party
  1.   When samples are taken and when tests are carried out
       wherever they occur a representative nominated by the
       Crown Prosecution Service is to be present.

  2.   Photographs are to be taken whenever samples are obtained
       and copies provided to the C.P.S.

  3.   All reports and data are to be provided promptly to the
       C.P.S.

  Please would you be good enough to liaise on the above points
  with either myself or Mr Michael Kennedy in this office.
  Yours faithfully

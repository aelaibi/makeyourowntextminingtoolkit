            Arnold, Notts.



            On Saturday 15 April                          1989 in company with several other officers                                 of my

Ground which was allocated for use by coaches used by Nottingham

Forest su pporters, out towards Junction 34 of the Ml motorway.



Prior to the match starting, myself and Pc Wei Is paid particular

attention to two public houses on our area,                 the names of which 1

cannot    remember.         The nearest one ofytnese two pubs to the ground <a

distance of approx            1 mile from th* football      ground) was crowded to

bursting        point from the moment/it opened. Even the car park was not

capable of housing many veQj/cles due to it being crowded with people

dr ink in g .



These people I again believe to be Forest supporters. As the day

progressed the route from this pub to the ground was busy with people

walking towards and away from the area of the Hi 1lsborough g r o u n d . A

lot of these people were the worse for dr/ink (both going to and coming

from the area of the pub) and a lot of/our time was spent stopping,                         or

rather trying to stop, many of the jpeo pie who were intent on

urinating       in the street      in full v/ew o f other members of the public,

both pedestrians and occupants p f trav el l ing vehicles. This was a

hopeless task, mainly due to Vhe area we had to cover and a lack of

other    police officers.         B u r lin g this ti me I had to experience a lot of

verbal abuse from people,            im ose who we re behaving badly and those who

were expressing views that we (the police)                 should be doing something

'about these people who were misbehaving.



At about 3 . 10pm 1 hea/d a VHF           radio call    requesting any OSCAR GOLF

mobiles    (Dog v a n s / to urgently attend the Hillsborough Ground,               but no

reason was g        a   s     to w h y . T h i s , myself and Pc We 11 s d i d , within a

couple of minutes.
                                                                       PAGE       3
                                                             /         S2S4E

Upon our arrival we spent the majority of the timjr'fiutside the g round

unaware of what was happening and waiting toJtfe deployed accordingly.

During this time outside the ground whils )c waiting I was approached fay

a man who stated he was a doctor and h^id heard on his car radio of the

incident occurring    (he obviously knd^w more than me). He stated he had

come to see if he could be of any help.        I said that I was not fully

aware of what was happening and was not the best person to advise him?

due to me being from a foreign force.      I however asked him to stay with

me as I would take him to someone who would know how he could help.



Near to where we were was an ambulance officer bearing three pips on

his shoulders, who was directing ambulances        into the ground upon their

arrival.    I went to this ambulance officer to ask him for advice

regarding the doctor.    I spoke to him on two occasions when I

considered he was no^-^particulary busy but was totally ignored by him.

I then went just in^di^ the ground to see another ambulance officer

(wearing two pips) who I spoke to but again did not get any help. The

doctor,    who remained with me during this time,     said that he would find

his own way and went    into the ground.

Shortly after t h i s , I along with other dog fyaTndl e rs we re directed with

our dogs,    into the ground a nd stood in f/'ont of the stand occupied by

the Forest supporters.     I was still non, fully aware of what was

happeni ng as the re was no information comi ng over the radio or from

other officers of r a n k . All th^t I could see was a cordon of police

officers towards the Liverp/ro 1 side. Between us and this cordon were

people obviously injurej/'or dead but I was unable to do anything to

help because of having my dog.



Once outside the ground after we were s£ood down from duties         inside

the ground,    I went with Pc Wells to J m e   previously mentioned bus
                                                                                  PAGE     4
                                                                                  S2842

         station used by the Forest supportj/rs c o a ches, as was our brief from

         the early morning briefing. Herje we ended up carrying out T raf f i c

         duties with the buses       leavingsthe station but primarily assisting the

         ambulance service who were/using the same bus station as a temporary

         ambulance station, m a k i n / sure that the access     remained clear from the

         heavy t raff i c .   This w f   did of our own accord be i ng the most useful

         thing we considered t d be done at our location.          I received no contact

         from any supervisory officers to tell us what was happening or to

         instruct us what to d o .

         We were stood down at       1936 hours and returned to Nottingham.

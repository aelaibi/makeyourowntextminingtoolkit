               At 8.00am on Saturday 15th April               1989 I came on duty at Doncaster

               At approV.yi'1.30am following briefing                  I took up position at Tanfie 1 d

               Road    in company PC Russon on general                traffic   control

               At approx     1.00/1.30pm due to large numbers of Nottingham F o r e s t

               supporters walking along Penistone Road several                      of our Serial    took up
                                                                       PAGE

a position at a line of s hop s in the vicinity of Borough R o a d .

We remained at this point until approx 2.15pm when we moved to a

junction further along Penistone Road due to the number >af supporters

It was noticable that many      supporters had been drin>lnq h e a v i ly and a

large number were    carrying   containers of beer          as kick off time

approached there seemed little urgency among many to get to the ground

and queues were still forming at the shops       less than 20 minutes before

kick off.    Fans   in general at this time were very abusive and un­

cooperative.

Around the appointed kick off time w e made our way towards the ground

and entered at the Spion Kop end as several C & V squads were entering
              X
the playing area.  At this   time I had no idea of what was happening in

the ground and our Serial was ordered        to take up posit^jron in front of

the Spion Kop facing the Nottingham Forest fans.         fcKe dog men were

brought   into position with our Serial   for crowd control although they

were not needed as only a small minority of Forest supporters         seemed

intent on trouble.

Several   bodies were carried to our end of the ground and were being

attended to nearby and transported away by ambulance.

Liverpool   fans were being allowed to rip down advertising boards to

use as stretchers and the only problems we encountered public order

wise were incidents of verbal abuse between/irndi viduals whi ch were

easily subdued.

F o l 1owing duty in the ground our Secoal    then moved onto Penistone Road

to help with crowd and traffic    control.

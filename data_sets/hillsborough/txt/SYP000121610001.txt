 1.1                 incident on 15 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday
       Football CLub s (SWPC) Hillsborough Stadium on 16 April 1989 at the
       request .of ^ M s Nattrass, Area Director of South Yorkshire and
                               Agric?ltural Inveterate of the Health and Safety
       Exeaitive pBE). Subsequently I was appointed to head the USE
       jnVe^ L9a^ n?^the ixicident following correspondence between the court of
       inquiry and the Deputy Director General of the HSE, Mr J D G Hanmer.

 1.2        rgPQrt contains details of examinations performed on site and in the
       laboratory. The work was carried out by me and by other staff of HSE
       working on my instructions and under my general supervision.

2 SURVEY OF P B S 3 AND   A
2.1 Using the drawings prepared by Ralph Brade & Associates, 1340/02 and 03,
                       figures stated in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
    1986, the following assessments were made.

2.2 Pie heights of crush barriers should be 1.02m to 1.12m with a preferred
    height of 1.1m. In Pen 3 four out of five barriers do not conform. In
    Pen 4 six out of nine barriers do not conform.

2.3 Die alignment of gaps in successive rcws of barriers on a terrace should
    farm an angle of less than 60* to the barriers. Of the four 'paths of
    gaps in Ben 3, two do not conform. Of the eleven 'paths of gaps' in Pen
    4, one does not conform.

2.4 Gaps in the line of crush barriers should be at least l.im and not more
    than 1.4m in width. In Pen 3, four out of five gaps do not conform, in
    Ben 4, nine out of ten gaps do not conform.

2.5 For a terrace slope of approximately 14* the interpolated maximum
    horizontal distance between barriers is 3.9m. In Ben 3 only one spacing
    does not conform. In Ben 4 only two spacings do not conform.

2.6 Gates or other access points should have a minimum width of l.im. 3he
    gate to Ben 3 has a clearance width of 0.81 to 0.82m and the gate to Ffen 4
    has a clearance width of 0.77 to 0.79m. Both therefore do not conform.
2.7 Die aim is for every spectator on the terraces to be within 12m of a
    gangway or exit, if the perimeter gaps are not considered as exits then
    approximately 40% of the ^ectators in Pens 3 and 4 will not be within
    12 metres of an exit.


3 EXAMINATION OF TOE BROKEN BftRRTFR - MQ 124A

3.1 Bam-eir 124A was examined by HSE staff at Hillsborough Ftootball Ground on
    17 April 1989. Various parts of this barrier and 3 core           of
    concrete were taken to the Sheffield Laboratory on 24 April 1989 for
    detailed assessment.

3.2 It was deduced that barrier 124A had consisted of a continuous horizontal
    tube, made fran wroucfat iron, and four vertical supports each nwfa from
    two lengths of steel angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset
    plate. Five of the eight support feet were reinforced by additional angle
    sections which appeared to be let into the concrete terrace steps. Two of
    the rear support legs were braced by further angle sections. A
    reconstruction is shown in Figure 1. The barrier had failed apparently by
    partial collapse and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the
    horizontal tube at supports 2, 3 and 4, as shown in Figure 2. The portion
    of the tube which had been located between supports 2 and 3 had been bent
    uniformly to give a mavimim permanent deflection of 133nm at midspan. The
    portion of the tube which had been located between supports 3 and 4 had
    been bent uniformly to give a mayimm permanent deflection of 200mm at
    midspan. Barrier 124A was estimated to be approximately 60 years old,
    although it had received a number of modifications during its lifetime.

3.3 The tensile strength of the wrought iron tube material was measured at
    365MPa (23.6 tcnf/irr) with an estimated elastic limit of 15CMPa
    (9.7 tcnf/in2). The tensile strength of the mild steel angle used for
    the supports was measured at 360MPa (23.3 tcnf/in2) with a yield stress
    of 288MPa (18.6 tcnf/in2).
3.4 Ihe tube fractures had occurred in areas which had been located under the
    metal straps designed to retain the tube. At these locations the tubes
    had not been painted, and the tube wall thicknesses, nominally 4.5mm, had
    been reduced significantly by corrosion. At the fracture surface
    corresponding to support 2 the residual thickness of the tube wall was
    found to vary from 0.4mn to 4.4mn around the circumference. Similarly at
    the fracture surface corresponding to support 3 the wall thickness was in
    the range 1.6am to 4.5nn. At support 4, however, there was evidence that
    the tube wall had been perforated by corrosion at two locations producing
    holes which would have been approximately 10nm and 20nm in diameter before
    the collapse. Elsewhere, around the fracture corresponding to support 4,
    the wall thickness was in the range l.lran to 4.Son.
3.5 In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
    iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. Fracture
    of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on the uphill
    side of the barrier at a position approximately 90* from top dead centre.
    The other tube fractures had suffered seme post-failure damage and the
    origins were not readily identifiable.

3.6 The failed supports had been corroded, particularly at the junction with
    the concrete steps and/or reinforcement angles. In these regions residual
    thicknesses in the range 3.Iran - 5.9mm were measured ccnpared with a
    nominal thickness of 6.3mn.
3.7 Large amounts of metal had been lost by corrosion from supports 3 and 4
    near, what would have been, the original junctions between the support
    feet and the terrace. In one case (rear leg support 4) a ligament of
    metal 8nm vide was all that remained of the original angle section (50 x
    50nm). Cn two of the four feet this region had been reinforced by the
    addition of a length of meted angle which had been bolted on top of the
    original angle from which the support had been made. Ihe height of the
    concrete terrace had been raised at same stage and this had concealed the
    previous corrosion damage. The appearance of the concrete cares,
    extracted from near the support feet, was consistent with this
    observation.
3.8 Calculations to establish the farce required to cause the collapse of
    barrier 124A, and the collapse sequence are currently underway.

                                       2
3.9   One of the remaining barriers in the Central Pen will be tested to
      destruction in the near future in order to validate the calculations.

4 PWESTIGATICN OF TURN5TTTRS AT toe EEPPINGS IANE   WD
4.1 tti 25 April 1989 BSE staff made tests on turnstiles at the Leppings Lane
    end of the stadium to investigate how the application of a force to a
    'gate' affected the release of a turnstile. On 28 April 1989 tests were
    made to assess the accuracy of the ccnputerised system for counting and
    recording the admissions through the turnstiles. Calculations were made
    to compare the average admission requirements of turnstiles serving the
    designated zones of the stadium. Counts of people passing through the
    turnstiles A to G were made from video recordings.

      THE EFFECT OF A HORIZONTAL FORCE RISKING CN THE 'GATE' OF A TURNSTILE

4.2 TVimstiles C to G appeared to be of the same pattern, whilst turnstiles A
    and B were of a different pattern. In the tests a known force measured by
    a load cell was applied to the 'gate' of the turnstile. Standard test
    weights were then placed gently on the pedal until the spindle was
    released. The tests shewed that turnstiles C to G were likely to be more
    difficult to release than turnstiles A and B.

4.3    A turnstile operator having a weight of 750 N (12 stone) or less might
      have difficulty in releasing turnstiles in the group C to G if a force of
      480 N (110 lbf) or more was applied to the 'gates'. The same operator
      might have difficulty in releasing turnstiles A and B if a force of 1340 N
      (300 lbf) or more was applied to the 'gates'.

      THE ACCURACY OF THE GCMEUHRISED SYSTEM PCJR COUNTING AND RECORDING
      AEMISSICNS

4.4 TXimstiles were checked by rotating the 'gate' a knewn number of times and
    then recording the count measured in the control room. Tests of
    turnstiles in the group 9 to 16 indicated that they recorded the correct
    number of admissions.

4.5   Tests indicated that turnstiles A, B, C, D, E and F were likely to record
      the correct nunfcer of admissions. In my opinion turnstiles A to F, as a
      group, would indicate the correct nunfcer of admissions to within 1%.

4.6 Tests indicated that there oould be a persistent error in the recorded
    number of admissions through turnstile G. It is ay opinion that this
    turnstile might continuously register less than the correct number of
    admissions during a period of operation. It was concluded that the error
    was probably attributable to the roller of the roUer-plunger micro-switch
    fitted to this turnstile only just making contact with the upper boss of
    each 'gate'.

4.7 Additional detectors were installed across each turnstile passageway at
    positions above the gates. Examination of these devices indicated that
    some appeared to be disconnected and in some cases the wiring had been
    cut.

      AVERAGE ADMISSIONS REQUIRED fRCM THE TURNSTILES

4.8 By reference to Eastwood & Partners Drawing No 8945/1A dated 16/4/87
    figures were obtained for their estimates of the capacity of the various

                                         3
    zones of the stadium. On 28 April 1989 HSE staff surveyed the cutside
    perimeter of the stadium to identify the nunbers of turnstiles used by
    each zone. Six groups of turnstiles served the six zones of the stadium.
    These axe summarised in the following Table.

4.9 The three groups of turnstiles having the highest average admission
    requirements were sited at the Leppings lane end of the stadium, i.e. West
    Terrace Standing, North Stand Seating and West Stand Seating.

4.10 The average admission requirement of the turnstiles serving the West
     Terrace « « the highest for any zone of the stadium. It was almost 3.5
     ♦••imps the lowest average admission requirement which is that for the South
     Stand Uncovered Seating and approximately 2.9 times the average admission
     requirement for Spion Kdp.
     COUNTING OF PEOPLE AEHTFTED THROUGH TURNSTILES A TO G FRCM VICED
     RECORDINGS
4.11 The video recordings used for the counting were delivered by West Midlands
     Police and were identified KJH2/E/Part 1, RJH2/E/Part 2, K3H2/E/Part 3,
     RJH2/F/Part 1, KJH2/F/Part 2, RJH2/F/Part 3. They shewed the exits of
     turnstile booths A to G from approximately 12.55pm until 3.10pm on
     15 April 1989. The continuous reference timings on the video recordings
     were with respect to the start of each recording, and not to British
     Summer Time (BST), but the relationship between the recording times and
     BST was determined from the observation of specific events in conjunction
     with West Midlands Police.
4.12 The method of counting used a ndcro-conputer and specially developed
     program. A push-button was depressed every time a person was seen to
     emerge from an identified turnstile booth and the ccnputer recorded the
     signal and its time. People emerging frcm turnstiles A and B were counted
     together         it was not always possible to differentiate between
     people emerging from these individual turnstiles.
4.13 The analysed data provided the relationship between the total rwnber of
     people seen to emerge from turnstiles A to G and the time that they
     emerged. Figure 3 shows the total nunber of people that had emerged from
     turnstiles A to G over the relevant period of time.
                                         4
4.14 I was infanted by West Midlands Police that the turnstiles were opened
     before the start of the video recordings. At approximately 2 .00pm just
     over 2,000 people had been counted and at 2 .52pm this mnber had risen to
     approximately 6,000. The final total count was 7247 people.
    The HSE count totals are summarised in the following table and compared
    with the swPC computer print-out, taken on 15 April 1989, a oqpy of viucii
    was provided by West Midlands Police.

        TOfEAL        7247      7038*


       * See paragraph 4.15
       Turnstiles A and B, D and E and F and G had ocnmon exits, and hence the
       HSE and SWPC counts of these pairs of turnstiles have been conbined.

4.15 paragraph 4.6 of this report referred to a persistent error in the ocunt
     obtained from turnstile G. This could result in no signal being sent to
     the pfiip    even though a person had passed through the turnstile and
     could account for the discrepancy between the HSE count of 2019 for F plus
     G and the SWPC count of 1632.
4.16         on the assumption that the SWPC ocnputer printout accurately
       recorded A to E and that the HSE count for F and G was less than the
       nunber who actually passed through F and G by a similar percentage to that
       obtained front A to E, the estimate for the total number of people that
       entered through turnstiles A to G is 7494. In By opinion the actual
       nunber is unlikely to have exceeded this value by more than 2%, i.e. 7644.

 4.17 The rate at which people were counted through all the turnstiles is shewn
      in Figure 4. The rate is for a 3 minute time period and shews the ramber
      of pecple per hour per turnstile. Die rate increases rapidly at about
      1.40pm and remains fairly constant between 2.05pm and 2.50pm. Die mean
      rate for      period was about 660 people per turnstile per hour. Between
      2.55pm and 3.00pm the rate increased and reached a maxiiium of about 1150
             per turnstile per hour. This increased rate coincides with the
      Hmo       c was        and could therefore be a result of decreased crcwd
      pressure allowing a faster flew through the turnstiles.
 4.18 If the rate of 660 had been maintained frtxn 2.50pm onwards and no gates
      had been        I estimate that it would have taken until about 3.40pm to
      bring the total nunber of people admitted through turnstiles A to G to
      10,100. (The quoted capacity of the West Terrace standing area.)

 ESTIMATE OF PEOPLE A              i %s*re c* m w   if m   video recordings
1 A video neaarding labelled RJH2, delivered by West Midlands Police, was
  used for this analysis. It was copied by HSE photographers and a timing
  reference added. This copy was given the identification DF1/B. It showed
  the exits of turnstile booths A to G, Gate C and the general area on the
  West Stand side of these turnstiles. The continuous reference timings on
  the video recanting related to the start of the      and not to BST.

2 I was told by West Midlands Police that, following scrutiny of
  synchronised video recordings, the 'First Opening' of Gate C had occurred
  at approximately 14.48pm for a duration of ~30 seconds. I was also told
  that the 'Second Opening' of Gate C had started at -14.52pm and finished
  at ~ 14.58pm, a duration of ~ 5^ minutes. A 'Third Opening' then occurred
  a^iijximately one minute lata: when the gate was opened for approximately
  8 minutes, sufficient to allow the entry of people in single file.

3 The method of assessment for the first two openings was to count the
  rwnber of people passing a reference line for a period of 3 seconds and
  then to repeat this process at intervals of no greater than 15 seconds.
  At times when the rate was seen to vary rapidly, and for the whole of the
  'First Opening', samples were taken more frequently than at 15 seconds.
  Figure 5 shews a graph of the nunber of people who entered through Gate C
  during the 'Second Opening'.

4 Estimates of accuracy are based on the possibility of missing one in ten
  of the people passing the reference line and the unlikelihood of missing
  more than two in ten.

5 The estimate of the nunber of people passing through Gate C during the
  'Second evening' based on the counting was 1800 but this should be
  regarded as a minimum. The best estimate would be 10% higher than 1800
  i.e. abcut 2000, and in my opinion the actual nunber was unlikely to be
  greater than 2200.

6 The estimate of the number of people passing through Gate C during the
  'First Opening' based on the counting was 130 but this should again be
  regarded as a minimum. The best estimate would be abcut 150, and in my
  opinion the actual nunber was unlikely to be greater than 180.

7 In the 'Third Opening' entries were much slower and a more accurate count
  was possible. A total of 90 were counted over a period of about 8
  minutes, and in my opinion the actual nunber is unlikely to be greater
  than 100.

8 The following table is a seminary of the estimates of both Gate C and
  turnstile A to G entries.

6ESTIMATES    OF THE CAPACITY OF THE WEST TERRACE

6.1 Drawing 1340/02A by Ralph Brade & Associates gives dimensions of Pens 3
    and 4. Both Pens are shown as being 13.1m deep; Pen 3 is shewn as being
     14.350m wide and Pen 4 as being 14.645m wide. Based on these dimensions
     the areas are 188.Osg m and 191.8sg m.

6.2 The 1986 "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" states
     "222    The extreme allowances for packing density are as follows:

              a.   54 persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or
                   viewing slope is in good condition (as set out in
                   Chapter 8); and
              b.   27 persons per 10 square metres when it materially
                   deviates from the reoamnended guidlines, so as to
                   constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
                   packed.
     223   It may be necessary to interpolate between these figures where
     conditions fall between the two extremes. When ..."

6.3 If 54 people per 10 sq m is assumed as the allowable packing density
    for the West Terrace then the capacity of Pen 3 is 1015 and the
    capacity of Pen 4 is 1036 making a total of 2051 for the oenbined
    area.
6.5 The above calculations of capacity must therefore be assumed to be
    the iMYiiam allowable capacity for this terrace area. The guide also
    gives examples of hew this raviumn capacity figure should be reduoed
    vihen certain factors do not conform to the guide. Examples include

     a)       When the strength of crush barriers conform with the
              guidelines but the spacing of such barriers does not ...

     b)      Wien perimeter wall and crush barriers do not comply with
              strength or spacing requirements ...


                                        7
    c) When the positioning and width of gangways do not meet with the
       raoconendations of Chapter 8. ...
6.6 It also states that when crush barriers do not meet the guidelines on
    streng t h    but are well constructed, consideration may be given to
    allowing a lower packing density figure for the purpose of calculation.


7ESTIMATES OF THE PACKING EENSTTTTS OF TOE WEST TERRACE
7.1 West Midlands Police provided me with several albums of photographs, taken
    at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989, and several of these photographs were
     identified as providing nw^Hai for the estimation of the numbers in
     Pen 3. Enlargements of photographs ER1/7A and FR1/8A were provided by
    West Midlands Police and these two photographs were analysed in detail.
     Hie •Hu** •itVnH'f-iration marking on both these photographs was 15.03.

7.2 The method of assessment entailed mounting the photographs on an
    electronic digitising table (Digitiser) and then marking the head of each
    person who was discernible. Hie Digitiser was linked to Ocnputer Aided
    Drafting software and the act of marking each person on the photograph
    enabled the physical points on the photograph to be placed on an
    electronic grid which oould then be displayed, under ocnputer control, on
    a VDQ screen or printed out on a graphics plotter. Actual counting of the
    nuntoer of those identified within a specified area was carried out __
    automatically and no allowance was made for people that were hidden from
    view.
7.3 On 22 May 1989 photographs were taken of the empty pens by the same
    photographer, using the same CSJOBTSl and camera position. This enabled the
               and barrier locations in Pen 3 to be transposed onto the
    nrwpifer image of photographs taken on 15 April 1989. IR1/7A and FR1/8A
    covered about 75% of Pen 3 and it was assumed that the density of people
    in the remaining 25% was similar to that in the photographed area of
    Pen 3.
7.4 Hie estimated headcount for the whole of Pen 3 was 1408 people tut areas^
    at the front of the pen were masked by pecple cutside the pen and heads in
    the area forward of the first barriers were generally less discernible
    than those behind the first barrier; 1408 is therefore a miniaum estimate.

7.5 The results from a more detailed analysis, in whicii Pen 3 was sub-divided
    into four rows, bounded by the perimeter fence and the rows of crush
    barriers, are sunmarised in the Table overleaf. Figures 6, 7 and 8
    illustrate the four rows and the numbers counted in rows 2, 3 and 4.

* The number of spectators in the First Row was estimated from the plan area and
an assumed packing density of 10.0 spectators per square meter. This density has
been shown to be the maximum achievable without undue discomfort in tests at HSE's
Sheffield Laboratories and has been corroborated by crowi density measurements in
a selected area of the first row on photograph FKL/1QA.

7.6 The estimated total for Pen 3 of 1576 is about 55% greater than the value
    calculated from a packing density of 5.4 people per square metre.

7.7 An estimate of the packing density in Pen 2 was also made from photograph
    H?1/7A. The area selected showed an overall packing density of 5.0 people
    per square metre.

8 ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE NUMBERS OUTSIBE TOP TFPPTHGS LANE TURNSTILES

8.1 I was asked to make estimates of the number of people which could have
    gathered outside the turnstiles at L eppings Lane but within the cuter
    perimeter gates. The area between the Ieppings Lane End turnstiles and
    the carter perimeter gates is illustrated in Figure 9. The Figure is based
    on Ralph Brade & Associates' Drawing No 1340/04. The area has been
    sub-divided into three separate areas (Area 1, Area 2 and Area 3) and the
    approximate area of each has been calculated by scaling from the Drawing.

8.2 The nunber of people that could stand in the areas has been calculated
    using a packing density of 8 people per square metre and also using 10
    people per square metre; the estimates are tabulated overleaf.

9   SUMMARY

9.1   Various aspects of the crush barriers and perimeter gates        in Pens 3 and 4
      did not conform to the 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 19867.

9.2   The broken barrier, 124A, was made from wrought iron tube and mild steel
      angle section. Both tube and angle sections were heavily corroded in seme
      areas. Calculations on the mechanism and faroe required to cause the
      collapse of the barrier are proceeding.

9.3 Examination of turnstiles A-G indicated that there was a fault in the
    counting mechanism of G. Fran assessment of video recordings, a best
    estimate of people entering through A-G was 7494, with a maximum of 7644.

9.4 If Gate C had not been opened, BSE estimate that it would have taken until
    about 3.40pm to admit 10,100 people through turnstiles A to G.

9.5 Assessment of the numbers of turnstiles allocated to various zones of the
    stadium revealed that the average admission requirement of the turnstiles
    serving the West Terrace was the highest fear any zone of the stadium, and
    was approximately 2.9 times the requirement for Spicn Kbp.

9.6 HSE's best estimate of the total number of people who entered the ground
    during the three openings of Gate C was 2240 with a maximum of 2480.

9.7 BSE's best estimate of the total nunber of people who entered the ground
    through gate C (3 openings) and turnstiles A-G was 9734, with a Tnavimm
    value of 10124.

9.8 Even if the strength and spacing of the barriers had complied with the
    'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986#, HSE's calculations showed that
    the capacity of Pens 3 and 4 was 1015 and 1036 respectively.

9.9 Since the barriers did not ccraply in all respects with the Guide (see 9.1)
    the estimated capacity of Pens 3 and 4 would be less than in 9.7 above.

9.10 Hie best estimate, based on photographs, of the nunber of people in Pen 3
     at 15.03 was 1576.

9.11 The runber of people who could be aoocmuodated theoretically between the
     perimeter gates and the turnstiles at Leppings lane was estimated to be
     3880 and 4850 for era*! packing densities 8.0 and 10.0 per square metre
     respectively.

   by our calculations and by our measurements, to suggest
   how far out those figures were.

Q. So, in fact, the substance of your work is and was that
   you are confident that the figures you are going to
   give me are based on the counts or the calculations you
   have done are accurate and correct? - A. Yes.

Q. Tell me then what, in fact, you discovered with regard
   to the number? I think you worked on a print out which
   was timed at three o'clock? - A. Yes.

Q. I think I am also right in saying that, in fact, there
   is no other print out of an earlier time and so that is
   the only one you have been able to work from? -A. It
   was the only one that was referred to us, yes.

Q. Can you tell me then what, in fact, you calculated as
   being the number of people who entered the
   turnstiles? - A. Can I refer to my notes?

Q. Yes, I forgot to say that. Please feel free to look at
   your report.  I do not expect you to remember the
   detail. You just turn to it? - A. Right. Can I deal
   first with gate C?

Q. Yes indeed. - A. This was done by analysing the video
   recording that was close to Gate C and turnstiles A to
   G and we actually counted the people who were going
   through the gate and we counted the number of people
   who were going through the turnstiles on a careful and
   scientific basis. We counted on the first opening 130
   people entering. On the second opening we counted
   1,800 people entering. That was averaged by doing
   certain three second periods but the average figure
   came out at 1,800. On the third opening we got a
   figure of 90 so that the total gate opening figure was
   2,200. Because of the definition of the video and the
   difficulty in actually doing the counting exercise we
   have added a percentage above that. This is because
   each person we actually identified, we are sure that
   that is a person and we have added a certain percentage
   above that for those that could be missed. So our
   figure is a minimum figure that we will add to.

      The figures that we have added to for the first
  opening — so we have termed these figures the best
  estimate — the best estimate figures for the first
  opening are 150. That is 20 more than our first count.
  For the second opening it was 2,000 which is 200 more
  than our actual count. For the third opening which was
  at a very slow rate we think we have got a good figure
  there and we are happy to leave it at 90 which leaves a
                                                                87
                                                 C. E. NICHOLSON

     total gate C figure of 2,240. We have also added on to
     that a maximum that we think could have been achieved.
     In other words, this is the very top that we think the
     figure could go to and we have increased each of the
     figures that I have mentioned by a similar amount so
     that the maximum that we think could have gone through
     gate C in all three openings would be 2,480.

          Similarly on the turnstiles, as I said, we counted
     for all A to G, for each turnstile, we counted the
     people through from the time the video started which
     was at one o'clock and we found that comparing our
     figures with the figures on the Sheffield Wednesday
     print out that for A to F they were just slightly out,
     3 per cent out, and we think this can be accounted for
     by the fact that people were coming in before three
     o'clock. So we are quite happy to use for A to F the
     actual figures produced by Sheffield Wednesday but for
     G, the turnstile that was not operating accurately,
     each count was not being recorded, we have increased
     that by a number that we calculated based on the
     accuracy of our actual observations of the each person
     coming through A to F. So we have ended up there with
     an actual count through the turnstiles from one o'clock
     right through to the start of the game of 7,247.
     Similarly we have increased that figure to provide a
     best estimate up to 7,494 with a maximum figure of
     7,644. So that is the summary of our total figures.
Q.   On A   to G? -   A. Yes.

Q.   What   was the   maximum again?- A.   A to G    is7,644.




                                /Q. So if one were to add.

                                       C.E. NICHOLSON



&. So if one were to add, and I don't know if you have got
   the figures in front of you? - A. Yes.

Q. Gate C entry.  Let's take your best estimate and then
   your maximum of the grand total so to speak of entries
   through that part of the ground? - A. Yes, the best
   estimate figure which is adding 2,240 to 7,494 gives a
   total of 9,734 and our maximum figures are for a total
   Gate C 2,400, plus for the turnstiles 7,644 gives a
   maximum total of 10,124.

Q. Which is remarkably close in fact to the then state of
   capacity? - A. To the state of capacity of that end, yes.

Q. Now what it does not of course include as I see it and
   correct me if I am wrong, it does not include terrace
   people who might have come through Turnstiles 1-16?
     A. No, it does not include them.

Q. You did actually I think also estimate, did you estimate
   the gates B and C entries.  I can't remember? - A. No,
   we examined what videos we were shown.  I could not get
   a proper view of any of those gates in which we could
   really make - A and B that is - in which we could make
   anything like a reasonable estimate.

Q. So assuming for a moment that some people came through
   those gates and there seems to be evidence that they did
   and that they also went on to the terracing, that might
   increase the figure which you have got here? - A. It
   could well if people could get from those gates to the
   terrace, yes.

Q. The other thing you did was you had a look at the
   throughput of the actual turnstiles, didn't you? - A. Yes.

Q* 1 think the easiest way of doing that, you have produced
   a graph, I believe, which shows the number of people who
   went through at different times.  Is that right? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Just bear with me and see if I can find it. - A. It is
   Figure 4 of our report.

Q*     a act you produced two graphs. One of them is as you
     say Figure 4 and the other one is Figure 6. Can you have
     a look at Figure 6? - A. Yes.

Q. That is the Gate C count? - A. Yes.

Q. I think it miqht just be worth putting it up because it
   gives a visual impression? - A. Yes, fine.
                                                                 89

           THE CORONER:  Put Figure 4 up first and we will
     give that a number.

             1IR. BEECHEY:   Figure 4 number then sir will be
     C493.

Q.         THE CORONER:   Focus your eyes.   You can see it?
     - A. That is a graph of the people per hour per turnstile
     on the vertical, on the left-hand side of the ground,
     plotted against the time on the bottom axis.     So that
     represents the   number of people who came in through the
     turnstiles A-G   from 1 o'clock right through to the start
     of play at 3 o'clock.   You can see initially there is
     a gradual rise up to that point which if you go back to
     the axis on the left-hand side it goes up to about 300
     people per hour coming through each turnstile.     It the;,
     rises, and this time is about quarter-to-2, rises up to
     the rate of some 550, another steady rise or rather it
     fluctuates somewhat until you get at about 2 o'clock a
     relatively even rate of some 600, between 600 and 700
     quite a long period of time from 2 o'clock up to soviet.1.!;.sj
     like about 10-to-3.   At 10-to-3 you can see there iii i-
     rapid rise inthe rate of entry, but sir     up to that ^eii^cl
     there has been   three-quarters of an hour of relatively
     steady entry.  Our average figure works out to be 6GO
     per hour coming through each turnstile.    At 10-to-3 the
     rate rapidly increased.    That is the time that Gate C
     was opened and we think that the reason for that rise ii
     due to the pressure being taken off the turnstiles ai
     the crowd wanting to go through the turnstiles rela::oc'.
     because the pressure was taken off the back of the cj:u-.:c:
     as people could go round and through Gate C, so we thin.":
     that is one reason why that could account for an
     rate of entry from the average of 660 up to well ovc:
     1,000 per hour, just for a very short period, and it tr.or.
     drops down to almost down to zero for just after 3 o 'l Io c I:.

Q. I suppose another reason might be that tickets were h j L
   being separated if that is right? - A. Perhaps they
   weren't being examined so closely at that time.  Tiiat.it
   a possibility.

Q. So if one just looks at this graph for a moment it looks
   as if from well about quarter-to-2 onwards, with
   fluctuations, the number of people going through were
   between 550 and 650 until you get your peak.  That is
   right, isn't it? - A. Yes, from that time from quarter-to
   it is something between 550 and 650.

Q. That is for about an hour, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. So would I be right then in saying that whatever impression
   people might have had as to what was happening at the
   turnstiles, the graph would seem to indicate that people
                                                               90

                                         C.E. NICHOLSOH



   were actually entering at a relatively steady pace? -
   A. Yes, a relatively steady pace for at least three-quarters
   of an hour and for almost a complete hour.

         THE COROIJER: Now' if we put the other graph up,
   that is Figure 6, and we will give this a 'C' number
   as well.

           MR. BEECHEY:   The 'C' number for Figure 6 is
   C494.

         THE WITNESS:  Yes, this is a graph for the second
   opening of Gate C, the main opening really when we
   counted, worked out, estimated that it was 2,000 people
   coming through the gate and you can see that over on the
   vertical left-hand side is the number of people against
   time in seconds on the bottom axis and you can see that
   actually from the time it opened up to the time of clo^e,
   which I think the total time was some five-and-a-half
   minutes which gives you your 300 plus seconds, that the
   rate of entry is relatively even, you end up with a
   straight line which suqgests that the pace at which
   people started to come in it stayed steady over the full
   five minute period.

O. Yes, there is obviously a take off right at the beginning,
   isn't there? - A. There is a little clitch at the start,
   yes, but it is hardly anything.

Q. And apart from that, as you say, it is virtually a straight
   line? - A. Virtually a straight line> yes.

Q. The significance of a straight line as you say it shovs
   no fluctuation, that the rate was continuously the sai.ie
   whatever that rate may have been? - A. Yes.  I think
   worked out that it averaged out across the width of the
   gate a row of people going through shoulder to shoulder
   it took them about a second to pass the gate entrance,
   so each second there was a row of some 5 or 6 whatever it
   was going through, but that rate stayed steady over the
   whole gate opening period.

Q. I think I am right in saying if you got what, around
   2,200-odd people through in five minutes, that is how
   many a minute, that is about 400 isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. That rate in fact is about double the rate at which people
   were coming through the turnstiles.  Is it about right.
   Have I got it right or not?  If you look at the minute
   rate of people coming through the turnstiles 650 per
   hour? - A. Yes, 650 per hour suggests it is some ....

Q. Was that per turnstile? - A. Yes.
                                                              91

                                      C.E. NICHOLSON



Q. So you have got to multiply that by 7 and then divide by
   60? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you want my calculator? - A. I prefer not actually.
   If we say 600 per hour that means it is 10 per minute,
   multiplied by 7 turnstiles is 70.  Is  that right?

Q. Yes, I make it 75 because I took the, yes, so that would
   be 75 a minute, wouldn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. And if you then take,how many did you say through Gate C,
   2,200 was it? - A. 2, COO over five minutes which is 400
   per minute.

Q. In fact there was a substantial increase in numbers who
   were coming through at the minute rate over that period?
   - A. Yes.

Q. whilst we are on the turnstiles we will just complete this
   last point.  I am right in thinking, am I not, that you
   compared the number of turnstiles which had been allocated
   to the various sections of the ground? - A. Yes, we did.

0. Just briefly tell me what you discovered on that front?
   - A. We counted the number of turnstiles all the way round
   the ground and then compared what turnstiles had been
   allocated to specific parts of the ground.  We have
   already talked about the seven turnstiles that were
   feeding the West Terrace.   There were some ten turnstiles
   feeding the North Stand seating; six feeding the VJest
   Stand seating; ten  feeding the South Stand covered seating
   42 covering the Spion Kop and eight the South Stand
   uncovered seating, so knowing the capacities of each of
   these areas we could work out how many people needed to
   come through each turnstile on average and the averages
   work out, I won't go through all the figures but just to
   compare them with 42 turnstiles feeding the Spion Kop
   which is some 21,000 people to come in, this means that
   the average person per turnstile that comes through those
   turnstiles is 500 whereas the West Terrace where some
   10,100 peopie is the capacity fed by seven turnstiles,
   means that 1,443 people needed to come through each of
   those seven turnstiles. This is obviously averaging it
   out to give you a feel for how used the various batches
   of turnstiles had to be.  This is effectively three times
   the rate of entry was required at the Leppings Lane end
   than was required at the Spion Kop end to fill both of
   those terraces to capacity.

Q. I think you also worked out the total number of people
   who were in the ground, I don't know if you have got that
   figure in front of you, have you? I have a figure of
   about 48,669 but that would not include the people who
   came in through Gate A and B.  Is that right? - A. I
   am sorry, I don't have that figure.
                                                           92


                                      C.E. NICHOLSON



Q. No, that is the entry through the. turnstiles, through all
   your turnstiles.  Can I pass you this.    It is I think
   Appendix 2 if.you find it.   It is not terribly important
   actually? - A. Yes.  The total count v/as some 48,669
   for all the different areas.




                         Q. This is turnstile count
                                                              93

                                                  C. E. NICHOLSON


Q. This is turnstile count,      isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. So to that you have got add however many people got
   through the gates? - A. Yes.

Q. And through Gate C. which we already know about, 2,200 or
   thereabouts, I can t remember the exact figure, plus
   whatever went through Gates A and B? - A. Yes, that is
   right.

Q. Can we turn then to the pens?    I want to do the same
   exercise with regard to the numbers in the pens.    I
   think what you did was that you selected the best
   photographs which you could find which gave an overview
   of pens 3 and 4? - A. Yes.    This was an exercise done in
   conjunction with the West Midlands Police, who of course
   were in charge of many, many photographs taken at the
   time.  With them we selected the best two photographs
   from which we thought we could get a reasonable count of
   the people in pens 3 and 4.

Q. In fact you selected two photographs in the end? - A.
   Yes.

Q. They are known as PR.1/7A and PR.1/8A? - A. Yes.

Q. I think they are timed at 15.03, and we have got acetates
   of these and we will put them up so that people can see
   which photographs you used.   One we have already got.

          MR. GRIFFITHS:    PR.1/7A, sir, is C.360.

Q.        THE CORONER:   So that was one of the photographs
     which was used? - A. Yes, that is the first one.   The
     slight gap down the middle is in fact the position of the
     radial fence between pens 2 and 3, so that shows part of
     pen 2 as well.

          MR. GRIFFITHS:    PR.1/8A, needs a MC" number.

          MR. BEECHEY:     The number is C.495.

Q.        THE CORONER:   And this is, I think... - A. In fact
     it was an adjoining photograph.  With the modern camera
     techniques you can take a series of shots across a wide
     spectrum and this is the next adjoining shot, the next
     negative, if you like, in the film.   You can see in the
     bottom left hand corner part of the radial fence that was
     visible in the last shot.   That is it exactly.

     We were able to put these two photographs together, to
     overlap them, and you can do this very accurately, so we
     built up a picture of some of pen 2 and a considerable
     proportion of pen 3.   This was the best picture we had
    a    .

             SUBJECT:       FA CUP SEMI FINAL - 9 April 1986


          I refer to the enclosed correspondence regarding the above event. I have
          liaised with the officers concerned with the preparation, control and
          supervision of the above event and we have noted locally the lessons that
          were learned and the improvements that can be made for any similar future
          event. Generally I was well satisfied with the event and I will confine this
          report to matters which effect the Force Operations Room and Road Traffic
          Department.

          COMMUNICATIONS

          On the day more use than normal was made of the radio link between ground
          .control at Hillsborough and the Operations room in attempting to contact
          those units equipped with both ground control and UHF radio." This was
          entirely due to difficulties in personal radio transmissions which were
          effected for most of the event by breakthrough from local radio. The
          Superintendent (Communications) is aware of this and an immediate survey
          of the equipment was made after the event, but the fault could not be traced.

         TRAFFIC FLOW AND CONTROL

         Transmissions in relation to problems with traffic, from mobile units and
         the spotter plane were being received at Operations room and were not
         monitored at ground control. It seems sensible to me that for future 'semis*
         all matters relating to the control and movement of traffic should be
         supervised by Operations room, with the exception of the local arranaements
         made immediately outside the ground when the final whistle is b l o w n /

         FOOTBALL TRAFFIC SIGN’S

         Purpose made signs have been requested in the past, but for financial
         reasons have not been approved. Such signs are extremely beneficial and
         it is pleasing to note that Superintendent Brougham is lookina into this
         aspect.

         SEARCHING OF COACHES FOR ALCOHOL ABUSE ETC.

        The effect of alcohol on football supporters is well known and I would not
        wish to see any relaxation of enforcement of the laws relating to the carriage
        of alcohol on coaches etc.   It is appreciated that this can cause some traffic
        congestion, but surveys are being carried out on the major roads approaching
        the city to “establish where this can be carried out to cause minimum
        inconvenience to traffic flows.

        CLOSE CIRCUIT TV LINK W ITH WADSLEY BRIDGE STATION

        A TV monitor was sited in the control roan giving pictures from Wadsley Bridge
        Railway Station. This monitor took up valuable room in the control area and
        was of little use and I would not wish such a system to be implemented in the
        future.                                 ' -

 SUBJECT:   items for de-briefing re F.A. Semi-final 9th April 1988

On Saturday 9th April I was duty sergeant in the Operations
Room and I would like to submit my observations concerning
the football match.

 1 • Operational Orders

   Traffic      ~ no problems with this order other than the
   fact that no call signs had been allocated to the three
   Public order patrols at Woodall Services, Ml. It was not
   until they came on the air that we knew who was on this
   detail. It was necessary to then create a duty rota on the
   computer and allocate callsigns (X101,X102,X 1 0 3 ). It would
   have been much better if this had been catered for in the
   order.

   'F' Division - no problems, other than the fact that Operations
   Room did not receive a copy of the order. One was obviously
   copied from another held at headquarters.

   ’T>' Division - this order catered very well with 'D* Division
   involvement, the precise details of primary and secondary
   routes being useful. One problem encountered was that the
   traffic signals   on the Ml exit slip roads at Catcliffe
   were not turned off; officers were working traffic against
   the lights. This matter was subsequently resolved but should
   be catered for in any similar operation.

   Dog Section - Operations Room did not receive a copy of a n y '
   order or duties in relation to duties at the match. It was
   a fairlY lengthy task creating a duty rota on the computer
       ^all the dog handlers involved and in future advance
   duties for such operations should be supplied in advance.

2• Use of spotter plane

  As you know we did have   problems initially with air to
  ground communications, but once these problems had been
  resolved the assistance cf the spotter plane became
  invaluable. Prior to the match, Operations Room were given
  good accounts of traffic flow into Hillsborough and traffic
  hold ups were reported. It was then possible to give
  instructions to officers on point duty,via other match
  controls, to ease the hold ups.

  Ironically, there was a          two mile tailback reported on the
  A616 at Oughtibridge - traffic building up through Warncliffe
  Side to D e e p c a r . The hold up was on Low R o a d ,Oughtibridge
  where public order patrols manned by the Underwater Search
  Unit were stopping and searching vehicles travelling into
  city.
                          -2-

    After the match, the spotter plane was of great assistance
    in identifying why traffic could not leave the area of the
    ground.

    One major problem highlighted, and rectified by the air
    observer, was that officers on point duty were working
    against each other. One would have released traffic whilst
    the next officer in line would be stopping it. It was then
    possible to synchronise their instructions to traffic to
    keep the traffic flowing. One point that should be made to
    beat officers on traffic points is that after the match they
    should give priority to football traffic leaving Sheffield,
    giving long runs through junctions. This was not the case
    on Saturday and I had to make repeated requests,via Match
    controls, for this to be done.

 3• Radio Procedure and Transmissions

   Unfortunately there was some confusion regarding which Force
   Radio Channel was being used for the match. As far as Operations
   Room was concerned, Force Channel 1 was reserved for all
   mobiles engaged on the football duty. 'D' and 'F' Division
   were expecting channel 2. This matter was rectified and channel
   one was used.

   Channel 1 monitored all motorway patrols and any vehicle with
   specific duties in relation to the match. A total of 87 mobiles
   were working on this channel and obviously at this level
   transmission time is at a premium. P.C. Ragg was the controller
   in Operations Room and I choose this point to state what an
   excellent job he did.

   As always some officers were suffering from 'verbal diarrohea■
   making life very difficult for the radio operator. Officers
   persisted in telling Operations Room every time they saw a
   coach or took up escort of it. In my view this type of
   transmission is unnecessary as it is virtually impossible for
   t is type of information to be recorded and retransmitted
   when coming in thick and fast. The only transmission of this
    ype required is where we"have a coach containing unruly
   supporters, etc. or where"specific instructions or enquiries
   are giv®n. Perhaps this point should be made at future briefings
   and included in orers.

4 . Press Officer

  I am aware that Superintendent Pratt had been detailed to
  deal with the media concerning the match, and we had speech
  with Mr. Pratt thoughout the day, but it would have been
  useful if there had been a press officer on duty at Headquarters
  throughout the day to take care of all the press calls.

  The Operations Room Inspector and Sergeant act as press
  officers out of hours and like any other Saturday numerous
  Press calls were being received. Some were in relation to the
  match, others were routine press calls about incidents that
  had occurred Friday night - Saturday morning.
                     -3-



A press officer on duty at headquarters would have allowed
both the .Sergeant and Inspector to give total supervision
to -tiifc'-ruiming of the Operations Room and football detail
instead of having to keep breaking off to answer press
enquiries.

Generally, the operation went well and was certainly an
improvement on last year's operation. This report is
respectfully submitted for your information.

 I have a few comments of my own concerning the policing that day as follows

 You will appreciate this was my first semi ’outside the ground’ , with the
 th S!S            f Operations & Traffic. By and large it was okay, but I think
 traff-,-nagement ° traffic flow can be improved. Many of the officers deputed to
were e x p e c t e ^ t o ^ l o ^ Y ^ ^ ’F ' Divisions really had little idea of what they

^                             overall situation.  I consider that one way to
thev ch                for Divlsions     perhaps be a little more selective in who
nominated th° d? ^ te, tok ke» traffic points, and once those persons have been

        Sir,


        In respect of your memorandum concerning the above subject, I forward
        m a d e Vtherein8P0rt ^   Superintendent Murray and endorse the ccmnents


        M y only additional comnent concerns traffic, and I would agree with
        the carments made by Superintendent Anderson that in future at such
        h I!?*  ^ k 8 ' SCTi finals* there may well be merit in traffic being
               W1+
                 th sep? rately from the P a c i n g of the football match. I
        honlf-     i    adverse t0 this suggestion and feel that it would be
        Deneficial to all concerned. However, I would not wish to see similar
        action at normal football matches and feel that our existing
        arrangements are completely adequate.

        I submit this report for your information please.

about      300 Liverpool                    supporters                were      in the a r e a           under        close       Police

both       in L i v e r p o o l      and around                the    g ro u n d .

Drink       in e x c e s s        was    evident           in a       considerable                number          of   supporters,

both Liverpool                 and Notts             Forest.            This        included           those       in a d r u n k e n

condition           and      in     possession             of    drin k.            The     extent          was    such    that          I

gave       instructions              that       only       those        in an        extreme           state       would       be

arrested          in o r d e r       not       to    deplete          manpower.

At    about       2.45pm          <1445)        it     became         apparent             there       was a       fault       on     the

radio.        Transmissions                from        c on t r o l     were        becoming           broken,         although

s t i ll    audible.              .! i n f o r m e d      con t r o l     of       this.         The    r a di o       fault     can         best

be    described           as      a warbling/clicking                         - missing           out       one    word    in       three.

I was       on    the     Spion Hop             at     3pm      <1500)         with        the    serials          I had       detailed

to    supervise           the       area       containing             the L i v e r p o o l           supporters.              An

apparent          p i t ch     invasion             shortly after                  k ick    off       created a sit uat ion

which       incensed           the      Notts        Forest          f a ns    and       the a c t i o n s        of    some     of      them

towards          the    Liverpool              group       of    supporters                suggested          there       would          be a

public        disorder            situation            on the Hop.                  I therefore              remained          at     this

location with my                    serials          u nt i l    the      ground           c l ear ed .       I t ook      no       part       in

the    events          on the        Leppings             Lane       terrace.

My    briefing          to S t e w a r d s          was    for       those         on K o p      only - also             Sergeants

present          and    identified

I asked          if w o r k e d H o p          before          - yes

They       were     to ld      to    keep       a isle s        cle a r       as    possible

The    emergency             procedures              were       explained            — all        should          be a w a r e      of       own

I knew        the      senior        steward.              I had        carried            out    annual          briefing          several

him      mouth           to    mouth.                  I    don’ t         know          how       long          for,          not       long,             someone

running            passed            kicked                me    on    the          rig h t        side          of       my       stomach,                1 was

I    c o u ld n 't        help        him ,            thought             ('S o rry            pal         yo u 're           dead’ ).

I    went         back        down        the          tunnel          and          got       to       the       Terraces.                    Someone                in     the

                 KENNETH EDWARD
                           ' 1
                                HORSFIELD Sworn
                        By THE CORONER:

Q. It is Kenneth Edward Horsfield.    You are Police Constable 1171?
   - A . That is correct.

Q. Your job was also outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles?
   - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. But you were positioned outside turnstile number 16.    Is
   that right? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. You were still under the same overall command of Inspector
   Sykes but you were one of the other Serials which was
   on the other side of the barrier from A-G? - A. That is
   correct, yes sir.

Q. In fact the nearest turnstile to A-G? - A. Yes.

Q. I just want to take your evidence probably fairly briefly
   but it is by way of comparison more than anything else?
   - A. Yes sir.

Q. You took up your position at about 11.40 or thereabouts?
   - A. Thereabouts sir, yes.

Q. It was quiet at that time? — A. Yes, very quiet.

Q. And you too were intending to search people and prevent
   prohibitive items being taken in? - A. That is correct sir,
   yes.

Q. As a matter of interest did you actually find anything on
   anybody that day? - A. Only soft drink cans. The people
   that we did check carrying bags we asked them not to take
   the cans into the ground and they were placed in a large
   plastic dustbin which was next to the turnstile.
Q. And no problems with that at all? - A. None at all.
Q. Would I be right in saying that on the whole people went
   through quite freely until about 2 o'clock? - A. Yes, no
   problems at all.

Q. And you didn't have any problems. I think there was only
   one person who was an elderly man who did not seem to quite
   understand what was happening. Is that right? - A. Yes,
   that would be round about 2.15, between 2.15 and 2.30.
   I observed a gentleman in the entrance to the turnstiles
   near the gates, the entrance gates. He was wearing a
   Notts. Forest cap and scarf and he was carrying a whltfe
   plastic carrier bag and a tan ladies purse in his left hand.
                               K.E. HORSFIELD



He was wandering round looking rather confused.  I would
put him into his late 50s perhaps early 60s in age.

My age. - A. Sorry sir.  I approached this gentleman and
I informed him that he was in fact at the wrong end of
the ground and that the Leppings Lane end was for the
Liverpool supporters, quite plain to see.  He did seem
very confused.  I asked him for his ticket so I could
direct him to his correct entrance point.  The gentleman
stated:  "I have not got a ticket but I have got £10 in
my purse if you know where I can buy one".  I directed
this gentleman to the Penistone Road end but I advised
him to go home at that time.




                  Q. Then from 2 o'clock
                                                                       86
                                                     K. E. HORSFIELD



        Q. Then from 2 o clock onward, things began to become
                           riSht? " A - Yest sir- Between 2 and
              ? the crowds were, I would say, as per normal for
           most football matches, a steady stream of people,
           orderly queues forming at the turnstiles.
    B
        Q. About 2.30 did you do anything or see anybody, or did
           anytmng change in any way1 - A. It got a little bit
           busier. I noticed the groups of young men, people in
           their late teens, stood about in snail groups, again
           near to the entrance gates, the entrance area to the
           turnstiles area, they were just milling about making no
           attempt to go into the grounds. I did speak to them
           and told them to go into the ground. They made excuses
           saying they were waiting for someone who had got their
           ticket, and they couldn t go in until they had received
           a ticket from whoever they were waiting for, but they
           just continued to mill round in the area just outside
           the turnstile enclosure.
        Q.   But we are not talking about hundreds, are we, or are
             we* “ Am There were several groups. I spoke to three
             or four separate groups, perhaps been eight, ten to
D            twelve people per group. They kept milling into the
             enclosed area and when you approached they they
             shrugged their shoulders and said, "We are waiting for
             a friend. We said we would meet him here", then they
             drifted outside the area back onto Leppings Lane.
        Q.   What else happened after that? - A. Shortly after that
             period, which I would estimate lasted about five or ten
             minutes, where there were orderly queues, I was stood
             in tne corner next to turnstile 16. Up to that point I
             had been able to walk up and down the queue, talking to
             people and generally laughing and joking with them,
             very good humoured, very good natured people, up to
             that point. I returned into the corner portion, at the
             side of the large metal fence and the turnstile wall.
             fuVaS en8a8®^ *-n talking to fans as they were entering
               e turnstiles. I looked up and suddenly the whole
             enclosure filled with people within a matter of
             seconds, and the queues just disappeared and I was
             trapped in the corner between the metal fence and the
             w?r * That is when the first instance of the crush
             whicn later ensued took place. Up to that time the
             turnstile queues had been quite orderly.
        Q. What time would you put that, if you are able to tell
           m •” w* * w°uld say somewhere round about 2.40-ish. I
           can t be specific to five minutes either way but I
           would think between 2.30 and 2.45.

        Q. We have already heard lots of descriptions about how
           severe the crushing was in the other part. Of course,

              you couldn't see that, could you? There was a fence
              between you and .... — A. I could see.

        IQ. Ho w did you manage that? - A. At the point where the
            fence was adjoining onto the brick wall where I was
    B       stood, there was a gap of about four inches, and I
            could see tnrough this gap into the approach area for
            the standing turnstiles, and I could see that people
            were getting squashed quite badly on the other side of
            the tence. It appeared worse than on my side.
            People s faces were getting shoved into this four inch
            wide gap on two or three occasions.

        Q. Sorry? - A. The faces of people who were getting
C|         crushed along the other side of the fence, you could
           see them being squashed into this narrow gap by the
           crush w m c h was obviously behind them.
    Q. How bad would you describe it on your side? - A.
       Initially not too bad. I was able to stand in the
       corner and keep a short area around me quite free. I
       was able to turn and move, but the crush was pretty
  i                     5
                        5>e?arae worse when people started climbing
Dl          !     met?1 barrier from the standing terraces side
       into our enclosure. On several occasions I had people
                  £V!!r        ?tandin5 on ®y head and shoulders as
            oi1?       offuthe fence, down into our enclosure. I
       removed two or three youngsters and early teenagers,
            «-*year~2i children from the fence. I managed to
                      5 tnC *?P °f the fence and 1 Put them
       through the turnstile number 16 into the stand
       enclosure.

E| Q.        Did they say anything to you, any of these that came
             over, can you remember? - A. Not as such. I could hear
             people on the other side - I distinctly remember
             hearing someone crying. I don't know whether it was
             male, female or a youngster, but that was about that
             time, probably about quarter-to.

             Did you have any mounted Officers in your patch of the
             turnstile area? - A. Not in the enclosure, no, they
             were outside on the Leppings Lane side of the gates.

        Q*         y°U .®ee.what had caused this, it sounds the way
             you describe it, a rather dramatic change? - A. It was
             ThI* ? sudden rush of people, just appeared at once.
                 il      - can recall it. There is no sudden build
             up, it was just there.

                      duFin8 this Period you suddenly decided you
             that ripht?   1°^      !r°wards the Perimeter gates, is
             FoJi right? - A. Yes. After a while I got a little bit
             fed up of people standing on me in the corner, and I

         th»idTd th?5 something had to be done. The only thing
         th!!        *See     “ ny P°sition was to try and shut
         the outer gates to the enclosure, to try to alleviate
         to6*™*!     ng V?against the turnstile walls. I managed
         P r ai my a lleag“e on the next turnstile, which was
    B    r.c. Alexander, and together we managed to force our
         way along the edge of the metal fence up to the large
         wrought-iron gates at the front of the enclosure. I
         went to the right-hand gate.

   Q. Is that the one near the sweet shop? - A. It was the
      If
      of t theh emetal

                                                      section.
      Together with P.C. Alexander we tried to close the
      right-hand gate to stop people from entering the
      hHSi°SUrI! and causin8 the crushing. At first we didn't
      have much success. However, I did attract the
      attention of one of the mounted Officers who were on
      duty outside the area, and he positioned his horse
      across the front of the gates, which enabled us to
      h Jf f *      right-hand half of the gate and after soaie
      S i I t y , because the gate was being moved constantly
      by the crushing, the to-ing and fro-ing of the crowd, I
Dl    wMrPh                the bolt into the floorf the large bolt
      wnich holds the gate shut into the floor, and I
      attempted to hold this bolt into the floor while the
      other gate was pulled to.

        a,  If111? 1 was stood in this position people had
                 s£arte? to climb over the gate which I had just
        fo?        K?an   Feraember exactly how long I was there
        tor, probably a minute, a minute and a half, not too
        long. I was jostled and I was thumped a couple of
        times by people in the crowd, who I have no idea, but
                       t 0 l e t 80 o f th e b o lt in th e f l o o r and
             ate was just   swung wide open again and we just
        could not manage to close it after that.

        So are you then saying that the demeanour of the crowd
        of iifi?POSitl£I\ WaS     satisfactory from your point
        of view? - A. Not at all, sir. I received quite a bit
                  a^USe troa5 the crowd ^cause of my efforts to
                              Were intent on gaining entry to
        tne football ground. I was sworn at and like I said I
         id receive at least one blow because of my efforts to
        try and close the gate. They were a little bit
        incensed by my actions.

        Did you begin to fear that there would be injuries
                    ®ncl°sufe at that point? - A. Yes, I was

        [ Very relieved, yes.

        Q’             ^n°A*Wh? told you» do you» at this stage, or
             do you. - A. At that time I was stood out on the
             wrought-iron gates adjacent to Leppings Lane away from
D            the turnstiles. The other Officers in ray serial,
             ar!eon tKtUr"fduf.nd shoutedf "Come on, get inside, they
             are on the pitch , and they went through the

        Q. Did you go onto the pitch side initially? -A. No, sir.
        Q. What did you? - A. As Ientered the rear of the
           Leppings Lane stand I saw a large group of Officers,
           S L L       f running, making their way towards the

           pitch. At that point Isaw a large crowd of people on
           tne edge of the playing area at the rear of the
           Leppings Lane goal and I believe that the last couple
           of players were going down the tunnel, off the pitch.
        Q.   Vofee» y°u Just caught a glimpse of them leaving? - A.

             to the rear of the Leppings Lane stand.

             Through the tunnel, you mean? - A. We went through the
             tunnel and onto the terraces from the rear.

     there was someone, some trouble at the front, and it
    appeared to me to be a crush situation, that people had
    been pushed forward. We got hold of people who Sere
    still pushing forwards from the back of the terraces
    grabbing collars, and pulled them back and pushed them
    out towards the tunnel pnysically, and virtually fought

Q.    In fact, you did help to carry several people out? -
     A. Yes, sir, numerous.
Q.    You took them out backwards? -A. Yes, that is
     correct.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:
Q. Hr. Horsfield, could you just tell the Court whether
   you have any experience of policing football matches
   prior to this one? - A. Yes, sir. I have been a
   Police Constable since 1971 when I was posted to the
   Hammerton Road Subdivision which Hillsborough
   Football Ground is within and I have experience of
   working at Hillsborough since 1972.

Q. Give a picture of your experience? - A. In relation
   to what, sir?

Q. How long, how often, what sort of matches? - A. I
   have worked quite a number of previous Semi Finals
   which have been held at Hillsborough Football Ground,
   numerous divisional matches since that period.
   However, there was a break of several years when I
   was in the Traffic Division and I was not involved
   with the crowd control side but the traffic control
   side of policing football matches.
Q. Just give us an idea, I am not asking you to be
   exact, of about how many years of attending and
   policing football matches? - A. Out of the 19 years'
   service I have attended regularly for about 11 or 12
   years.

Q. Does that include policing at the Leppings Lane
   end? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Can you express that as a proportion of the number of
   years' service? I am sorry to be difficult but I
   just need to know your experience before I ask the
   next question? - A. I would not like to put a number
   on it, sir, but I would think I have worked a similar
   duty to what I worked on 15th April 1989 on more than
   a dozen occasions.

Q. In all that time have you ever seen such a large
   crowd arriving shortly before a kick-off as occurred
   on the 15th April? - A. No, sir, I have .never
   experienced anything quite like that ever before.
                                                              92

Q. Have you ever experienced such a crushing taking
   place at the turnstiles before? - A. No, sir, never.
Q. Your response when you saw Gate A was opened was one
   of relief you have already told the Court? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. Because it relieved the crushing pressure? - A.
   Outside.

Q. If that had not been opened what did it appear to you
   was going to happen next? - A. When I was stood up
   against the wall before I made my way to the front to
   try to close the gate I was concerned for my own
   safety and the safety of the other people around me.
   People were going to get seriously injured unless
   something was done. I went to try to close the gate
   and I was relieved when I saw the large gates open
   and the crush was eased.

Q. A lot of people streamed into the ground? - A. Yes.
Q. Through the open gate? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. At that moment did it occur to you by these people
   going into the ground___

     THE CORONER:   Hr. Payne, I do not want him to express
any opinions. Can you phrase the question in such a way so
that it is either what he observed or what he knows.
Q.        MR. PAYNE: Did    it cross your mind at that time
     when the people went   in through this open gate that
     this would cause any   risk of crushing to people
     inside the ground? -   A. No, sir. The gate I saw
     opened was I believe   Gate A which leads to the rear
     of the North Stand.    I was unaware that any other
     gate had been opened   at that time. I just saw one.

Q. Did it cross your mind by opening the gate that would
   cause any crushing inside the ground? - A. No, sir.
Q. It certainly was not obvious to you? - A. No, sir.
     THE CORONER:   Enough on that line I think.   It is
difficult I appreciate but I think I have to be fair
between all the parties. I cannot stop Mr. King asking
questions about opinions and then allow you to do so.
     MR. PAYNE: Of course, sir, I accept your ruling but
you will be conscious, as I am conscious, that in due
                                                           93

course there may be a matter of law which needs to be
explored and it may be helpful at that stage for this sort
of evidence to be explored one way or another. That is
what I have got in mind.

     THE CORONER:   I appreciate that and obviously we will
just discuss that at the end of the day when we have sent
the Jury out.

     MR. KING:   I just wish to ask one question arising out
of that, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Yes.
                 Cross-Examine   bv MR. KING:

Q. Where did you think that the people going through
   Gate A were going to go? - A. To the rear of the
   North Stand.

Q. It is only a supplementary but it will help. That
   gate through which they entered led directly to the
   North Stand? - A. That is correct.

Q. So that anybody going through that had to go to the
   North Stand? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Can I go back if I may to questions about your
   experience, had you been on duty in the 1988 Semi
   Final? - A. No, sir.

Q. Had you been on duty in the 1987 Semi Final? - A.
   Yes, sir, I was on duty but my capacity for several
   years prior to that was in control of traffic as I
   was a member of the Traffic Division.

Q. You had not ever been on the Leppings Lane turnstile
   end of the ground on the occasion of a Semi Final, is
   that correct? - A. I cannot remember the year because
   I am not a football follower but Arsenal versus
   Sunderland, 1970 something.
Q. As long ago as that? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You may not be able to answer this; on this occasion
       the Liverpool fans, all 24,000, were going to
   enter the ground somewhere in the turnstiles at the
   Leppings Lane end? That is a fact and you probably
   knew that. Did you know that? - A. I was aware that
   the North Stand of Leppings Lane or part of the North
   Stand was allocated.
                                                                    94




                                               & u - S t .P Q E S F y g frp



Q. Not only that but entry to the North Stand was going
   to be via a turnstile at the Leppings Lane end? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. You say that as if surprised but you could have other
   turnstiles not at the Leppings Lane end designed to
   enter the North Stand but on this occasion everybody
   was going to use the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane
   end, the Liverpool fans? - A. Yes.
Q. You understood that? - A. Yes.

Q. You understood that on the day. That is some 24,000
   people who were expected? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. Did you know that? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Had you ever been on duty before - because you were
   asked about your experience - where some 24,000
   people were all going to be using the 16 turnstiles
   at the Leppings Lane end?
     THE CORONER:      23.

Q.    MR. KING:     23, I beg your pardon? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. When was that? - A. A long time ago, like I said, in
   the 1970s at the other Semi Finals when Hillsborough
   held a lot more people than it does now.

Q. Certainly with the present layout of the turnstiles,
   the divisions, the pens and so forth, the modern
   layout, the first time would be in 1989 for you? - A.
   I may be wrong, sir, but I think the layout has
   changed. Not to my recollection.

Q. We can investigate that with other Officers and I
   need not investigate it further with you. The normal
   games when you are there are much smaller gates, are
   they not? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I mean considerably smaller, the normal League
   game? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. The people who were entering the turnstile area, 1 to
   16, where you were up to 2.30, they were entering
   through the perimeter gate? - A. Yes.
Q. That was the only way they could get into that area
   obviously? - A. That is correct.

Q- Do I take it from that then that all those perimeter
   gates were opened, all three of them I think it is,
   up to that time? - A. Yes, so far as I am aware they
   were.

Q. As I understand it, there was no Police Officer
   manning those gates as they were just opened to allow
   people in? That is correct, is it not? - A. So far
   as I am aware, yes, sir. There was nobody given a
   specific duty to man, as you put it, those gates.
Q. Up to 2.30 did you see anything from your position by
   the turnstiles 1 to 16 which led you to think, "Gosh,
   there is so many people here we ought to close
   Leppings Lane", for example? - a . No , sir.
Q. Did you know that Leppings Lane was closed to
   vehicular traffic at about 2.30? - A. I wasn’t made
   aware of that.

Q. You did not see anything which led you to believe
   that that was about to happen, like a large group of
   people? - A. From my position, which I have described
   in the corner, my vision was very limited out along
   Leppings Lane.

Q. When you say a large group of people entered, I think
   you said in a rush, did you actually see thom come
   into the perimeter gate? - A. No, I think they just
   suddenly appeared would be the best way of putting
   it. That is how I would describe it. I would
   describe it how I have done before. I was stood in
   the corner talking to people in the queue and
   suddenly I looked round, and being 5' 10" tall you
   cannot see over the heads of people to get a better
   view, suddenly I was just surrounded by people and
   the queues disappeared within what seemed to be
   moments.

Q* All those people, the new people, obviously had to go
   through the open perimeter gates to get into that
   area? - A. Yes.

Q. Before you made the attempt to close one of the
   gates, had you seen any other attempt by other
   Officers to close any of the gates? - A. I attempted
   to close both gates.

Q. I know you did. Did you see any other attempt by
   anybody else? - A. No, sir.

                                               ILs— Hi— HORSFIELD



Q-    Much earlier on - I am     not talking about the time
     which you put at about 2.40ish - say at 2.15, had you
     been conscious of any cordon of mounted Police
     Officers outside the perimeter gates forming a cordon
     as early as 2.15 or something like t h a t? - a. No.
     sir.

Q.    The impression I gained from your evidence is that it
     was really only at the time when you suddenly saw
     this area suddenly filled with more than you were
     expecting, at about 2.40ish, it was only the" so far
     as you were aware anything was being done, from what
     you could see - and only from what you could see - to
     stop people getting into the perimeter area. It was
     ®®ly then that you saw anything because what you saw
     was your own efforts to close the gates? - A. I saw
     the horses outside attempting, moving amongst the
     crowd.

Q. That was round about 2.40? - A. That was round about
   the same time.

Q. I am really talking about much earlier on and from
   your evidence it appears that earlier from behind
   2.40 you did not see anything similar to that before
   then? - A. The mounted Officers were present?
Q.    Yes? — A. Before that time so far as I am aware there
     was no need for any crowd control action.   My duties
     were specifically to control a queue of people
     entering a turnstile. Like I said I was stood in the
     corner carrying out that duty.

Q.    If I suggested to you that there had been a cordon of
     Police Officers attempting to stop people getting
     into the perimeter area as early as 2.20 you saw
     nothing of that? - A. There were Officers on duty in
     Leppings Lane.

Q. But you saw nothing of that? - A. Sir, the crowd was
   such, like I stated, that when you are stood in a
   corner you cannot see over the heads of people. I
   knew the Officers were there but I couldn’t see them.
                Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRIEN:
Q. You say that the behaviour of the crowd.was not
   satisfactory at one stage and that you received a
   blow from one of the fans? - A. That is correct.
                                         K. E. HORSFIELD

What did you do when that happened? - A. At that
point I was attempting to hold the wrought iron gate
at the front of the enclosure shut by keeping the
bolt in the floor. I was being verbally abused by
the crowd because they wanted to gain access to the
enclosure and turnstiles and I did receive at least
one blow which I am aware of from a person in the
crowd. The result of this was that I was forced to
let go, by the jostling of the crowd, of the bolt
which I had placed in the floor and the gate was
flung open against my attempts to keep it shut.




                             /Q. Did you have that.
                                                             98

                                                K. E. HORSFIELD.


 Q. Djd you have that person arrested? - A. Madam, I have no
    idea who that person was.   I was in the centre of what I
    could best describe as a crush situation.   Like I
    stated, we had to get a horse to position itself in front
    of the gates so that we could even attempt to move it.
    By the time I had closed it members of the crowd which
    was pushing forward, were climbing over the gate, which I
    was trying to hold shut.   They were climbing over the
    top to by-pass it.

Q. So you didn't see the person at all? - A. Not at all.          I
   felt him.

Q. When Gate C was opened, is it possible that person who
   gave you the blow just had free access into the stadium?
          THE CORONER:    This Officer didn't see Gate C open
     so he can't answer that question.    He was in a different
     part. Sergeant Griffiths, can you just show where
     turnstiles 1 to 16 are on that, just to help
     Mrs. McBrien.    Those are turnstiles 1 to 16.   He was in
     the corner there on the far side.    In fact at the time
     he was up at the perimeter gates.    That is where he was.
     Show us where Gate C was.    That is a totally different
     area, so he can't answer.    You can ask another question,
     if you like, but you have got the wrong gate with regard
     to this Officer:

Q. That's right, you never saw Gate C did you? - A. I
   couldn't see it from my position.   I could only
   see Gate A.

0.         MRS. McBRIEN:  I am just wondering what might have
     happened to that sort of crowd.   Would that crowd end up
     inside the stadium at some stage? - A. They all did I'm
     sure.

          MR. KING:    Sir, there was one question which I
     meant to clarify.

              Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING:
Q. Officer, when you heard for the first time that you were
   wanted on the pitch - that is the event I am looking to.
   I have forgotten where you are at that point.   Where
   were you? - A. Stood next to the wrought iron gates at
   the front of the enclosure.

Q. I made a note of what you heard people shout, or stated.
   I am not sure I got it right.    Was it that you heard the
   message, "They're on the pitch"?    Have I got my note
   right?   Is that what you heard? - A. Something to the
   effect, "Get inside.   They're on the pitch."
A                                                K. E. HORSFIELD-


    Q. Did you understand by that that "They're on the pitch"
       referred to some sort of pitch invasion? - A. Yes, sir.
        ✓
           THE CORONER:   Sergeant, thank you very much indeed.
      I understand you aren't very well yourself at the moment.
      I hope you make a good recovery and thank you for coming
      when you weren't quite well.
            You will recollect, ladies and gentlemen, that when
       Stephanie Jones gave evidence we had a bit of a problem
       with her timings because it was difficult to reconcile -
       I think it was Mr. Catchpole who spotted it.   He spotted
       there was a discrepancy between the timing-of the
       identification on the terraces with the time she said she
       went in.
            We said we would have the family have another look
       at the videos to see whether they could confirm or deny,
       as the case may be, the terracing identification because
       there was very little doubt about Stephanie's
       identification outside. Sergeant Killoch did that and he
       is just going to come and tell us.   I am doing it now
       because Mr. and Mrs. Jones are here and it seems a very
       sensible thing to deal with it.

               I am a Police              Constable         in the       South         Yorkshire        Police        stationed           at

               Ecclesfield           Police         Station.

               On Saturday           15 A p r i l      1989     I wa s    detailed            for    d u t y at H i l l s b o r o u g h

               Nottingham           Forest.

               was     assigned       to     serial        18 u n d er    the      supervision             of PS M o r g a n        f r o m FI

               Sub Division.               Our      duties     for      Phase      1 of       the   match      were        outside

The turnstiles serial 18 were responsible for gate access to the seats

in the West Stand only.                                                                     The way the ground is set out is that on the

street side of the turnstiles is an enclosure which gives access only

to these turnstiles and the turnstiles for the seating in the North

Stand.
To the left of turnstile 16 is a solid metal barrier some 12 feet

separating the turnstiles for the seats from the turnstiles for the

standing on the Leppings Lane terraces.                                                                                     There are 10 foot high

wrought iron gates giving access to this enclosure and some 50 feet

from the turnstiles.
I took up position outside turnstiles '13 and 14 together with PC320

Bradshaw when the turnstiles opened at "IS mid-day.                                                                                    PC's 1960

Alexander and 1151 Horsfield were immediately to my left covering

turnstiles 15 and "16 and PC's 513 Francis and 786 Hemsworth were

immediately to my right working turnstiles 11 and 12.

I subsequently found that turnstiles 9 and 10 were giving access to

the North Stand and a row of temporary 3 foot metal barriers had been

e   r   e   c   t   e   d   b   e   t   w   e   e   n   t   u   r   n   s   t   i   l   e   s   1 0   a   n   d   1 1 . ,




Initially there were very few fans wanting to go through the

turnstiles.                                     There were a considerable number milling about in

Leppings Ln but they were reluctant to go into the ground. By 1pm

still very few people had passed through the turnstiles we were

supervising and between 1pm and Spm there was a very gradual increase

in the people using the turnstile but still there had not been many

people through the turnstiles considering the size of the crowd

expected.
Shortly after 2.30pm the amount of people wanting to use the turnstile

increased considerably and orderly queues began to form at each

turnstile.                                  We were still carrying out duties checking tickets and

searching people prior to them going through the turnstile but it
                                                                    PAGE
                                                                    S 1095

became obvious about the time that to search everyone waiting would

cause unacceptable congestion therefore we were searching only

selected people in order to speed access into the ground.

At this time a problem became evident with the tickets in that

although the tickets had been colour coded, red for West Stand seats,

brown for North Stand seats and purple for Leppings Ln terrace

standing the holders of these tickets did not seem to be aware of the

significance of these colours.

There were no signs telling people to which turnstiles to go to for

their colour of ticket and although the turnstiles were lettered these

letters could not be seen through the ever growing crowd.      This meant

that people getting into the wrong enclosure had to go back onto the

street before they could get to the correct turnstiles.      Also despite

ticket checking by police officers to ensure     people got the correct

turnstile the volume of the      crowd waiting to get in was such by 2.40

that all tickets could not be checked and some people with the wrong

tickets were getting into the mouth of the wrong turnstile and having

to be turned back from there.     This was causing even further

congestion in extracting them from the turnstiles before others could

pass through.
At about S.45pm I became aware of people sitting and standing on top

of the afore mentioned 12 foot metal barrier to my left.      1hey were

getting onto the barrier from the opposite side to myself but were not

attempting to get over it.      Although I could not see what was

happening at the other side      of the barrier Iformed the impression

that the weight of the crowd at the other side of the barrier was such

that people were climbing onto it to escape being crushed.

By 2.45pm the numbers of people waiting to get through turnstiles was

such that it was impractical to search anyone.      People were still

waiting in queues for the turnstiles but were very tightly packed and
                                                                   PAGE
                                                                   51095

by S.50pm the numbers of people in the enclosure had increased to such

numbers that the queues had degenerated to a crush.

X could not see over the crowd but it was obvious that the large

amount of people trying to gain access to the turnstiles from the

street was causing people to crush forward towards the turnstiles.         By

this time I was standing at the side of PC Alexander.    We were

standing with our backs to a 20 foot brick wall with turnstiles either

side of us.   Several times the crowd pushed forwards crushing us

against the wall and the numbers of people was such that it was

impossible to supervise them from the position we were in.       I could

see that people were climbing from the metal barrier to my le-ft onto

the wall at my back and gaining access to the ground over the top of

the turnstiles.   There was also an Inspector on the top of the wall

supervising them doing so.    Not many people got in this way.

At this time I became afraid that if 1 stayed where I was, I was

likely to get injured in the crush, therefore, PC Alexander and myself

made our way to the rear of the crowd at the entrance to the enclosure

whilst we were still able to do so.
At the afore mentioned wrought iron gates to the enclosure I saw PC

Horsfield.    I assisted him in attempt ing to shut this gate to prevent

further people entering the enclosure in order that people could ease

back from the turnstiles.
We managed to keep this gate shut for 2 or 3 minutes which seemed to

be helping the people inside then the gate was forced open by other

people wanting to get   in and we had to allow them to do so.     At this

time many people were   rushing about pushing others and seemed to be

panicking, not due to   any fear of injury but panic      because they

thought they may miss   the kick off of the football match.

Leppings Lri itself was totally blocked with people.   When I saw it

first at about 2.55 the wrought iron gates to the enclosure in front
                                                                     PAGE
                                                                     S1095

of the terrace turnstiles were shut and people were being kept away

from the gates for 4 mounted Police Officers.        These were the only

mounted officers I saw on Leppings Ln. Some control was being

exercised by people being allowed past the horses and through the

gates a few at a time but generally there did not seem sufficient

police officers to control a crowd of that size.

By 3.10pm the crush had begun to ease in Leppings Ln and. in front of

the turnstiles to the West Stand.        At this time we were joined by PS

Morgan and as he joined us we heard over his personal radio that

assistance was required inside the ground as the pitch had been

invaded.
We gained access to the ground via a turnstile and followed PS Morgan

along the back of the West Stand, round the back of the Police Control

Box and into the South Stand lower seating.        Whilst walking down the

aisle towards the pitch I noticed that there were a considerable

number of people on the pitch but there was no fighting and the reason

for the pitch invasion was a crush of people on the Leppings Ln

terraces.     I looked onto the terraces to the right of the goal at

Leppings Ln and although they were full there still seemed to be

plenty of room for further people.       When I got onto the pitch I saw

the central pen of the Leppings Ln terraces was very full.        People had

been crushed against the perimeter fencing and bodies were piled

on top of one another and appeared dead or badly injured.

Police officers had the gates to all the pens open and were attempting

to free the t rapped people and via the gates, and over the perimeter

fence.     I am a trained First Aider.     I therefore stayed on the pitch

intiailly treating the injured as they were taken from the terraces.

Once the main bulk of the injured and dead had been moved onto the

pitch and were beginning to be transported to the back of the police

room.    I went to this location and assisted in treating the injured
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S 1095

         until the last person had been taken to hospital.

         From there I again met up with my section and we were stood down from

         the ground.

         In my opinion the main cause of the origianl crush outside the ground

         was Liverpool supporters turning up at the ground from £.50 onwards

         and not allowing themselves sufficient time to get into the ground

         before the kick off.     Also many people were turning up at the ground

         who had obviously been drinking especially the ones who turned up

         late.     This was also born out when I began to treat injured people on

         the pitch.     I was obliged to get much closer to them then and noticed

         that many of them smelled strongly of drink.

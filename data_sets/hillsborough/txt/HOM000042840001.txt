HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

Since the Inquiry office is closing on 9 February, I ought to let
you and Mr Bolton know what arrangements have been made to bring
the Inquiry to an end.

Costs

2.   I had hoped to be able to let you have a note about the
total costs of the Inquiry, on the assumption that the Home
Secretary will be asked about this in a PQ sooner or later.   But
the costs of parties represented in Part I of the Inquiry, where
Lord Justice Taylor recommended that they should be paid from
public funds, have still not been settled. There is continuing
discussion between the Treasury Solicitor and the solicitors for
the   bereaved   and   injured  and   the Football    Supporters'
Association, with which we are not directly involved.         The
parties have the right to apply for taxation and, if so, the case
might not be heard for several months. We have made clear to all
concerned that there is no money set aside to pay these costs
beyond the end of the current financial year. We could bring all
this within the current financial year (and still be within
budget) by suggesting that Treasury Solicitors agree to pay what
is being asked:      but Treasury Solicitors do not think that
repayment from public funds of the current bills could be
justified, so I could not recommend that we should settle now
just for the sake of settling.      Mr Sweet has been keeping in
touch with Mr Preston in G1 about this, and Mr Preston has all
the details:   I fear he will have to keep a careful eye on the
unresolved differences. On costs generally, I thought that you
yourself might like to have a copy of a note Mr Sweet has
prepared setting out the current position.

Corre spondence

3.   There has so far only been a handful of letters following
the Final Report, which Mr Sweet and I have dealt with.       Mrs
Humphries will acknowledge any more which come in while I am on
leave and I will deal with them on my return.Most of    them can,
I hope, be dealt with by a pro forma response.   I will make sure
that Lord Justice Taylor sees them all: he is dealing with some
himself.

Technical Working Party

4.   As you know, Professor Maunder has been anxious that the
detailed papers of the Technical Working Party should be made
available to those who will have the task of revising the Green
Guide. Mr Sweet has assembled this material, and will hand it
over to Mr Mould by 9 February.

Files and Papers

5.   A single complete set of all the Inquiry papers has now been
placed on files, which have been laid by in the Registry.       A
detailed list of these files, from which their broad subject
headings can be identified, is attached.       The files include
papers for both parts of the Inquiry. There are no loose papers
apart from the files, and all duplicates of written submissions
etc have been destroyed. Lord Justice Taylor and the Assessors
are going to keep some of their papers but destroy others: we
are leaving this to them.

6.   The Inquiry accumulated a large number of videos - the
material shown to the public inquiry in Sheffield, film of other
football matches, policing of football matches, perimeter fences
and so on. All these videos have been catalogued and handed over
to Mr Mould.

Accommodation

7.   Room 448 will be left clear on 9 February.     I understand
that M Division intend to take it over.
Telephone Contact

8.    Mrs Humphries will be available on extension 2577 during my
leave from 12 February to 2 March. From 5 March I shall be on
extension 2175. From 19 February Mr Sweet will be on extension
3083.

HILLSBOROUGH PUBLIC INQUIRY - COSTS


I promised to let you have a note on the overall cost   of the
Inquiry. The attached print-out produced by Accounts    Branch
shows that as at 31 January 1990 bills amounting to a   total of
£479,048.68 had been paid. That figure is made up of    the
following:-

                                             £

     Civil Service salaries              76,980.47
     Travel and subsistence              32,893.23
     Stationary and printing              1,351.27
     General expenses                   218,402.25
     Legal representation               134,500.00
     Research                            14,921.46


               Total (31/1/90)         £479,048.68

2.   The figure is substantially lower than our budget estimate
(and provision) of £900,000, but it needs qualifying.  Several of
the sub-heads need amendment to reflect bills submitted but not
yet paid, and to incorporate further payments made since then.
In particular, a further £113,661.64 has been paid out in respect
of legal costs.

3.   There is no guarantee, however, that this will be the final
payment on that sub-head. You have seen Hill Dickinson's letter
of 2 February in which they say they are unhappy with the way
their costs have been dealt with.  Should the Hillsborough
Steering Committee react similarly (and given the more drastic
pruning of their bill and the number of individual firms
involved, I think it likely), we may ultimately have to pay out
up to £100,000 more. That would push the total Inquiry costs up
to a little over £690,000.

4.   In addition, there are a number of relatively minor bills to
be added to other sub-heads. On. research. Dr Nicholson ■
                                                        h as told
me yesterday that HSE will this week be submitting a bill for
some £5,000 in respect of Inquiry work done by their consultant.
Similarly, we have received travel and subsistence claims from
members of the Technical Working Party which will add a further
£1,000 or so to the total.
5.   We shall also need to Include a figure for the cost of
copies of the Final Report supplied direct to the Inquiry and
Home Office.  I understand from Parliamentary Section that 1300
copies were supplied. For the Interim Report, we were charged
(at discounted rate) £6,266.11 for 1000 copies. We shall
probably be paying in the region of £9,000 this time.  (Such
figures do not, of course, include the total cost incurred by
HMSO in printing the Reports - I have asked them to let me have a
figure for this but, as a guide, production costs of the Interim
Report for Popplewell in 1985 totalled approximately £30,000.)

6.   Assuming payment as outlined in paragraphs, the overall
cost of the Inquiry to the Home Office will be in the region of
£700,000. Adding the full publication costs suggests a total
Inquiry cost of £750, 000-E800, 000 .

7.   The difference between this and our earlier estimates can be
attributed largely to i) a saving of almost £50,000 on the bill
from Sheffield Town Hall* ii) the decision by their respective
employers not to charge the Home office for the Assessors' salary
and associated costs and iii) completion of the Inquiry before
financial year-end.

8.   I hope that, broad-brush though they are, these figures will
be helpful.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,
The Hillsborough Scrutiny,
Room 1106,

Dear Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,

                                     Hillsborough

Thank-you for your letter of 3rd December 1997.

The first I knew of a change on the certification form was on 24th November 1997
when, whilst looking at the body file of Kevin William I noticed some correspondence
about this. This alteration was undertaken by my successor presumably when he dated
the revised form in April 1994. I had been retired as Coroner for well over three years
by then.

As you rightly say the evidence of Dr. Slater was not altered during the inquests nor
do I recollect that he has ever communicated with me about any change.

From what I saw in the file I believe that he did correspond with Mr. Dorries and it is
Mr. Dorries who will have to deal with the question which you have put to me. To
save time I am photocopying your letter and enclosure and sending it on to him for his
attention. I have also phoned him and alerted him to your enquiry.

Perhaps you will permit me to add that in addition to the point which you have
mentioned Dr. Slater said specifically on pi 001 (page 3) ‘In addition there was
evidence of bruising to the lungs, again supporting compression of the chest.’

It has to be remembered that the post mortem was undertaken very shortly after the
tragedy and that the reports were completed months before the start of the interim
inquests. I do not have a copy of the actual post mortem report to hand but no
doubt Mr. Dorries could send you a copy of it with his reply as it is possible that
it will be more detailed.

I do not have copies of the original certificate but I am sure Mr. Dorries will be able
to send you a copy of it.

Yours sincerely,

S. L. Popper

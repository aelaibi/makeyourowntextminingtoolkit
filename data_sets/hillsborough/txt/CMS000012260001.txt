Thank you for your letter and enclosure of 20 April about factual
reports on the Hillsborough disaster.         I enclose a copy of our

In his statement to the House of Commons on 17 April about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster the Home Secretary said that he
had asked for factual reports from the Police and other
services, the local authority and the Football Association. A
copy of the page from Hansard which records the Home Secre­
tary's statement is attached.

We have been in touch with you by telephone to request that a
factual report be provided to the Home Secretary and I am now
writing to formally confirm this request. It would be helpful
to receive your report by 28 April.

You are aware that the Home Secretary has sought a factual
report of the part which your service played in the events of
the day: he does not ask that you make in the factual report
judgements about the issues which arise from the disaster.

I attach a copy of a letter which we have sent to the Chief Fire
Officer of South Yorkshire following the Home Secretary's
statement to the House on 17 April.

Could I ask that you write in similar terms to the local
authority and the Football Association.

I shall let you have a copy of the reports received here -
perhaps you would reciprocate.
                                                     Yours sincerely

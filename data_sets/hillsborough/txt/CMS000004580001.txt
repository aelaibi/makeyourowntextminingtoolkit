WILL THE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGE LOCAL PLANNING AUTHORITIES TO GIVE

PLANNING PERMISSION FOR ALL-SEATER STADIA?



The Football     League has raised with us the difficulties which

some    football      clubs     are     experiencing       in    securing      planning

permission for either re-development of existing grounds or for

new    stadia   on    different       sites.     Clearly    it    is    important   for

football    clubs      to   get   in     touch    with     their       local   planning

authority at the earliest possible stage in the preparation and

review of local plans.            We are considering whether it would be

appropriate      to     issue     national       guidance        on     the    planning

considerations relevant to new and re-developed football stadia.




WILL GREEN BELT POLICY BE RELAXED TO ALLOW BUILDING OF NEW STADIA

IN THE GREEN BELT?



The Government has been resolute in its defence of the Green Belt

and no change of policy is contemplated.

             SAFETY AT F~LOWSPARK, WAI~ALL
             LETTER FROM W~T MIDI~%ND6 COUNTY COUNCIL
Further to my earlier report of 6 March 1984 on the wall collapse at
Fellows Park, Walsall on ~esday 14 February 1984 I feel I should
confine myself to answering, where possible, the questions raised in
the letter of 23 February 1984 from the County Secreta~.

    (a)   In my view restricting the overall numbers at the Railway
          End would not have prevented the inevitable crowding behind
          the goal itself. This is always a focal point for the
          more exuberant young supporters.

    (b)   It is difficult to see how more crush barriers could be
          installed. The barriers already in position were,
          according to the Club Secretary, fitted to ~afety of Sports
          Ground specifications.

2         Obviously not or it would not have collapsed. Health and
          Safety Executive Inspectors have reported on the condition
          of the wall and MessrsI ~d      ~f the Cotmty
          Council Surveyors Department visited the ground, albeit in
          an advisory capacity, on 28 February.

3         Again, with the advantage of hindsight, no.

4         Overall safety standards at Fellows Park have been adequate
          to cater for the average home gate (4800). The Health end
          Safety Executive did not prosecute Walsall Football Club,
          presumably because the club conducted their undertaking in
          such a way as to ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable,
          that the spectators were not exposed to risks to their health
          or safety (see Section 3 (1) Health and Safety at Work etc
          Act 1974).

          Obviously with a low average home gate Fellows Park was not
          ’designated’. Without the pressure exerted by the requirement
          of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and given the financial
          position affecting football clubs the ground is well below
          the standard of safety of the other West Midlands clubs.

5         No comment.

            MII~K CUP 2rid LEG SEMI FINAL: %~ALSAIL FC v I~IVERPOOL FC,
            TU~DA¥ 14 FEBRUARY 1984 AT FEIJ~ObA$ PARK, WALSAIL

    With reference to the attached letters of 15 and 21 February 1984 from
    the Home Office, the facts surrounding the collapse of the wall at the
    Railway End of Fellows Park Football Ground are as follows:

    It will be recalled that the First Leg of this Semi Final had resulted
    in a 2-2 draw at Liverpool. This result ensured that Liverpool would
    send a large number of spectators for the Second Leg. Interest in
    Walsall was also intense as this was the furthest the Third Division
    club had ever progressed in a national competition.

    Fellows Park has in the past housed as many as 26,000 spectators. In
    view of the interest in this match a meeting was held at the ground on
    Saturday 21 January 1984 at which were present Chief Superintendent
    R J MELLER, Mr K WHELOON, the Club Chairman, Mr J W~TMANCO~, the Club
    Secretary and the Walsall Borough Eagineer, Mr G MARSH. It was decided
    that a crowd limit of 20,000 would be set in the interests of safety
    and comfort. The visitors enclosure at the Railway hnd of the ground
    has a capacity of 7,000 spectators but it was decided to confine a number
    of tickets sent to Liverpool to 6,000. The fixture itself was an all
    ticket match.

    The average gate at Fellows Park up to the 14 February 1984 was 4,581.
    This gate is good for a team which is in line for promotion to the
    Second Division. Fellows Park is not a ’designated ground’ for the
    purposes of the Safety of the Sports Ground Act 1975. According to the
    Club Secretary only the crush barriers at the Railway End are installed
    to the standards laid down in the 1975 Act.

    I prepared an Operational Order for coverage of this event using Divisional
    resources supplemented by four serials from the Operational Support Unit,
    Mounted Department, Western Traffic Motor Cyclists and two serials from
    ’K’ and ’J’ Divisions. 32 Special Constables volunteered their services.
    The ~brce Communications Van was utilised for match coverage.

    Given the size of the crowd and the lack of off street car parking facilities
    the 19,591 spectators who attended were positioned in the ground safely
    and with the minimum of incident at 7.30 pm for the commencement of the
    game. According to the Club Secretary the distribution of the crowd was
    as follows:

               The Hillary Street Stand and two thirds of the             10,443
               Wednesbury Road Stand (Walsall Supporters)

               The hailway End and remaining one third of the              5,558
               Wednesbury Road Stand (Liverpool Supporters)

               Standing ~closure below the Main Stand                      2,125

               Main Stand                                                  1,465
                                -- 2 --



In view of the lack of any real physical barrier to prevent a pitch
invasion and the lack of any suitable enclosure to house a reserve
of Police Officers for swift deployment there was a larger than
normal number of uniform Police Officers patrolling the perimeter
of the playing area.

Having discussed the safety factor before the gs~ne I visited the
club’s Public Address Operator and requested him to advise spectators
at both ends of the ground to exercise great care in leaving the
ground at the end of the match to avoid anyone being crushed. In
doing this my main concern was for the limited exit facilities at
this ground. The Operator did in fact comply with my request at half
time.

Some 20 minutes after the kick-off I patrolled the playing area and
noticed that the crowd appeared to be comfortably spaced on the
terracing all around the ground. Liverpool scored a goal in the
first half at the Hillary Street End but no untoward incident resulted
from this.

At about 8.45 pm I was at the front main entrance to the ground when
I was told that Liverpool had scored a second goal and that the wall
behind the Railway End goal had collapsed. I made my way to the
scene and saw that about 40 yards of the three foot high wall behind
the goal had indeed collapsed. Police Officers and St John’s Ambulance
personnel were busy moving casualties, mainly young people, suffering
from minor injuries, to the players entrance at the Hillary Street End
of the ground. Whilst the Police were restoring order the Referee,
Mr HUNTING, took the players off the field and the game was halted for
some 13 minutes. It was possible to move Liverpool spectators from
directly behind the goal onto the terracing at the corner of the ground
on the Wednesbury Head Stand side without too much difficulty. A
cordon of uniformed Police Officers was maintained from the restart of
the match to the final whistle. At the final whistle - and a Liverpool
victory - the cordon retreated some 20 yards and extending for the
width of the playing area. This allowed many Liverpool spectators to
come forward onto the edge of the pitch and take the pressure off the
limited exit gates. No disorder took place and the ground emptied -
at both ends without any further casualties. The Public Address Operator
broadcast warnings as arranged.

L~cal newspapers put the casualties from the wall collapse as high as
24. The St John’s Ambulance casualty book contains details of six
casualties probably from the Hallway End. None of those treated went
to hospital. Walsal~ General Hospital dealt with 13 casualties from
Fellows Park; six as a result of a wall collapse, six were victims of
assaults, one, with a Liverpool address declined to wait for treatment
as he had a train to catch. A 59 year old Walsall man who had been at
the match suffered a heart attack in a public house at the end of the
game. He was admitted to Walsall General Hospital and died on 2 March
1984. The case has been referred to H M Coroner but there is no suggestion
he was involved with the wall collapse. Two of the six casualties
treated at the General Hospital did in fact receive crush inJuriesat
the Hillary Street End of the ground. Apparently when the wall collapsed
at the Railway End many of the Walsall supporters at the Hillary Street
End thought that there was a pitch invasion and this appeared to cause
a surge amongst them. The two casualties were in fact detained in
hospital for some days before being discharged.
                                                                      Cont’ d ...

As Fellows Park is not a ’designated ground’ under the Safety of
Sports Ground Act, the only statute having a bearing on this incident
is the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 - Section 3- On the
15 February 1984, Mr M BIRD, an Inspector from the Health and Safety
Executive, McLaren House, Birmingham (tel 021 236 5080) visited the
ground and inspected the collaosed wall. Mr BIRD had with him Mr
H WELI~, Senior Construction Engineering Inspector, who prepared a
report on the damage.

Mr BIRD later contacted me and as a result two further meetings took
place at Fellows Park. The first meeting on the morning of Monday
20 February 1984, involved Mr BIRD, Superintendent B R DO~ ’HI’
Sub Division, the Club Chairman and Secretary. The purpose of this
meeting was to check on the arrangements to be made at the Railway End
in view of impending fixtures on Tuesday 21 February 1984 against
Northampton Town F C in the Associates Cup, and on Saturday 25 February
1984 against Bradford City F C in the League. In the event it was
decided to exclude spectators from the terracing behind the Railway
Ead goal and to accomodate visiting spectators in the corner section
near the Wednesbury Road Stand. By 20 February 1984 the damaged
section of the wall had been ’rebuilt’ using the same materials - in
effect remortared.

The second meeting held on Tuesday 28 February 1984, suggested by
Mr BIRD, again involved the Club Chairman and Secretary and Mr BIRD.
At Mr BIRD’s suggestion           and           ]of West Midlands County
Council Surveyors Department, attended purely in an advisory capacity.
If Fellows Park ever becomes a ’designated ground’ then Messrs
and         ~ould be responsible for the implementation of the provisions
of the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975. Also in attendance at the
invitation of Walsall Football Ground wasI            ~f Corderoy Ltd,
Construction Engineers to the Sports Ground Improvement Trust. On this
occasion I attended with PCI

The purpose of this second meeting was to consider the safety aspect
of the whole ground for the rest of the season and, in particular, the
match against Oxford United F C on Saturday 7 April 1984, and the last
home match of the season (Monday 7 May 1984 against Preston Northend)
Given the current League placings the Oxford match should attract a
large crowd and, if promotion is still an issue, the last home match
on a public holiday may also attract a large crowd. The club position
was that they will not allow spectators into the area behind the Railway
End goal for the rest of the season. It was felt that the two fixtures
referred to would not attract more than 10,000 spectators at the outside.
Mr BIED, supported by MessrsI ~d ~ expressed the view that
pressure on the wall at the HillarySt~e~r       at the ground should be
minimised. This wall is of a similar construction to that at the
Railway End. It was agreed that consideration should be given to
excluding spectators from the terracing in front of the crush barriers
behind the Hillary Street goal. This could be effected by means of
some demarcation system and Police coverage or by positioning some
physical barrier. The exact measures were to be discussed nearer the
date of the Oxford fixture when the League placings might be clearer.
Since the Liverpool match Walsall have in fact lost three League matches
in succession.



                                                                     Cont’d ...
                               -4-


      ~  agreed with the football club officials that cost was a
factor d that short term building or construction work might
be wasteful. He felt that the two fixtures mentioned were the
priorities for the rest of the season and that in the event of
promotion Fellows Park would undoubtedly become a designated ground
under the 1975 ACt.

With reference to the report prepared by Mr WELLS, Mr G LINDO~,
Mr BIRD’s superior, provided me with a copy of a report. This was
provided under confidential cover and when I later asked if a copy
could be supplied to Home Office Mr LINDO~ said not. He said that
if Home Office wanted a copy they could write to him and ask for
it.

In 1968 in a F A Cup match again against Liverpool, there was a
similar wall collapse at the Hillary Street Eud of Fellows Park.
I have had searches made of both Divisional and Force Registries
but there is no trace of any Police reports on the incident. It is
probable that the papers were destroyed on the 1974 amalgamation.
A total of 38 persons were arrested at this match. Three before
the kick-off and the rest during and after the game. 23 persons
were arrested for Public Order Act offences, four for Drunkenness,
one for Criminal Damage, one for Obstruct Police and nine on
suspicion of Wounding (eight later eliminated from the inquiry).

It is submitted that with regard to Policing the match we have
nothing to reproach ourselves for. The large numbers of Officers
patrolling the playing area were extremely useful when the wall did
collapse.

So far as Walsall F C is concerned the Health and Safety Executive
have decided that there is no evidence on which to base a prosecution
under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. In the short term the
only fixtures to cause concern for the remainder of the season are
the visits of Oxford and Preston already referred to. These matches
will be given special attention and we will liaise with Mr BIRD
nearer the time. In the lonE term if Walsall are promoted the ground
will be ’designated’ and, no doubt, we will be consulted by the
County Council during the closed season.

This incident, which has already attracted parliamentary interest,
serves to highlight the anomalies in relation to ’designation’ caused
by a fixture such as this leads to a non-designated ground having to
cater for four times its average gate. Hindsight plays a large part
here and i can only speculate as to what limit the Health and Safety
Executive would have set on the crowd had they been involved. Again,
the provisions of Section 3 of the q974 Act are not that well known
in the context of football stadia and perhaps there is room for some
machinery for such fixtures - which usually arise from F A Cup or
Milk Cup draws - to be referred to the Health and Safety Executive in
advance.

As requested by Home Office, copies of a scale plan of the Railway
End terracinE are attached. I have had photographs taken of the
Railway End which will be forwarded separately as soon as possible.

                                           I am a Police Inspector, 1721 in the West Midlands Police,

                                 Fellows Park, Walsall, which kicked off at 7.3Opm. I was in charge

                                 the Hillary Street end, when Liverpool scored a goal at the Railway

                                 End. At about the same time, I heard a loud bang from the Railway

                                 End and at first thought a fire cracker had been let off but on

                                 looking towards the Railway End of the ground I saw a large number of

                                 supporters spilling onto the track and playing area. I immediately

                                 thought it was a pitch invasion and it seemed that Walsall supporters

                                 behind the goal area at t~e Hillary Street End thought the same

                                 because they surged forward from directly behind the goal, causing

                                 a crushing effect on the retaining wall at my end. However, I then saw
                                                                    ---             721                      Signature witnessed by

Continuation of statement of

  that the wall at the Railway end had collapsed from ~a point to the
  left of the goal area as I looked at it, behind the goal and to a point to
  the right of the goal area. The Walsall supporters at the Hillary Street End
  obviously realised what had happened at about the same time and to their
  credit contained themselves and the crushing effect was eased.



         I at once went down the playing area to the Railway End, assisted in

  getting the injured treated and restoring order. A number of Police Officers

  went into the crowd and did a remarkably good job in easing supporters

  towards the scoreboard corner of the Railway End thus creating space for those

  who had spilled onto the t rack/playing area to return to the terrace. A

  line of Police Officers then stood facing the crowd on the terrace for the

  remainder of the match. Whilst this was taking place, I went amongst the

  Liverpool Supporters and spoke to a number of them who were behind the area

  where the wall had collapsed. Having informed them of the situation and

  the consequences of them surging forward during the remainder of the match, i.e.

  that the referee might be forced to abandon the game, some of them ’spread the

  word’ and to their credit, no further problems of this nature occurred.



         I feel sure that any problems or injuries that arose in the Hillary

  Street End of the ground as a result of this incident were purely caused

  by the hooligan element of Walsall supporters being under the original

  impression that the Liverpool supporters had invaded the pitch. As soon

 as they realised, in a very short space of time, that this was not the

 case, normal order was restored.

                                        I am a Police Inspector, 1721 in the West Midlands Police,

                              stationed in the Prosecutions Department, Walsall.



                                        On TUESDAY 14th FEBRUARY, 1984 1 was a match Inspector on

                              duty at the Walsall F.C. -v- Liverpool F.C. Football match, at

                             Fellows Park, Walsall, which kicked off at 7.30pro. I was in charge

                              of the Hillary Street End of the ground which was occupied by

                              the home (Walsall) supporters.



                                        At about 8.50pm I was patrolling the track immediately behind

                              the Hillary Street end, when Liverpool scored a goal at the Railway

                             End. At about the same time, I heard a loud bang from the Railway

                             End and at first thought a fire cracker had been let off but on

                             looking towards the Railway End of the ground I saw a large number of

                             supporters spilling onto the track and playing area. I immediately

                              thought it was a pitch invasion and it seemed that Walsall supporters

                             behind the goal area at the Hillary Street End thought the same

                             a crushing effect on the retaining wall at my end. However, I then saw

  that the wall at the Railway end had collapsed from a point to the

  the right of the goal area. The Walsall supporters at the Hillary Street End

  obviously realised what had happened at about the same time and to their

  credit contained themselves and the crushing effect was eased.



         I at once went down the playing area to the Railway End, assisted in

  getting the injured treated and restoring order. A number of Police Officers

  went into the crowd and did a remarkably good job in easing supporters

  towards the scoreboard corner of the Railway End thus creating space for t hose

  the consequences of them surging forward during the remainder of the match, i.e.

  that the referee might be forced to abandon the game, some of them ’spread the

 word’ and to their credit, no f~rther problems of this nature occurred.



         I feel sure that any problems or injuries that arose in the Hillary

 Street End of the ground as a result of this incident were purely caused

 by the hooligan element of Walsall supporters being under the original

 impression that the Liverpool supporters had invaded the pitch. As soon

 as they realised, in a very short space of time, that this was not the

 case, normal order was restored.

 the age and construction of the wall concerned.

                             I am Constable ~in the West Midlands Police stationed at Walsall.

                             On Tuesday 14 February 1984 I was on uniform duty at Fellows Park,

                             Walsall for the semi-final of the Milk Cup which was being played

                             between Walsall FC and Liverpool FC. My duty was to patrol the

                             Wallows Lane side of the track which surrounds the playing area.

                             At approximately 8.50 pm I was in a position roughly 12 metres from

                             the goal line at the Railway End of the ground, which was the end that

                             Walsall were defending and the end at which the Liverpool supporters

                             were occupying. At this point of the game Liverpool scored a second

                             goal. This caused the Liverpool supporters at this end of the ground

                             to surge forward. My attention was focused entirely on these supporters.

                             At the same time I heard a loud crack and I saw the boundary wall at

                             the Railway End of the ground begin to collapse. It appeared to start

                             at the far side of the ground, near to the invalid seats, and run in a

                             ’domino’ effect towards me. The result was that a large number of

                             spectators spilled forward onto the playing area.

                             I could see several people amongst the fallen masonry blocks.

                            With the assistance of other officers and St John’s Ambulance men, I

                             helped to carry the injured to the medical room.

Complete order was restored very quickly.

For the remainder of the game I remained in the vicinity of the Railway End of

the ground. There were no further incidents.

                              I am Constable ~in the West Midlands                                                Police stationed                       at    Walsall.

                              On Tuesday 14 February 1984 I was on uniform duty at Fellows Park,

                              Walsall for the semi-final of the MiLk Cup which was being pls~Ted

                              between Walsall FC and Liverpool FC. My duty was to patrol the

                              Wallows Lane side of the track which surrounds the playing area,
                              At approximately 8.50 pm I was in a position roughly 12 metres from

                               the goal line at the Railway End of the ground, which was the end that

                              Walsall were defending and the end at which the Liverpool supporters

                              were occupying. At this point of the game Liverpool scored a second

                               goal. This caused the Liverpool supporters at this end of the ground

                               to surge forward. My attention was focused entirely on these supporters.

                               At the same time I heard a loud crack and I saw the boundary wall at

                               the Railway End of the ground begin to collapse. It appeared to start

                               at the far side of the ground, near to the invalid seats, and run in a

                               ’domino’ effect towards me. The result was that a lares number of

                               spectators spilled forward onto the playing area.

                               I could see several people amongst the fallen masonry blocks.

                               With the assistance of other officers and St John’s Ambulance men, I

                               helped to carry the injured to the medical room.

For the remainder of the game I remained in the vicinity of the ~Ltlway End of

the ground. There were no further incidents.

Dear Inspector Wallace

Further to our telephone conversation this morning about the collapse
of the perimeter wall at the Walsall football ground I enclose a copy
of my construction specialistts report.

You will appreciate that this was prepared solely for internal use in
HSE and it is sent on the understanding that you will consider it as an

If I can be of any further assistance in this matter please let me know.

Yours sincerely

    COLIAPSE OF FOOTBALL PITCH PERI~ETER WALL

    i      The subject wall was 3 feet high and was built in 9" x 9" x 18" hollow
    concrete blocks. The hollows were not filled and the mortar joints were 1/2"
    thick.

    2     The length of the section of wall which collapsed was 130 feet, the
    failure occurring at either the second or third bedding joint.

    3    Guidance is published by the Home Office/Scottish Home and Health Depart-
    ment in the form of a booklet entitled ’Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds’. It
    is a voluntary Code and has no legal force.

        3.1 The recommendations at Clause 7.10 regarding pitch perimeter
        fence/~ll are that if spectators can lean on the wall it should be
        deemed a crush barrier.

        3.2 The strength requirements for crush barriers are that they
        should be designed and tested to safely resist a force of 400 Ibsf/ft
        v~dth.

4    -~T.~eex~s~ino
              ~ ~" ~ perimeter wall at Walsall F.C. cannot theoretically withstand
the recommended design loading. The type of construction is unsuitable for use
as a crush barrier.

        4.1 At the time it was built it is unlikely tb~t it was required
        to act as a crush barrier.

5     It is ~nderstood that     the Club have high hooes of    ~ ~"
                                                              pro.,o~lon   to the Second
Division next season. This      promotion may well attract additional     spectators
~nd put the Sports Stadium      into the category covered by the Safety of Soorts
Grounds Act 1975 when the       ground will need a Safety Certifi ~ .
                                                                    c~ ~e
6     The arrangements for spectators and the requirements ~ ~,
                                                             ~o~ the crush barriers
and the pitch perimeter fence will then have to be reconsidered.

7     Under these circ~usts_uces it may pay the Club to postpone any rebuilding of
the pitch perimeter fence/wall until the result of the promotion race is kno~,m.
In the ~ ~’-
       ..... an~ime however, and certainly for home matches coming up ohor~ly, I
would recor:zend that the wall debris is cleared up and the pa~-t of the lower
terrace in, mediately behind this length of collapsed }~II barricaded off.’

8      I will be pleased to assist further, if required.

 safety .chief
  _ The wall collapse which marred Walsall’s Milk
  Cup semi final clash against Liverpool acted as a’
  "safety" valve" and sa#ed supporters from being!
 crush~l to death,.a safety chief said.today. -
    The incident at the Laundr~
  End of the Fellows Park grouncl
  helped prevent a disaster, he
  added.
    Mr Geoffrey Lyndon -- area
 director for the Health and
 Safety’Executive in Birming-
 ham .-- was speaking after the
 completion of a detailed probe
 into the incident, which marrec
 the game.
    Twenty four fans were
 injured when the wall gave way
       sending hundreds of
 spectators in the crowd cas-
 cading onto the pitch.
    Today Mr Lyndon said that a
 dossier on the incident had
 shown that the wall had been
 constructed, properly to deal
 with the club’s nol:mal crowd
 sizes.
    The crowd at the Liverpool
 match was a 19,600 sell-out~
            Release
    "The arguable point is had it
  been more substantial and not
 ra ven way, what would have
     ppened to "the spectators
  crushed against it?" he said.
    Mr Lyndon addedt hat it had
  acted as¯ an "explosion release".
  and said. t~    --
              It caused       . o
                        relatively
 minor injuries, but at least
 hundreds of people were able to
 spill over.
. "If they had just been pushed
 against the wall, some of them
 could have been flattened like
 flies."
    Mr Lyndon ~dd that officials
 from the Safety Executive
 would visit the Walsall ground
 tomorrow to meet club
 represenatatives and West-
 Midlands County CoUncil
 safety chiefs to discuss
 arrangements for the club’s
 next game which looks set to
 attract a big attendance.-- the
~d      otion battle against
         United on April 7.
   Earlier this month, the
Safety Executive .cleared the
football club of responsibilty for
     incident and ruled that
t~ were not to be prosecuted
over the !ncident on Feb ~rtml7

At 9,40 am P~iday 17 Feb,-,~z’y 1984, I received a telephone call from
Mr Bird, an Inspector with the Health and Safety Executive, McLa~en House,
Birmingham, (O21 236 5O8O). Mr Bird told me that he had been asked by
hle Area D~eter, Mr lqndon, to establish contact with the Police foll~
the collapse of the wall at the Railway End of Fellows Park on the occasion
of the ~ lee Milk Cup Semi-Final Tie with Liverpool on Tuesday 14 February
1984.

At present the involvement of the Health and Safety Executive is due to
the provisions of Sections 3 & 4 of the Health and Safety at Work Etc. Act
19741 which, in effectt deal with the duty of the football club to those
people who enter their premises but who are not the clubs employees or
contractors. Under these provisions Mr Bird has visited ~ellows Park twiaee
On Wednesday 15 February 1984, he viewed the damage and on the following
day he sp:~e to the Club Chairman, Mr K Whelden.
As Mr Bird points out the issues in this matter are t~o-fold :-

(a)In the short-term, the question of repairing the damase and the
       availability of that section of the ground for the next home
       game on Tuesday 21 Fetn-ua~ 19~ v Northampton ~bwn F,C. in the
      ’Associates CUpt KeO,7,~K) 1~,

(b)     In the longer term, the distinct possibility that galsall FeC,
        may be promoted to the Second Division next season, This would
        mean that the average anticipated home gate would be over 10,000
        spectators and the ground would thus be ’desisted’ under the .................................
        Safety of Sports (h’ounds Act 1975.

As to (a) above Mr Bird intended to visit Fellows Park at IO.~:K) am Monday
20 February 1984 to discuss the short-te1~ position at the Railway E~le He
felt that the Police may wish to be represented at this meeting.
As to (b) the Specialist Inspector under the Safety of Sports Ground Act was
al               lintended to visit Fellows Park at 10 am Tuesday
28 February 1984 and again it was suggested that we might wish to be represented,

I told Mr Bird that we would wish to be represented at both meetings.

I submit this report for information and for a decision as to which Senior
Officers should attend. You may feel that Divisional or Sub-Divisional
representatives should be supplemented by someone from Uniform Operations
Department.

SUBJECT: DOG BITE 1~.02.84

I have to report with reference to the above.

On Tuesday 1~ February 1~, I was on duty with Police dog Rebelt on the
occasion of the Walsall v Liverpool Football Match, Fellows Park, Walsall.

At 9.~O pm same date I was on van patrol in the main Fleck Shopping area,
at the Junction of Oxford Street and Wednesbury Road, Walsall, together
with WPC
                         J
 There were large gangs of unruly Walsall supporters running about in
 Wednesbury Road and traffic was at a stand still. I overheard on my radio
 that a number of stabbings had taken place in the vicinity of Hillary Street.

 Due to the volume of traffic I realised that it would be impossible to
 drive to the scene of these incidents, so together with WPC            I we took
 our dogs from the van and started to make our way towards where I saw other
 Police Officers.

 I walked round the corner of Oxford Street and on reaching the front of the
 Hope and Anchor Public House, a large group of unruly Walsall supporters came
 round the corner towards me. One of these supporters shouted something,
 which seemed to be directed at my dog, he then came close in towards my dog,
 my doe reacted, jumped up and bit him on his left arm, but came straight off.
 This man did not seem aware that the doE had bitten him, and started to walk
 away. I saw that he appeared to be told by other people that the dog had
 bitten him.

 He came back towards me and was very abusive, although I apologised for the
 incident, he continued shouting and again came towards my dog. I found it
 necessary to push this person away from the dog. I asked him for his name
 and address, but he refused to give it. He then walked away with others into
 Oxford Street.

 This incident was of a minor nature. The dog did not appear to have bitten
 this man very hard only catching hold of his coat sleeve.
 This incident was of a minor nature until escalated by the man concerned
 having been egged on by his friends.

 At all times the dog was on a short lead and under my control.
 I respectfully request that this report be forwarded to Chief Inspector Haywood,
 Central Kennels, Harborne.

 From the collator at Liverpool

 The two below named are known to be attending the Walsall v Liverpool
 match tonight (14.2.84)
 They are both well known criminals in Liverpool having form for Robbery
 burglary and assault number I features number 5 on the Metropolitan Police
 football match pick pockets. NumberJ~- is considered extre~y voilet and is
 known to carry a 6" gravity knife.

 When ever Liverpool play away they always hire a vehicle paying for it with
 the proceeds of crime. The vehicle which they have hired this time is
 a red Vauxhall NovaI          If the vehicle is seen it is worth a check
 but the occupants should be treated with the utmost caution.

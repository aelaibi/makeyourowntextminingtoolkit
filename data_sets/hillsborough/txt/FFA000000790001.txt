Dear Sir,

Re;     Local Plans/Safety certificate

Thank you for your letter dated 18th August 1988, amendments to our local
plans for the caning season are as follows:

1) The capacity in the North Stand (ie. members stand) is reduced by 180 to
9,702 places. This is to accommodate a new disabled facility here at the
ground. This in turn makes total capacity of the ground 54,101.

2)    A copy of the admission prices for the current season are enclosed.

3) This year our membership scheme has been altered slightly in that guest
tickets are available for purchase but these mast be collected and paid for
prior to the day of the match.
                                                                4

4)     The restaurant licence is new in the name of our new catering Manager,


I confirm that we are still not in the possession of a full Safety certificate
from the Local Authority but I understand from them that it is in am advanced
stage of drafting and I will, of course, forward you a copy as soon as it has
been received.

Yours faithfully,

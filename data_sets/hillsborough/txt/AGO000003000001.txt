Dear Mr Parkinson

R v Duckenfield and Murray


We thank you for your fax received earlier today. We do think Winckworth’s letter of 6th
December needs a response. Accordingly, we enclose copy letter which has just been faxed to
Mr George Croston our contact at the CPS. Its relevance to the application for a nolle is
obvious.

The question whether counts 4 and 5 should be tried should be left to the trial judge. He will
consider all the enclosed material at a submission by the defence in the week of 20th
December, and may hear live evidence.

Yours sincerely




Ann Adlington
Solicitor

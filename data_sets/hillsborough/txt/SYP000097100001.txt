WERE THE POLICE ACTING AS OCCUPIERS OF THE STADIUM WITHIN

THE   MEANING OF THE OCCUPIERS/ LIABILITY ACT 1957 ON 15TH

APRIL 1989?



Police Comments:



1.     The Police were visitors not occupiers because



          (i)    They        were     not responsible for dangers due

                  to     the        state of the premises or to things

                  done         or         omitted       to        be        done    on     the

                  premises.                The Police were concerned with

                  people not premises.



         (ii)    They        entered        the premises in the exercise

                  of the right conferred by Section 15 Police

                  Act         1964        to     provide               special          Police

                  services.



        (iii)    They        did     not       control       the        state           of the

                  premises           or     things      done           or     not done on

                  them.



2.     The      Club     were        the       occupier responsible for the

       dangers         due     to     the      state        of        the premises and

       things          done     or        omitted      to        be     done       on     them

        including



        (a)      No     suitable exit system or means of                                escape

                  (see Issue 32).
(b)     No      mechanical        or    structural            system     for

            counting or control of numbers in pens                      (see

            Issues 8 and 10).



(c)     No          mechanical     or     structural           system     to

            control access from turnstiles to pens                      (see

            Issue 25).



(d)     Insufficient             number         of      turnstiles        at

            Leppings Lane End (see Issues 14 and 15).



(e)     No comprehensive system of signposting (see

            Issue 44).



(f)     Bad          size     spacing     and        layout     of     crush

            barriers        (see Issue 40A).



(g)     Excessive            gradient     of     tunnel        (see Issue

            41) .



If    the     Police        were occupiers then the extent of

their   duty to visitors was much less than that of

the Club.

APRIL     1989



Party making the allegation:



(1)      Plaintiffs and Club against Police

          paragraphs 3 and 10 of the Defence]



(2)      The allegations made by the Plaintiffs are adopted

Club's comments:



Yes.     The police were occupiers for all material activity

purposes.        They initiated the decision to pass some 6,000

extra     spectators       through   the    Leppings Lane end.    They

were     at   turn-stiles      in charge of entry.      They, and not

the     Club, were in control of and responsible the filling

and     monitoring     of terraces and were responsible for the

policy of the crowd finding its own level.              They, and not

the Club were responsible for all or any decisions on the

gates     opening     or    closing and as to any postponement of
the   kick-off.   They,       and not the Club, controlled the

perimeter fence gates.

     take    over control of the event and of all the members of

     the     public   admitted,   the   Police   were   acting   as

Club's comments:



The   Club    had        properly briefed and trained its stewards

and   gatemen       as     to    their responsibilities and were not

negligent.                 As      appears    hereinbelow,     those

responsibilities           did    not include filling of the pens or
the     monitoring        and     controlling      of   the    Leppings Lane

terraces.         On the morning of the Semi-Final the stewards

were     briefed        as to their duties and responsibilities by

Police     Inspectors           (see Taylor Interim Report, paragraph

48) .



As     between     the     Club     and     the   Police,     there   was     an

agreement        and a clear and longstanding practice that the

Police     would monitor and control the crowds entering the

pens     (see    Taylor         Interim Report, paragraph 167 and see

Club's comments on Issue 8 below).



The Club informed the Police of the flow rates that could

be expected through the turnstiles well in advance of the

Semi-Final (see Club's comments on Issue 7 below).



The     Police     briefing       was     inadequate     and in particular

failed     to     set     out any proper system for monitoring the

numbers        in the Pens.       The Police briefing failed to give

the officers who should have been monitoring the pens for

overcrowding        any specific instructions to undertake such

monitoring, strongly emphasising instead the need to keep

the fans from coming onto the perimeter track (see Taylor

Interim Report, paragraphs 58, 182 and 246 to 247).                         This

was     compounded       by      the failure of the Police to adopt a

safe     plan for filling the Pens, leaving the fans instead

to     "find     their     own     level"    (see Taylor Interim Report,

paragraphs 170 to 174).
The     Operational           Order for 1989 substantially reproduced

that     for        1988 and left a lot unsaid (see Taylor Interim

Report,        paragraph        273   to   274).   It failed to make any

arrangements           for closing off the tunnel, as had occurred

in     1988, in the event that Pens 3 and 4 became full.               If

it was the fact that those responsible for the drawing up

of     that     Operational Order were ignorant of the previous

closing        of     the     tunnel, the failure to communicate that

important fact was itself negligent.



It     also     failed to make any or any adequate arrangements

to     control        the     crowds coming to the stadium at a point

some considerable distance from the ground to ensure that

the     area outside the turnstiles at Leppings Lane did not

become        congested        (see Taylor Interim Report, paragraphs

210     to     212).        Further, the Senior Officers in charge of

the     area        outside     the Leppings Lane turnstiles were not

briefed        as     to    the anticipated flow rates through those

turnstiles           even     though the Club had informed the Police

of     their        estimates     well     in advance of the match.   The

Police were negligent in the foregoing respects.
WAS THERE ADEQUATE PLANNING. PREPARATION AND BRIEFING FOR

THE 1989 SEMI-FINAL?



Engineers' Comments:



The Police failed to devise a proper plan for policing of

the     crowd or to ensure that clear arrangements were made

with     the        Club     for control of the numbers entering each

pen.          The     Police     failed      to     ensure     that     the Ground

Commanders           were    properly briefed.           The Police failed to

have     any        proper     system for monitoring numbers entering

the     pens        or for dealing with those wishing to leave the

pens     in     an     emergency,      whether by the tunnel or by the

perimeter           gates.       The   Police        failed     to     work   out a

comprehensive and effective method of policing and failed

to      review,            evaluate    and        heed   the    data     available

concerning           the     numbers attending the 1988 Semi-Final or

to     make     similar        arrangements to those made in 1988 for

closing off the tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4.
WERE THE POLICE AWARE OF THE ESTIMATED FLOW RATES THROUGH

THE TURNSTILES?



Police Comment:



       The Police could have been aware of the flow rates

       estimated    in    the   Green     Guide paragraph 47 as a

       maximum of 750 per hour per turnstile but planning

       of the number of turnstiles and rates of admission

       was   the   duty    of   the     Club    under   Green     Guide

       paragraph     44-47      (ingress       of   spectators)     and

       tickets were issued by the Club accordingly.

Club's comments:



Yes.     Mr    MacKrell   informed      Chief Superintendent Mole

that   the anticipated flow rate was 850 an hour which was

an underestimation for an all ticket match.
7.   WERE THE POLICE AWARE OF THE ESTIMATED FLOW RATES THROUGH

     THE TURNSTILES?



     Engineers' Comments:



     The     Police should have been aware of this since it was a

     factor     which        should have been considered as part of the

     decision        to     close     the Penistone Road Turnstiles.         Such

     awareness        should        also    have     influenced the planning of

     what measures were necessary to control movement into and

     along    Leppings         Lane.            However,   the   decisions of the

     Police both in planning the event and on the day indicate

     either     an        ignorance        of such flow rates or a failure to

     pay any due account to them and to their implications.

              (i)   No such duty of the Police was specified by

                    the Club.



          (ii)      There     was no mechanical or other system of

                    counting or control of numbers in any pen.



         (iii)      No    particular        pen   had    been allocated by

                    ticket to any particular spectator.

                    Responsibility).



2.      Negligence by the Club and Engineer as follows:



              (i)   Failing     to     specify    the     safe capacity of

                    each     pen     and     failing     to    apply   for   an
        amendment        to     the     Safety Certificate (see

        Issue 35 and 36).



 (ii)   Failing     to provide a system of counting or

        control     of        numbers in each pen (see Issue

        21     paragraph        2     and     3    and Issues 35 and

        36) .

(3)    The allegations made by the Plaintiffs     are adopted

Club's comments:



Yes.     There was an agreement between the Police and the

Club   that   the   Police would be responsible for filling,
monitoring             and    controlling the Leppings Lane terraces.

This agreement had been reached in 1982 shortly after the

installation                of the radial fences (at the request of the

Police)          in 1981.        Even if there was no formal agreement,

there       was in any event a clear understanding between the

Police       and the Club and a longstanding practice that the

Police      would fill, monitor and control the Leppings Lane

Terraces          (see Taylor Interim Report, paragraphs 166, 167

and     183)          and    there     is     no practical distinction to be

drawn       in        this    context between a formal agreement and a

clear understanding.                 The Police accepted that the proper

filling          of     the pens and the monitoring for overcrowding

could       not        and would not be carried out by stewards (see

Taylor       Interim          Report,       paragraph 167).    The Police had

accepted          de facto responsibility for control of the Pens

at    the        Leppings       Lane        end   (see Taylor Interim Report,

paragraph 166).

1989?



Engineers' Comments:



The     system          for monitoring numbers entering each pen was

one     of    visual           monitoring           and control by Police and/or

Stewards.               Indeed        the     purpose     of        introducing radial

fences       as        advocated        by     the     Police       was to enable the

Police       to        exercise more active control over the filling

of    the     terrace           and     the     distribution          and movement of

spectators.               The     Police        were     in     de facto control of

monitoring             the situation on the terraces and should have

had some form of adequate system of visual assessment and

warning       to        enable        pens     3 and 4 and the tunnel leading

thereto           to      be      closed        when     they       were   approaching

capacity.



The     positioning of Police and the absence of Stewards in

the     vicinity          of     the        pens,     together       with the overall

Police        control of the Ground, meant that the Police were

in de facto control of the monitoring of the pens.

Club's comments:



No.     On 15th April 1989, the Police, whose responsibility

it     was     to monitor the Leppings Lane Terraces, failed to

monitor        and     control     the Pens.      No Police Officers were

briefed        as    to    their    duty     to   monitor   the     pens   for
overcrowding.                    The Police          Control     Box    provided     the

Officers           in     command        with    a     pre-eminent position from

which to monitor the Pens both by sight and by use of the

C.C.T.V.           screens        situated       in     the    Control Box.        Those

Officers           should       have monitored the terraces (see Taylor

Interim           Report, paragraph 229).                The Commanding Officers

could        see        the    build up of the fans on the terraces and

were regularly provided with the numbers of spectators in

each     section              of the ground by PC Guest who was situated

in     the          Club's control room for this very purpose.                        If

those        in     the        control      box had any difficulty in seeing

what     was        going        on    in pens 3 or 4, the failure to have

present           binoculars          was    a serious operational mistake.

The     Police           failed to observe that the Central Pens were

full by at the latest 2.50 pm (see Taylor Interim Report,

paragraph 63).                  This failure was compounded by the stated

policy of the Police                  on 15th April 1989 to allow the fans

to "find their own level" which effectively left the fans

in the pens to monitor their own comfort and safety so as

to      avoid            overcrowding           (see    Taylor    Interim     Report,

paragraphs              58,     174and 183).         The Police        were negligent

in the foregoing respects.
WERE     PROPER MEASURES TAKEN ON 15TH APRIL 1989 TO MONITOR

AND CONTROL THE NUMBERS ENTERING EACH PEN?



Engineers' Comments:



On     15th     April     1989   there was effectively no system of

monitoring and control of numbers entering each pen.               The

Police        failed to note and observe that by 2.45 pm at the

latest        pens 3 and 4 were for all practical purposes full

or     nearly     so.       In addition, the absence of any Police

with instructions to close the tunnel at its entrance, to

prevent        further     spectators   going   through   the   tunnel

towards        pens     3 and 4 contributed to the difficulties of

monitoring and controlling the numbers in pens 3 and 4.

                capacity     of      each pen, a means of counting

                and   control        of     numbers entering the pen,

                and the allocation of pens to spectators by

                ticket.



        (ii)    Failing     to            heed      that         a     system    of

                information          as to the capacity of each pen

                was   required,           because        the     state     of the

                design      and      structure           of     each     pen    was

                dangerous       by    reason        of        no suitable exit

                system or means of escape (Issue 32), wrong

                size spacing layout and testing of barriers

                (Issue      37,       40A     and        B)     and     excessive

      Club's commentsâ



      Yes,   the Police should have instituted such a system for

      ensuring that the Police Officers in the area between the

      turnstiles        and     the     West    Stand   knew   the    state    and

      condition    of     the Pens and for ensuring that an order to




                                        42
close     the        tunnel        or        the side entrance was swiftly and

effectively put into operation.



The     chain        of command and responsibility was clear.                           The

Police     were        responsible              for        controlling     the     numbers

entering        and        monitoring           the numbers in the Pens on the

Leppings        Lane        terraces.            The Officers in the concourse

behind     the        turnstiles             received           their   orders from the

Ground     Commander in the Police Control Box who possessed

all     the material information to determine whether or not

the     pens were full: the Police Control Box was in a preÂ­

eminent position to view the terraces; the Police Control

Box had video cameras giving clear views of the Pens, the

turnstiles           and     Leppings Lane itself (see Taylor Interim

Report,        paragraph           50);        the        Officers in command should

have received reports from the Officers whose duty it was

to     monitor        the     pens;           and they were regularly provided

with     the        numbers        shown        to        be     in each section of the

ground     by        the     Club's computer by PC Guest.                       The Police

were negligent in the foregoing respects.



The     Club        was not negligent in the respects alleged.                           It

would have been irresponsible of the Club to by-pass that

chain     of        command,        particularly                when    it was unable to

determine           from     its        own control room whether individual

pens     (as        opposed to whole sections - see Taylor Interim

Report, paragraph 48) were approaching capacity and when,

because        of     the     agreement              or        understanding     with   the

Police,        there        were        no     Club employees in a position to

monitor         the         pens        for     overcrowding.             All     relevant
information   that   the   Club   possessed   was passed by PC

Guest to the Officers in the Police Control Box with whom

responsibility for the terraces and the authority to give

all relevant orders lay.

      AND/OR STEWARDS THAT THE PENS WERE APPROACHING CAPACITY?



      Engineers' Comments:



      Yes.      It     was     clearly       important              that   some   means of

      directing       spectators on the Ground should be employed to

      achieve     a    reasonably          even        and     a safe distribution of

      spectators.            This     could        not        be    done   without    some

      monitoring       the     situation          as     it        developed and drawing

      attention       to     the    fact     that certain pens were becoming

      full.

      Police Comments:



      1.         Observation          that pens     3    and        4    were      full     or

                 approaching capacity           depended                   upon         visual

                 impression       which at        the time did not work with

                 anyone in authority.



      2.         Negligence by the           Club and Engineer as follows:



                      (i)   Failing      to    specify        what       was      meant     by

                            "full".



                  (ii)      Failing     to    apply     for        amendment        to     the

                            Safety      Certificate           to        state     the     safe

                            capacity of each pen.



                 (iii)      Failing     to provide a system of counting or

                            control of numbers entering each pen.



                  (iv)      Failing     to    devise and put into effect any

                            mechanical         or       structural              system      to

                            determine whether any pen were full or near

                            capacity.




                                        46
     (v)   Failing            to    devise   what    system should be

           used       to       count    numbers     in any particular

           pen.



 (vi)      Failing to provide for the issue of tickets

           to        spectators          allocated       to     particular

           pens.



By     reason        of       the    negligence     of    the     Club and

Engineer        in        2    above no-one in authority knew or

observed        that          the    pens were full or approaching

capacity until it was too late.

      Club's comments:



      Yes.         The Police should have observed that Pens 3 and 4

      were approaching capacity by 2.45 and were full by 2.50.

      The     Club     were not able to monitor the individual pens.




                                     48
Because of the agreement or understanding reached between

the     Police              and the Club as to the responsibility of the

Police           to        control       and monitor the numbers entering the

Pens        on        the        Leppings      Lane      terrace,     no stewards were

deployed              to monitor the terraces.                The Club Control Room

did     not have cameras fixed on the terraces nor could the

terraces              be     seen       from     that     room.     Further the Club's

computer              did        not show the numbers in each pen.               This is

to     be        contrasted             with     the Police who, for the reasons

already           set        out above, were in the optimum position for

monitoring                 the     terraces       (see     Taylor     Interim    Report,

paragraph              170        and    the     Club's     comments     on     Issue   10

above).           In failing to observe the state and condition of

pens        3     and        4     the Police were negligent.             The Club was

not.

      Engineers' Comments:



      Yes.       It     is     clear        that    the   number of those who had

      already         entered        pens    3     and 4 by 2.45 pm by comparison

      with      other pens was such that unless steps were taken to

      divert          new      arrivals,           pens   3   and   4   would   become

      increasingly            full     and increasingly uncomfortable.            This

      could      and        should have been seen by those monitoring the

      terraces.

      Yes.     Pens 3 and 4 were full by at the latest 2.50 pm and




                                      52
were overfull by 2.52.                 It was for the Police Control Box

to monitor the build up in those Pens (see Taylor Interim

Report,        paragraph           229).        At League matches it was the

Police       practice         to     close      the   tunnel   leading   to the

central pens and direct the fans to the other pens.                        This

practice        was     followed           at   the 1988 Semi-Final when the

tunnel       was closed by Police Officers because the central

pens     were        deemed to be full (see Taylor Interim Report,

paragraph 181).              This should have been done by the Police

at     the     1989     Semi-Final at or before 2.50 pm whether or

not     Gate     C     was     going to be opened (see Taylor Interim

Report, paragraphs 230 and 231).                      The Police were thereby

negligent.           The Club was not.

      Engineers' Comments:



      Yes.       Pens 3 and 4 were for all practical purposes full

      or     nearly    so by 2.45 pm and the tunnel should have been

      closed     off   as it had been in 1988.   Had that been done,

      no     crushing situation at all would have occurred in pens

      3 and 4, whether or not Gate C had been opened.

"find    their         own level" on 15th April 1989 together with

their     failure        properly          to    monitor    the filling of the

Leppings        Lane        terraces combined with the blunder of the

Police     in     opening          Gate     C    without     first    taking   the

elementary        precaution          of        closing    the tunnel to divert

fans     away     from       the     already        full    Central Pens led to

overcrowding           in    those        Pens     and hence the tragedy that

occurred        (see        Taylor Interim Report, paragraphs 265 and

311).       The Police were thereby negligent.                       The Club was

not.

      Engineers' Comments:



      Yes.            Pens        3 and 4 were already full before Gate C was

      opened.               The    fact   that      no    or   no   proper   system of

      monitoring             existed,     so     that     senior    Police   were   not

      alerted          to     the fact that there was no spare capacity in

      pens        3    and 4, together with the absence of any policing

      or stewarding system for diverting spectators from pens 3

      and 4 at the entrance to the tunnel, meant that when Gate

      C was opened it was inevitable that spectators would head

      in large numbers through the tunnel directly towards pens

      3     and       4, with the equally inevitable result that pens 3

      and     4       became       excessively full and a crushing situation

      and the disaster followed.

Club's comments:



Yes.     The     turnstiles        should have been able to, and in
some     cases     did, allow spectators into the ground at the

rate     of     1000   per turnstile per hour.            Anticipation and

management        of   the    crowd     outside    the     ground   was the

responsibility of the Police.              The Police lost control of

the     crowd     outside     the     Leppings    Lane turnstiles which

caused        severe   congestion       outside    the     turnstiles    and

eventually         led to the        decision     to    open Gate   C.   The

reason forany reduced efficiency in the operation of the

turnstiles         was the very density of and pressure             created

by     the     crowd   that    the     Police had allowed to build up

outside          the   turnstiles (see         Taylor     Interim   Report,

paragraphs         196 and 199).         The     Police    were     thereby

negligent.        The Club was not.

      Engineers' Comments:



      As     designed           and constructed, the turnstiles at Leppings

      Lane     and        Penistone           Road    were     adequate     to     cater for

      spectators           at        the     Leppings       Lane End and North Stand.

      However,        the arrangements made on the day, including the

      closure        of        twelve        turnstiles at Penistone Road and the

      diversion           of        all north stand spectators to the Leppings

      Lane     turnstiles,                 meant     that    there   were       not adequate

      turnstiles               to     deal     effectively       with     the     number   of

      spectators expected, and this proved to be the case.

Police Comments:



1.     The     Police       correctly     proposed       that     to prevent

        crowd disorder the Leppings Lane turnstiles should

        be     used to fill the North Stand.               The Club agreed

        and        issued tickets accordingly.            10 turnstiles at

        Penistone Road North were closed not 12.

Club's comments:



The   Police         required     the    ends        of     the     stadium        to be

allocated       so     that     the Liverpool supporters would enter

the   ground         through     the    Leppings          Lane turnstiles (see

Taylor        Interim         Report,         paragraph          35).       This    was

reluctantly           accepted         (see        Taylor         Interim     Report,

paragraph       21).      The choice of the ends by the Police in
this   way   was   not causative of the disaster (see Taylor

          Engineers' Comments:



          A     decision     was        taken by the Police and/or the Club (in

          which     the     Engineers were not involved and of which they

          were     not informed prior to the disaster) to close the 12

          turnstiles        in        Penistone     Road which normally served the

          North     Stand        so     diverting     6,000   spectators from those

          turnstiles        to the Leppings Lane end.           The effect of this

          was     that     there were 23 turnstiles to accommodate 24,000

          spectators which was inadequate.

Police Comments:



1.    Police     planning               and operation measures      were

       reasonable         and        not negligent and similar to 1988

       when they had worked well.



2.    Measures       to    check        the     advance   of the crowd   at

       places on the approach to the ground



         (i)   Had        not         been     required    on    previous

               occasions.



        (ii)   Would not have worked against the                 behaviour

               of the large numbers of late arrivals.



       (iii)   Would       have caused the risk of crushing and

               injury           at     the    point   where the crowd was

               held        up and the risk of trampling when the

               crowd was allowed to move on.



3.    Negligence by the Club as                follows:



         (i)   Failing to heed the provisions of                 the Green

               Guide paragraphs 44 and 2 9 ( v ) ( c )          as above.

      Club's comments:



      No.         The        Police     lost control of the crowd outside the

      ground       in the vicinity of the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

      The    Police          knew      that     the Club estimated the flow rate

      through the turnstiles at 850 an hour (an underestimation

      for    an all ticket match).                   Police Control were regularly

      informed          of     the     numbers       in individual sections of the

      ground        by        PC     Guest     (although     they   failed   to   tell

      Superintendent               Marshall        of the numbers still expected -

      see    Taylor           Interim Report, paragraph 221).            The cameras

      in    the     Police           Control       Box   had good views of the area




                                              69
outside    the   turnstiles       and   Leppings     Lane itself (see

Taylor    Interim    Report,      paragraph   50).      The build up

should    have   been     anticipated by the Police (see Taylor

Interim    Report,      paragraphs 224 and 225) and should have

been avoided by competent policing as in 1988 (see Taylor

Interim Report, paragraphs 215 and 271).             The Police were

thereby negligent.        The Club was not.

16.   WERE PROPER MEASURES TAKEN TO PREVENT THE BUILD-UP AT THE

      Engineers' Comments:



      The      Police          failed             to     appreciate        that   the     numbers

      requiring        to use the turnstiles would mean that it would

      require          careful          policing           of     Leppings Lane and              its

      approaches         to ensure            that        flow         rates      through        the

      turnstiles         were               not        slowed     down      by the   press        of

      spectators.             A        system           of controls along Leppings Lane

      should have been considered and provided for.                                  Monitoring

      of    the         situation                 was     required     together         with     the

      realisation        of        the        fact        that    by   2     pm   8,000        fewer

      spectators         were          in the Ground than at a similar time in

      the   previous           year and that the majority of those yet to

      arrive      were        expected             at     the     Leppings Lane End.             The

      Police      and/or          the        Club        should   have been aware of and

      warned relevant authorities that,                           if as few as a third of

      the    total capacity of the north and west stands and west

      terrace      arrived             in     Leppings Lane within a period of 15

      minutes, policing arrangements were inadequate to control

      the    crowd       and       that           a dangerous crushing situation was

      likely      to     or       might           develop.        Thereafter, the Police

      failed to take necessary measures to control the approach

      of    the    crowd          to        the        turnstiles from Leppings Lane if

      necessary by using cordons or other means.

      Engineers' Comments:



      The    developing         situation        at the turnstiles should have

      been     noted,     reported        on     and     reacted to much earlier,

      whether     by means of postponing the kick-off, controlling

      access     to     Leppings     Lane        some        distance    away from the

      turnstiles,        some     combination           of     these    or   some other

      method.         Instead,      the        build-up        at the turnstiles was

      allowed     to reach such a dangerous state that the opening

      of Gate C became inevitable.

      a     delay        (see     Taylor Interim Report, paragraphs 62, 227

      should        have been apparent that the number of those still

      remaining        to     enter     at       the Leppings Lane end were more

      than     could        safely     or    properly      be accommodated by the

      Leppings        Lane        turnstiles       in   time for kick-off at 3.00

      pm.      It should have also been appreciated that a failure

      to     announce        postponement          of the kick-off would lead to

      renewed        pressure        from    those      in the crowd to reach the

      turnstiles and further potential crushing and danger.

      Yes.     Using all of the information available to them the

      Police     should      have     anticipated           that    there would be a

      large    number       of     fans        arising in the 3 0 minutes before

      the     scheduled      time     for        kick-off     and    taken action to

      ensure      that       the      crowd        were     properly   managed   and

      controlled      (see        Taylor Interim Report, paragraph 224).

      The failure of the Police to take steps was negligent.

      BEEN TAKEN EARLIER THAN 2.52 PM?



      Engineers' Comments:



      The    Engineers repeat the matters set out above.        By 2.15

      pm or by 2.45 pm at the latest,        it should have been clear

      that     action    was   needed   to relieve crushing.   The fact

      that the only means of doing so was the opening of Gate C

      was or should have been apparent by 2.47 pm at the latest

      and should have been acted on.         The fact that the opening

      of Gate C was necessary demonstrates that the build-up at

      the turnstiles had been allowed to get out of control.

      Club's comments:



      The     failure       of    the Police to properly manage the crowd

      outside        the    Leppings     Lane      turnstiles   led   to   severe

      congestion           in that area and to the need to open Gate C.

      It was the opening of Gate C without taking the necessary

      precautions to avoid an influx into Pens 3 and 4 that was

      the cause of the death of the deceased.

      DECEASED?



      Engineers' Comments:



      Yes.     The build-up at the turnstiles, which was caused by

      the     decision        to close Penistone Road turnstiles and the

      failure        to     consider     or     implement       proper        control    of

      spectators           approaching        the     turnstiles,       and    which was

      exacerbated             by   the    failure        to     deal    promptly        and

      effectively          with    the build-up, was the prime reason why

      it     became       necessary      to     open     Gate    C     to     relieve the

      pressure.           The opening of Gate C was the direct cause of

      the disaster, although the disaster could still have been

      avoided had proper measures been taken at the same time.

      HAVE     BEEN     TAKEN    BEFORE      OR AT THE SAME TIME AS OPENING

      GATE C?



      Police Comments:



      1.        At the time, the lack of precautions by the Police

                was not negligent because:



                  (i)    No-one      in     authority        (Police;          Club;    St

                          John's      Ambulance;        F.A.        Officials;         T.V.

                          Commentators;            SYMAS           Officials)           had

                          recognised        the    overcrowding in pens 3 and

                          4.



                 (ii)    The     total     number     of tickets sold did not

                          exceed     the total certified capacity so the

                          overcrowding was not expected.



                (iii)    The     capacity     of     pens      3    and    4     was not

                          certified.



                 (iv)    There     was no system of counting or control

                          of    numbers entering pens 3 and 4 so except

                          for      visual         impression         which      was     not

                          effective         no-one     was         given     notice      of

                          overcrowding.




                                      84
  (v)   Apart     from       visual impression there was no

        system     to        indicate    that      the    pens   were

        full.



Negligence by the Club and Engineer as follows:



  (i)   Failing    to cause an amendment to the Safety

        Certificate to certify the safe capacity of

        the pens.



 (ii)   Failing    to provide a system of counting and

        control        of    admissions to the pen contrary

        to the Green Guide paragraph 12 (assessment

        of      safe        spectator    capacity)        101    (self

        contained entrance exits and facilities for

        each      section),          221-225       (assessment      of

        terrace capacity).



(iii)   Failing        to    provide a comprehensive system

        of     signposting contrary to the Green Guide

        paragraph 57 (comprehensive signposting).



 (iv)   Failing    to        provide     a    system      to control

        access     to pens from turnstiles contrary to

        the     Green        Guide   paragraph 44 (turnstiles

        dispersal             of     spectators)         101     (self

        contained            sections)       206   (self-contained

        sections).
Had     the   above        precautions           been        taken then the

significance of the influx into pens 3 and 4 would

have been apparent.



Negligence by the Club as follows:



  (i)    Failing       to make plans              for coping with the

          exceptionally            large        number        of spectators

          arriving         at     the     ground        contrary          to the

          Green Guide paragraph 2 9 ( v ) (c ).



 (ii)    Failing       to its           officials            in the control

          room      including             the     Chief        of    Security

          Douglas      John        Lock     and by its stewards to

          heed     the effect of the influx through Gate

          C upon pens           3 and 4.



(iii)    Failing       to carry            out    the basic duties of

          stewards         under        Green     Guide paragraph 195

          (controlling            or    directing            members of the

                by the Engineers.




      Club's comments:



      Yes.     The Police should have ensured that access            to Pens

      3 and 4 was prevented by closing the tunnel (if necessary

      with     the    metal    barriers     in   the   vicinity   which were

      available) and stationing officers to direct the incoming

      fans to the side pens.          The exercise was a simple one and




                                     87
had     been carried out in 1988.                        It was the failure of the

Police           to take this elementary step that was the blunder

which        caused           the    disaster.          The failure of the Police

properly           to        prepare for the influx of fans at Gate C is

to     be contrasted with the precautions taken prior to the

opening            of         Gate    A    (on    the      instructions     of     Chief

Superintendent                 Duckenfield):            see Taylor Interim Report,

paragraphs              229     to    232.     There were no precautions that

the Club could take to stop an influx of fans into pens 3

and     4        after the opening of Gate C because they were not

told        by     the        Police of the decision that the Police had

made        to     open        the    Gate       (see    Taylor   Interim        Report,

paragraphs              67     and    229).       The failure by the Police to

take        this        elementary        step     was      characterised        by Lord

Justice Taylor as "a blunder of the first magnitude".                                 It

was the most serious and potent act or omission committed

by the Police that day.

      Engineers' Comments:



      Yes.       The tunnel at the entrance of pens 3 and 4 should

      have been closed off using the gates which exist for that

      purpose.        Further     and    alternatively,    Police Officers

      and/or     Stewards     should     have   been   posted   across   the

      entrance to the tunnel to direct spectators away from the

      tunnel as had been done in 1988.

Police Comments.



1.       The    opening            of    Gate    C   was   shown   on the CCTV

          screens in the Club control room where it was seen

          by    the      Club's Chief of Security Douglas Lock who

         was       in         radio        communication    with    the   Club's

          stewards.



2.       The    Club's stewards inside Gate C saw that it was

          opened.



3.       The    appropriate precautions against the emergency

         which should have been taken were in the design of

          the    layout of the structure, certification of the

          capacity           of     each     pen,    and   the   provision of a

          system        of        counting      and control of numbers going

          into each pen.                These were the responsibilities of

          the Club and the Engineer.



4.        Any mistakes by the Police made under the pressure

          of    the emergency by failing to warn anybody, were

          not negligent.

                    structure        to        provide      separate     turnstile

                    access to separate pens.



            (ii)   Failing       to cause the Safety Certificate to

                   be      amended        to     specify       the   capacity    of

                    separate pens.

                    structural        system for counting and control

                    of numbers going into particular pens.



            (iv)   Failing       to provide proper signposting (see

                    Issue 44).

      Club's comments:



      Yes.         It     was the       failure     of   the Police to take any

      effective          steps (or,     indeed,    any steps at all) to ensure

      that     the        fans did      not   enter the terraces through the

      tunnel       that     was the cause of the dangerous overcrowding

      and    hence        the injuries and         deaths in Pens 3 and 4 (see

      Engineers' Comments:



      Yes.         The opening of Gate C was the immediate and direct

      decision          to    close    pens       3   and    4, directly caused the

                by the Engineers.




      Club's comments:



      Yes.       The Police Control were in a pre-eminent position

      to     monitor          the   terraces     in    accordance     with    their

      responsibility;           they   knew     of    the   numbers    of    people

      outside the turnstiles waiting to get in; they alone knew

      of     the decision to open Gate C; they knew or should have

      known that the majority of the fans entering through Gate

      C     would have gone down the tunnel into pens 3 and 4; and

      they     could     or     should have seen the spectators in those

      pens     showing        and   signalling        distress in the immediate




                                       98
aftermath     of the opening of the Gate (see Taylor Interim

Report, paragraphs 229 and 244).



In     addition   there were Police Officers stationed on the

perimeter     track    and   in   the West Stand overlooking the

Pens who should have been monitoring for overcrowding.



Notwithstanding       all of the above the Police reaction was

sluggish: the overcrowding was not recognised and, in the

initial     stages no senior officer took effective charge.

This     resulted in the loss of valuable time.        (See Taylor

Interim     Report,   paragraphs     82   and   244 - 251).   These

failures were negligent.

Engineers' Comments:



Yes.      The      Police   in the Control Box and on the ground

should have observed, reported and acted upon the evident

crushing,       distress    and    suffering   of    spectators.   The

match     should     have   been    stopped,   the   perimeter gates

opened     and the spectators in pens 3 and 4 evacuated from

the     rear through the tunnel and the gates at the rear of

the radial fences.

                sections).          These breaches were important

                because      of    the     dangerous       state     of   the

                ground      and lack of control systems set out

Club's comments:



No.       The pens were created at the request of the Police

to     enable    them     to     ensure      that     the   fans were evenly

distributed       on     the     terrace (see Taylor Interim Report,

paragraph        125).         It   was      always     recognised   by   all

concerned       that     there      would        necessarily   be freedom of

movement between the pens.
If (which is denied) separate turnstiles should have been

installed          for safety reasons, the Club reasonably relied

on the Engineers to advise it if any work was required in

the     interests         of    safety.     The Club were not advised at

any     time       that    the layout of the turnstiles in Leppings

Lane was unsafe.               Schemes for the revision of the layout

of    the      turnstiles       were under consideration in 1985 but

these       were     being proposed to enhance the segregation of

opposing supporters at that end of the ground and not for

safety       reasons.          The proposals were not pursued because

of    the large amount of work that had to be undertaken to

improve        the    safety      of     the ground after the Popplewell

Report into the Bradford Fire (see Taylor Interim Report,

paragraph 130).

The     Club     agreed     to    the    removal   of barrier 144.     The

suggestion        to remove it came from the Police (see Taylor

Interim        Report,     paragraph      133) and was approved by the

Local         Authority     and    by    the   Engineers.        The   Club

reasonably        relied     on    the    advice   and expertise of the

Engineers as to          whether or not to agree to         the removal of

the barrier (see Taylor Interim Report, paragraph 293).

WHO    WAS        RESPONSIBLE           FOR THE DECISION TO REMOVE BARRIER

144?



Engineers' Comments:



The    application              to     remove    Barrier 144 was made by the

Police       at     the     Working         Party        Annual Inspection on 7th

August 1986, without prior warning to the Engineers.                            The

Police      wanted the barrier to be removed before the first

home     match       of     the        season    on       25th   August 1986.   The

Engineers' representative made various suggestions as set

out    in     paragraph              8(e)   of   the      Amended Defence of the

Engineers.            After discussion the Working Party approved

the    proposal           of the Police that the sections of barrier

should       be     removed           and   the City Council by their Chief

Licensing          Officer           affirmed    the       decision   of   the City

Council       that        the        two sections of Barrier 144 should be

removed.            Such        a     decision      is     one that only the City

Council can make.

Police Comments;



       Yes.



2.     Negligence by the Club and Engineer as follows:



         (i)   Failing to heed that the removal of barrier

               144     left        a gap of more than 1.4 metres in

               breach      of       the    Green     Guide paragraph 115

               (1.1 metres).



        (ii)   Failing to heed that the removal of barrier

               144 exposed barrier 124A                  to diagonal crowd

               pressure from a tunnel entrance.



       (iii)   Failing     to heed that altogether 4 out of 5

               of    the      gaps between barriers in pen 3 did

               not      conform           with     Paragraph      115    Green

               Guide.



        (iv)   Failing to heed that the combination of the

               removal        of     barrier 144 and excessive gaps

               between          barriers         would    cause   excessive

               pressure            upon    other     barriers      including

               124A.



         (v)   Failing        to     heed    and     specify      that    the

               maximum        capacity       of pen 3 in the light of
                    the   size      and     spacing    of    barriers       and

                    removal      of       barrier     144, should      be   no

                    greater   than        822   instead     of   any    other

                    number or not specified at all.

Club's comments:



The Club were not negligent in agreeing to the removal of

barrier        144.       The    Club        retained   an   expert   (the

Engineers)     to advise them on such matters and reasonably

relied     on the opinion of that expert as to whether it was

safe to    remove        the    barrier.        If the advice given was

misguided       and if    the    absence       of barrier 144 caused or
contributed   to   any   deaths in Pen 3, the responsibility

lies with those who suggested and approved its removal.

The Engineers did not and do not consider the decision of

the   Working       Party to be unreasonable.   To have left the

two sections of the barrier in the face of the experience

of    and   risks     of   safety identified by the Police would

have been irresponsible.        The risk which occurred on 15th

April 1989 was wholly unforeseeable.

      the     disaster         and        the    death      of     the     deceased was the

      opening        of    Gate       C     at     a    time     when pens 3 and 4 were

      already        full and without measures to close the tunnel to

Club's comments:



The gates in the perimeter fence were marginally narrower

than    the    minimum width advised by the Green Guide.         The

width     of the gates was consistent with and reflected the

desire of the Police "to have gates sufficient for police

access and small scale emergencies" but not a "flood gate

of     such    size   as   to   endanger    the   prime principle of

preventing      pitch invasion".      (See Taylor Interim Report,

paragraph 263).        The width was considered and approved by
the     Local Authority and by the Engineers on whose advice

the     Club     reasonably           relied.          Without prejudice to the

foregoing        the     perimeter          gates      were not, nor were they

ever     intended        to     be,     part      of     an   exit   system or to

facilitate        free        movement       of     those at the front of the

pens.          The exit system was to the rear and to the sides

(see Taylor Interim Report, paragraph 258).

      Engineers' Comments:



      The     Green     Guide        (1976     Edition)     did not recommend the

      minimum width of perimeter gates.



      The     gates     in    pens      3    and   4 were not part of the exit

      system for the departure of spectators at the end of play

      and,    without them, pens 3 and 4 satisfied the evacuation

      times     required        by    the      Green   Guide.    The width of the

      perimeter        gates had been considered by the Working Party

      including        the      Police       and   Fire     Service    on   various

      occasions        prior to        1985.       The recommendations of        the

      Green Guide (1986 Edition) were considered by the Working

      Party      who         reasonably         concluded     that    the   existing

      perimeter        gates had in practice proved satisfactory                 for

      their purpose and did not require to be widened.

      Club's comments:



      No.      The     gates         in   the perimeter fence were manned                by

      Police     Officers.            Deploying stewards as well to man the

      perimeter            gates    would       have    been    unnecessary        and    a

      division        of     responsibility            between police officers and

      stewards        for     the manning of those gates would have been

      foreseeably dangerous.                 Further,     it would have interfered

      with     viewing        from     the      terraces       (see    Taylor     Interim

      Report,        paragraph        170)      thereby     creating      a     potential

      source of crowd disorder.

Club's comments:



No.          Even        if     the    width         of gates 3 and 4 had been as

advised        in        the Green Guide, they would have been wholly

inadequate           to       relieve         pressure       and release spectators

swiftly        on        15th     April 1989 (see Taylor Interim Report,

paragraph           264).        In any event, wider or more gates would

not have made any difference when those gates were manned

by police officers who were forbidden to allow spectators

access        to     the         track without           the    consent of a senior

officer,           who        failed     to     recognise the overcrowding for

some     considerable                 time and who, even after the crushing

had     begun, shut the gates when they were forced open and

pushed        fans        back        into     the    pens     (see   Taylor Interim

Report, paragraphs 71, 72 and 246 to 249).



In     any     event          paragraph         209    of the Green Guide places

primary emphasis on perimeter gates being used for police

to     gain access              to the terraces but invites "the striking

of     a balance".Such a balance was reasonably struck [in

accordance           with the wishes of the police] with the gates

in     pens        3 and 4.           To have provided sufficient perimeter

gates to deal with the emergency that occurred would have
meant   gates   throughout most if not all of the perimeter

fence   and that would have fallen markedly the wrong side

of the balance.

      DECEASED?



      Engineers' Comments:



      No.       It    would     have made no difference.         The perimeter

      gates     were         neither    designed    nor    intended     for   the

      evacuation of large numbers in a short time and a gate of

      1.1     metres would have served the need which arose in the

      crisis     no    better     or    not significantly better than the

      existing gates.

      Yes.     See Taylor Interim Report, paragraph 258.            The Club

      adequate means of escape from the terraces.              The means of

      escape     was     approved   by    the   Working     Party   and,   in

      particular, the Fire Brigade.

The     perimeter     gates   were not part of the exit system.

Without     them     pens 3 and 4 satisfied the evacuation time

required     by     the Green Guide.   The Working Party and the

Fire Service were satisfied with the evacuation plans and

pens 3 and 4.

      TO THE DISASTER AND THE DEATH OF THE DECEASED



      Club's comments:



      Whilst     the        perimeter       fence       prevented        escape the real

      cause     of     the       disaster       was     overcrowding        (see       Taylor

      Interim        Report,       paragraph          311).       No     reasonable exit

      system     could have been capable of dealing with the crush

      which was created by more than 2,000 people being allowed

      to   enter the pens in one sudden rush.                          The Police failed

      to      recognise           the     crushing        and     organise        a    speedy

      evacuation           of    the    Pens     from     the     rear.     Matters were

      compounded           by    the    fact     that,        for some time after the

      crisis         had        developed,       the     police        officers       on   the

      perimeter        track       were forcing the gates shut against the

      crowd     and        pushing people back into the pens                 (see Taylor

      Interim Report, paragraphs 71, 72 and 74).

DID THE NATURE OF THE MEANS OF ESCAPE CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE

Engineers' Comments:



No.      The means of escape satisfied the evacuation times

required          by        the     Green        Guide.         The only shortcomings

relating          to        the means of escape on 15th April 1989 were

that     the           Police        failed        at     any     time   prior    to   the

occurrence             of     the disaster to implement any measures to

evacuate          pens        3     and     4.          Pressure continued from the

tunnel       at        the        rear     of     the     pens.     The tunnel was the

proper       means           of     escape        and     no    steps    were    taken to

evacuate          from        the rear of the pens or from the gates in

the radial fences.                   The narrowness of the perimeter gates

did    not        materially              affect the issue, and in any event,

for some minutes after the disaster had begun, the Police

who    were        on        duty at the perimeter gates remained under

instruction not to allow the gates to be opened or anyone

to leave the pens through them.

Yes.         The Club relied on the Engineers to calculate and

advise       as     to    the safe capacity for each section of the

ground.            The notional figures provided by the engineers

for capacity in Pens 3 and 4 were 1,200 and 1,000.                   It is

accepted          that,    with      hindsight, the notional capacities

for pens 3 and 4 provided by the Engineers were too high,

as     was    the        certified     capacity   for   the   terrace as a

whole.        Even if this was a negligent failure on the part

of     the Engineers it was not negligent on the part of the

Club.

The    certification               of capacity was the responsibility of

the    City      Council as Licensing Authority.                The Engineers

had    pointed         out        that the removal of barriers should in

theory     lead        to     a    reduction     in    certified capacity as

calculated        by        the Green Guide.          It was a matter for the

City     Council to decide what,               if any, reduction to make.

The decision not to do so was not unreasonable.

                    (barriers        below     height)           namely     that the

                    unspecified number.



             (iv)   Failing to heed that there was no system of

                    counting      or    control        of        numbers     in    the

Engineers' Comments:



No.     The    certified          capacity      was          irrelevant     to what

happened on 15th April 1989 because:-



(1)     the problem which occurred was not one of capacity

       but     distributing.             No system for monitoring and

        controlling         the     numbers entering each pen was in

        operation on 15th April 1989;



(2)     the     opening of Gate C meant that there was no way

        of     limiting       the    number        on     the      terrace to the

        certified       figure,       without           closing the tunnel or

       the pens, whatever the certified figure might have

       been ;



(3)     the    Health       & Safety Executive's best estimate of

        the     total number who entered through the Leppings

        Lane     turnstiles and Gate C was 9,734.                        It has not

        been     alleged       (and     in any event would be denied)

        that     the    total       number        of     spectators        actually

        admitted       to     the     terrace          was excessive.        At the

        time    when Gate C was opened, there was ample room

        remaining in pens 1, 2, 6 and 7 for the spectators

        awaiting entry to be safely admitted.

      1.      No.



      2.     Negligence by the Engineer as follows:



               (i)   Failing to carry out the test in accordance

                     with Green Guide annex C.



              (ii)   Wrongly    measuring each deflection from the

                     measured from the first starting place then

                     the     barrier         124A   ought     to    have   been

                     retested        Under      Green       Guide     annex   C

                     paragraph 5.



              (iv)   Failing    to     keep    a    record of deformation

                     during the loading period contrary to Green

                     Guide annex C 4 .



               (v)   Taking measurements at mid-span of the rail

                     where     the     most recovery occurs instead of

                     at the centre supports where least recovery

(vii)   Failing        to heed that the method of testing

        in 1988 disguised and failed to measure the

        deformation of the supports.



(viii) Failing         to     heed   that       the   layout of the

        barriers        in     pen 3 did not comply with the

        Green Guide paragraphs 113-117 or columns A

    37.   WERE THE CRUSH BARRIERS IN PEN 3 PROPERLY TESTED?



          Engineers' Comments:



          The     barriers        in        pen     3    were      properly     tested    by the

          Engineers        in July 1988 and in accordance with annex C to

          the     Green     Guide           1986 Edition.             The sections of Barrier

          124A     which     collapsed on 15th April 1989 passed the test

          load.          Further,           if     it     is alleged that the Engineers'

          interpretation               of        annex     C    was     incorrect,     then     the

          Engineers'         will            say        that    their     interpretation        was

          reasonable        and        coincided           with that of (amongst others)

          the     Structural           Engineer of the City Council to whom the

          test     results        were           sent;     if    it     be contended that the

          section which had a 59% recovery at its first application

          of     load,     74% recovery on second application and 100% on

          third     application              should have been re-tested thereupon,

          on     a re-test it would have shown a 100% recovery on each

          application.             Further,              barrier       124A   was    capable     of

          withstanding            and        did        withstand       the   design     load    as

Â«         contemplated by the Green Guide 1986 Edition.

Engineers' Comments:



Probably     at   some     time   after   3.00   pm.   It certainly

occurred     after   the     influx from Gate C which so greatly

increased     the pressure in the pen to an extent which was

the lay-out of the terrace.

      1.     Yes.



      2.      Negligence by the Club and Engineer as follows:

            Defendants]



Club's comments:



It is the Club's primary case that the effective cause of

the     collapse            of   barrier 124A     was   the   excessive and

unanticipated               pressure   to    which it was exposed on 15th

April       1989        (see Taylor Interim Report, paragraph 243).

If    and        to     the extent that it is shown that the barrier

was     not       capable        of withstanding the loads suggested by

the     Green Guide, there was negligence               on the part of the

Engineers.
WAS THE COLLAPSE OF BARRIER 124A CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE ON

Engineers' Comments:



No.          Barrier     124A was capable of withstanding, and did

withstand,        the     load   for which it was designed.   It was

properly        tested     in July 1988 in accordance with annex C

to     the     Green     Guide, alternatively in accordance with a

reasonable interpretation of annex C to the Green Guide.

The     cause     of the collapse of two sections on 15th April

1989     was     that     it was subjected to a load substantially

greater        than that which it was designed to be capable of

withstanding.

               existing barriers were carefully considered at

               the time of the approval of the ground by the

               Licensing Authority.   The Licensing Authority

               acted reasonably in not requiring the replacement

               of existing barriers which were below the

               preferred height set out in the Green Guide and

               in not requiring any additional barriers to those

               recommended by Eastwood & Partners and installed

               under their supervision.   Subsequent changes to

               the spacing and layout of barriers were

it      achieved      that     for   no   more   than   3   metres   or

approximately l/7th of its length.

      Engineers' Comments:



      Over   a   three    metre      length   the ramp had a gradient of

      approximately       1    in   6.5.   The average gradient was less

      than   1   in 10.       Where the gradient was greater than 1 in

      10, it was sloping downwards towards the pitch.

              [Amended Third Party Notices]



      Club's Comments:



      No.   The slope was towards the pitch.   This slope would

      tend to enhance safety rather than to impair it.    The

      tunnel was accordingly reasonably safe, but if it was not

      the responsibility lies with the Engineers who should

      have advised the Club or the Working Party that the

      gradient needed to be altered.
SHOULD THE GRADIENT IN THE TUNNEL HAVE BEEN ALTERED?



Engineers' Comments:



No.   The Engineers gave consideration, together with the

Licensing Authority and its Officer Working Party, to the

gradient of the ramp on a number of occasions, but it was

considered very difficult, costly and unnecessary to make

any alterations.

                    tunnel     plus   removal   of barrier 144 would

                    contribute to dangerous forward momentum of

Police Comments:



1.      Yes.



2.      Negligence of the Club and Engineers as follows:



               Failing     to        comply    with   the    Green Guide

               dispersal         of      the      crowd     and   caused

               concentration of spectators in pens 3 and 4

TO THE DEATH OF THE DECEASED?



Party making the allegation:



(1)       Plaintiffs and Police against Club.

         of   the Particulars    of   Negligence of the Second

         Defendants]

         [Amended    Statement   of Claim under paragraph 9(i )

         of   the Particulars    of   Negligence of the Fourth

         Defendants]



Club's comments:



No.    Although     the signs and tickets were admittedly poor

they   were    in no way causative    of any death or injury.

The     injuries and deaths inside the ground were caused by

the     decision     of the Police, without telling anyone, to

allow some 2,000 into the already full central pens in an

uncontrolled rush.
44.   DID    THE TICKETS OR SIGNS AT THE CLUB CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE

      TO THE DEATH OF THE DECEASED?



      Engineers' Comments:



      No     alleged    defect   in the exit and emergency evacuation

      sign     will    have made any difference.       Other signs at the

      Ground     and    Ticketing   were   something     with   which   the

      Engineers were not concerned.

      Police Comments:



               Issues       (a)    and (b) are included to deal with the

               possibility that more liability will attach to the

               Engineer if his inspection and testing of barriers

               were both negligent and causative.

          In view of the way in which the issue is formulated (i.e.

          "in    the light         of the findings of the Court ...") comment

          by     a party           at   this     stage     is   neither    helpful   nor

          possible.

          Engineer's Comments:



          (a)   It is denied     that the collapse of Barrier 124A was

                 caused by negligent inspection and it is further

                 denied that in the circumstances predicated any

                 liability should be apportioned to the Engineer;



          (b)   The Engineer     will make submissions as to the

                proper apportionment of liability if any at the

*                conclusion of the evidence;



          (c)   It is denied     that any liability for the death of

9.    WERE PROPER MEASURES TAKEN ON 15th APRIL 1989 TO

MONITOR AND CONTROL THE NUMBERS ENTERING EACH PEN?



Police Comments:



1.   No.



2.   Negligence of the   Club and Engineer as follows:



      (i)       Failing to heed or apply the Green

               Guide paragraphs 12, 101, 221-225

               (assessment of safe capacity for each

               section of the ground).



     (ii)      Failing to apply for an amendment to the

               Safety Certificate to certify the safe

               capacity of each pen (see Issues 35 and

               36) .



     (iii)      Failing to heed that without a certified

               capacity for each pen no-one knew when

               it was full.



     (iv)       Failing to provide or implement a system

               of counting or control of numbers in

               each pen (because there was no

               certified number to count).

10.   SHOULD A SYSTEM HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED FOR INFORMING

POLICE AND/OR STEWARDS WHEN THE PENS WERE APPROACHING

CAPACITY?



Police Comments:



1.    Yes.



2.    Negligence by the Club and Engineer as   follows:



      (i)       Failing to devise and operate a system

                of information including the certified

                capacity of each pen, a means of

                counting and control of numbers entering

                the pen, and the allocation of pens to

                spectators by ticket.



      (ii)      Failing to heed that a system of

                information as to the capacity of each

                pen was required^ because the state of

                the design and structure of each pen was

                dangerous by reason of no suitable exit

                system or means of escape (Issue 32),

                wrong size spacing layout and testing of

                barriers (Issue 37 40A and B) and

                excessive gradient of tunnel (Issue 41).

11.   SHOULD THE POLICE AND/OR THE CLUB HAVE OBSERVED

THAT PENS 3 AND 4 WERE FULL OR AT LEAST APPROACHING

CAPACITY BY 2.45 p.m. AT THE LATEST?



Police Comments:



1.    Observation that pens 3 and 4 were full or

approaching capacity depended upon visual impression

which at the time did not work with anyone in

authority.



2.    Negligence by the Club and Engineer as follows:



      (i)       Failing to specify what was meant    by

                "full".



      (ii)      Failing to apply for amendment to    the

                Safety Certificate to state the safe

                capacity of each pen.



      (iii)     Failing to    provide a system of counting

                or control of numbers entering each pen.



      (iv)      Failing to    devise and put into effect

                any mechanical or structural system to

                determine whether any pen were full or

                near capacity.



       (v)      Failing to    devise what system should be

                used' to count numbers in any particular



                             -18-
               pen.



     (vi)      Failing to provide for the issue of

               tickets to spectators allocated to

               particular pens.



3.   By reason of the negligence of the Club and

Engineer in 2. above no-one in authority knew or

observed that the pens were full or approaching

capacity until it was too late.
12.   SHOULD ACCESS TO PENS 3 AND 4 HAVE BEEN CLOSED OFF

PRIOR TO OPENING OF GATE C AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER

OR NOT GATE C WAS OPENED?



Police Comments:



1.    Yes.

13.   DID ANY SHORTCOMINGS IN THE SYSTEM OF MONITORING

THE NUMBERS ENTERING THE PENS CONTRIBUTE TO THE

DISASTER AND DEATH OF THE DECEASED?



Police Comments:



1.    Yes the lack of any system of counting or control

of numbers in pens 3 and 4 was caused by the negligence

of the Club and Engineer set out under Issue 11 which

contributed to the deaths of Mr. Chapman and Mr.

Rimmer.

14.   WERE THE TURNSTILES AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END OF

THE GROUND ADEQUATE TO COPE WITH THE NUMBER OF FANS

EXPECTED TO BE ADMITTED ON 15th APRIL 1989?



Police Comments:



1.    Yes if the spectators had arrived at a rate

similar to that in 1988.



2.    The number of turnstiles provided was the

responsbility of the Club and Engineer and the number

of tickets issued per turnstile was the responsibility

of the Club.



3.    Negligence by the Club and Engineer as follows:



      (i)          Failing to provide an adequate number of

                   turnstiles for the number of tickets

                   issued.



      (ii)         Failing to heed and implement the

                   provisions of the Green Guide paragraph

                   29(v)(c)   (Coping with Exceptionally

                   Large Numbers of Spectators Arriving at

                   the Ground).



      (iii)        Failing to heed and implement Green

                   Guide paragraph 44 (sufficient

                   turnstiles whereby no unduly large

               '   crowds are kept waiting for admission).



                              -22-
15.   WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECISION TO CLOSE THE

12 PENINSTONE ROAD TURNSTILES AND TO DIVERT 6,000

SPECTATORS SO THAT THEY HAD TO USE THE LEPPINGS LANE

TURNSTILES?



Police Comments:



1.    The Police correctly proposed that to prevent

crowd disorder the Leppings Lane turnstiles should be

used to fill the North Stand.       The Club agreed and

issued tickets accordingly.       10 turnstiles at

Peninstone Road North were closed not 12.



2.    If the above decision were at fault then

negligence by   the Club as follows:



      (i)       Failing   to heed the provisions of the

                Green Guide paragraph 44 (sufficient

                turnstiles whereby no unduly large

                crowds are kept waiting for admission)

                and 29(v)(c)   (coping with exceptionally

                large numbers of spectators).



      (ii)      Failing to notify the Police that the

                provision of turnstiles was inadequate.




                           -23-
16.   WERE PROPER MEASURES TAKEN TO PREVENT THE BUILD UP

AT THE TURNSTILES?



Police Comments:



1.    Police planning and operation measures were

reasonable and not negligent and similar to 1988 when

they had worked well.



2.    Measures to check the advance of the crowd at

places on the approach to the ground



      (i)      Had not been required    on previous

                occasions.



      (ii)     Would not have worked    against the

                behaviour of the large numbers of late

                   arrivals.



       (iii)   Would have caused the    risk of crushing

                   and injury at the point where the crowd

                   was held up and the risk of trampling

                   when the crowd was allowed to move on.



 3.    Negligence by the Club as follows:



       (i)         Failing to heed the provisions of the

                   Green Guide paragraphs 44 and 29(v)(c)

                   as above.



                               -24-
(ii)   Failing to provide sufficient turnstiles

       (see Issue 14) for the number of tickets

       issued.




                 -25-
17.   WERE PROPER MEASURES TAKEN TO DEAL WITH THE BUILD

UP AT THE TURNSTILES?

reasonable and not negligent.




                         -26-
18.   SHOULD THE KICK-OFF HAVE BEEN POSTPONED?



Police Comments:



1.    No.   The Police decision to proceed was reasonable

and not negligent.



2.    If the kick-off should have been postponed this

should have been done by the Club.




                         -27-
19.   SHOULD STEPS TO RELIEVE PRESSURE AT THE TURNSTILES

HAVE BEEN TAKEN EARLIER THAN 2.50 p.m.?

21.   SHOULD PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID AN INFLUX INTO PENS 3

AND 4 HAVE BEEN TAKEN BEFORE OR AT THE SAME TIME AS

OPENING GATE C?



Police Comments:



1.    At the time, the lack of precautions by the Police

was not negligent because:



      (i)      No-one in authority (Police; Club; St.

               John's Ambulance; F.A. Officials; T.V.

               Commentators; SYMAS Officials) had

               recognised the overcrowding in pens 3

               and 4.



      (ii)    The total number of tickets sold did     not

               exceed the total certified capacity so

               the overcrowding was not expected.



      (iii)   The capacity of pens 3 and 4 was not

               certified.



      (iv)    There was no system of counting or

               control of numbers entering pens 3 and 4

               so except for visual impression which

              was not effective no-one was given

               notice of overcrowding.



      (v)     Apart from visual impression there was

              no system to indicate that the pens were



                        -30-
               full.



2.   Negligence by the Club and Engineer as follows:



     (i)       Failing to cause an amendment to the

               Safety Certificate to certify the safe

               capacity of the pens.



     (ii)      Failing to provide a system of counting

               and control of admissions to the pen

               contrary to the Green Guide paragraph 12

               (assessment of safe spectator capacity)

               101 (self-contained entrances exits and

               facilities for each section), 221-225

               (assessment of terrace capacity).



     (iii)     Failing to provide a comprehensive

               system of signposting contrary to the

               Green Guide paragraph 57 (comprehensive

               signposting) .



     (iv)      Failing to provide a system to control

               access to pens from turnstiles contrary

               to the Green Guide paragraph 44

               (turnstiles dispersal of spectators) 101

               (self-contained sections) 206 (self-

               contained sections).



Had the above precautions been taken then the

significance of the influx into pens 3 and 4 would have



                        -31-
been apparent.



3.   Negligence by the Club as follows:



     (i)         Failing to make plans for coping with

                 the exceptionally large number of

                 spectators arriving at the ground

                 contrary to the Green Guide paragraph

                 2 9 (v)(c).



     (ii)        Failing by its officials in the control

                 room including the Chief of Security

                 Douglas John Lock and by its stewards to

                 heed the effect of the influx through

                 Gate C upon pens 3 and 4.



     (iii)       Failing to carry out the basic duties of

                 stewards under Green Guide paragraph 195

                 (controlling or directing members of the

                 public to help achieve an even flow of

                 people to the viewing areas and safe

                 dispersal of spectators on the terraces)

                 (manning entrances) and Annex B

                 paragraph 2(i)   (prevent overcrowding by

                 ensuring crowd limits in various parts

                 of the ground are complied with).




                           -32-
22.   WERE ALL RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS WARNED OF THE

OPENING OF GATE C SO THAT APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS COULD

HAVE BEEN TAKEN?



Police Comments:



1.    The opening of Gate C was shown on the CCTV

sceens in the Club control room where it was seen by

the Club's Chief of Security Douglas Lock who was in

radio communication with the Club's stewards.



2.    The Club's stewards inside Gate C saw that it was

opened.



3.    The appropriate precautions against the emergency

which should have been taken were in the design of the

layout of the structure, certification of the capacity

of each pen, and the provision of a system of counting

and control of numbers going into each pen.     These were

the responsibilities of the Club and the Engineer.



4.    Any mistakes by the Police made under the pressure

of the emergency by failing to warn anybody, were not

negligent.




                         -33-
23.   DID THE OPENING OF GATE C WITHOUT TAKING

APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO THE

DISASTER AND THE DEATH OF THE DECEASED?



Police Comments:



1.    Negligence by the Club and the Engineer as

follows:



      (i)          Failing     to design the layout of the

                   structure to provide separate turnstile

                   access to separate pens.



      (ii)         Failing    to cause the Safety Certificate

                   to be amended to specify the capacity of

                   separating pens.



      (iii)        Failing    to provide any mechanical or

                   structural system for counting and

                   control of numbers going into particular

                   pe n s .



      (iv)         Failing     to provide proper signposting

                   (see Issue 44).



      (v)          Failing     to heed and implement the

                   provisions of the Green Guide under

                   Issue 21.

23.




                        -35-
25.   SHOULD SEPARATE TURNSTILES HAVE BEEN INSTALLED TO

EACH PEN?



Police Comments:



1.    Yes.



2.    Negligence by the Club and Engineer as follows:



      (i)      Failing to heed and implement the

               provisions of the Green Guide paragraph

               44 (control of dispersal of spectators

               by turnstiles), 101 (self-contained

               sections of the ground), 206 (self-

               contained sections).   These breaches

               were important because of the dangerous

               state of the ground and lack of control

               systems set out under Paragraph 2 in

               Issue 1.

                            -37-
27.   WAS THE REMOVAL OF BARRIER 144 NEGLIGENT?



Police Comments:



1.    Yes.



2.    Negligence by the Club and Engineer as follows:



      (i)       Failing to heed that the removal   of

               barrier 144 left a gap of more than 1.4

               metres in breach of the Green Guide

               paragraph 115 (1.1 metres).



      (ii)      Failing to heed that the removal   of

               barrier 144 exposed barrier 124 a to

               diagonal crowd pressure from a tunnel

               entrance.



      (iii)     Failing to heed that altogether 4 out of

               5 of the gaps between barriers in pen 3

               did not conform with Paragraph 115 Green

               Guid e.



      (iv)      Failing to heed that the combination of

               the removal of barrier 144 and excessive

               gaps between barriers would cause

               excessive pressure upon other barriers

               including 124 a.



      (^)       Failing to heed and specify that the



                         -38-
              maximum capacity of pen 3 in the light

              of the size and spacing of barriers and

              removal of barrier 144, should be 822

              instead of any other number or not

              specified at all.



Note Taylor Report Paragraphs 138 to 142 and 225 to

235.




                       -39-
28.   DID THE REMOVAL OF BARRIER 144 CONTRIBUTE TO THE

DISASTER AND THE DEATH OF THE DECEASED?



Police Comments:



1.    Yes.



2.    The removal of barrier of 144 caused an increase

of the pressure upon barrier 124 a.



3.    The absence of barrier 144 meant that the inrush

of spectators down the tunnel proceeded unchecked into

pen 3 which added to the crush causing the disaster.



4.    Note Taylor Report Paragraphs 233-235 and 243.
29.    WERE THE PERIMETER GATES TOO SMALL?



Police Comments:



1.    Yes.



2.    Negligence by the   Club and Engineer as follows:



      (i)        Failing to heed or implement the

                provisions of Green Guide Paragraph 215

                (minimum width 1.1 metres).



      (ii)       Issuing the annual Safety Certificates.



      (iii)      Failing to heed that in the absence of

                any other means of escape (see Issue 32)

                the perimeter gates were not only too

                small but too few and impossible to use

     (ii)       Without a certified capacity for each

                pen no one knew when it was full.



     (ii)       No system of counting or control of numbers

                in each pen was devised or implemented

                because there was no number to count.



     (i i i )   No attention was paid to the need for

                a system of counting or control.

      (ii)      Wrongly measuring each deflection from

                the last result.



      (iii)       Failing to heed that in the 1988   test

                if the deflections had been properly

               measured from the first starting place

                then the barrier 124a ought to have been

                retested under Green Guide annex C

               paragraph 5.



      (iv)        Failing to keep a record of deformation

               during the loading period contrary to

                Green Guide annex C4.



      (v)      Taking measurements at mid-span of the

               rail where the most recovery occurs

               instead of at the centre supports where

                least recovery occurs.
(vi)     Failing to heed the visible corrosion

         of barriers.



(vii)    Failing to heed that the method    of testing

         in 1988 disguised and failed to measure

         the deformation of the supports.



(viii)   Failing to heed that the layout    of the

         barriers in pen 3 did not comply with

         the Green Guide paragraphs 113-117 or

         columns A or B in table 1 so that the

         test load forces indicated in table 2

         did not apply.

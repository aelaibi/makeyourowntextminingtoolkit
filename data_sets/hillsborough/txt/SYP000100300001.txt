Superintendent                Brougham             advised             Police          Constable             Leake       not       to       use    the

horn    any       more       than    necessary                and          Police       Constable             Leake          responded             to

this.        We    stopped          outside             the       Leppings             Lane       entrance          where          there          were

a    large    number          of    Liverpool                supporters                still       trying          to    enter          the

ground.           I could          see    and       hear          a    P.A.       operating                from    a Police             Land

Rover,       requesting             the       crowd          to       stop    pushing.                 I    spoke       briefly             with

Police       Constable             Treck          and    whilst             doing       so       I was       watching             the

supporters.              I    sensed          a    resentful                attitude             towards          the    presence             of

our    vehicle,          many       of    the       supporters                appeared             t he      worse       for       drink.             It

did    not    appear          that       we       could       be       of    any       further             assistance.

Superintendent                Brougham             asked          Police          Constable                Leake    to       leave.           I

agreed       that      this        was    t he      best          thing       to       do    as    our       presence             seemed

detrimental            to     the    situation.                       We    drove       slowly             forwards          and       turned

left    into       Catchbar          Lane          and       then          travelled             via       Penistone          Road          and

Rutland       Road       to    Firvale,             intending                to    return          to       the    Driving             School.

At    Firvale,         Operations                 Room       began          requesting             t he      attendance                of    Dog

Handlers          at   the     ground.              As       we       entered          Upwell          Street,          Operation

Support       was      implemented.                     We    made          haste       to       Driving          School          where       all

personnel          turned          out.           All    Personnel                Carriers             were       directed             to    the

ground,       with       Police          Sergeant             Lightfoot                escorting             them       with       a    Range

Rover.        The      Motorcycle                 Wing       was       sent       to    Claywheels                Lane.           After       a

short    liaison             with    Chief          Inspector                Wall,          we    also       went       to    Claywheels

Lane.        On    arrival          Police          Constable                Leake          was    instructed                to    act       as

communications                vehicle.              Police             Constable             Somerset             was    deployed

as    Reception          Officer.

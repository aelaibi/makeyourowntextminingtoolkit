I SUDDENLY FOUND THAT THE PRESSURE GAVE WAY AND I LUNGED FOR THE OPEN GATE. I
COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A MAN BESIDE ME WHO WAS DEAD. THE NEXT THING I
REMEMBER I WAS LYING ON THE PITCH WITH A POLICEMAN STANDING OVER ME, AND HE
FETCHED A ST JOHNS AMBULANCEMAN TO ME. I SAT AT THE SIDE OF THE STAND FOR A
LONG TIME TO GET MYSELF SORTED OUT. THEN I SAW A GIRL I KNOW WHO WAS BEING
CRUSHED AND I JUMPED OVER THE ADVERTISING HOARDINGS TO PULL HER OUT. THE
POLICE JUST WOULDN'T HELP ME. THE BOBBIES WERE JUST LINED UPALONG THE CENTRE
OF THE PITCH DOING NOTHING. I HELPED AS MUCH AS I COULD, CARRYING DEAD
BOQjES, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO FIRST AID. I JUST HELPED WHERE I COULD,
CLMRING BODIES. THERE WAS A SENIOR POLICEMAN WITH BLACK BRAID ON HIS HAT
SHOUTING AT THE POLICE TO GET MOVING.
THERE WERE POLICE DOGS GETTING IN THE WAY AS WELL.
I WAS THERE WITH                  I DON'T KNOW HIS ADDRESS OR PHONE NUMBER.

WHEN THE GATE WAS OPENED THE CROWD JUST PUSHED FORWARD TOWARDS THE
TUNNEL,THERE WERE NO SIGNS OR STEWARDS ABOUT TO TELL US WHICH WAY TO GO.THE
FORCE OF THE MASS OF PEOPLE JUST PUSHED PEOPLE FORWARD DOWN THE TUNNEL AND
INTO PENS 3 AND 4. WE JUST COULDNT MOVE. PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING FOR HELP AND
BEING CRUSHED. I MANAGED TOGETHER WITH MY MATE TO MOVE OVER TO OUR LEFT AND
MAN WHO WAS IN THE PEN TO THE LEFT OF PEN 4 MANAGED TO HELP ME AND MY MATE
OVER THE FENCE AND TO SAFETY. I THINK THE TRAGEDY HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE WERE
JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE IN PEN 3 AND 4 AND THERE WERE NO STEWARDS AT THE
ENJIftkNCE TO DIRECT PEOPLE INTO PENS 1 7 fi----------------

 I APPRECIATE THE DECISION TO OPEN THE GATE IT WAS JUST GENERAL PANIC

AGREE THAT TO OPEN THE GATE WAS THE RIGHT DECISION.

                                          LIVERPOOL, TEL UNKNOWN
ONLY TWO POLICE HORSES THERE AT THE TIME. SOMEBODY SHOUTED THAT THE GAME
HAD BEEN DELAYED AND THEN AT ABOUT 2.50 WE GOT INTO THE TERRACES... IT WAS
THE WEST STAND IN LEPPINGS LANE. WE ALL HAD TICKETS. WE DID NOT GO STRAIGHT
THROUGH TO THE GROUND BUT WERE BY THE TUNNEL...WE HEARD A ROAR AND WE MADE
OUR WAY TO THE ENCLOSURES... I CAN NOT REMEMBER WHICH POUND WE WERE IN BUT AS
YOU LOOK ONTO THE GOAL WE WERE TO THE RIGHT OF IT. WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE
MIDDLE OF THE CROWD AND THERE WAS A SUDDEN SURGE AND EVERYBODY WENT FORWARD.
I GOT SCARED AND MADE MY WAY BACK TO THE TUNNEL WITH MY FRIEND          IN
FRONT OF ME WAS A MAN WHO WAS DEAD.. HE WAS COMPLETELY BLUE...THERE WAS BLOOD
ON HIS HEAD. I STRUGGLED TO MAKE MY WAY BACK TO THE REAR TUNNEL AND I SAW
THBaJDEAD MAN BEING DRAGGED BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL BY TWO YOUNG FANS AND THEN
PIJPe D ON THE FLOOR AND THEY ATTEMPTED TO BRING HIM ROUND. THERE WAS TOTAL
CONFUSION AS NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.    I MUST ADMIT SOME OF
THE COPPERS WERE BRILLIANT AND THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD BUT SO WERE
SOME OF THE FANS. A FEW SCUFFLES BROKE OUT BUT I THINK THAT WAS BECAUSE OF
THE PANIC. THE WHOLE SCENE WAS AWFUL.
I DID NOT WITNESS THE GATES BEING OPENED AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE STEWARD
BEHIND THE GATES CARRYING A BUCKET OR SOMETHING. I COULD GO ON FOR AGES ABOUT
WHAT I SAW BUT NOBODY SEEMNS TO UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL

THEY STICK THEM IN SMALLER ENCLOSURES. IF THOSE SIDE FENCES HAD NOT BEEN

INFO       >>  I GOT INTO THE GROUND IN THE RUSH WHEN THE GATES WERE OPENED AND
               WENT THROUGH THE TUNNEL TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE PENS - AS WE
               GOT INTO THE GROUND IT WAS THE ONLY ENTRANCE WE COULD SEE TO THE
               TERRACES. IT WASN'T SO MUCH OF A RUSH AS BEING PUSHED WITH THE
               TIDE OF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN THE TUNNEL. THERE WAS NO WAY WE
               COULD STOP.

OUR COACH WAS DELAYED. WE WERE STOPPED THREE TIMES BY THE POLICE. THE FIRST
TIME WE WERE STOPPED, THE POLICE GAVE US A LITTLE STICKER FOR THE WINDOW, BUT
WE WERE STILL STOPPED AGAIN. WE WERE VERY LATE GETTING TO THE GROUND, AND WE
WERE ABOUT TEN MINUTES WALK FROM THE GROUND. MY FRIEND AND I STOPPED ON THE
WAY FOR CHIPS, SO WE GOT SPLIT OFF FROM THE REST OF OUR COACH CROWD. THERE
WAS JUST A BIG CRUSH FOR THE TURNSTILES, NO ORDERLY QUEUE. THE POLICE HORSES
WERE JUST MAKING THINGS WORSE, RIDING IN AND OUT, MAKING PEOPLE RUSH FORWARDS
AND BACKWARDS OUT OF THEIR WAY, AND THERE WAS NOWHERE TO GO. AT ONE STAGE
THERE WAS A SURGE OF PEOPLE FROM THE RIGHT OF THE GROUND - I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THM|WAS, BUT IT MADE THE CRUSH EVEN WORSE. THE POLICE WEREN'T USING RADIOS,
T H W WERE JUST SHOUTING TO EACH OTHER, AND I COULDN'T HEAR WHAT HE WAS
SAYING, AND I WAS RIGHT WITH HIM.
WE WERE TOLD TO STOP RUSHING AS THE KICKOFF HAD BEEN DELAYED, BUT AS WE
ENTERED THE TUNNEL, THERE WAS NO CHOICE OTHER THAN TO GO FORWARD WITH THE
RUSH OF PEOPLE OR FALL OVER - WE COULDN'T GO BACKWARDS. AS WE GOTTO THE
OTHER END OF THE TUNNEL WE COULD SEE THAT PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER
THE FENCES AT THE FRONT.
BECAUSE WE WERE NEAR THE BACK, WE MANAGED TO CLIMB OVER THE SIDE-SENCE INTO A
NEIGHBOURING PEN, BUT I COULD SEE PEOPLE STANDING ON OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE
TURNING BLUE, AND I COULD SEE THEM DYING.                                X
I THINK THE PEOPLE JUMPING OVER THE TURNSTILES TO GET IN W & R S % f % M 0 TO GET
OUT OF THE CRUSH, NOT TRYING TO GET IN WITHOUT TICKETS. \ \
I THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER STAMPEDE TO GET OU&OF THE GROUND
WHEN I SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, SO I GOT TO THE SIDE.
IT WAS ONLY WHEN A GIRL CAME OVER STREAMING WITH BLOOD THAT THE STEWARDS
OPENED THE SIDE GATE AND I WENT INTO WHERE THE FOREST SUPPORTERS WERE.
THE FOREST SUPPORTERS THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING TO RIOT - THERE WAS NO
ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
THEN THE POLICE RUCHED IN, WHICH MADE THINGS EVEN WORSE BECAUSE THERE WERE
TOO MANY PEOPLE AND NO ROOM.
WE COULD SEE HOW BAD EVERYTHING WAS ON THE PITCH, AND THE FOREST FANS WERE
ABOUT TO TURN ON ME, THEN A LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER CAME OFF THE PITCH COVERED IN
BLOOD, AND THE FOREST FANS TURNED ON HIM, SO MY MATE AND I ESCAPED.
THE CRUSH OUTSIDE WAS BECAUSE THE POLICE HORSES WERE DOING SOD ALL APART FROM
FRIGHTEN®ING PEOPLE, AND THE GATES HAD TO BE OPENED BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH.

I WAS WITH THE SUPPORTERS CLUB, AND MY MATE WAS
I DON'T KNOW HIS ADDRESS OR ANYTHING.
I TRAVELLED WITH THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS HEART OF ENGLAND CLUB.

I GOT SEPARATED FROM MY FRIENDS.
I WENT BACK TO THE TURNSTILES TO LOOK FOR THEM, AND BY THEN THE MASSIVE CROWD
HAD ALL GONE. I WALKED UPTO THE TUNNEL. I'D BEEN TO THAT GROUND BEFORE AND
KNEW THERE WAS ANOTHER GATE ON THE LEFT, SO I WENT THERE AND THERE WAS PLENTY
OF ROOM. WHEN THE MATCH KICKED OFF I COULD SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO CLIMB OUT OF
THE PENS, AND I WATCHED EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED. I HAD BEEN SPLIT UP FROM MY
FRIENDS, AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WERE INVOLVED OR NOT, SO I RUSHED ROUND
TRYING TO FIND THEM. I SAW THE POLICE PULLING A BOY OUT, AND THEY WERE
PUSHING ON HIS CHEST AND GIVING HIM MOUTH TO MOUTH. HE STARTED MOVING, AND I
HAD TO MOVE AWAY THEN. I SAW ONE OF MY FRIENDS AND WE SET ABOUT FINDING THE
OTHERS. IT TURNED OUT THAT FOUR OR FIVE OF OUR PARTY WERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
o ^ B t ALL.

I WAS WITH:
                                        LIVERPOOL.

             2.20. WE QUEUED FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE GETTING IN THROUGH
             THE SIDE GATE AND INTO THE CENTRAL PEN. THE PLAYERS WERE ON THE

             BARRIER AND HAD CRUSH INJURIES TO MY STOMACH. I MANAGED TO GET
             OUT OVER THE SIDE RAILINGS INTO AN ALLEYWAY BETWEEN THE TWO
             ENCLOSURES.

I WAS LAID OUT ON THE PITCH TO RECOVER. I WAS THERE FOR ABOUT FORTY MINUTES,
BUT I HAD NO IDEA OF THE EXTENT OF THE DISASTER - I COULDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
GOING ON. IT WAS ABOUT QUARTER TO FOUR WHEN I WAS RECOVERED ENOUGH TO MOVE. I
WAS DIRECTED TO GO TO HOSPITAL, BUT I FELT I HAD TO FIND MY FRIEND AND
REASSURE HIM. I EVENTUALLY FOUND HIM AT ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK AT THE EM: iRGENCY
CONTROL CENTRE. WE HAD BOTH REPORTED EACH OTHER MISSING. WE WENT HOME

I jLAVE ALREADY SENT A BRIEF REPORT OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHIEF CONSTABLE OF
S ^ F I E L D , AND I HAVE RETAINED A COPY.

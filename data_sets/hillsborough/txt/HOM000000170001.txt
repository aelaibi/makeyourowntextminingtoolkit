                                           S T A T E M E N T



     I,    MALCOLM       BAIN ofJ
                  will say as follows


     I     was    born       on the 16th July 1945.              I am employed as          a       bill
     poster by a company based in Leeds.


     I     have    been a steward with Sheffield Wednesday Football                                Club
     for     at    least the last twelve years and all my time                           has       been
     spent in the West Stand.                 For this season I have been a gateman
     at C gate.


     Before       the     start      of    each season an annual              meeting         of    the
     stewards       is held at the club and representatives from the Fire
     Brigade        and        Police       attend    to        give    talks     on      emergency
     procedures.              They        also    show     us     how    to     use     the         fire
     extinguishers.                Emphasis      is   also placed on the               gates       being
     manned       at all times and that only police and officials can                                 be •
     allowed       through.           Reference       is also made to the code                 to     be
     announced          on    the     public      broadcast        system       to     announce       an
     emergency evacuation.


     This        season there have been a couple of evacuation                           practices.
     A     practice          was    held about three league              matches        before       the
     semi-final arranged for the 15th April.


     I     now turn to my involvement in the events that took place                                   on
     15th April 1989 at Hillsborough.

\\
      I    arrived at the ground at 11.15 a.m. I had been working                                   that
     morning        but~had spoken to Stuart Thorpe at the previous                                match
      to     say that I would be a little late.                        He understood as I            was
     working        and said there was no problem as we both knew that the
      other       two men would be at the ground in plenty of time to take
      up     their posts.           The other two gatemen that day were
                                                  -   2   -




                                        Three gatemen are allocated to C gate.


On     my arrival at the ground, I went up to the snack bar at the
rear      or      top       of the West Sta n d 'and collected                 my      stewards
jacket        from       Stuart Thorpe.           I went down onto C gate              and       the
other two were already there.                         The gate was unlocked.


The gates are always unlocked before any of the gatemen arrive.
We     all said to each other that it was very quiet.                               About     1.40
p.m.     we     were commenting to the police that the build                            up       was
very small.              We were outside C gate talking to the police.


The     police had a barrier by C gate which was at the back of                                    C
gate     and at 90 degrees to C gate.                         There were two women police
officers        and        three policemen outside the gate.                    An     Inspector
attended from time to time.


Behind        the turnstiles there were about a dozen police officers
including two women police officers.


There     were           about      four or five more police officers more than
would      be    deployed for              a league match.             I remember that I         did
 not     recognise any of the police officers as they were not                                   the
 normal        faces       that     the stewards see at                football      matches       at
 Hillsborough.              .There       were also police outside the                 turnstiles
 although I have no idea as to the numbers.


 We     kept     the       gate open about 18 inches.                   This saves      us       from
 constantly              opening        and shutting the gate.            Two stood         outside
 the     gate        and     one        behind.        By     about    2.15   p.m.,     we       were
 suffering           a     lot     of     hassle from supporters              trying    to       gain
 access        through C gate without tickets.                        Some of the supporters
 were     trying           to give us money and at one point I                       fetched      the
 Inspector           who was inside C gate to have a word with one or two
 of     the     supporters              who were abusive.             This Inspector        is    the
 Ground        Inspector                for the Leppings Lane end.             He has abeard.
 I do not know his                 name but he is a regular face.
He   told me to shut the gate and not to open it accept for                                    the
police.             I also asked if Police horses could be used to                            keep
supporters           away from the gate but he said that it could not be
done.           I    cannot remember whether I closed the gate                         as      the
three     gatemen take it in turn to do this.                      It rathers          depends
upon     who is closest to the gate at the time when the                            decision
is made to open or shut it.                    The gate was fully closed.


At     about 2.45 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. I noticed that the                             supporters
were     starting          to     climb over the turnstile huts.                   All      three
gatemen     did          not know what was happening outside                    although        we
were     aware        that a large crowd was gathering.                    We    could        hear
banging     against             the gate from the outside.               It is     impossible
to open the gate from the outside.


I    should         mention that        just      before 2        p.m.     eight       or      nine
Liverpool           stewards           arrived. ■ By    that time          it    was        still
reasonably quiet.                     They were wearing steward's jackets.                      One
remained        with us and the others went elsewhere.                          However/ more
 stewards       turned          up showing photo passes and I told them                        that
 no more stewards would be admitted.


At      about       2.45     p.m.      to 2.50 p.m. I remember             saying        to     the
 police     that         I could not understand where all                  the     supporters
 were     coming           from.      Iremember seeing        a    woman        crying        and
 shouting           as      she       attempted to     gain       access     through            the
 turnstiles.               There was          a terrible crush in          front    of        those
 turnstiles           although I was unable to gain a good view.                         I could
 hear screaming and shouting.


 More     and        more supporters tried to climb over the roof of                            the
 trunstiles.             Many supporters came over and told us to opent the
 gates.


 The      Police ejected some of the supporters who had climbed over
 the      roof ofthe turnstiles                and did not have tickets, or                   where
 supporters           attempted         to    get through turnstiles and                 did     not
 have     tickets.              The    gate    was opened     by     the        gatemen        about
fifteen          to twenty times to eject supporters in this way.                      The
gate       was     opened about three fee to do this.              These     ejections
took       place        over    a    period of 20-30 minutes.          It. is     common
practice          for     Police          Officers to eject supporters      through      C
gate.          However,        if     the Police encounter       any   problems        (for
example          violence)          the     offending supporter is     taken     to    the
Police room in the North stand.                              “


At      this time there were a large number of people milling about
behind         us.       Many were quite abusive and were shouting at                   the
Police and the stewards.


I       then     heard an order to open the gates.               I do not       know    who
gave the order.                All three gatemen including myself stood for a
second         upon hearing the order not knowing what to do. At least
I       was    not sure what I should do but the Police were in control
and almost instantaneously two Police Officers opened the gate.
We        moved away to ensure that we were not caught in the path of
those          about      to    come through.        The fans at the head         of    the
queue          fell      forward but then regained their feet and                 carried .
 on.       Most of the          supporters headed towards the tunnel.


 I      remember that the gate was opened very soon after a roar                          in
 the crowd as the game was already underway.                       I believe this may
 have         been      when    Peter Beardsley hit the crossbar.               The    gate
 remained             fully     open for some three to four minutes              and    was
 then fully closed.


 I      cannot        remember        who closed the gate.       Nor can    I     remember
 whether an order was given by the police to close the gate.


 We       were       then      told to open the gate by a police            officer      but
    only       about three feet.             Police outside C gate were marshalling
    supporters          'through and checking their ticket.            We also checked
    the tickets as they came through.


    I     remember that a young lad came out and said that his stomach
    was       on fire and that people were being crushed on the terrace.
                                              -   5   -




Someone          else    called out that somebody was dead.                     The        police
officers          beind the turnstiles disappeared.                    After that it            was
chaos.           I find it difficult to remember what happened.                            A     lot
of       people     were standing by the partition wall                       holding          their

chests.


I       remember        seeing    a    police officer giving             mouth       to        mouth
resuscitation             right outside the C gate.                  Ambulance men arrived
and        one    tried to put a pipe into his mouth.                     I    remember          the
ambulanceman             saying       that it was too late, the man                  had       gone.
The        police       officer       took off his tunic and put               it _over          his

face.


A        number        of people were brought out sometimes on                       stretchers
and        laid     down in the lane outside C gate.                    The    deputy          chief
steward,          Albert Marsh, told me that 'those people laid out were

dead.


 I       moved      from C gate to B gate and directed some                      firemen          who
 came        through       B gate.      I pointed them in the direction of                        the
 central          tunnel.       ’ Sometime    later I was told that               there          were

 thirteen dead.


    I    also     remember       taking off my             jacket.       Stewards including
    myself       had     suffered       a   great         deal   of    abuse    by     Liverpool
    supporters          milling about in the area behind the turnstyles and
    the jackets provided an easy form of identification.


    I    said     to a fellow steward, someone I know by his first                               name
    only,               - that I would have to go home.                 I was upset by what
    X had seen.          I left at about 3.45 p.ml/4.00 p.m.


    At     last   year's semi-final I was positioned in the seated                                area
    or     West Stand.          I have seen the tunnel closed on two or                          three
     occasions,         but only in relation to League games and also                             when
     the    West stand including the terrace was divided between                                  home
     and     away       fans.    There are wooden doors to this tunnel and                             on
     those       occasions I saw Police Officers shut the doors and stand
in     front    directing fans elsewhere.


When the West stand was divided between home and away fans, the
home     fans obtained entry to the ground through turnstiles 9-16
for     the     seated      area and the North West pen.        The    away    fans
gained entry through turnstiles A-G and they were allocated the
remainder        of the terrace and       a part of the seated area.            The
Police,        at least initially, kept the centre pens open but                not
the     South    West pen.        A barrier was put across the South           West
pen,     sometimes       both were opened for away fans depending              upon
the     size of the crowd.          These occasions I have described           when_
the     tunnel was closed, occurred before the partition wall                   was
built.


For     this     season and the last two seasons the West              stand    has
been for away fans only.             For League''games, the Police keep the
North West pen empty and the gate to the partition wall is shut
but     unlocked.        Usually a steward is deployed on the gate.              The
Police        also    put    up barriers near the snack        bar    to     prevent
access        to the South West pen.         I have not seen Police Officers
shut the doors to the central tunnel, but I have seen Police in
front of this tunnel and have also heard them say to supporters
that     the     pens       were full and they have     then    directed       those
supporters to the South West pen.


The      main        difference    between    this   years     and    last     years
 semi-final          is that at this year's semi-final there was still a
 large     crowd of people still trying to gain entry at about 2.55
 p.m.


 This statement is true to the best of'•my knowledge and belief.
